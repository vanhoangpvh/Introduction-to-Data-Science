Inazuma Eleven: Saikyou Gundan Ogre Shuurai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9032/Inazuma_Eleven__Saikyou_Gundan_Ogre_Shuurai,"['Inazuma Eleven the Movie is the most satisfying and exciting tie-in piece of media ever made.Having come out at a point where the franchise hadn\'t overly reused the plot of ""people from the future want to destroy soccer so they have to stop them"", it takes that concept and refines the raw passion that the early part of the series instilled onto the viewer and made it even more potent by making most of the movie a recap. The idea of more than half the movie being events the viewer has probably already seen is exactly what makes it so great: fans will be reminded...of what moments shaped Endou and the team\'s beliefs about what soccer is, building up to what is originally the defining moment of that journey being the match against Zeus academy but switching them out with the even more fearsome foes from the future.Raimon\'s match against Ogre perfectly embodies the appeal of Inazuma Eleven: the flashy moves, the bonds the characters have formed by going through thick and thin together, the breath-taking moments where they turn things around no matter how hopeless it seems. Ogre academy itself couldn\'t have been a better foil to Endou and his friends because of their misguided idea of strength and what is necessary to achieve peace. This match takes the character defining moment that was supposed to be in its place and adapts it into a series defining moment by upping the scales and ending with the most intense climax the anime as a whole ever had.To cap it all off, the credits roll and along with it is a series of photographs of every team and individuals they had met along their 130 episode long journey. Whether it be allies or even foes: they\'re all shown along the main character, smiling, laughing, and being glad that they got to enjoy a nice game of soccer together. For the viewer, now having spent an hour and a half engraving Endou\'s iconic catchphrase and the feelings and history behind it into their hearts, seeing this credit sequence couldn\'t be any more satisfying. of what moments shaped Endou and the team\'s beliefs about what soccer is, building up to what is originally the defining moment of that journey being the match against Zeus academy but switching them out with the even more fearsome foes from the future.Raimon\'s match against Ogre perfectly embodies the appeal of Inazuma Eleven: the flashy moves, the bonds the characters have formed by going through thick and thin together, the breath-taking moments where they turn things around no matter how hopeless it seems.

Endou Mamoru Revives the Soccer Club, and many scenes of the first season... Admiral Hibiki and Several others recruit the Ogres to facing Raimon.Art (10): This is the best... I liking the Style of the movie and the Hissatsu Wazzas looking very Awesome... I Liked the introduction of the members from the future.Sound (9): A nice Job with the music is notable. But Many Tracks are remixed or Changed with some new music. And the Voices fits with the characters. And addition. T-Pistonz+KMC Songs are Cool and Great.Characters (8): Other of the...Weakest parts, The lot of characters are the same, The Ogres (In Majority are too Ugly...), But Kanon and Baddap Looks very nice.Enjoyment (8): I Liked the movie and I enjoyed it... But the Story is too Repetitive and the Hisatssu are Great.Overall (8): Inazuma Eleven Movie Saikyou Gundan Ogre Shuurai.

Altough I must say that I really enjoyed the serie. The part of the movie that I hadn't seen yet also wasn't very original. It's just that the team is attacked by evil persons, not very original, but I still liked it.Art 7/10The art is almost the same as in the serie, I've seen better, but it's all right.Sound 7/10The sound was good, I don't really have...anything to say about it. The only thing is that the sound fits well with the situations.Character 8/10I already liked the characters because of the series. They are sometimes really pessimistic and sometimes really optimistic and cheerfull.Enjoyment 8/10Even when the movie wasn't that new, I still enjoyed watching it. The part that was new, was pretty good, and it brought back the smile that I had on my face while watching the serie.Overall 7/10I liked the movie, it was funny and it looked good.

Atashin'chi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3006/Atashinchi,"['Which anime series bring back your childhood memories?Crayon Shin-chan, Doraemon and Atashinchi always make me think back to my childhood. When I was a little kid I loved those and even though I\'m not the youngest anymore (I was born in 1997), I still love them and always enjoy watching them. Since they were also available with Chinese dub (all three were pretty popular in China), even as a little boy, I could understand everything, but after more than 15 years it is twice as much fun watching the whole series again. Childhood is something beautiful that everyone likes to remember. Enjoy this precious...time!Now let\'s take a closer look at this masterpiece:STORY:There is no real plot here, the anime shows the everyday life of our little Tachibana family. We experience their everyday life, what they do, what they eat, who they have fun with, etc. An “interesting” family where everyone is a little bit different.Every now and then we get to see a different setting, so we see the family in medieval style, but also when they are in the future. No matter what period, they still remain themselves.CHARACTER:The characters are those what makes this anime special. Everyone is unique in their own way and has different interests and friends.Let\'s start briefly with the ""heart"" of the family: the mother. She\'s the best bargain hunter and knows the best way to save money. She takes care of the whole household and has fun with her friends, who are similar to her. Together with Ms. Mizushima and Ms. Toyama they form the perfect housewife trio and can overcome all hurdles.Her husband, on the other hand, is a classic working man. He gets up early in the morning for work and in the evening having a nice beer/sake. Without alcohol, the life wouldn’t be that great (well…I agree with him in this point). He doesn\'t talk much, but together with his wife they both harmonize perfectly. He\'s someone who likes to take matters into his own hands. His biggest hobby is by far Pachinko, nothing makes him happier.With a daughter and a son, they have a perfect family. The older sister Mikan is a typical high school girl, she enjoys spending time with her friends, falls in love and hates it when she is embarrassed by her mother. But she is a very kind girl and does not ask for impossible things that would be financially not makeable for the family.Her younger brother is a smart guy who recognizes the different situations and can act on them. He understands very quickly what the thing is about. He likes to fool around with his friends and have fun together. Yuzukiho also enjoys playing video games and is very interested in technical devices.In addition to these four main characters, we also get to know the friends of our family members. They are very different, but all are nice people and have their hearts in the right place.STYLE:It is THE Atashinchi art style, there is no doubt. Of course, the animations are a bit outdated compared to the modern anime, but that\'s exactly what makes it perfect. You feel very comfortable watching it and, even if there are parts that are not perfectly animated, you have a lot of fun. The old style differs significantly compared to the newer version.SOUND:""Konnichiha arigatou sayonara mata aimashou"". For me it was more like: ""Hello. 你 好吗. 郑重 再见. 期待 再 相逢"" since I watched it in Chinese. But no matter what language you watch, you love the OP. It brings you in a happy mood already. If you hear the first note of the OP, you know: THIS IS FROM ATASHINCHI. This song will always stay in your head.The first ED ""Kite Kite Atashin\'chi"" on the other hand brings the after-work atmosphere home. You know the day is over and you can look forward to your warm home and your family. Wholesome music and lyrics.ENJOYMENT:I always enjoy watching this series. As mentioned earlier, I strongly associate them with my childhood. All the beautiful, but also sad moments are brought back my memory. I think many of you will agree with me on that point. It is something we will never forget. This series is a part of it. Thanks, Atashinchi!In conclusion I can only quote the very first sentence from the OP (translated): ""Hello, thank you, goodbye, let\'s meet again!"". time!Now let\'s take a closer look at this masterpiece:STORY:There is no real plot here, the anime shows the everyday life of our little Tachibana family.

Alps no Shoujo Heidi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2225/Alps_no_Shoujo_Heidi,"[""Beautiful, a serie that everyone most see, with an amazing story that will capture your full attention.Certainly is a classic anime with a few years old, but I must say that's not so important as you may think, I'm pretty sure that there are lots of new series who want to have an audience of as many generation (children and adults) as this has.Absolutely recommended for people of every age. "", ""Heidi, Girl of the Alps (Alps no Shoujo Heidi) is an absolutely lovely anime adaptation of the 1880 Swiss novel written by Johanna Spyri. The novel has gotten other numerous adaptations beside the anime series, which should indicate how much the original novel has touched the hearts of its readers. Some adaptations surely have been much more grim and gut-wrenching than the rest with its happy moments but none might ever be held as high as this particular adaptation that for many is a taste of nostalgia from their their childhood. Many who have seen it might still imagine the people of Switzerland herding their...goats while happily dancing on the high mountains of the Alps just like the character representing Japan in another series called Hetalia. In fact a lot of people from Japan wanted to visit Switzerland when the series had started airing, indicating even more of its impact on the viewers.Back when I was young the only place I ever heard or saw of Heidi's story was from my grandmother, who I watched the live action adaptation(s) with, although I remember them having more sadness and melancholy than in the anime version, which I don't actually have a lot of memories of. Only when I was much older did I finally watch a bit of the anime adaptation as I recognized the familiar name from my childhood and skipped almost or, well basically everything as I was still a bit impatient a few years back. And finally this week I finally started watching it and finished all 52 episodes while knowing very well how the story would be.The story of Heidi, Girl of the Alps is quite simple without big plot twists or any real big changes to the setting, which the characters reside in as the show wants you to feel like you're truly living in the beauty of the mountains along with Heidi. The beauty of the setting is also enhanced by the background art, which makes it feel like mimicking the real beauty that is the country of Switzerland from the towns, the lakes, the trees to the mountains. The characters are not as detailed or as clean as the background but they sure do stand out from it and the animators were able to put more detail into the movements when needed accompanied beautifully by the sound design, which sadly does sometimes use the same happy tracks that are very noticeable but you'll get pretty used to it as it doesn't really spoil a scene. There are also quiet moments when it's supposed to be serious or eerie in the scene.The biggest factor to enjoying Heidi, the Girl of the Alps is its characters, which the story, art and sound are there for. All of it exists to enhance how the characters feel. Normally this is all expressed in the novel as text, so those who can't get themselves to imagine the scenes from text get to see it in art with the sound of the fir trees greeting Heidi as her face lights up with joy accompanied by her laughing as she turns around to chase the goats back into the top of the mountain where the sun smiles and turns the cliffs into a blanket of yellow and red. A scene so beautiful that you can truly feel what is going on in Heidi's head as she runs back into the hut to enjoy a piece of bread and cheese with the grandfather that smiles so kindly upon seeing the young girl enjoying her dinner after a long day on the top of the mountain. This is what makes the show so great, understanding the characters, their feelings, sorrows, happiness, everything.And despite this show being old enough to be re-adapted by anyone many many times, I think no other adaptation could ever redo what this version did for so many people. There doesn't really even have to be an adaptation or even a continuation to expand the their world as much as I would want there to be. The story of a girl that lives on the Alps is something that was there and can't be really redone. It's a gem with small cracks but one of a kind that cannot be replicated or replaced despite its small imperfections. A gem that can be enjoyed by anyone despite their culture or origins. goats while happily dancing on the high mountains of the Alps just like the character representing Japan in another series called Hetalia.

You will cry both tears of sadness and tears of joy. You will fall in love with Heidi (but in a weird way - she is a little girl), and you will fall in love with the Swiss Alps. This anime may be old, and it may be targeted towards children. However, that doesn\'t change the fact that it is a perfect series, and one of the most beautiful series ever told. Also, I ship Heidi and Peter. They\'d make a cute couple....Although, I don\'t think either of them are old enough to think of boys/girls romantically yet. Then again, if my math checks out, at the end of the series Heidi is at least ten and Peter at least sixteen. (They were five and eleven at the beginning.)One more thing. Heidi is the original moe character. Some otaku might say that moe began in the late nineties or early two thousands. To which I say, ""No, moe began in the seventies maybe earlier.""

To which I say, ""No, moe began in the seventies maybe earlier.""', 'Heidi came out in 1974 created by an all-star staff: Directed by Takahata Isao (Tales of Princess Kaguya), Layout by Miyazaki (Spirited Away), Storyboard by Tomino (MSG), Music Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, and Background Art Mukuo Takamura (Gauch the Cellist). Basically, this was high on my list, if only to give a glimpse at.Based on the 1880 book ""Heidi,"" the story is ""for children and those who love children."" It focuses on a little girl named Heidi growing up with her Grossvater Ohi in the Alm Mountains for three years before her selfish Tante Dete takes her to live with a rich family in Frankfurt, Germany....The characters are fairly one-dimensional as well as the story itself, which is alright for what the anime is. Watching the first episode in Japanese with English subtitles, I felt I wasn\'t getting the essence of the show. From there I found a German dubbed version, and the show got so much better.The art is your typical ""Studio Ghibli"" style, not coming to much surprise. Meanwhile, the Japanese music is great coming from Watanabe, but the German version took it out of the park. For a story taking place around 1880 with old German style folk music, perfect.Heidi begins in the mountains at 5 as a free-spirit learning the mountain life, and then is forced to move to the big city at 8 into a ""cage-like"" environment to live/befriend the daughter (Klara) of a rich family learning ""civil"" life. As one could imagine, once getting used to a country lifestyle and then moving to the ""civilized"" life of the big city isn\'t for everyone. That is pretty much the story with some life lessons along the way.At 52 episodes and what seems to have a lot of filler in between the show\'s main plot points, you could probably watch only about 12 episodes to fully understand the story while skipping the other content. I recommend to watch episodes 1-5, 16,18,20,26, and 52 in German preferably. This is a nice children\'s story and does a fine job being just that.

I loved the relationship between Heidi and her Grandpa. I loved Heidi and her friends the most. Thinking back, I feel like I used to ship Peter with Heidi lol.

However, if asked, \' what is the masterpiece?\' by those who have just started to watch anime, I will recommend them this 1973 work, ""Alps no shoujo Heidi (or, just \'Heidi\').""It is based on a fiction \'Heidi\' by Johanna Spyri, but  the staffs of ""Alps no shoujo Heidi"" made some changes. They focused more on the way Heidi lived in Alps and in Germany, and on the relationships between characters, that is, the staff depicted the daily-lives of characters.This TV series was directed by Isao Takahata, famous for ""Panda Kopanda,"" ""Hotaru...no haka"" and so on, with Hayao Miyazaki, also famous for academy-award-winner ""Spirited Away."" It is not a well-known fact that Takahata and Miyazaki in their younger days made this work. The fact implies that ""Alps no shoujo Heidi"" is not only reputed as a well-made work, but it has a historical value. If you are interested especially in the history of Japanese anime, this title is must.Speaking of its historical worth, I cannot overlook the work of Miyazaki. He helped Takahata well and drew all the layouts of this 52-episode anime series. This is a surprising fact.(NOTE: in Japanese, \'layout\' means \'the very important drawing in the cut,  included background\'; in anime animators do not depict backgrounds but layouts include background. Usually 30-minute long anime is composed of 300 cuts, so there are 300 layouts in one episode.)Miyazaki\'s work is also found in many parts of this anime. He was also involved with direction. Therefore you can easily understand how great Miyazaki was, and still he is, by watching ""Heidi.""There are more historical achievements in this anime, but I cannot write down all of them, so if you got interested, please check them.Thanks to Miyazaki\'s effort, and other talented staffs including Yoshiyuki Tomino and Yoichi Kotabe, ""Alps no shoujo Heidi"" made a big success.As for storyboard, it is still one of good models of anime today. ""Heidi"" could express Heidi\'s innocence, Peter\'s cheerfulness, Clara\'s agony, and Uncle\'s conversion. With precise backgrounds (thanks to a location hunting, which is the first one in Japan\'s TV anime history,)  you can feel as if Heidi and other characters really smiled and cried.As I said, the plot mainly traced the original, so I won\'t mention it in detail. Takahata and Miyazaki\'s success is that they succeeded to describe tiny changes of emotions with delicate directions, animations and the story. This success influenced (and, still influences) the later works, I mean, Japanese animators became to depict daily-lives of characters, not a Hollywood-like spectacle. In this sense, ""Heidi"" is the most important work of all.Of course, you sometimes find its old-fashioned aspects, such as the designs of characters, recordings, and other technical constraints. However, this work for certain contains the essence of anime. You will soon notice that only a few titles can perfectly imitate ""Heidi,"" and there are an amount of anime which aimed to ""Heidi.""After 25 years, it is still a key work in Japan\'s unique anime world.

Therefore you can easily understand how great Miyazaki was, and still he is, by watching ""Heidi.""There are more historical achievements in this anime, but I cannot write down all of them, so if you got interested, please check them.Thanks to Miyazaki\'s effort, and other talented staffs including Yoshiyuki Tomino and Yoichi Kotabe, ""Alps no shoujo Heidi"" made a big success.As for storyboard, it is still one of good models of anime today. ""Heidi"" could express Heidi\'s innocence, Peter\'s cheerfulness, Clara\'s agony, and Uncle\'s conversion. With precise backgrounds (thanks to a location hunting, which is the first one in Japan\'s TV anime history,)  you can feel as if Heidi and other characters really smiled and cried.As I said, the plot mainly traced the original, so I won\'t mention it in detail. Takahata and Miyazaki\'s success is that they succeeded to describe tiny changes of emotions with delicate directions, animations and the story. This success influenced (and, still influences) the later works, I mean, Japanese animators became to depict daily-lives of characters, not a Hollywood-like spectacle. In this sense, ""Heidi"" is the most important work of all.Of course, you sometimes find its old-fashioned aspects, such as the designs of characters, recordings, and other technical constraints. However, this work for certain contains the essence of anime. You will soon notice that only a few titles can perfectly imitate ""Heidi,"" and there are an amount of anime which aimed to ""Heidi.""After 25 years, it is still a key work in Japan\'s unique anime world. It is when you notice the excellence of ""Heidi"" that the time you became interested in anime anew comes.', 'I am probably biased,but this show may be the best kids anime out there. They reran this on the national german child program channel almost every year from probably the 80\'s or 90\'s up to they mid 2010\'sThere journeys the characters go through seems so much real than anything from other programs.

I rewatched the series in Japanese, and enjoyed it just as much as I had as a child...if not more.This series is truly a masterpiece that withstood the test of time.Be warned though, this story isn't for everyone. It's rather slow paced and heavily character driven (a given seeing as it's a coming of age, slice of life story about a little girl living in the Swiss Alps). "", ""Heidi is one of the most defining shows in the world masterpiece theater catalog. Before Heidi the other shows consisted mostly of collections of stories that became Anderson Stories, Rocky Chuck, and Moomin, and they also did an Adaptation of the manga Dororo.

Heidi’s Aunt Dete being more of a plot device who’s never seen again. The highly optimistic tone that maybe too much more some people, and so on and so forth.Overall though this is a show that i think is pretty good and has stood the test of time.

Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15613/Hakkenden__Touhou_Hakken_Ibun,"['Hakkenden draws you in through its artwork, elements of fantasy, and its moments of mystery. It was an enjoyable anime that kept me watching every week but it did not have me dying to watch it.The storyline is definitely unique, however there is an absence of a central plot or it tends to stray from it. What kept me interested were the characters and their background stories. With the introduction of each character, there are minor plots that keep you interested, however it is usually resolved within the following episode. The storyline tends to feel like a collection of stories that are somewhat connected to...a central plot however it feels mostly disconnected.The characters are my reason for scoring this anime as an 8. Shino, the protagonist, is very childish however he has a sensitive and caring side that makes him very enjoyable. Sosuke, his childhood friend, maintains a calm and loyal attitude and is seen accompanying Shino mostly everywhere. He provides a balance to Shino, who would otherwise be a typical bratty protagonist. Hamaji is another childhood friend, but her presence in the story is not a prominent halfway through. She appear to be immature and demanding but later displays a level of maturity far greater than most of the characters, even the adult ones. She is a refreshing character, who although lacks a background story of her own, adds a silly and realistic feel to the story. She is a main character but acts mainly as supporting. These characters and the rest as they are introduced actually add to the story. Not only are their personalities in great variety and incredibly different from one another, but their stories are what truly make this series a great one.The artwork is definitely done incredibly well. It is one of the first things that drew me in. The characters all have defining features that are immediately noticeable and match the multitude of personalities presented. The background is captured beautifully. Each district, each of the places that the characters visits are almost like a painted work of art. The artwork is the defining beauty of this series.Hakkenden is a very good series if you don’t mind the lack of a central plot. Don’t fret though because it does keep you interested if you get into it. It does tend to leave you wondering what it all leads into, hopefully we will see a central plot in the second season. a central plot however it feels mostly disconnected.The characters are my reason for scoring this anime as an 8.

But, what ‘if’ you were about to die and really desired to live, what would happen? How about, some nasty or beautiful entities come and grant those wishes to keep you alive, but for a price, eveeen if the price falls upon both parties. Well in Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun that’s all possible if you truly desired it, and even then you kinda...have to be in the right place at the right time.Luckily our main character, Shino Inuzuka exactly was wishing that, and he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time while dying from a tragic accident, but it turns in to be the right place and the right time, as he is saved by the Church’s Riou Satomi, but his price is a lot larger than any, as the boy will forever not age (forever aged 13) or die, technically an immortal, not only that he gives born to a grow who is called Murasame, who is meant to be this super powerful entity (that’s what we are led to believe), that when is called for bursts through Shino’s skin and comes out as a sword (yeah, I know weird transformation). Also, his friend, if not family is a dog and his best friend Hamaji, well we don’t know about her yet, but I suggest she is something too. Thus, their lives changed as well. He is now no longer alive, what will his life be like now?Right, just before we go into this review I would just like to say that, I will be marking this solely as if there wasn’t even a second season, but that doesn’t mean I won’t mention anything about it. That’s all I would like to say, so let’s get on with this review.Story (8/10) - Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun is a an Action, Shoujo and a Supernatural anime, with katanas and all that, which would make you think that this could have some real good battles and fighting scenes, but can I just say ‘right now’, don’t bother, if you are here for action, because you will be wasting your time. I mean don’t get me wrong it has its moments, but they don’t last long and there’s nothing really to them anyway. This anime (or this season) wasn’t based on Action and theatrics, it’s based on one big ass puzzle, with what seems to be a deep story, which is slowly, but surely coming together, and by the end you will definitely see why this anime got a second season, and what exactly is a drawing them in together, as it was hinted quite a few times throughout the series.This series, while trying to tell the story goes about it really slowly with barely anything happening. Some of you viewers might give up with this anime 5 episodes in, because let’s be honest, nothing actually happens for like a good 7 to 8 episodes, for me it wasn’t till the 9th one that it really got interesting. It’s around there, that all the previous episodes start to make sense, this anime is just simply, you getting to know the characters, the feel of the story, what they are and get into the feel of it, but honestly I think it failed at getting you into it, until you get to that exact part of the series. Anyway, it’s more like a long introduction of sorts, still if you got through a whole lot of nothing then you are definitely are rewarded with a lot of mystery. I’m sure you will be going straight onto season 2 in no time just wanting to know more, and what the outcome could be, well, at least I certainly am.This animes good points are its strong story and presence, while definitely giving us some good characters to enjoy as well. The characters certainly bring the story together, and there is something real deep and mystified about each character, especially, Shino Inuzuka and Sousuke Inukawa.I think you all will be very surprised, just how good the actually overall experience was like by the end, even if the start was such a drag.For the bad points, well like I’ve said this anime literally goes nowhere for like 4 episodes, they then suddenly get sent off to another town and now have to look for beads, and you think this is where something begins but again, nothing. At first you really think something deep is going on, and shit is about to go down, but in the end it was a totally let down, seriously! You get all dumped, just for it to be all thrown away, I mean it had the entire plot there and everything and at first you think, “Wait? What? That it? Can’t be serious, right? They build it all up and even the atmosphere, just for it to end like this?” There was a real good plot, but the conclusion was very droll and boring. This is where you will strangle, because it continues to do this. There’s even a random encounter on a train and ends in them making a friend and leaving him, obviously the guy wasn’t any normal guy and there something more to it and all that, but still, makes you think “what exactly was the purpose of that guy? You know, forget that question, what was the point in the episode?” You need not worry, in the last few episodes everything begins to make sense, I can assure you.Now I did say that this anime is solely story more than anything, and yes that is correct, but this anime has Action in it, I mean come on! It has *flupping* demons, swords, entities and bloody deities in it, and yet nothing really badass happens, or no real challenge at all throughout the whole thing, apart from this mysterious character that doesn’t get introduced until later in the series, and he is like the first and ‘only’ real threat that I know of throughout the whole thing. I wish it done it sooner, because I honestly think people could lose patience of just how slow it progresses. Also, the actual battles are nothing all that much either, pretty standard, none interesting stuff, if they were to have a battle, I wished it could have been more intense, like maybe bring the story into the fight, make it feel that little more intense and stuff, but what do I know, huh? In the end, I think you could count the number of battles there were on your hand. I would love to make an example, but then this review wouldn’t really be spoiler free, but you will see what I mean.For shoujo side of things, well I couldn’t say any girl or man wouldn’t be disappointed at all, the characters are all hot guys and that main character when his curse was lifted, my god I think when I saw him, I think I was just as stunned  as Kobungo Inuta was, haha.In the end, it really just depends, if you don’t mind too much about a stories pace or anything like that, then this won’t be a problem for you, in matter of fact, it could even be fairly enjoyable and likeable as well. The story is certainly not perfect and it did have some real flaws. If you’re a person who saw Katanas, the genre, “Action and “Supernatural” and thinking it’s going to be some real fun and awesome battles, then again sorry, you are being totally miss leaded.Art (9/10) Art was amazing! Recently, animes art and animation have been astounding, like they really have stepped it up a notch, to something suppose from like an anime like maybe 3 or 4 years ago and I honestly think nowadays our rating on art should be a little more strict, as there are less mistakes to point out now, due to all this HD.Still again, this anime I just couldn’t bring this rating down any further than 9, because the art was (like I said) amazing. The entities were either, beautifully animated and well-drawn or damn right suited to their looks or name, take for example Shino’s Murasame, a crow with black feathers with this, like evil look to his eye. Then you have the deities, which look like what they were and yet so wonderfully drawn and animated, I mean you could tell them apart from maybe some normal entity or demon. Literally everything supernatural was, I would say, “stunning”, as simple as that really. That crow coming how of Shino’s arm, come on! That like creeps me out a little, what’s worse he doesn’t have any reaction to him whatsoever when it happens.The actual characters were very well drawn as well, I wasn’t too keen on Hamaji’s art, but for me, I eventually didn’t mind, matter of fact I liked her art as well in the end.Background was again well drawn, but nothing really special. It’s something you would expect from a 2013 anime.(Ignore if you wish) Damn, I hate rating backgrounds because like, who has the time to read the subtitles, look at the screen and what’s actually going on, while trying to soak in the background, when nothing happens there, argh. (End of gibberish)Reason not for a ten is that I had one problem, it just didn’t seem right and I’m sure you viewers will feel the same way, is that when you go into a wider perspective, when like Shino is next to Shousuke, and see just how small he is to them, it felt way too weird and off at the same time, like something just wasn’t right there, he looked like a midget. However, when I saw his real form (without the curse), I honestly think the art for it was magnificent, and I truly thought it was better and it definitely suited in the crowd a lot more than in his “small boy form”.Shino: Eh? Naaaniii?!Sound (6/10) – One thing this anime definitely falls in is the music, the music was simply just there, the OP theme song after listening to it once makes you want to skip it every time so you can just get right in to it, doesn’t want you to stay back and listen to it. I’m sure if you keep listening to it, you might not be bothered by it, but let me just say this, if you listen to ANY music long enough, you’re going to like it by the end of it all, until you’re just sick of hearing it, wait, that’s like that with every music, oh well. One thing the OP did have which was good was the chorus, with its hard beats and up-beat chorus was definitely nice, but that’s about it.As for the sounds in the anime, they were fairly good, they did add to some scenes and scenarios, so they definitely did a good job there.The EP Theme Song is a little worse than even the OP, as for the OP had a nice Chorus and instruments and so did this instrument wise, but as for the lyrics and the song itself, just didn’t seem right, I ain’t going to say that it didn’t fit because the lyrics and the song is meant to resemble the anime itself.So, I definitely will say for sure that the worse side of this anime is the music by far; this is something I’m hoping was done better in season 2. Also the reason for the 6 and not a 7 is purely because of the fact the year of this anime is 2013 and I honestly think music since last year has really been kicked up a notch, nearly every new anime I’ve seen has had outstanding quality of music and it’s getting harder and harder to rate, so this is the reason and I compare to today’s animes and this just isn’t up there with them on this department.Characters (8/10) – The characters were surprisingly very well done, they weren’t boring, very far from it. And I’m leaving everything about the characters up to you, because this story revolves around them, but mainly the main character, but don’t they always, argh, so cliché, haha.Anyway, the characters are all likeable, and you knew which ones were mysterious or ominous beings. They all have something to them, and every character seems to have a part of the plot, even though it centres around Shino, which is nice to see that it ain’t just all about the main character all the time. I find that so refreshing.There will be still characters that feel a little off, or know nearly nothing about, which is sad, as I wished it went it to that a bit, well I guess it did, but I just thought maybe a little more, still hopefully that gets all explained in season 2.There was a problem however, it’s when a certain characters arc ends, all of a sudden what we saw in the arc, turned out to be totally different in the end, matter of fact even joking and having a laugh to make the comedic moments, which it did poor at if I might add. To be honest, it confused the hell out of me, that they turn to what they were in the arc to suddenly not giving a crap or continuing like nothing happened, I just found that so weird. Meh, it’s nothing mager but it just bugged me, so I thought I should point it out.Enjoyment (7/10) – Beginning stint was just a little confusing and weird at times, but they were still fun episodes to watch, just seeing how everything unravels is a nice thought. Basically this anime I don’t think was meant to be all this fun fun times, but more to immerse you within its storyline to get you to understand things, what the characters are like, their pasts and what kind of plot the series be going after, that sort of thing, and have you noticed it’s either about the story or the characters which make up the story as well. It centres around story, not action. So, if you are that kind of person, then I suggest just giving this a miss. The beginning was a drag and could make you feel a little bored, but I still think you will find yourself marching on further and further through this anime.For the later stages of the anime, it kicks it up a notch by bringing an unknown being into the mix and showing us some new stuff, it was certainly a joy to watch like I’ve said so many times already throughout this review. So, if you’re watching this, just hang in there and you will be REWARDED.Overall (8/10) – The anime was just too slow to begin with and the viewers could well be fed up and just give up on the show, due to nothing really happening at all, and seeing even nothing during even the action doesn’t help this anime by any means, matter of fact makes it worse. Weird characters also just forgetting what just happened to them during the series and now just seem to act normal and jokingly, which is nice to see that they are doing well, but it just doesn’t seem right the way they act as if nothing has happened to them at all.This anime however, is good at telling a story, it gives you lovely backgrounds on characters, gives a deep storyline that is slowly but surely coming together, which longs the enjoyment for more content, amazing characters and meaning. Even the connection with the whole bead business, it really does make for an interesting show to watch, and when you finally get the last few episodes, then you’re going to enjoy this anime even more and makes you feel like you understand what was going on earlier and why they went the way they went with the show, and it doesn’t make It all that confusing anymore, not only that, it actually gives you more good times than anything, it’s dark, it’s deep and it’s mysterious, how about that, hey?I’ve said quite a few times already, but I will say it again, this anime is NOT for people who are looking for just some awesome action and good fun fun times because you’re not going to get it, however if you are a person who wants to have a real story based, then this is it, or just want something that is a little mysterious then this has it as well, or just want a deep story and awesome characters, then again this anime has it. It’s simply about the story and the characters, nothing more or less.I recommend this to anyone, who is anything about story and for people who like shoujo and all that, I also would recommend this to people who like a deep mystery with mysterious characters. And I don’t recommend to anyone who want something less serious or action and beefy time, because it just ain’t going to work out for you. have to be in the right place at the right time.Luckily our main character, Shino Inuzuka exactly was wishing that, and he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time while dying from a tragic accident, but it turns in to be the right place and the right time, as he is saved by the Church’s Riou Satomi, but his price is a lot larger than any, as the boy will forever not age (forever aged 13) or die, technically an immortal, not only that he gives born to a grow who is called Murasame, who is meant to be this super powerful entity (that’s what we are led to believe), that when is called for bursts through Shino’s skin and comes out as a sword (yeah, I know weird transformation). Also, his friend, if not family is a dog and his best friend Hamaji, well we don’t know about her yet, but I suggest she is something too. Thus, their lives changed as well. He is now no longer alive, what will his life be like now?Right, just before we go into this review I would just like to say that, I will be marking this solely as if there wasn’t even a second season, but that doesn’t mean I won’t mention anything about it. That’s all I would like to say, so let’s get on with this review.Story (8/10) - Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun is a an Action, Shoujo and a Supernatural anime, with katanas and all that, which would make you think that this could have some real good battles and fighting scenes, but can I just say ‘right now’, don’t bother, if you are here for action, because you will be wasting your time. I mean don’t get me wrong it has its moments, but they don’t last long and there’s nothing really to them anyway. This anime (or this season) wasn’t based on Action and theatrics, it’s based on one big ass puzzle, with what seems to be a deep story, which is slowly, but surely coming together, and by the end you will definitely see why this anime got a second season, and what exactly is a drawing them in together, as it was hinted quite a few times throughout the series.This series, while trying to tell the story goes about it really slowly with barely anything happening. Some of you viewers might give up with this anime 5 episodes in, because let’s be honest, nothing actually happens for like a good 7 to 8 episodes, for me it wasn’t till the 9th one that it really got interesting. It’s around there, that all the previous episodes start to make sense, this anime is just simply, you getting to know the characters, the feel of the story, what they are and get into the feel of it, but honestly I think it failed at getting you into it, until you get to that exact part of the series. Anyway, it’s more like a long introduction of sorts, still if you got through a whole lot of nothing then you are definitely are rewarded with a lot of mystery. I’m sure you will be going straight onto season 2 in no time just wanting to know more, and what the outcome could be, well, at least I certainly am.This animes good points are its strong story and presence, while definitely giving us some good characters to enjoy as well. The characters certainly bring the story together, and there is something real deep and mystified about each character, especially, Shino Inuzuka and Sousuke Inukawa.I think you all will be very surprised, just how good the actually overall experience was like by the end, even if the start was such a drag.For the bad points, well like I’ve said this anime literally goes nowhere for like 4 episodes, they then suddenly get sent off to another town and now have to look for beads, and you think this is where something begins but again, nothing. At first you really think something deep is going on, and shit is about to go down, but in the end it was a totally let down, seriously! You get all dumped, just for it to be all thrown away, I mean it had the entire plot there and everything and at first you think, “Wait? What? That it? Can’t be serious, right? They build it all up and even the atmosphere, just for it to end like this?” There was a real good plot, but the conclusion was very droll and boring. This is where you will strangle, because it continues to do this. There’s even a random encounter on a train and ends in them making a friend and leaving him, obviously the guy wasn’t any normal guy and there something more to it and all that, but still, makes you think “what exactly was the purpose of that guy? You know, forget that question, what was the point in the episode?” You need not worry, in the last few episodes everything begins to make sense, I can assure you.Now I did say that this anime is solely story more than anything, and yes that is correct, but this anime has Action in it, I mean come on! It has *flupping* demons, swords, entities and bloody deities in it, and yet nothing really badass happens, or no real challenge at all throughout the whole thing, apart from this mysterious character that doesn’t get introduced until later in the series, and he is like the first and ‘only’ real threat that I know of throughout the whole thing. I wish it done it sooner, because I honestly think people could lose patience of just how slow it progresses. Also, the actual battles are nothing all that much either, pretty standard, none interesting stuff, if they were to have a battle, I wished it could have been more intense, like maybe bring the story into the fight, make it feel that little more intense and stuff, but what do I know, huh? In the end, I think you could count the number of battles there were on your hand. I would love to make an example, but then this review wouldn’t really be spoiler free, but you will see what I mean.For shoujo side of things, well I couldn’t say any girl or man wouldn’t be disappointed at all, the characters are all hot guys and that main character when his curse was lifted, my god I think when I saw him, I think I was just as stunned  as Kobungo Inuta was, haha.In the end, it really just depends, if you don’t mind too much about a stories pace or anything like that, then this won’t be a problem for you, in matter of fact, it could even be fairly enjoyable and likeable as well. The story is certainly not perfect and it did have some real flaws. If you’re a person who saw Katanas, the genre, “Action and “Supernatural” and thinking it’s going to be some real fun and awesome battles, then again sorry, you are being totally miss leaded.Art (9/10) Art was amazing! Recently, animes art and animation have been astounding, like they really have stepped it up a notch, to something suppose from like an anime like maybe 3 or 4 years ago and I honestly think nowadays our rating on art should be a little more strict, as there are less mistakes to point out now, due to all this HD.Still again, this anime I just couldn’t bring this rating down any further than 9, because the art was (like I said) amazing. The entities were either, beautifully animated and well-drawn or damn right suited to their looks or name, take for example Shino’s Murasame, a crow with black feathers with this, like evil look to his eye. Then you have the deities, which look like what they were and yet so wonderfully drawn and animated, I mean you could tell them apart from maybe some normal entity or demon. Literally everything supernatural was, I would say, “stunning”, as simple as that really. That crow coming how of Shino’s arm, come on! That like creeps me out a little, what’s worse he doesn’t have any reaction to him whatsoever when it happens.The actual characters were very well drawn as well, I wasn’t too keen on Hamaji’s art, but for me, I eventually didn’t mind, matter of fact I liked her art as well in the end.Background was again well drawn, but nothing really special. It’s something you would expect from a 2013 anime.(Ignore if you wish) Damn, I hate rating backgrounds because like, who has the time to read the subtitles, look at the screen and what’s actually going on, while trying to soak in the background, when nothing happens there, argh. (End of gibberish)Reason not for a ten is that I had one problem, it just didn’t seem right and I’m sure you viewers will feel the same way, is that when you go into a wider perspective, when like Shino is next to Shousuke, and see just how small he is to them, it felt way too weird and off at the same time, like something just wasn’t right there, he looked like a midget. However, when I saw his real form (without the curse), I honestly think the art for it was magnificent, and I truly thought it was better and it definitely suited in the crowd a lot more than in his “small boy form”.Shino: Eh? Naaaniii?!Sound (6/10) – One thing this anime definitely falls in is the music, the music was simply just there, the OP theme song after listening to it once makes you want to skip it every time so you can just get right in to it, doesn’t want you to stay back and listen to it. I’m sure if you keep listening to it, you might not be bothered by it, but let me just say this, if you listen to ANY music long enough, you’re going to like it by the end of it all, until you’re just sick of hearing it, wait, that’s like that with every music, oh well. One thing the OP did have which was good was the chorus, with its hard beats and up-beat chorus was definitely nice, but that’s about it.As for the sounds in the anime, they were fairly good, they did add to some scenes and scenarios, so they definitely did a good job there.The EP Theme Song is a little worse than even the OP, as for the OP had a nice Chorus and instruments and so did this instrument wise, but as for the lyrics and the song itself, just didn’t seem right, I ain’t going to say that it didn’t fit because the lyrics and the song is meant to resemble the anime itself.So, I definitely will say for sure that the worse side of this anime is the music by far; this is something I’m hoping was done better in season 2. Also the reason for the 6 and not a 7 is purely because of the fact the year of this anime is 2013 and I honestly think music since last year has really been kicked up a notch, nearly every new anime I’ve seen has had outstanding quality of music and it’s getting harder and harder to rate, so this is the reason and I compare to today’s animes and this just isn’t up there with them on this department.Characters (8/10) – The characters were surprisingly very well done, they weren’t boring, very far from it. And I’m leaving everything about the characters up to you, because this story revolves around them, but mainly the main character, but don’t they always, argh, so cliché, haha.Anyway, the characters are all likeable, and you knew which ones were mysterious or ominous beings. They all have something to them, and every character seems to have a part of the plot, even though it centres around Shino, which is nice to see that it ain’t just all about the main character all the time. I find that so refreshing.There will be still characters that feel a little off, or know nearly nothing about, which is sad, as I wished it went it to that a bit, well I guess it did, but I just thought maybe a little more, still hopefully that gets all explained in season 2.There was a problem however, it’s when a certain characters arc ends, all of a sudden what we saw in the arc, turned out to be totally different in the end, matter of fact even joking and having a laugh to make the comedic moments, which it did poor at if I might add. To be honest, it confused the hell out of me, that they turn to what they were in the arc to suddenly not giving a crap or continuing like nothing happened, I just found that so weird. Meh, it’s nothing mager but it just bugged me, so I thought I should point it out.Enjoyment (7/10) – Beginning stint was just a little confusing and weird at times, but they were still fun episodes to watch, just seeing how everything unravels is a nice thought. Basically this anime I don’t think was meant to be all this fun fun times, but more to immerse you within its storyline to get you to understand things, what the characters are like, their pasts and what kind of plot the series be going after, that sort of thing, and have you noticed it’s either about the story or the characters which make up the story as well. It centres around story, not action. So, if you are that kind of person, then I suggest just giving this a miss. The beginning was a drag and could make you feel a little bored, but I still think you will find yourself marching on further and further through this anime.For the later stages of the anime, it kicks it up a notch by bringing an unknown being into the mix and showing us some new stuff, it was certainly a joy to watch like I’ve said so many times already throughout this review. So, if you’re watching this, just hang in there and you will be REWARDED.Overall (8/10) – The anime was just too slow to begin with and the viewers could well be fed up and just give up on the show, due to nothing really happening at all, and seeing even nothing during even the action doesn’t help this anime by any means, matter of fact makes it worse. Weird characters also just forgetting what just happened to them during the series and now just seem to act normal and jokingly, which is nice to see that they are doing well, but it just doesn’t seem right the way they act as if nothing has happened to them at all.This anime however, is good at telling a story, it gives you lovely backgrounds on characters, gives a deep storyline that is slowly but surely coming together, which longs the enjoyment for more content, amazing characters and meaning. Even the connection with the whole bead business, it really does make for an interesting show to watch, and when you finally get the last few episodes, then you’re going to enjoy this anime even more and makes you feel like you understand what was going on earlier and why they went the way they went with the show, and it doesn’t make It all that confusing anymore, not only that, it actually gives you more good times than anything, it’s dark, it’s deep and it’s mysterious, how about that, hey?I’ve said quite a few times already, but I will say it again, this anime is NOT for people who are looking for just some awesome action and good fun fun times because you’re not going to get it, however if you are a person who wants to have a real story based, then this is it, or just want something that is a little mysterious then this has it as well, or just want a deep story and awesome characters, then again this anime has it. It’s simply about the story and the characters, nothing more or less.I recommend this to anyone, who is anything about story and for people who like shoujo and all that, I also would recommend this to people who like a deep mystery with mysterious characters. And I don’t recommend to anyone who want something less serious or action and beefy time, because it just ain’t going to work out for you.', 'Hakkenden: Eight Dogs of the East, But Went South FastThis is one of the rare occasions where I\'ll say a series fascinated me but bored me to death at the same time. I\'m not sure how that\'s possible, but Hakkenden managed to pull it off. This series is slightly misleading from the get go and it never really got off the ground.This series is about a pair of friends, who consider themselves ""brothers"" that each possess a special power after their lives had been saved five years prior to the current plot. Shino Inuzuka is a boy/young man that possesses the sword Murasame in his...body and takes the shape of a crow. However, as a result, his body does not age and he remains in the form of a 12-year-old boy. Sousuke Inukawa is a young man the same age that takes the form of a dog and it is later discovered in the series that there is a problem with his spirit (which I will not spoil). Together, they live with another girl they consider to be their sister named Hamaji, who also faced a tragedy from her past that brought her together with Shino and Sousuke. The three of them are taken in by Rio Saotome, a priest from the high church and while in his custody, Shino is on a mission to collect the eight beads that are the same as his and Sousuke\'s beads. Each bead has a different passage on it, what each means...is yet to be determined.There isn\'t much I can say on the positive side of Hakkenden other than I found the premise to be pretty interesting and the music to be downright awesome. I\'ll admit, this series did keep me interested in what these ""Eight Dogs of the East"" were and what powers they shared. This series was captivating from its OPs and EDs, giving the impression that this series was going to have an interesting story AND excellent shounen elements...even if it is somewhat shounen-ai. I found the music to generally be pretty good, especially with its OPs and EDs. The OP is a song called God FATE performed by Faylan, who I consider to be one of my personal favorite J-pop artists in the industry right now. My only beef with the OP in regards to the song choice is that it does not fit the vibe of the series very well. Hakkenden is a very slow-paced, character driven series with not a whole lot of action. However, the upbeat song with flashy OP visuals gives this series the impression that its a fast-paced shounen series. While the OP is enjoyable, it\'s a bit of a false advertisement for what you\'re going to get with the series. The ED is actually one of the better EDs I\'ve seen in a while. While it isn\'t visually stunning, it is pretty to look at with a pretty cool song to boot, ""String of Pain"" by Tetsuya Kakihara. It\'s actually kind of funny in retrospect when you realize the person singing the ED song is also doing the voice of Shino...and sounds almost nothing like him. The ED does a nice job showing off each character...but that\'s about all it accomplishes. Otherwise, the music by Hitomi Kuroishi is pretty solid and fits the theme of the series...which are a couple things I\'ll give her props for considering her most notable works outside of this series are Code Geass and Last Exile.As for the negatives, when I said this series bored me to death, it was because there is almost no story progression whatsoever. If you just watched the first three episodes and the last three episodes, I\'d almost be willing to bet you\'d be able to pick up on everything that\'s happened throughout the series. It felt like this first season focused more on character introduction with some slight development around the two leads. It\'s a little hard to explain, but while I found the characters to be at least somewhat interesting, the pacing of this series didn\'t reveal a whole lot about them besides their exterior personalities. While yes, I\'m aware each character that was introduced did come with their own internal monologue, the way this series was paced felt too slow and didn\'t really dwell on each character enough. It didn\'t seem to implement the supporting characters into the over-arcing story very well either. From a production standpoint, there wasn\'t anything very remarkable about the animation or voice acting. There are quite a few familiar seiyuu\'s, like the aforementioned Tetsuya Kakihara (Natsu from Fairy Tail, Gaul from Dog Days, Simon from Gurren Lagann), Satoshi Hino (Akito from Bakuman, Koukin from Ikkitousen, Yuji from Shakugan no Shana), and Hiroshi Kamiya (Yuzuru from Angel Beats, Koyomi from the Monogatari series). However, I wouldn\'t call their performances in this to be all that compelling.All-in-all, I\'m really not sure what\'s going on with Studio Deen. It seems like they keep pushing out mediocre series after mediocre series with a hidden gem here and there. Unfortunately, I have to put this series along with the blandly average. It\'s really a shame because this series did have a ton of potential. It had a very interesting plot and the production values are pretty good on the OP and ED, although a bit misleading. However, again this story seems to struggle due to its horrifically slow pace with a non-existent story progression. While I tend to enjoy animes that are more character driven than story driven, this was one of the few rare occasions where I felt it put a little too much focus on certain characters, not enough on others, and had moments where it felt like there was unnecessary padding. As far as a recommendation for this series, I\'d have to say to wait until the 2nd season comes out this summer. The series does a nice job of introducing the characters but is extremely slow with its story progression. I just have the impression that this whole series (including 2nd season) would be easier to marathon than watch and wait for a 2nd season. If you enjoyed something like Katanagatari or shounen-ai animes, I might recommend this...but again, I\'d say wait for the 2nd season to finish first to see if it\'s really something you\'d want to invest your time into. body and takes the shape of a crow.

I was personally drawn by how every character had such an extensive backstory and how all the characters were woven together in a charming, intriguing way through the main protagonists. There's a good balance between magical elements as well as emotional, romantic, and comedic moments. The main plotline does tend to stray, but the individuality of each sideplot is fascinating enough that the series continues at a good pace. Again, the art is possibly this show's greatest strength--there's a stunning use of color in both the...character designs and the settings, and the style is smooth and consistent throughout both seasons of the show. There's a little bit of everything within this story, with almost all types of characters touched upon. character designs and the settings, and the style is smooth and consistent throughout both seasons of the show.

That also explains the shonen-ai ""hints"" that appear from time to time, fortunately without being  over the board and without straying from the main plot.The series begins in a quite dramatic way, with a scenery covered by flames, while two children and a dog are severly wounded, especially a young boy who lays on the ground, dressed in a blood-stained kimono. Suddenly, a young man appears, offering the boy the option to choose between dying without protecting his friends, or letting a ayakashi (spirit,demon) take over his body. The boy chooses to live and to save his friends, but pays a heavy price, his growth process is stopped,making him stuck in his child form for eternity.While the story unfolds, we find out about the existence of the Four Beast Clan, which become very important later in the story, since they are the center of the conflict between humans (the power being held by the church) and yokai. To fight the demons,the church chose four children to wield the power of ancient,powerful beasts,in order to protect humanity.However,the story is by far original, being based on a classical Japanese novel ""Nanso Satomi Hakkenden"" by Bakin Kyokutei Takizawa. As if that wasn\'t enough,it has been animated already twice, in different forms. I could say that this current form has been mordernized for the current audience, but I think it could have been better. Even so,after episode 5 we can see some improvement in the story, focusing more on the choices of characters and the consequences.Story: 5My first impression of the characters was decent, at times they were quite enjoyable, especially the young girl, Hamaji, which has quite shows to be quite  mature, posessing observational skills. His brattiness may a temper, for example, even when kidnapped, she remains calm, presearving her composure, asking impossible demands with a straight, poker face. The main character, Shino Inuzuka, may appears as your usual brat, but at times, he have been perserved by the ""curse"" of wielding the power of one of the four beasts,Murasame, that retains him from growing up.There is also the loyal  Sousuke Inukawa, that as his family name reflects,has the loyalty of a dog (quite literally,since he can also tranform into one). Other characters start to emerge as Satomi (the one who saved Shino), Kobungo Inuta (whose brother has the same beast seal as Shino) and Kaname Osaki ( who fancies Hamaji\'s unlady-like but charming personality) however until now they remain quite underdeveloped. In my opinion, it is one of the weakest points in the series, since I consider the plot and characters the most important parts of an anime. However, little by little, the plot thickens, and the characters have to start making decisions that help them develop.Characters: 5One of the highlights of the anime is the design and animation, the mangaka provided an eye-catching character design ( she specialises in it,since she is a shonen-ai mangaka) as well as the Showa era inspired sceneries,costumes etc.   Studio Deen specialises in fantasy-inspired worlds such as Fate/stay night and Amatsuki,delighting the eyes of the 2013 audince thorugh its bright coloured sceneries,almost as if emanating warmth from each light, each nunance.Art: 7The music from the first episodes is not extraordinary, but after that, it starts to pick up the pace, becoming more and more interesting and accomodating the atmosphere.Music: 7Maybe I became less exigent with this anime,therefore my enjoyment was decent.Enjoyment:5Overall: 5 wit.

The main character, Shino Inuzuka, may appears as your usual brat, but at times, he have been perserved by the ""curse"" of wielding the power of one of the four beasts,Murasame, that retains him from growing up.There is also the loyal  Sousuke Inukawa, that as his family name reflects,has the loyalty of a dog (quite literally,since he can also tranform into one). Other characters start to emerge as Satomi (the one who saved Shino), Kobungo Inuta (whose brother has the same beast seal as Shino) and Kaname Osaki ( who fancies Hamaji\'s unlady-like but charming personality) however until now they remain quite underdeveloped. In my opinion, it is one of the weakest points in the series, since I consider the plot and characters the most important parts of an anime. However, little by little, the plot thickens, and the characters have to start making decisions that help them develop.Characters: 5One of the highlights of the anime is the design and animation, the mangaka provided an eye-catching character design ( she specialises in it,since she is a shonen-ai mangaka) as well as the Showa era inspired sceneries,costumes etc.   Studio Deen specialises in fantasy-inspired worlds such as Fate/stay night and Amatsuki,delighting the eyes of the 2013 audince thorugh its bright coloured sceneries,almost as if emanating warmth from each light, each nunance.Art: 7The music from the first episodes is not extraordinary, but after that, it starts to pick up the pace, becoming more and more interesting and accomodating the atmosphere.Music: 7Maybe I became less exigent with this anime,therefore my enjoyment was decent.Enjoyment:5Overall: 5', 'Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun is an historical and supernatural anime that revolves around the story of 18 years old Inuzuka Shino, Inukawa Sousuke, and Murasame. Inuzuka Shino was supposed to be dead 5 years ago without the help of Saitome Riou. Riou \'implanted\' Murasame in Shino\'s body to have a second chance in life but the price was that Shino will never die and will always be trapped in a 13 years old body of his. Inukawa Sousuke was also revived but had to live in a consequences of having half of his soul was gone and have the ability of transforming to a dog...named Yoshiro.Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun is a masterpiece in its own league, having the perfect collaboration within the characters like Sousuke being a big brother to Shino, Riou\'s superiority to Shino, and many more; and also the perfect layout of unfolding and revealing mysteries such as Ao being Sousuke\'s shadow, Murasame\'s true form, Riou\'s claim of its his duty to give his blood to Shino, and all the bead holders\' last names have ""Inu"" in them and have the same situations on how they had the beads.Unlike in supernatural animes, Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun has a unique point of master-demons relationships. For example, Murasame and other demons are very vengeful to the people who harmed their masters, very dangerous when they sensed someone threatening their masters\' safety, and very obedient to their masters. An example of this was Murasame devouring Shouichi when Shouichi shot Shino at his neck, causing Shino to be dead; Yatsufusa\'s obedience towards Rio, Hibiki\'s over protectiveness towards Ayane, Yukihime\'s possessiveness towards Inuyama Dousetsu and the casual relationship between the Five Foxes and Osaki Kaname. Also, the element of transforming a human to a demon without going berserk and claiming to be ""good demons"" like Inuta Kobungo and Inukai Genpachi.What Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun fun to watch is the relationship of the characters to each other and the personality of each, which made a good balancing in the anime. In other animes, portraying the relationship of the characters in details can sometimes makes the story draggging and boring but in this case, it was different. It had a flavor of a good balance of relationships without inserting some dramatic events.The protagonist\'s, Shino\'s, growth can be seen as well. At that start of the series, Shino will always be seen in Sousuke\'s side but later on, Shino hanging out to the other characters and meet other people like Kouhaku, and also the realization of the world, like Shino\'s statement to Kouhaku: “I didn’t understand that there are people who didn’t fear death, but instead falter at that thought of living.”Overall, Hakkende: Touhou Hakken Ibun is strongly recommended for the people who are carving in a different ride of supernatural animes. There are no girls pairing up to these beautiful boys but these boys are pairing up each other themselves (xD); Shino\'s clingy attitude towards Sousuke and Genpachi\'s love to Shino. Of course, there\'s an exception, Hamaji\'s and Kaname\'s love to each other (Kaname said himself that he wants to marry Hamaji when she is old enough to marry)“I told you that I’m afraid of dying, but I think being left all alone in this world is much more painful than death. However, if only there’d be someone by my side to hold my hand, then I’m sure I’d neither fear the thought of life nor death.” -Shino Inuzuka named Yoshiro.Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun is a masterpiece in its own league, having the perfect collaboration within the characters like Sousuke being a big brother to Shino, Riou\'s superiority to Shino, and many more; and also the perfect layout of unfolding and revealing mysteries such as Ao being Sousuke\'s shadow, Murasame\'s true form, Riou\'s claim of its his duty to give his blood to Shino, and all the bead holders\' last names have ""Inu"" in them and have the same situations on how they had the beads.Unlike in supernatural animes, Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun has a unique point of master-demons relationships.

The animation is smooth, the art is clean, and the story has a great basis with an interesting cast of characters. However character development so far is good it can easily get better. Overall this anime has a lot of potential. I look forward to typing up a new hopefully better review when the series ends. ', 'Life is short and I will only give you an honest and straight forward opinion. I enjoyed this anime\'s artwork, style, and concept until at one point the boy-love tone made me hit the kill switch. What is with the ""mother dresses her son up as a girl to make him a better person"" rubbish? Why do you have to destroy a decent story with all that side stuff? I have not completed this anime and never will based on my personal integrity on what a decent story should entail. ', 'I am by no means an anime-connoisseur. I tried to watch Death Note and Berserk because it is so highly recommended but it was too intense for my taste. I am mentioning it here so that it may serve as a measuring stick. That said, now to Hakkenden.Without revealing too much,  Shino Inuzuka who is the focal point of this anime, is an 18 year old stuck in the body of a 13 year old due to demonic sword Murasame. Around Shino are his companions whose connections to each other are still not 100% clear as of the end of the first season....This mysterious connection of the characters is the main plot. There in lies the only weakness of this anime in my opinion.At the end of the 13th episode We still do not exactly know what is going on, who is really the bad guy and what the good guys are supposed to do.  And that despite the fact that we are introduced the first bits of plot information within the first few minutes of the first episode. Also, even though the first season has ended, it is for sure that we have been not introduced to all the characters as yet.  This all happens not because the plot is ingeniously intricate but rather because it is handled sloppily.  Though it did not really bother me, instead of furthering the main plot, unrelated sub plots are pursued, ending the first season not really on a cliffhanger but rather incomplete.I really enjoyed the art. Very eye pleasing characters all around. Also what I appreciated A LOT was the female characters did not annoy me with the usual weak, help me, support me, I am the damsel demeanor, or the obligatory forced pull-push romance. Hamaji for instance is the main female character. She is strong willed, smart, strong and compassionate. While flirtatious, she is not a character to lose her own being in romance. To my perception she is also not one of those extra dense female characters where the romantic interest all but stick his tongue into her mouth and she still doesn\'t get the news that he likes her. No, as far as I perceived Hamaji does understand very well Osaki likes her, but she chooses education before romantic mush.There are slight undertones of Shounen Ai, so if you are allergic to it, beware.I liked the music. I am not a very musical person so all I can say is in my opinion music was used very well to enhance the general atmosphere and the specific scenic effects of the anime. Also I liked the opening and the ending songs.I really enjoyed this anime. Apart from the eye pleasing art and ear pleasing music, despite the plot holes, it had the right balance of humor, fantasy, mystery, adventure and angst for me. Like I said at the beginning, I can\'t take too much of ""excitement/fantasy"". That is also valid for too mushy romances or nothing but stupid laugh humor. Maybe it means I have no taste or maybe I am too average. Whatever it may be, this anime spoke to my tastes. And the fact a second season was announced pretty much soon also helped. Without a second season it would have annoyed me a lot as many many many things in it are still unsolved/unresolved.Overall, I recommend it. It is almost like a pop corn movie. You are engaged while you are watching it, because it is interesting and entertaining without ruffling too many feathers but you don\'t feel the stomach churning excitement waiting for the next episode.

It doesn't say so in its genre or tags, but the friendship and brotherhood between the main characters implies shounen-ai. It's in almost every episode, and for someone who can't tolerate anything homosexual, it's best if you don't press play. Additionally, Abe Miyuki changed its original magazine to one famous for BL, so it's possible that in the future, real male on male relationships will come into the story.Personally, I like shounen-ai and yaoi, so I have nothing bad to say about this anime except this: Hakkenden is sort...of an anime that is slow with its plot progress. You have to wait a couple of episodes to see where the story really comes from. It's mainly just character introductions. It takes a while for you to put everything together, but it's fun to watch because of its comedy and bishounens (everyone's practically a bishounen in this series). I like all the characters, mainly their backgrounds and how they came to have their spirits.I can't wait for the 2nd season in July 2013! I want to see more of everyone.

Shino now has a god in the form of a demon crow (that can turn into a sword) living inside him, which prevents him from aging, and Sousuke can turn into a dog. Now working for the Church, the three of them travel to the capital to investigate demon-related crimes, and they keep having chance encounters with other people with similarly tragic backstories who also...have spirits living inside them.Clearly, the story here is a little hard to explain: the story takes a while to get going and is confusing once it does. To quote a character in the actual anime, “Jeez, I was already taken aback by that strange eyeball, and now there’s this Sacred Dog. The world is full of surprises.”Regardless, I enjoyed this anime more and more as it went on (and especially into season 2) because the characters are the real draw here, particularly the two leads. Shino and Sousuke’s relationship is a mix between a married couple, brothers, parent-child, and best friends (who cuddle a lot). Another character remarks that Shino draws people “like a magnet,” and that certainly was the case for me.

Shino, an 18 year old boy who has the permanent body of a non-aging 13 year old boy. This works to his benefit due to his personality and characteristics resembling a child. Shino is what makes the show, he\'s the lovable little main character; and almost everything is about him. His child hood friend Sosuke (18) accompanies him, and they have a best friend.../ brother relationship despite the differences in their appearance.The anime immediately gives viewers a general idea of what the characters personalities are like within the first few episodes. From that point, it is up to the viewer to decide whether they will be able to build some sort of connection with the characters, or if the characters do not appeal to them.Althought Hakkenden has a bad starting impression, it picks up rather quickly after the first few episodes. The age difference in terms of appearance between Sosuke and Shino makes it hard to see them as best friends and more as the older brother and little brother. Though many will claim there is a bountiful amount of fan service I\'d disagree, Shino\'s just simply a little kid. The story itself implied that him and Sousuke were really close to begin with; it\'s not weird that two guys hug unless people purposely view it that way... That\'s just something I\'d like to put out there.The OP/ED are alright nothing spectacular, but there were two excellent songs inserted  into different episodes to fit the scene. When I say amazing I mean lyrically and vocally, it was a great bonus.The art\'s relatively pretty and satisfying; I feel there is a slight bit of fan service for Shino fan\'s.

It is not necessary to ship them or anything to feel their caring relationships.The anime have just the right amount of action, drama, and funny moments.

Its really well made...and easy on the eyes. the soundtrack is pretty nice not really catchy but in the moments in the anime, the music is quite pleasing,overall:Give the this anime a try its pretty good, fair warning there is quite a bit of Bromance and easy on the eyes. the soundtrack is pretty nice not really catchy but in the moments in the anime, the music is quite pleasing,overall:Give the this anime a try its pretty good, fair warning there is quite a bit of Bromance"", 'I was pleasantly surprised with this anime! Fair warning that it takes a few episodes to really get into it. Honestly, the first episode was not the greatest and it starts to pick up around the third or fourth. It REALLY gets good around episode nine. I know that is a while, but luckily there is a second season so you can fully consider yourself invested at a good point.Story- 7/10; I gave this a pretty low score because sometimes the plot was incredibly boring. I still can\'t tell you exactly what is going on at any given point and I actually don\'t even...understand the curse on Shino. I also have literally no idea what half of them are talking about with the curse. The truth is, what keeps you interested are the character relationships, interesting dialogue, comedic moments, and the adventurous vibe.Art - 10/10; Literal perfection!! This art is peak anime in my opinion. It\'s my favorite time of design on the characters and the aesthetics were chef\'s kiss. I found myself just enjoying the visuals in several scenes.Sound - 10/10. Wow the music! Haunting. Goosebumps. Those are words that come to mind. I can\'t put into words how gorgeous the music is. Some scenes just elevated to the heavens with the sounds. Especially during emotional scenes or scenic images, the music pops out. I swear you will come to enjoy this show just fo the music and that\'s totally okay.Character - 9/10; I loved Sousuke & Shino\'s relationship to death. They are the heart of the show and really fuel all the events. Sadly, the other characters are not memorable enough... I literally can\'t even remember their name. They all are white haired and have identical voices and personalities, but I still enjoyed their presence. I just don\'t feel like they pushed the plot forward in any way. I also didn\'t like the female characters at all. Sousuke and Shino are the main reason I watched.Enjoyment - 9/10; Seeing as I binged all 13 episodes in one day, I seriously enjoyed this!!! Not a 10 because I found myself losing focus when it got boring, but I definitely can\'t deny that I was really interested in the plot. There were certain plot twists that really shocked me, and other times when I just shrugged it off. Overall, however, this was a really fun show.9/10 all the way. i find it hard to say 10/10 because I reserve that kind of rating for an immaculate show and this definitely had its flaws. It takes a while to get interesting and it loses focus plenty of times. There were some filler scenes that annoyed me, and certain characters that were empty space.In hindsight, I seriously think you should watch this! It is super enjoyable.BL: There is DEFINITE BL in this. Why is this not tagged shounen-ai? It should be. It\'s not the kind of BL that will aggravate you and it\'s not really ""fan service"". It actually seriously fits into the plot and makes sense. They are outright bisexual or gay in characterization so it isn\'t baiting either.

Our conversation led to a discussion about the characters, which is when I brought up ""Genpachi"". It turned out the character in Ten is named ""Ginji"", which left me with some very important questions... Just who the hell is Genpachi? Where did I get that name from? It was quite troubling. I Googled ""Genpachi"" and found out about this anime.To sum it up, this anime is all over the place. It\'s just a mess. The story starts off with some people dying in a fire, then some...mystery man hands a crying girl a katana with the opportunity to live instead of die. From that day forth, a girl becomes a guy, a man and dog get fused (he gets convenient transformation powers), and the girl forgets everything about the incident while the dead girl/boy shoulders the responsibility. Or at least that\'s what I made of it.They live a simple life in some town. The boy has a pet Niizuma Eiji (literally), he\'s friends with some river god and frog master, and he gets some fuzzy eyeball that he can\'t get rid of. Meanwhile, the church has kidnapped the girl, so they must go to town and get her back. Never mind, she went there of her own free will. By the way, there\'s an evil church of monks torturing a guy who slit his own throat and shot himself in the head. Somebody save him! Too late, he turned into some demon and is going to eat the boy. Or at least that\'s what we thought. The monks followed after him and fired off a bunch of arrows, resulting in our brave heroes falling into the river and the monks giving up on the chase. I dunno what happened to that old frog dude, but the show is now about some sort of dog fetish. Luckily, the guy who kidnapped the girl is a good guy and he finished off the evil monk. Suicide guy and his bro are now shirtless at the battlescene. I\'m not sure why, but they just are. All\'s well that ends well.I just want to emphasize the senseless script in this show again. The boy detects enemies, so he turns his crow into a sword and swings the door open to reveal that they\'re surrounded by the evil monks wielding bows and arrows. He is the only one with a weapon at this point and you think he\'s gonna be a hero. Someone else kicks up a floor board to reveal some hidden katanas and he dispenses them to everyone else. The boy steps back and lets the big boys handle things, then the dog fusion guy holds the boy\'s hand and runs off to safety. They spend the remainder of the battle being absent.Honestly, what the fuck just happened? He went from courageous hero to indecisive punk to molested little boy all within the span of a few minutes. How did this happen?The adult male characters in this show are pretty. The setting is some traditional Japanese era where trains and industry have just been introduced. Cool setting and pretty characters, that\'s about it. The animation is subpar, especially when the animals are talking (their mouths just stay open and sounds come out).This show also puts a ton of effort into having characters react to things in the opposite way you\'d expect them to, which is supposed to be funny. Now laugh! Basically, if you\'re gonna watch this show, you should start it up on some stupid whim like I did. That way, you won\'t feel cheated when you find out the plot was written on similarly stupid whims.Seriously, I couldn\'t watch the whole thing.

Amagami SS+ Plus,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11235/Amagami_SS__Plus,"[""Amagami SS+ Plus is the second season to the show Amagami SS. This review will try to cater to any viewer, whether you watched to first season or not. Therefore, there are no spoilers. Also another thing to note, most of this review was formulated before the show finished airing. Because none of my thoughts have changed since the writing of this review to the very end, I added an extra paragraph at the end of my initial review for any thoughts I figured you guys would want to know, rather than rewrite the whole review.To recap, let's briefly jump back to the concept of...the first season. Amagami SS was a story of a guy named Tachibana Junichi that got stood up by his date on Christmas Eve two years ago. In the present, Junichi is very melancholy about his love life, but is presented with many ways to get the date he was never able to get.Basically, the story, which runs in omnibus format, is about a guy named Junichi, who technically dates six or seven girls leading up to Christmas Eve. However the story itself runs, in the best way I can describe it, as if it has parallel universes. So no, he is not dating multiple girls at the same time... technically. Specifically, the story, which is divided in to 4 episode arcs per girl, highlights the different stories that come with Junichi's relationships with each of the six girls to hopefully get the Christmas Eve date he was not able to get beforehand. To specify even more, aftereach arc ends, time resets to a time prior to the days leading up to Christmas Eve and another girl gets to be with him.Saying all that, Amagami SS+ Plus season/show is run in the same format as the previous but in a 12 episode format - 2 episode arcs for each of the 6 girls (though it seems as if MyAnimeList is not that sure of the episode count). The story, while not necessarily kicking off right where each arc in the first ended, adds on to those stories. That said, because of the unique nature of the show, and because it is a direct sequel, going through the first season is a must to watch SS+ Plus.Without spoiling anyone (those who have not entered the whole series series included), I'll just say that the story is nothing too major, and personally and quite frankly, with the exception of Sakurai Rihoko's arc and maybe one or two more at best that may show up in the next few weeks (the show is still airing at the moment this review is being made), the story is not anything too mindblowing - I cannot stress this enough in this review. As a whole, because of the unique composition of Amagami SS, the second season sort of suffers in that each arc is only composed of 2 episodes. This is frankly not enough to write up any major developments to add to the stories established in the first season. Actually, to put it simply, these episodes were probably made just for the fans who were literally dying to see more of the show.Despite some of downsides I see to the show, I do enjoy it, but I don't commit to it as much as the richer experiences from other 12 episode shows. You will find some if not most of the happy and romantic qualities that the first season had. In regards to conflicts, they, again, are not as drawn out as well as in the first season, but are a decent watch to say the least. I give the show credit for what its worth.As someone who watched the first season and liked it a decent amount, I though SS+ Plus was good at best. It did what I expected it to do - maybe it added a bit more depth to each of the characters here and there, but I honestly did not find it that necessary to watch - again, apart from one or two good arcs. That's not saying you shouldn't watch it. It's just saying don't expect too much out of it. If you enjoyed and had fun watching Amagami SS, then SS+ Plus will most definitely be a good watch as well. If you have not watched watched the first season, all I can say is that you will feel completely alienated if you watch SS+. While there is some substance for new viewers, it would probably make you think worse of the show, which is not that fair. Take note of that first season before you judge.*Update after show's end: I can honestly say that the show overall was good. However most of my thoughts did not change over the course of the three or four weeks since the making of this review. Additionally, I'd like to add that Haruka's arc was, although predictable, a really fun and satisfying arc overall, although I'm not sure if I can agree with the show ending with Miya's mini-arc. If the show ended with Haruka, that would have been much better than dragging along the season longer than it should. If anything, this should have been a DVD/BD extra, not an extension of the season run - but I digress. the first season.

A young man who got stood up on a Christmas date, leaving him traumatized and afraid to fall in love. Two years later, he'll encounter a certain woman. A woman who'll bring him back up to his feet and learn to love once again.Amagami SS is based on a PS2 Dating sim and is viewed in an omnibus format. Basically, there are 4 episodes (For...the first season) for each of the 6 heroines and those 4 episodes tell what happens if Junichi goes after a specific girl.Amagami SS+ is the second season and it shows the events that took place after each of the first season's arcs. So I suppose you can say it's basically an epilogue to the first series.The story itself is pretty much cliche. But I can't really blame anyone. The series is based off a dating sim. A traumatizing event in the past like that has probably been used before in other dating sim/anime. But I do find each of the story arcs to be romantic, cute and sweet (Except for Rihoko's first season arc. I was quite disappointed they didn't end up with each other. The second season Rihoko arc makes up for it though) The show is pretty light on the heart and it doesn't cause much heart-wrenching feels (Which is good in my case 'cause I have a weak heart)The characters are enjoyable in their own way. They're pretty unique from each other and each of them has their own charm. Though I have to say Junichi is a tad bit generic. He's the average high-school student. But as each story develops, he does get a bit unique (Depending on which story arc he's in) But I like him. He's childish, supportive, loving, caring, a bit clueless, reckless and he'd go out of his way to make the girl he loves happy. He reminds me of me, sometimes.The art is pretty good. Though the quality of the art did drop at certain points like at the start of Nakata, Sae's arc. The animation is pretty smooth. No complaints there. The sound and the voice acting was also very good. I especially loved Morishima, Haruka and Tachibana, Miya's voice acting for some reason.My favorite heroine will have to be either Sakurai, Rihoko or Tanamachi, Kaoru. Rihoko is bubbly cute and adorable. She's innocent and honest and has a big appetite. Kaoru is mischievous but also very hardworking.Overall, this is a pretty enjoyable anime. Cute romance here and there. Some slight feels, but that makes the romance all the more satisfying. And you'll enjoy each of the heroines arcs because their own stories are pretty unique from one another. the first season) for each of the 6 heroines and those 4 episodes tell what happens if Junichi goes after a specific girl.Amagami SS+ is the second season and it shows the events that took place after each of the first season's arcs.

What exactly is ""happily ever after""? Amagami SS+, the sequel to the school romance anime, Amagami SS, gives viewers a glimpse of the lives of the six heroines after the conclusion of the first season. Not much has changed in between seasons - artwork, characters, seiyūs and staff all remained more or less the same - so fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this continuation. With that being said, although Plus is a sequel, knowledge of the first season is not necessarily mandatory as the basic premise of the story can...be grasped quickly.Art (8/10)Simplicity is almost always a good thing. Having clean art with a good amount of detail is generally well-accepted, especially when it comes to a series like Amagami SS in which the art is not focused on too much. I found the character designs to be very normal and plain, but that isn\'t necessarily a bad thing. The style is something I see very often but that is what makes it easy for my eyes to digest. Backgrounds that are not too fancy which don\'t detract my attention from what\'s happening is very much positive. AIC did a great job with the animation once again.Characters (7/10)Let\'s be honest here, the girls of Amagami SS are far from realistic. Now I may be wrong, but I\'m pretty sure there are barely any girls in the world who would want someone like Junichi as their boyfriend. The guy, in many ways, is the reincarnation of a human male\'s inner desires; he doesn\'t know the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Not only that, but he\'s also a blatant pervert and idiotic protagonist. Despite all this, he ends up getting the girl at the end, which is a big reason why I think the characters are unrealistic. Nonetheless, the girls do develop during their own arcs. You can easily see that, after they started dating Junichi, their personalities have changed. While I would\'ve preferred Junichi to not have been such an irritable character, I believe his current personality was used on purpose, in order to enable viewers of similar traits to be able to relate to him and to gain hope (i.e. ""if someone like Junichi can get a beautiful girlfriend, then so can I!"").Sound (8/10)azusa returns for a second season with two more new songs - an OP and an ED - both of which I liked. They also fit their respective positions very well; the OP was high-energy, readying the viewer for the episode to come while the mellow ED wrapped out the episode nicely. BGM was the same as in the first season. Nothing in particular was memorable but it was there and did its job of enhancing scenes without being too obtrusive. No changes in voice acting since all the characters are still the same. Notable seiyūs include Itō Shizuka (Morishima Haruka, Katsura Hinagiku [Hayate no Gotoku!]), Yukana (Nanasaki Ai, C.C. [Code Geass]), and Satō Rina (Tanamachi Kaoru, Misaka Mikoto [To Aru Kagaku no Railgun]). Unfortunately, there were no insert songs unlike in season one.Story (8/10)The omnibus format follows from the first season into the second. Each girl gets their own two-episode arc that introduces a problem before solving it. The purpose of these problems is to strengthen each of the girls\' relationship with Junichi. It\'s realistic in a sense because real life relationships always contain ups and downs, even if the couple has just started dating. The different stories evoke a wide variety of emotions and appeal to viewers of diverse preferences. Personally, I thought some of the arcs were too rushed as there were only two episodes available for the problem to be introduced and solved.Overall (8/10)As a fan of Amagami SS, I definitely enjoyed Plus. Seeing my favorite Amagami girls in action again was a real treat. I would\'ve liked for it to be 24 episodes but, alas, you can\'t have everything go your way. At this point, I think it\'s safe to say that this is going to be the last of Amagami SS, in terms of TV series. It\'s been a good 38 episodes and I\'m satisfied with how things went. I would recommend this show to those who want to watch a nice, relaxing shōnen romantic comedy. You won\'t be disappointed! be grasped quickly.Art (8/10)Simplicity is almost always a good thing.

Seeing my favorite Amagami girls in action again was a real treat. I would\'ve liked for it to be 24 episodes but, alas, you can\'t have everything go your way. At this point, I think it\'s safe to say that this is going to be the last of Amagami SS, in terms of TV series. It\'s been a good 38 episodes and I\'m satisfied with how things went. I would recommend this show to those who want to watch a nice, relaxing shōnen romantic comedy. You won\'t be disappointed!', 'AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH DAMNIT!!!!!!! ヽ(ｏ`皿′ｏ)ﾉPardon my French. ಠ_ರೃThis anime series has been sucking me in since the very beginning. I get attached to the different plot arcs and each of the girls. I also find myself having a very hard time when any of the arcs endings.Take this for example. In Amagami SS the ending of Sae, Ai, and Haruka were a bit easier to feel ""accomplished"" or that the story had an end. They each ended with a scene that was pretty definitive that Junichi made a home run. I do not mean for this to sound perverted or that I\'m asking for a hentai. I...just want you to consider how in a rout anime such as this, where each girl has only a fraction of the season for their arcs, need to get you attached and leave you fulfilled within that period. (〜￣▽￣)〜With how much fanservice is given, it does not feel right to end on more of the same. You need to end an arc with something that takes their relationship to the next level. In your average anime these endings would be satisfying indeed. However they get to third base rather quickly in almost every arc before the final episode. ಠ_ಠWith a second season they are giving two episodes to each heroine to basically put the cherry on top of a wonderful story. Or pop it. Pardon my humor, I simply couldn\'t resist after that being the main topic of my review.I had much to look forward to, however with Ayatsuji\'s arc ending I do not feel satisfied. I did enjoy the episodes very muchly. It is just rather awkward because I feel like I\'m getting more of the same. (ノ#-_-)ノAgain, not a bad thing.

(≧∇≦)', 'Here is my first review, so please go easy on me....Introduction : when i saw this anime for first time, i know this anime would be awesome, why? since the artwork and how beautiful the girl in it... and i think thats enough reason for me to try watching it.STORY : 9/10Since this anime focussing on love story, i would say this anime present an interesting love story than another love anime. I mean, come on. who doesnt like to see a MC dating into 6 six different girls and see the lovey dovey talks between them? and absolutely i am the one who loves...to see MC dating into the girl who bump into him. The main point is the story  in this anime is so unique, you wouldn\'t find an anime like this anymore.ARTWORK 10/10Like i said before, this artwork is the reason why i am watching this anime. the artwork for the people or the scenes is absolutely stunning (especially the girls, lol), The characters are drawn good, it was very interesting to see.SOUND 10/10I really love the opening song from Amagami SS plus, its certainly presents the story, and also the voice for the character is also lovely, its just the seiyuu really putting their feelings in the actor, oh, the background music is also really fit with the anime.CHARACTER 10/10The character of this anime is the first one i caught. the six different girls with different characters and also the main character guy who is have the same feeling with the real man (like have a naughty thinking), The interesting point is which the feelings that the MC has is like the other us. We, man, always have a dirty thinking if we\'re alone with the girl.OVERALL 10/10I really recommend to all people who loves to see a light love story,without any complex story to see this anime. you didnt have to think too much when you see this anime. you just need to enjoy the show and said ""Wow, Thats very lovely"" to see MC dating into the girl who bump into him.

While I for one, enjoyed the Kaoru/Haruka/Class Rep arcs in season one, I found the others ""ok"", or ""decent enough"".In season 2, they essentially fix this problem. Even for the characters I previously didn\'t care about, I found their stories at least moderately engaging.It\'s feel good ""happily ever after"" stories that surprisingly, were better than the the original ""how""...of how these characters got together. of how these characters got together.', 'As the summary says, Amagami SS+ is the second seaso of Amagai SS.From just the first episode alone, it seems as though we will be getting more character dvelopment between each of the 6 protagonist females and the main protagonist male.  However, the story seems like it will take a differant route from the first season\'s ""getting the girl and their future"" to a more ""events between getting the girl and their future.  Since we know the series will be only 12 episodes long, it is indicated by the words ""first and second -half""  in the title of the first episode and...preview that each of the 6 female protagnists will likely be 2 episdes each.Since this is a second season, I feel it would be necessary to watch the first season since it seems like they are futher building on the chracters and teir relationships from the first season.The first episode was very well done with the typical boyfriend/girl friend interation and ecchi shenanians between them, but there is an added tension thanks to he addition of side charcters.The story tus far is good in that it is conistant with the first season story line with a few more plot twists now that the main storyline isnt about trying to get te girl. The art is pretty much the same as the first season, but still great.  The sound in my opinion is better and the op and ed songs are fitting. The charactes are still as entertaining as ever thus making it fairly enjoyable.Overall the first espisode really leaves a great impression and makes you want to watch more to see what drama will unfold, thus making it a must see; especially if you were a fan of the first season and and even if you werent you should still give it a shot. preview that each of the 6 female protagnists will likely be 2 episdes each.Since this is a second season, I feel it would be necessary to watch the first season since it seems like they are futher building on the chracters and teir relationships from the first season.The first episode was very well done with the typical boyfriend/girl friend interation and ecchi shenanians between them, but there is an added tension thanks to he addition of side charcters.The story tus far is good in that it is conistant with the first season story line with a few more plot twists now that the main storyline isnt about trying to get te girl.

Alright.There\'s a nice mini-story for each of the girls, which serve to more fully flesh out their relationships with Junichi. Honestly, these episodes should have been stuffed into the first season to make things feel more complete. If I could go to my past self, I\'d tell him to watch the 4-episodes arcs of Season 1 and then the 2-episode arcs of Season 2 for each girl together. Seriously. Try it out.The art still has me...going ""meh."" The background art is completely fine, but I just straight up dislike the art style for the characters. Meh. Same as the first season.The characters are pretty much the same as the first season, but it\'s nice to see how they get along with Junichi after the fact.Overall, I definitely enjoyed this season more than the first one. If you really liked Season 1 of Amagami SS, you\'ll love this season. If you didn\'t, Season 2 might redeem it for you, but probably not. If Season 1 was Oreos, Season 2 would be the milk. A typical vanilla cake of an anime with cute sprinkles on top gives Amagami SS+ Plus a final score of 7. going ""meh.""

A typical vanilla cake of an anime with cute sprinkles on top gives Amagami SS+ Plus a final score of 7.', 'It\'s very surprising to me,when I read the information at MAL that the second season of Amagami SS was planned back then.I mean,well...the story still can be developed remembering the previous season leave us when Tachibana Junichi still at 2nd grade,but it really is still surprising.Why?Cause this anime\'s storyline goes in a same situation,setting,and time but it kept repeated with the same male character with six different heroine and in several heroine,we can watch a glimpse of their future after the male character conquered their heart.So,will it be wright to make a sequel of it,despite we already watch their future self?The answer is YES.It fulfill...my high expectation.To be honest,the word sequel itself is a bit worry me.We can see many anime quality drop instantly after their sequel was aired and it\'s often that the previous season quality was much better than the next.Amagami SS first season itself,for me,was quite impressive.Well,it\'s a bit like playing an automatic visual novel,but it still good.Six girl with a unique and different character from each other,yeah that\'s what made this show interesting.So,basically Amagami SS+ is the continuation of the story from the first season.The times seta several month after Tachibana Junichi confess his love to each heroine.I\'m a bit confusedabout how to make this review since I\'m usually make a review mainly based on the plot.But,this one is exceptional cause it has six different plot.So I will review it from the each heroinecharacter and their development after the previous season.About Tachibana?Well just ignorehim.His stil as pervert,dull,stupid,and useless as usual.Oh god,what kind of Lady Luck thatpossessed this extremely lucky dude?All he\'s thinking about is how to get a quick and nicesex with all of the heroine.And what makes me despise him even more,all of the heroine almostalways agree to his stupid pervy request from time to time like,""May I sleep on your belly?"",""Can I kiss your knee?(in season one)"".What the hell,fuck!Girls,please don\'t be a slut.If they gonna make the third season of Amagami SS,I\'m personally request his death.Almost all of the action and the development of their relationship come from the heroine.It lookslike they encouraging Tachibana to take a deeper action cause he\'s way too dull to be a boyfriend.In this 2nd season the amount of the episode has been reduced to only 13 episode.So each arc have two episode and one addition for a filler in the last episode.Not much different from the previous season actually,eventhough it has a shorter episode,but I do like this one better.The heroines are way more attractive and responsive than in the first season.It make them a lot more appealing.Maybe it\'s because they already in a phase where they\'ve become a lover so they can talk about their feelings more seriously and honestly than before they date each other.Now let\'s continue to the heroines character.There\'s a bit change in the second season.The arc got a reverse in their turn to appear atthe show.So,Tsukasa is the first one and Haruka is the last one.Ayatsuji Tsukasa Arc:Don\'t judge the book by its cover.I bet you know this phrase already.It suit Tsukasa extremelywell.On her outer appearance you can see her as a respectable person,nice,perfect,and a hardworker.But after you succeeded to penetrate her heart,you will get a shocking turn around in her attitude.She\'s a dominant and an oppressor.There\'s not even a single guy in the world want to be dominated by their girl so badly.And what makes it worse,she elected to become the student council president which make her bossy attitude become worse.She express her love to Tachibana with her cynical behavior.To be honest,I do like her figure.Long black silky  hair,a pair of gorgeous black eye filled with spirit,slim body,and a pretty nice breast eventhough it\'s not too damn big.I guess what make this anime rated under 8 point is because of her.She make this show dropin its content.Want to know why?Here\'s my three reason:First,she\'s way too dominant.Second,she\'s a hot girl but she\'s not cute.Three,her arc is boring.I feel like a de ja vu when Iwatch her arc.Not particularly too different from the first season so it\'s kinda plain.She got a job and position and Tachibana help her with her job,they got into an obstacle,they quell it and voila,the ending kiss!I will give this arc approximately a 3 or 4 for theoverall point.Tsukasa did NOT satisfy me.Sakurai Rihoko Arc:Hmm,what will I say about Rihoko.Everytime I look in her eyes I always remember about my dog.Suppose she\'s not a glutton and have a very strict diet to lose her weight,maybe I will lostmy interest to her.Her chubbyness is so sexy and it\'s so appealing.Forget about her breastfor a moment and you will find an innocent,pure,and cute 10 years old girl.I won\'t say that her arc is good but it\'s not bad either.It\'s fine.In her arc,you will watchher act very unadorned and hesitating about how she will deliver her feeling toward Tachibana.The ending is too simple and meh meh meh.So I will give it a 6.Nanasaki Ai Arc:If you ask me about which heroine love Tachibana the most,I will say it\'s Ai.If I were lookingfor a girlfriend,I\'m definitely will searching for someone with her character.Well,isn\'t it obviousthat she will give Tachibana a lot of love??Her name itself is Ai (love).A sporty girl,witha tomboyish appearance.But don\'t be deceived,she\'s very soft and fragile inside.She\'s the opposite from Tsukasa.The only thing that bother me about her is why did the creator made her to be the one with the flattest breast?The other heroine seems pretty stuffed,especially Rihoko,Haruka,and Sae.Kaoru and Tsukasa is a mediocre.And Ai is the most pitiful in the boob ratio contest.In her arc in Amagami SS+,Ai and Tachibana couldn\'t meet each other too much cause Tachibana in a busy term to prepare for college.She feels very lonely when Tachibana is not in her side.Oh poor Ai.Eventhough she looks very sad and crying,she\'s still look pretty and tryto face it rigidly.I like her faithfullness for Tachibana in this arc,so I will give it 8.Tanamachi Kaoru Arc:I love it!Probably the girl that I like the most,wrapped with the nicest story.Did you realizethat Kaoru is the only arc where its setting is off from the school?That\'s what make thisarc the greatest.It is an anime with a school as a main setting but it\'s not a rule to makethe story always take place in the school right?Kaoru\'s arc definitely gives a refreshing airto me.The story feels like going very natural and smooth.It gives you something new.Well,shortly the couple decide to take a vacation together in order to develop their relationshiptoward something more serious.Because they short in money,finally they decided to takea cheap and fun night touring in a bus.Then,funny and complex thing started one after another.Face it with a love power guys,and you will get a well deserved ending.Two things that I love from Kaoru: First,she\'s very energetic and sometimes a bit bold anddaring.I like this side of Kaoru.There\'s not much girl out there like her in this era.She can live the situation up anytime,anywhere with her action.Second,she\'s a talkative girl.I like talkative chick cause they can talk their heart content honestly and they can beso pure and it\'s nice to share our mind with a girl like Kaoru.This is the funkiest arc.She\'s cute,her attitude is great,her hair is sexy,so I will give Kaoru 10.Nakata Sae Arc:This heroine.....an angel I guess.Always positive and always looks adorable and super cute.Not to mention her bust super size.I will like her if she\'s act a bit more of her age.Seriously,she really like a kid.Her gesture,her voice,her hair,and her way to talk.Way toocute for a highschool student.But that doesn\'t matter anymore.Her arc is one of the best.In this Arc,Nakata Sae will be tested to be a leader.She will handle the founder festivalcommittee.Well,she indeed showing a progress from the previous season.She doesn\'t seethe cafeteria lady as a vending machine anymore (lol,I wonder why it have to be a vendingmachine?).But realizing her lack of social interaction in her community,Miya,her best friend,whom also Tachibana\'s little sister,decided to vote her to become the leader of the founderfestival community.It sure not an easy problem.Her maturity and sense of responsibility reallyis developing very well in this arc.We can see from her dedication,she really into this and don\'twanna let everyone down.Tachibana was really useless in this arc.He wasn\'t help Sae at all.For me,he even adding another trouble for Sae.Yeah,he did something unnecessary as the narrator said.I won\'t say what cause I\'m afraid I\'ll spoil it.Watch the show and you will know that I didn\'t say anything wrong about Tachibana being so damn useless.Aside from Tachibana\'s foolishness,this arc is good.But actually,I want more of her breastexposure.I will give it 8.Morishima Haruka Arc:The hottest girl among the heroine.Ohh,she really is sexy.Look at her beautiful black hair.It\'s very smooth and a bit wavy touch on the tip of it makes it even better.Really an ojou-samatype of girl.And her bright blue color of her eyes make her always looks energetic.A british-japanese mix.What a nice combination wasn\'t it?I think that the probability of a guy like Tachibana dating a girl like Haruka in the realworld is about 0,00000001%,except if you are lucky enough to bump her in front of your classand ""accidentally"" groping her breast and triggering a flag with her like in a genericromance anime :p.To be honest,I like this arc second best to Kaoru\'s.The reason is:1.Haruka didn\'t exaggerate and too aggressive in expressing her love to Tachibana.She actmore of her age and show a calm love plus maturity in facing Tachibana.2.There is an appearance of girl who claim to be Haruka\'s relative from England.She reallylooks like Haruka except for her eyes and hair color.It\'s a british mode of Haruka.That\'sdouble kawai,made me enjoy the arc even more.Her Japanese-British accent really cute.3.Finally,Tachibana got his ball as a man.You will see why at the end of the arc.It\'s a great arc,so I will give it 9.Overall for Amagami SS+ it\'s 9 for me.Well,it\'s not actually far better than the first season.In fact,you will get a pretty much the same feeling from watching it.I don\'t even know why Igive it a 9 :p.But if you are looking for a nicer and clearer ending in each of the arc,this is it for you! my high expectation.To be honest,the word sequel itself is a bit worry me.We can see many anime quality drop instantly after their sequel was aired and it\'s often that the previous season quality was much better than the next.Amagami SS first season itself,for me,was quite impressive.Well,it\'s a bit like playing an automatic visual novel,but it still good.Six girl with a unique and different character from each

progress from the previous season.She doesn\'t seethe cafeteria lady as a vending machine anymore (lol,I wonder why it have to be a vendingmachine?).But realizing her lack of social interaction in her community,Miya,her best friend,whom also Tachibana\'s little sister,decided to vote her to become the leader of the founderfestival community.It sure not an easy problem.Her maturity and sense of responsibility reallyis developing very well in this arc.We can see from her dedication,she really into this and don\'twanna let everyone down.Tachibana was really useless in this arc.He wasn\'t help Sae at all.For me,he even adding another trouble for Sae.Yeah,he did something unnecessary as the narrator said.I won\'t say what cause I\'m afraid I\'ll spoil it.Watch the show and you will know that I didn\'t say anything wrong about Tachibana being so damn useless.Aside from Tachibana\'s foolishness,this arc is good.But actually,I want more of her breastexposure.I will give it 8.Morishima Haruka Arc:The hottest girl among the heroine.Ohh,she really is sexy.Look at her beautiful black hair.It\'s very smooth and a bit wavy touch on the tip of it makes it even better.Really an ojou-samatype of girl.And her bright blue color of her eyes make her always looks energetic.A british-japanese mix.What a nice combination wasn\'t it?I think that the probability of a guy like Tachibana dating a girl like Haruka in the realworld is about 0,00000001%,except if you are lucky enough to bump her in front of your classand ""accidentally"" groping her breast and triggering a flag with her like in a genericromance anime :p.To be honest,I like this arc second best to Kaoru\'s.The reason is:1.Haruka didn\'t exaggerate and too aggressive in expressing her love to Tachibana.She actmore of her age and show a calm love plus maturity in facing Tachibana.2.There is an appearance of girl who claim to be Haruka\'s relative from England.She reallylooks like Haruka except for her eyes and hair color.It\'s a british mode of Haruka.That\'sdouble kawai,made me enjoy the arc even more.Her Japanese-British accent really cute.3.Finally,Tachibana got his ball as a man.You will see why at the end of the arc.It\'s a great arc,so I will give it 9.Overall for Amagami SS+ it\'s 9 for me.Well,it\'s not actually far better than the first season.In fact,you will get a pretty much the same feeling from watching it.I don\'t even know why Igive it a 9 :p.But if you are looking for a nicer and clearer ending in each of the arc,this is it for you!', ""SS Amgami +Plus is the second season to SS Amagami( My favorite anime). SS Amagami Plus takes place right after the first season. We get more character development between the Junichi and the 6 Main girls in this season than last season. We are introduced to the supporting characters that we didn't see in the last season here. The are trying to interfere with their Junichi's relationship with said Main girl of the eps. Cannot wait to see more episodes : ) "", '----------Disclaimer----------The following review is mostly spoiler-free (except for two marked locations), and is meant for users who are curious about whether to watch the show or not. While I write reviews with this focus, and the goal of presenting the show with little bias, it is impossible to write a completely unbiased review. Feel free to disagree with any of my opinions, and ultimately decide for yourself how you feel about the show after watching it yourself!Additionally, due to this being the second season of Amagami SS, it should go without saying that you need to watch season 1 of the show before even considering...or understanding this review. My review is based off of my first season review, therefore it would be good to check that out if you want full critiques of the show as a whole.---------Positives---------- More DaisukiDid you love Amagami SS? Then Amagami SS+ Plus is a no brainer. It extends the stories of each of the characters for 2 additional episodes each, providing a small conflict + resolution to deepen the relationships depicted in the first season. I consider this less of an independent ""season"", but rather a continuation, addition, or extended epilogue to the series as a whole. Call it a ""love letter"" from the creators of the show to its fans. In any case, it\'s very welcome from me!- Added Screen TimeOne of the common complaints about Amagami SS was its relatively short arcs (4 episodes), which initially seems like Amagami SS+ Plus just exacerbates. But instead of being separate instances, the combination of both seasons (ending up with ~6 episodes on each character) helps those doubts melt away, satisfying many small quibbles about the characters of the first season. We get to see more depth to all the characters and their relationship to Junichi, which only serves to make you fall in love with the couplings all over again!- Excellent FinaleOne of the key strengths of Amagami SS was its ability to flesh out characters even when not in their own respective arcs. While the final (non-arc) episode is heavy on the fan-service due to its setting, it fulfills my final desire to see many of the main cast interact with each other in new and exciting ways. Move aside Junichi, I want a show with just the girls!THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS! SCROLL TO NEGATIVES SECTION TO CONTINUE SPOILER FREE!- Rihoko\'s ArcThe first season\'s Rihoko arc was a complete tease, and many felt unsatisfied with its ending. I will not give away the ending of Rihoko\'s continuation this season, but it was handled a lot more satisfyingly this season and rounded out into an excellent 6-episode arc. This was the story that the arc was originally meant to be, and I\'m happy we could all see it through.SPOILERS HAVE ENDED---------Negatives---------- MC Fatigue Pt. 2Junichi Tachibana is approximately EXACTLY the same as the first season. As such, there are many positives and negatives to his character, which balance out into a frustrating, but ultimately lovable MC. Some arcs had him be a little less facepalm worthy than others, but don\'t expect him to suddenly change things up from the first season! Haha.THIS SECTION CONTAINS SPOILERS! SCROLL TO CONCLUSION TO CONTINUE SPOILER FREE!- Kaoru\'s ArcThis is personal preference, but in my opinion Kaoru\'s mini arc this season was a huge disappointment. After an incredibly strong showing in Season 1 (tied for 2nd best), her character felt incredibly confused and inconsistent. The first seasons presented a very positive tsundere image, with self denial but ultimately a submission to her feelings. This season felt like she slipped into every single bad tsundere characteristic. On top of that, she had a very legitimate issue to grapple with (how do you effectively transition from being close friends to lovers), which never actually got resolved! They fought a bunch, made up, and suddenly it\'s like: ""Oh that problem\'s magically solved too!"". Whaaat?! Sorry Kaoru, I love your character but with such a strong cast of characters, this will affect your standing greatly in my mind. Don\'t worry though, we always have Season 1 re-watches ;~;SPOILERS HAVE ENDED----------Conclusion----------Amagami SS+ Plus, besides having a classically silly anime name, is more of the same. It continues to flesh out the roles the characters play, and satisfies fans\' desires to see more of their favourite characters and relationship dynamics. If you enjoyed the first season, there\'s no reason why you wouldn\'t love the second season just as much. It has all of the elements I loved, and the quibbles that nagged at me, all wrapped up in a nice little series of epilogues. Some stories got better, some series got a little bit less good, but most of them stayed consistently fantastic. Even the arcs I ""liked the least"" are solid 8s or 9s, which should tell you about the absurd quality of the girls in this show.

Having watched the first season and enjoying it completely, I found this one lacking somewhat in character progression.I'll try not to write too much of a spoiler here. Each included story, as has been said, details the afterevents some months further along, of the main protagonist's (Tachibana Junichi) choices in selecting each of the first series' heroines. While I found nothing particularly thrilling or disappointing in the stories themselves, I thought it rather confusing that, after being in a close...(very, in some cases) relationship with most of the girls for an extended period of time, why they (mostly Junichi) still behave as if they barely know each other? The awkwardness, shyness, nervousness, and general elements of inhibition were typical and expected in the first series, as Junichi got to know each of the girls, but why are these feelings replayed almost exactly the same way again? This is particularly evident with Junichi; in this respect, I found his behavior almost unbelievable, and definitely unrealistic. Perhaps with only two episodes per character, there's just not enough explanation.That being said, I really did like the way that some of the visual novel endings based upon the first series, that did not appear in the anime of said series, found their way into this anime series. With both animes watched a few times, my ideas about the best girl for Junichi haven't changed: Kaoru.

I love this series that much.Amagami SS+ is the second season of Amagami SS.To put it bluntly it gives you more time with your favourite characters. It serves to show what happens with certain girls after the relationship is established as well as to actually establish the relationship with the one that got left out.The music was excellent as always.The characters were perfect and believable....All in all this is the standard which all dramatic slice of lifers should be measured against.I cannot honestly say more about it.If you enjoyed Amagami SS then you'll love this one.Simple as that and I love simple.

The plot continues the same but with a continuation that surpasses its predecessor Each part of a heroine speaks of the relationship of a boy with a different girl, type a universe for each type of relation of the protagonist with a heroine.

It would have been better if they had done 4 eps per arc again as they did originally as i feel they would have been able to tell more like they did in the original and like i said to me it feels a bit rushed.Also it would...have been nicer if it was longer and should more of a development in there relationships, because from what i have seen so far even though something like 6 months or so has past, they still seem like they just recently got together.It would have been interesting to see there relationships development after the first season as was said was about getting the girl.Although I'm saying i wished it was longer and that they put more into the story it is still very good and would recommend watching this and the first season. I can only hope that they make a third season that is more like the first and that this is just a in betweener for that season were they can show them getting further in there relationship and maybe getting past difficult obstacles or something like that.Well here's hoping. :) have been nicer if it was longer and should more of a development in there relationships, because from what i have seen so far even though something like 6 months or so has past, they still seem like they just recently got together.It would have been interesting to see there relationships development after the first season as was said was about getting the girl.Although I'm saying i wished it was longer and that they put more into the story it is still very good and would recommend watching this and the first season.

I was very excited for this, because I'm always so curious to find to know what happens after the boy and the girl have become a couple.There are still many stories to tell what happens next, and I'm happy that AIC figured that out with Amagami.Story:The story centers around a High School boy who falls in love in 6 different girls.Do I see some question marks over your heads?Your maybe asking yourself; How could he possibly fall in love with 6 different girls! AIC have found...a very clever way doing this.They just do the same they do in eroge games. Make so that the main character can take different routs, so that he ends up with different girls.This in my mind is a very clever solution!Always when I watch romance anime it always ends with the girl I like the least ends up with the guy, and the girl I like most ends up heart broken.Call it the Pera curse.Characters:It's very rare that I don't dislike any of the characters when I'm either watching anime or a live series.But the characters here are very well written and modelled.

In this spotlight you can actually like it, but still it feels more like some extra not the standalone product ', ""Amagami SS had a great cast of girls to work with and it always left itself on a high note (well...5/6 times, anyways). Amagami SS+ though....while not bad (I've seen much worse in the harem genre), doesn't quite hit all the sweet spots that it's prequel series did.(+) The animation was top notch and the character designs look a lot nicer. Even with whatever qualms I have with the stories, seeing the followups on the girls is really nice. I LOVED Haruka's story and it was easily the best one, including that ending. The secondary characters were just as fun as they were before. And...we totally need more Jessica and Risa. :)(-) On the whole, I only really enjoyed one out of six scenarios, which is a little sad honestly. Just a quick thought on each of them: by far the worst was Kaoru's, since it seemed to diminish her likability in some ways. Sae's was just too weird and overly cutesy, but not terrible. Ai also lost some likability, but still kept her personality as fun as before. Rihoko got a nice resolution that I think everyone wanted. Finally, Tsukasa's (is a lovely person with nothing to hide, I swear!) was good, but it didn't work her personality into it very well.So overall, while not as charming as the first series, it's still a nice followup to the omnibus Amagami that came before it. :)As a little side note, here's a most-to-least favorite list of the girls routes this time around:#1.

The series is more of a side story than continuation of the first season but still gives the excitement that made us want more of Amagami.Story:The set-up of the story is the same as the first season where it is divided into story arcs focusing on one heroine. The sequence is different in the first season whereas the last heroine covered is the first one in this sequel. As I stated before, this more of a side story in which they show different events happening after the end of each arc on the first one. I...say it is more of a side story because there is not much development that may affect the series. But even though it is a side story, it is still good because it shows the lax side of the characters.Art:There is not much difference in the art as the first season. It is still good. The design of the heroines is the one that really stands out in the series which helps in rooting for the one. The backgrounds are also good but you most of the time, you will focus on the heroines instead.And wait, there are also fanservice if you are into that.Sound:The opening and ending are both good. They may not be as good as the first season but you can still enjoy it. It is perfect for this series. The soundtracks for the scenes are also good that it helps in taking the emotions out of you.Characters:The set of heroines are good given that there are many of them. They have different personalities that you may love or hate. In terms of character development, there is not much of it.

The stories may give yo a few laughs and gives an excitement that you want for romantic story.', 'Amagami SS was an interesting take on the harem genre, with the main character rotating through different routes spanning two seasons. Amagami SS Plus revisits lucky man Junichi\'s world with a promise of additional content. However, given that viewers from Amagami already know that Junichi is 6 out of 6 (7 out of 6 if you include OVAs), what can another season\'s worth of episodes add?I would actually classify this series as more of an OVA than a regular series, as plot-wise there isn\'t much to anticipate. As you are basically watching for more cute character interactions, this is primarily for fans of the original...Amagami series. There is minor plot attached to each of the six arcs (in almost reverse order of the original season so you have to really wait for Haruka this time) but for the most part it\'s only just enough to give reason for the character interactions. If you liked the original and still want more of your favorite gal, this is where you\'ll find it.Animation:The animation is pretty much straight out of the original, granted a few additional backgrounds and such. If you like the mildly-understated character styling of the original then you\'ll be right at home here. If you liked the romance-based scenes in the original, there are definitely a few more of those here. If you\'re looking for the ecchi scenes, you\'ll find a good deal of it in the last episode- somewhat expected from any sento/onsen episode. My only major complaint is that Risa only gets a brief cameo appearance.Sound:Unlike the original, you get one fixed OP and ED for the entire duration of the series. The OP and ED, both by the same artist, fit fairly well into the general atmosphere of the series, with the OP being a bit more upbeat. The only animation difference you\'re going to get is during the ED where different heroines mouth the phrase ""Suki dayo"". Otherwise sound is pretty much the same as the original - same BGM and same VA cast. If anything, you get even more Haruka/episode as you essentially have two Morishimas. Her Engrish is actually somewhat superior to quite a few other VAs.Story:The director here had a tough challenge. How do you fit an entire season\'s worth of character interactions without boring or confusing the viewer who pretty much already have a fixed idea of the conclusion of most of the arcs? For the most part, I was satisfied with how the stories in each arc went. They didn\'t go back and rewrite events in the original and they didn\'t pull a Kimi Ga Nozomu Eien ~ Next Season (drastic personality change). What they did do is present new circumstances under which the character personalities could shine.Each arc takes off after the events in the first season (minus the flash-forward scenes as in the case of Haruka). In some arcs, you have a continuation of dating (fights, challenges, tension...) and in others you get to finally get to the confession/dating. You even get some more of the flash-forward finality scenes, which I kind of liked. However, you really can\'t compete with the story in the first season, as it\'s not possible here to replicate the tension of the early getting to know each other period. Despite this, there\'s more than enough to keep those who liked the original watching.Character:If anything, you learn that Junichi was always a little pervy (Rihoko arc). That aside, the personalities of each girl shows through as they are pushed into new challenges, be it getting lost or getting a rival. In most cases, the interactions are a bit more static, since in most cases Junichi is already dating the girl, but the particular situations make it interesting nonetheless. Again, I\'ll be rooting for an Amagami SS Plus OVA with more Risa.Value:This is not nearly as must-watch as the original, but the additional content is worth checking out if you liked the prequel. Not all arcs are even as the endings of the first season left more room in some story lines than others. Overall, this does a good job of balancing the progress in the different arcs and giving some more screen time to some nice, familiar faces. Amagami series.

It is also spoiler free.Amagami SS is a series that tries to play romance in a different way using an omnibus format. Unfortunately it fails to deliver engaging, interesting, or otherwise fun stories for the viewers.Despite the low rating I\'m giving this series, I wouldn\'t say I hate it - I just find it incredibly boring.STORY:This is a romance anime in an omnibus format. If you are not familiar with that term, it means that there are many girls and many arcs, and each girl gets her own arc. You can think of each...arc as a parallel universe because they have their own endings and there\'s no continuity between each arc.Anyway, Because of this, it\'s hard to rate the story as a whole, but we can talk about the arcs on average. Each arc is 4 episodes long in the first season, and the second season has continuations to each arc that are 2 episodes long. Unfortunately none of the arcs are really that interesting. Everything always goes well. They don\'t really take the time to develop any kind of drama, and if they do, it gets resolved really quickly, failing to justify the length of each arc. The romance is poorly done in each arc - it just isn\'t interesting. In fact, there\'s situations when it can actually be creepy and overdone. And one thing that is particularly jarring is that the arcs take place in the same timeframe every time, the main character has the same backstory in all of them, and they always end in the same event, with it just playing differently. You will probably find yourself rolling your eyes each time they repeat what happened to the main character at the beginning of each arc.The humor falls on its face most of the time. It doesn\'t come off as natural, and it just follows the typical troupes you would find in a romance comedy anime. There are some exceptions to this, but in general, the humor is not well done.ART:The one thing that can be highlighted from this show is the art. While this part of the review can only be objective, I really enjoyed the character design. The girls just look really cute, and the backdrops are detailed. They didn\'t slack off in this area.SOUND:The sound is nothing special. If you have played VNs, you will notice that it has that same ""type"" of music. In the first season, each ending was sung by the main girl of the arc. Sometimes they were OK, sometimes they were average. They were never BAD, but I wouldn\'t say music was this anime\'s biggest department.CHARACTER:So the character design is nice, but I have mixed feelings regarding their personalities and interactions. I think most of the characters, other than the MC, can actually be pretty likable on their own, but everything falls to the ground when they start interacting with each other, or at least when they interact with the MC. I wish we could see each character do their own thing a bit more often without having to involve the MC so we can get a better idea of what they are like. Many characters have good backgrounds, interesting personalities, and hobbies. But we can never see that because the series doesn\'t take the time to develop each character. When one of the girls show up, the MC is almost guarantee to be with them, and if they don\'t they aren\'t doing or talking about anything important.ENJOYMENT:Ultimately, how I rate an anime is mostly decided by how much I enjoyed it. It can have the nicest art in the world or the most bombastic music ever, but if it wasn\'t enjoyable, it\'s rating will go down.And Amagami SS fails to deliver any kind of enjoyment. With the comedy failing to deliver, the romance being so poorly done, and the character development being boring and mostly non existent, I found myself checking how much left of each episode was left when I was watching it. This is never a good sign.OVERALL:I sincerely find it hard to justify a score bigger than 2. The biggest problem with this anime is how the arcs develop and they always end up being boring. If you want to watch a romcom, rest assured the market is full of them, and only watch this when you have exhausted all your options. arc as a parallel universe because they have their own endings and there\'s no continuity between each arc.Anyway, Because of this, it\'s hard to rate the story as a whole, but we can talk about the arcs on average.

I got, however, a very nice surprise.Amagami SS focuses on each girl\'s route, while Amagami SS+ Plus focuses on the afterthought. Junichi has to deal with different situations regarding his different relationships, which is interesting to see.Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s still a harem anime, and you\'ll get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but this time around there\'s more on the table. While some situations seem outlandish, some others not so much.If you enjoyed Amagami SS, you\'ll enjoy Amagami SS+ Plus even more.

It is a direct sequel and follows roughly the same episodic format of its predecessor. Each female lead is given a two episode arc that once completed, goes back to the beginning of the timeline and focuses on another female lead. These episodes are meant to provide closure for last season’s episodes as not every...female was given a canon ending.Story: 7/10Amagami SS+ tries very hard to provide appropriate closure to each character’s romance, but some come off too forced due to the restricted two episodes per character. An example is from the ending of Haruka’s arc where Junichi makes a very bold confession that I believe no human would ever attempt. I also found myself reverting to my old preferences of character choice from last season as I still found Haruka way out of Junichi’s league and Sae was still a pill to listen to. There are however some really great moments such as Ai’s ending and Rihoko finally manning (err womaning) up to confess to Junichi. The season does have arcs that outshine others but overall it’s enjoyable across the board.Animation: 8.5/10The animation is a step up from last season as the production values have been very kind to the overall visuals of the show. Each character seems more defined and much more attractive to see. Backgrounds are drawn very well and each setting is very detailed.Sound: 7.5/10Once again the voice acting is very well done by the Jap cast. Each female lead is voiced by the same actor as before and retains their individual quirks that made them lovable in the previous season. My gripes still remain with Sae as she is just a pill to listen to for over 40 minutes. The opening song is very catchy and well done. Music during the episodes fit well and provide adequate atmosphere.Characters: 9/10There is not much I can say that has changed in the character department from last season. I still loved all the characters and they act the same as the previous season. I have newfound respect for Rihoko, returning ughness for Sae, and a liking for Haruka’s outgoing personality. Each character’s personality is unique and a joy to watch fold out. The male lead Junichi is also more likeable in this season as he seems more approachable this time around.Overall: 8/10Even though I ended up scoring this season with a score lower than a 9.0, I still found myself really enjoying the closure provided for the entire cast. Every arc was fun and enjoyable to watch and I cannot wait to go back and re-watch the first and second season in the future.Enjoyment: 8.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

Season 2 is not adapted from the visual novel unlike it's predecessor, and mainly focuses on the continuation of each girls relationship with the MC Tachibana Junichi. It tells the story of how Junichi tries to continue his relationships with all the girls despite Ai's anxiety caused by him preparing for college, Sae's lack of time for him due to her being focused on the cultural festival, Haruka wanting to get married after her graduation, Kaoru wanting to further extend their relationship and take that next big step, Rihoko...still unable to express her obvious feelings for him and Tsukasa running for student council president, all told using a 2 episodic format allocated for each heroine. First of all the second season is better than the first season, it has more interesting arcs and some really wholesome moments here and there, now granted the first season does have those as well, but that one was a lot more cringe and annoying to get through. Don't get me wrong this one still has cringe moments and that dreadful final panservice episode that was absolute unbearable and cringey to get through , shit was probably just mixed in to cash out, hell if you're making 2 seasons of anime based off a visual novel then you definitely need to cash in other wise that's a failure for the studio. Let's talk about the cringe moments next, there are still here, a lot less than the first one but still here, incidentally the first one had some moments where I had to pause and come back or take a quick break in order to get through certain episodes ahem ahem Sae arc and Nanasaki end ahem ahem, but fortunately this season wasn't like that despite still having cringe moments it wasn't unbearable that I had to pause or take a break to get through episodes, this one felt a lot more comfortable and entertaining unlike it's predecessor. Finally though this anime was decently entertaining by generic harem romcom standards, it is still a generic romcom that was only made because the first one succeeded back at it's time, but honestly for me this second season didn't have a necessary purpose for it to be made, it was only a cash in from the studio's part, hell the story was just an afterstory of characters with a already decent ending that many romcoms would die for instead they're out here ending with the characters too shy to confess to each other jeez this why is the genre is ass and we only have a few good ones, anyway as I was saying not to take anything away from this anime but honestly there's not really much to take away about Amigami hell the two seasons weren't good they're mediocre at best, and this second season is completely unecessary in terms of story fr we didn't need to see this but they still made it cause they needed more mulla hmmp whatever. Also I forgot to mention but the animation and the artstyle are the same, the characters are also the same, furthermore there is no new character development with the girls since they all just stayed with Junichi anyway and we already confirmed thats what going to happen in the first season.Pros:-More entertaining and bearable-Less cringe moments-Couple of decent afterstories for Haruka, Kaoruand Tsukasa-Kept the same animation and artstyle-Has some fluffy momentsCons:-The return of your favorite perverted beta male no personality MC Tachibana Junichi-Cringe moments are still here-This sequal didn't need to be made since the story was already done, and the only purpose of Amigami SS+ is fanservice and to be a cash grabber-Cringe af and annoying episode 13 [ if you're going to watch this anime stop at episode 12 thank me later]-No new character development-Garbage OP and EDOverall Amagami SS+ is a sequal to a run of the mill harem romcom, that only exists to be either fanservice or to make more money, though it is better than it's predecessor because it has less cringey moments, made 3 arcs more interesting plus it does have better more memorable instances, not too mention really fluffy scenes as well. Even so being slightly better than Amagami is not really a achievement that this second season should be proud off. To all of you who are looking for some romcoms to watch I don't really recommend Amagami SS and Amagami SS+ since they're you're run of the mill harem romcoms, if you are looking for some really good visual novel adaptations  you outta try Clannad and Clannad afterstory, Higurashi, the fate franchise and Steinsgate. If you're looking for good romance anime then you can try Sakurasou, Rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai, Your lie in april, School Rumble, Ore Monogateri, Kimi No Todoke, Romeo X Juliet, Clannad Afterstory and Maid Sama. I give Amagami SS+ a 6/10 for my overall anime rating, Cyranical signing off. still unable to express her obvious feelings for him and Tsukasa running for student council president, all told using a 2 episodic format allocated for each heroine.

Unlike many anime of the sort, we can see how the mc would pick each girl and how compatible they are. This change from the generic harem route is refreshing and will make every other show seem dull in comparison. The formula that Amagami chose for its storytelling is so unique that if done by any other show, would be seen as a copycat.The myriad of routes taken by the show has made me view...the very concept of love in a new way.It is no understatement to say that this show is a rollercoaster of many different emotions, and you will be thinking about it long after you have finished it, its OVA's, and its second season. I promise that you will think about Amagami every time you watch another harem anime, it's just that memorable and unique.If each arc was the same quality as that of the first and 2nd to last of the first season, this should probably have been the greatest romance in anime.Another part of the show that I feel as though I must point out is the genius idea to create a different ED for each arc/girl (much in the same way that Rascal Does not Dream of A Bunny Girl does, except Amagami takes it a step or two beyond that). I'm sure that this wasn't easy for the creators and I am very happy that they did it, it makes each arc feel unique, and using the same OP brings them back as part of the same overarching story about the many ways love can form and show its colors.While the art and animation are nothing to really write home about, I find that the overall story and thought-provoking nature of Amagami easily make up for that. Also on that note, I would rather have a mediocre, more realistic art style than one that is oversaturated or hard on the eyes. This more realistic art style also fits with the more grounded and true idea of love that the stories portray.Overall, this is an amazing show that I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to pretty much anyone interested in romantic anime, as I believe it to be an underrated staple of the genre. the very concept of love in a new way.It is no understatement to say that this show is a rollercoaster of many different emotions, and you will be thinking about it long after you have finished it, its OVA's, and its second season.

And these arcs pick up after the first season, meaning if you want to pick up one after the other, it'll make for a very kaleidoscopic viewing order. For fans of VN novels, I suspect this anime will be perfect viewing material. I, however, found this style frustrating and conflicting to the emotional core that should've been the point of the story. At this point I can't empathize with our protagonist Junichi...Tachibana. Yes, getting dumped on Christmas Eve was a way to start the story, but where it is taken from there is more crucial, a point this anime seems to miss. 6/10 Tachibana.

Hal,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16528/Hal,"['In the backdrop of a very slightly future world of helper robots and robot therapy a violent, fiery plane crash effectively ends the budding romantic lives of Hal and Kurumi. Left alone and without their significant other, Hal wakes up dazed and confused, programmed with a new mindset of a robot sent to comfort ""his"" former lover. Through their initially reluctant meetings and attempts to make Kurumi happy again, Hal finds something much more beautiful, and much more sad than what his initial purpose had programmed him for.Using various things left behind in that small button shop Kurumi lives in as clues, Hal does...his best to simulate the former Hal as best as he can. Photo albums and short messages written on Rubik\'s cubes are his main ways of connecting to the now reclusive Kurumi. With each short exchange, they start to open up to one another, sharing in their pains of loss and memories of a once happy life. With each side of the Rubik\'s cube solved, each bearing a different message and a different color, everything culminates in a beautiful ending of growing closer to one another, no matter what the source.""Hal"" is a short film that packs into it a myriad of emotions of love and loss that gives viewers glimpses of the lives of Hal and Kurumi before and after the plane crash. After shutting herself in her room, Kurumi seems to spend much of her time trying to fix a broken red video camera that taped moments of her and Hal\'s lives, some memories flattering and others painful. Seeing the past shows us that things were not rose colored and perfect, but sometimes troubled. Overcoming these obstacles and growing closer is the heart of this film.The story is like a puzzle, leaving us as confused as Hal at first. Through those disjointed recordings of the past, and as Kurumi fixes the video camera, these scenes become more complete and raise certain questions. Loose points and fuzzy details rise that do not seem to make much sense, but every little detail comes together brilliantly in a dazzling conclusion that reveals much about the story behind the story. It is like how the characters love solving Rubik\'s cubes, how with each completed face of the puzzle the overall picture becomes clearer, another message is revealed, and another beloved memory is remembered once more. It is a game of puzzles that leaves viewers playing the game with Hal all the way until the very end.However, not everything is fleshed out and not everything is made clear. There is a much darker side to ""Hal\'s"" world that the film hints at but never really goes into depth with. The only clue is Hal\'s hated memories of being poor and his experiences as a child. Given more time, the film could have created another aspect of the future world the characters live in to bring up more points about the conflict that robots bring. In fact, the robot aspect plays such a minor part that much of the film would be unchanged if they were suddenly taken out. Even so, this is a way for the story to bring in the interesting aspect of questioning what would happen if a loved one was suddenly replaced by a robot that looks exactly like them.The film is a visually pleasing swirl of colors and reflections, light and dark, old and new. The setting is gorgeous, with the sun shining and entering the lonely button shop that Kurumi lives in. Even though this story takes place in the near future, there are still traditional buildings, customs, and a festival parading through the modern town. The water illuminates, the trees shade the light, and everything seems to flow. The film looks very crisp and colorful. The most stunning scene, where everything ties together, is a wonderful display of fantastical light and reflecting waters.Accompanying the film is a pleasant soundtrack that accents the mood the film creates, that of hope and comfort, of regaining the past.

The answer is simple. Working towards understanding one another and growing closer to each other through the process. Hal is not your typical romance show, but instead, strays from the norm by bringing touching on the post-romance theme, which seems to be taboo in anime nowadays.[POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW: I have refrained from spoilers as much as possible. Read at your own risk.]Story & SettingThe setting of the story is slightly into the future, where robots and other more advanced electronics are common place. In a mere hour, HAL demonstrates the cycle of what was a regular relationship turned bad through the...death of one of the two young love birds. The story centers around the main character, a robot who now takes on the face and role of Haru, as he tries to reach out to Kurumi, the latter whom has given up the will to live upon the passing of the original Haru. A touching story, astonishingly full of emotions despite its short length.AnimationThe animation is relatively detailed, creating beautiful environments and bringing out the various emotions belonging to each scene. In particular, water appears to be a main focus of the show with it being used in various ways throughout.SoundThe background music acts as a great way to pull the audience deeper into the story, creating gripping scenes which do nothing but cause you to gasp in shock or smile along with the characters.

Haru, the robot desperate to learn more about Kurumi to cheer her up and Kurumi, the grief stricken ex-girlfriend who wants nothing more than to go back to the time when she and Haru were together. I had expected the characters to be rather shallow due to the time constraints of the movie but was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case, but rather, the opposite of what the anime managed to convey.OverallI thoroughly enjoyed this movie as though rather short and could possibly be considered rushed, it still manages to very effectively make me feel along with the character and associate with their feelings.

Please do give any comments of which I could learn from and improve on for any reviews I might do in the future!]', 'HAL  reviewThis movie was a total disappointment in both characters and story aspects .The concept and idea was good but the execution and rushed pace made it worse.The story is about losing a  person who is dear to you and the movie portrays the human drama behind that loss. The only problem is the execution of the plot and character interaction.The rushed pace that the movie uses , instead of making the viewer accommodate with the story and characters , all of the emotions and drama is lost on the way leaving no impact or message.The characters are  poorly written , we...can’t get to know them and understand their sufferings because the movie doesn’t tell us nothing about them. They are thrown into our faces and used as plot devices for the progression of the story. For example  the relation between HAL and Kurumi who is the main focus in the movie , the execution and the way it’s delivered as a human drama aspect for  the viewer, fails it’s expectations and potential.This happens because the movie doesn’t explore  the characters background story enough, we are shown only pieces of the puzzle but those pieces are not entirely connected to the story or serve a purpose for the human drama theme.The transition between different aspects of the human drama is rushed and all of the emotions is lost . For example when HAL tries to help Kurumi and cheers  her up , the anime doesn’t take a natural pace to form a bond between those two instead all happens in a instant and we are left with a lot of questions and a sour taste of disappointment.In conclusion I was disappointed in the execution of the story and plot because of the rushed pace, the poorly written characters who I couldn’t get to know them well both on story and emotional state , a lot of unexplained plot holes and finally the focus on the human drama aspect that lacked a strong impact and message to me as a viewer.Overall 4/10 can’t get to know them and understand their sufferings because the movie doesn’t tell us nothing about them.

Kurumi had lost her lover, Hal, in a plane explosion. Since then, she had shut herself in due to depression. A doctor (and friend of Kurumi\'s), along with Hal\'s grandfather, get a robot to help Kurumi. The robot takes Hal\'s place, in appearance and name, and goes to reach out to Kurumi and hope to reforge a relationship between Hal and Kurumi.The art, done at Wit Studio (known now for Attack on Titan) is phenomenal in this movie (as you can see in the image). The scenery, the character design, and pretty much everything...(especially the water) is beautiful in art and design. Kudos to you Wit Studio.Next up is characters. The characters in this were so lovable and genuine that you can\'t help but get attached. I don\'t know I mean there\'s not much else to say other than I loved the characters. Just to make a longer segment I\'ll put music here too. The music was fantastic and really sets a mood (as music should) that engulfs you into the story. Again... not much else to say there.Themes and Messages. The overall themes were really driven and important here. Things like ""can you teach a robot to love"" and ""can you ever understand someone else\'s emotions"" come into play and are really driven home hard. Along with a recurring motif of Rubiks Cube Wishes (what those are is that you write a wish on a Rubiks cube and if you solve it that wish will come true). You\'ll walk out of this movie asking a lot of questions like this, and maybe even have an existential crisis, like I did (even more than with Evangelion).The dub quality (I watched it dubbed) was amazing. Funimation does it again with a fantastic dub. That\'s all there is to say here.And lastly, the story. What could easily be the best part of the movie. Having only 60 minutes to deliver a story so powerful, so amazing, and so thought-provoking is truly a feat to be amazed at. I\'m still in awe about everything in the movie, and the ending will have you thinking about this movie for quite some time (seriously, I\'m even going to have to rewatch it).Now for the scores...Art: ACharacters: AMusic: AThemes: ADub Quality: AStory: A++Overall: 10/10All I can say is that Hal is nothing short of a masterpiece, and all in the course of 60 minutes.

The goal here is to Kurumi to find the confort and love that she once felt.Knowing this, the question that you\'re probably thinking is: How can both Kurumi and the robot (Hal) grow their relationship? How can they find love when one is a robot and the other had gone through such a tragic...experience as losing her boyfriend in a terrible accident? Now that\'s what makes you want to watch this movie.Only that it wasn\'t something like that. I consider myself a romantic guy but I didn\'t ""aww"" even once in this movie. Almost no time was given between Hal and Kurumi to develop feelings for one another. The movie was mainly Hal doing random stuff with people from the village. Such a disaster. Oh, what a great word to describe this movie: a disaster.I didn\'t give a lower score because the Sound was good enough and the Art was on point, kinda like a better version of Ao haru Ride\'s art for those that know that anime. That\'s what saved this movie. There was a good twist at the nearly end of the movie that really got my attention. Here again, I saw some potential. And then it faded away. They did nothing significant with this twist.If you tolerate lackness of story and just wish to watch something quick (1h), go for it. But if you\'re expecting something good from this movie, don\'t be. I find it very difficult to agree with other reviewers on this. This is just lost potential at it\'s best. experience as losing her boyfriend in a terrible accident? Now that\'s what makes you want to watch this movie.Only that it wasn\'t something like that.

This is just lost potential at it\'s best.', 'I have read the manga for HAL and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so I had high expectations when I watched the movie and I must say they were met.Story:9Although categorised as a romance I wouldn\'t say that it\'s your average romance story. It\'s got a few moments in the film that have you going ""aw"" but I wouldn\'t say romance is the number one aspect of the film. I\'d say it has more of a psychological feel to it that is a nice contrast against the slight shoujo side to the film.Art:10I love the art. Sakisaka Io helped with the character design and...I love her work a lot so I was glad to see it animated. (Now just give us a Strobe Edge or Ao Haru Ride anime!) Overall the art in general was just beautiful.Sound:8I don\'t have much to say for the sound apart from I think the voice actors were chosen well for each character.Character:9The characters in HAL, in particular HAL and Kurumi, have decent backgrounds and it leaves a good foundation for the story.Enjoyment:10This film is definitely something everyone should watch at least once. It\'s only short so it may seem rushed to some but the manga is also fairly short so it\'s not something I can personally complain about. Despite knowing what was going to happen it still pulled at my heart strings and I was a sobbing wreck by the end and if that doesn\'t say it\'s worth the watch then I don\'t know what will!

You see a robot/android lay in the water trying to catch some fish, so naturally, you think it\'s set somewhere in the future. Robot gets called out by some old guy who after the android arrived gets  mail and a plane explodes above them and the old guy looks like he\'s having a heartattack or sth.Then the movie cuts...to a dark scene which seems to have taken place after a funeral and the old guy tells the android to make some ""child"" want to live again. This is where the movie really begins.Some time later (We don\'t know how much later) we see a guy sitting in some sort of chair witha doctor next to him telling him that his transformation into a human was completed, which apparently looks like some dude named HAL. The doctor (Who looks like every stereotypical crazy professor in the animeworld) tells him that his task is to make this girl called Kurumi, who appearently was Hal\'s girlfriend, want to live again. He does some things to lighten her mood up blahblahblah even though she never really seemed like she actually had no willl to live on.He learns a bit about Hal\'s past even though no one really explains Hal\'s past properly, but that doesn\'t matter because it\'s barely plotrelevant anyway.Someday, he meets some guy who recognizes him as Hal and You instantaneously think ""Yep, that guy is gonna cause some problems"".*SPOILERALERT*And so he does.One day when RoboHal goes to a festival with Kurumi, that specific guy who actually turns out to be Hal\'s best friend wants to ""sell"" Kurumi. He has some shady dudes, one of which is wearing a Bruce Lee suit, accompanying him.Of course, Robohal doesnt want to sell kurumi, they run away and Kurumi falls into a river. Robohal sees her lying in a shallow part of the river and wants to go save her, but of course  Hal\'s best friend catches up stops Robohal from jumping in and gives Robohal a real beating.PLOTTWISTRobohal starts bleeding and actually remembers that he actually is Hal and that Kurumi is the one who died in that plane accident.He starts crying, shakes free of his ""BEST FRIEND"" (The guy who wants to sell his gf without explaining anything beforehand and beating him up, you know, typical best friend stuff) and dives into the river together with Robokurumi. We get some flashbacks fullfilling the funeral scene from the beginning and showing that Hal thought he was a robot because he couldn\'t handle Kurumi\'s death, Robokurumi and Hal kiss underwater and she sinks into the wet abyss while Hal is getting pulled out of the water by his best friendBtw, Hal was magically attached to a rope there. No further explanation needed.In the end, we cut to a scene where Hal has started to live a normal life again.I don\'t think this is a partycularly bad storyline, but it\'s no masterpiece either. The pacing is bad which results in the viewer constantly being confused how much and how fast the time is actually going by and some things actually make no sense at all. For example how did Robokurumi know that Kurumi wanted to see a giraffe together with Hal if she didnt actually see the note on the rubis cube....Oh yeah....I forgot about this: Kurumi and Hal both wrote things they wanted to accomplish and stuff on the sides of 5 by 5 Rubiks cubes and then scrambled them completely. I actually liked that but exactky such a detail makes no sense. Or Are you going to tell me that Robokurumi first solved those things, memorized all the notes on them and then scrambled them again? Nope I\'m not buying that shit.There were a lot more scenes like this but I guess there\'s no point in pointing them out one by one. You\'ll notice them yourselve if you watch this movie.*SPOILEREND*I actually liked this futuristic drama concept but since the pacing of this movie is so mediocre and the explanation in a 60 minute movie is so poor....well...I simply cannot give the storyline a good or even better rating.5/10Art:The art on the other hand is really amazing. There is so much detail in every single frame that you could take a picture at any time and you\'d have an awesome desktop background every time. But I did not expect less from Production I.G.10/10Sound:Though the soundtrack is not as amazing as the artstyle, its pretty good aswell. The soundtrack mainly consist of Orchestral pieces which suits this anime perfectly. On a side note, I want to shortly mention the music at the climax scene. Thatwas it.8/10Character:The main problem with the characters is that there are no explanations for any characters besides Kurumi and Hal. I\'m being dead serious. You don\'t know who the doctor is, you don\'t know who the old ladies are that show up a few times in the movie and that I forgot to mention which doesn\'t really matter because those scenes were rather pointless anyway and even Kurumi and Hal are only explained a little. You don\'t know how Kurumi and Hal came together....well....let\'s be real: You barely know anything about Kurumi. The best friend of Hal has three scenes in the whole movie, which creates no emotional attachment at all, especially when he starts crying after dragging Hal out of the water.(You need to have read the spoilerpart if you want to understand what I mean by that :D)But you cannot really get attached to characters that don\'t have much screentime together anyway. I mean, Kurumi and Robohal don\'t do that much together. The doctor nearly has as much screentime as her and I don\'t think his name is even mentioned once(But I could be wrong on that one.)Though I have to give the author credit for the characterdesign, they look pretty damn good. Kurumi, Hal and best friend that is. The rest consists of your generic Grannies, your genery professor/doctor and your generic wtf ever.And the characterdevelopment only really happens at the end!*SPOILERALERT*I have seen people call Robokurumi\'s behavior as ""Strong characterdevelopment"". Well guys, I dunno about you, but I understood that as her simply acting as a girl who\'s having characterdevelopment. Seriously. She\'s supposed to act that way to make Hal think that\'s he\'s a robot helping Kurumi starting to live again. The only characterdevelopment we have here is in the very end of the movie where Hal can finally let go and accept Kurumi\'s death. AND NOTHING ELSE!*SPOILEREND*4/10Enjoyment:Strangely, I really enjoyed this movie. I like seeing dramas with a lot of feels and this actually is one of those. Sure it\'s a bit hard to get into it at the beginning but it\'s fine as it is. And let\'s be honest, it could be a lot worse.Though it\'s no masterpiece, I gave it a.....9/10, I enjoyed it a lot after watching it the first time ( 7/10 if you watch it again and notice a lot of flaws and stuff.)That makes a final verdict of7.2/10I\'d recommend this if you enjoy dramas and don\'t take flaws too seriously.^^ to a dark scene which seems to have taken place after a funeral and the old guy tells the android to make some ""child"" want to live again. This is where the movie really begins.Some time later (We don\'t know how much later) we see a guy sitting in some sort of chair witha doctor next to him telling him that his transformation into a human was completed, which apparently looks like some dude named HAL. The doctor (Who looks like every stereotypical crazy professor in the animeworld) tells him that his task is to make this girl called Kurumi, who appearently was Hal\'s girlfriend, want to live again. He does some things to lighten her mood up blahblahblah even though she never really seemed like she actually had no willl to live on.He learns a bit about Hal\'s past even though no one really explains Hal\'s past properly, but that doesn\'t matter because it\'s barely plotrelevant anyway.Someday, he meets some guy who recognizes him as Hal and You instantaneously think ""Yep, that guy is gonna cause some problems"".*SPOILERALERT*And so he does.One day when RoboHal goes to a festival with Kurumi, that specific guy who actually turns out to be Hal\'s best friend wants to ""sell"" Kurumi. He has some shady dudes, one of which is wearing a Bruce Lee suit, accompanying him.Of course, Robohal doesnt want to sell kurumi, they run away and Kurumi falls into a river. Robohal sees her lying in a shallow part of the river and wants to go save her, but of course  Hal\'s best friend catches up stops Robohal from jumping in and gives Robohal a real beating.PLOTTWISTRobohal starts bleeding and actually remembers that he actually is Hal and that Kurumi is the one who died in that plane accident.He starts crying, shakes free of his ""BEST FRIEND"" (The guy who wants to sell his gf without explaining anything beforehand and beating him up, you know, typical best friend stuff) and dives into the river together with Robokurumi. We get some flashbacks fullfilling the funeral scene from the beginning and showing that Hal thought he was a robot because he couldn\'t handle Kurumi\'s death, Robokurumi and Hal kiss underwater and she sinks into the wet abyss while Hal is getting pulled out of the water by his best friendBtw, Hal was magically attached to a rope there. No further explanation needed.In the end, we cut to a scene where Hal has started to live a normal life again.I don\'t think this is a partycularly bad storyline, but it\'s no masterpiece either. The pacing is bad which results in the viewer constantly being confused how much and how fast the time is actually going by and some things actually make no sense at all. For example how did Robokurumi know that Kurumi wanted to see a giraffe together with Hal if she didnt actually see the note on the rubis cube....Oh yeah....I forgot about this: Kurumi and Hal both wrote things they wanted to accomplish and stuff on the sides of 5 by 5 Rubiks cubes and then scrambled them completely. I actually liked that but exactky such a detail makes no sense. Or Are you going to tell me that Robokurumi first solved those things, memorized all the notes on them and then scrambled them again? Nope I\'m not buying that shit.There were a lot more scenes like this but I guess there\'s no point in pointing them out one by one. You\'ll notice them yourselve if you watch this movie.*SPOILEREND*I actually liked this futuristic drama concept but since the pacing of this movie is so mediocre and the explanation in a 60 minute movie is so poor....well...I simply cannot give the storyline a good or even better rating.5/10Art:The art on the other hand is really amazing. There is so much detail in every single frame that you could take a picture at any time and you\'d have an awesome desktop background every time. But I did not expect less from Production I.G.10/10Sound:Though the soundtrack is not as amazing as the artstyle, its pretty good aswell. The soundtrack mainly consist of Orchestral pieces which suits this anime perfectly. On a side note, I want to shortly mention the music at the climax scene. Thatwas it.8/10Character:The main problem with the characters is that there are no explanations for any characters besides Kurumi and Hal. I\'m being dead serious. You don\'t know who the doctor is, you don\'t know who the old ladies are that show up a few times in the movie and that I forgot to mention which doesn\'t really matter because those scenes were rather pointless anyway and even Kurumi and Hal are only explained a little. You don\'t know how Kurumi and Hal came together....well....let\'s be real: You barely know anything about Kurumi. The best friend of Hal has three scenes in the whole movie, which creates no emotional attachment at all, especially when he starts crying after dragging Hal out of the water.(You need to have read the spoilerpart if you want to understand what I mean by that :D)But you cannot really get attached to characters that don\'t have much screentime together anyway. I mean, Kurumi and Robohal don\'t do that much together. The doctor nearly has as much screentime as her and I don\'t think his name is even mentioned once(But I could be wrong on that one.)Though I have to give the author credit for the characterdesign, they look pretty damn good. Kurumi, Hal and best friend that is. The rest consists of your generic Grannies, your genery professor/doctor and your generic wtf ever.And the characterdevelopment only really happens at the end!*SPOILERALERT*I have seen people call Robokurumi\'s behavior as ""Strong characterdevelopment"".

I did not read, just tuned in to the movie because it seemed like something I would enjoy.There may be spoilers also!The story had just seemed so fast. I couldn't really catch on to the emotions of the characters because of this.

OH now he wants Hal to snap out of it, he is helping? It was just very sloppy and didn't make sense.Perhaps I had set my expectations very high. Hal just did not have the story all there.

After a tragic plane accident, a robot, also known as Q01, is sent to a small Japanese town to help a person who just lost a loved one. While trying to heal the melancholic heart, the past of the couple is unearthed.The story is quite ordinary and easy to watch but...it got some emotional moment as well. especially the plot twist but it's not something that will left you depress for weeks and it got sad yet realistic ending.The animation is little below par,considering it was released in recent times.The voice acting have been done precisely both in dub and sub so no place to complain.As a whole it's a delight to watch the movie :) it got some emotional moment as well. especially the plot twist but it's not something that will left you depress for weeks and it got sad yet realistic ending.The animation is little below par,considering it was released in recent times.The voice acting have been done precisely both in dub and sub so no place to complain.As a whole it's a delight to watch the movie :)"", ""The best way to describe Hal is that the movie starts off great, then it has to add something that nearly wrecks the quality of the film. The movie is focused around a robot who is able to take on the human form of a man named Hal, the lover of a young woman named Kurumi who is still emotionally recovering from the loss of the human Hal who was killed in a plane accident. She is distrustful of the robot Hal at first for taking on the form of her dead lover, until she slowly starts trusting him and the robot wishes to learn...more of what Kurumi's life was like with Hal before his death. We do come to learn more of the joys and difficulties within the life of the couple when the human Hal is still alive, the mentioned difficulties leading to a dramatic element to the story as we learn one of the two in the relationship has their own personal baggage that doesn't make them as pure-hearted as they seem on the surface. The first three-quarters of the movie has excellent story-telling and character exploration that has you credibly buying the relationship of our pairing in the movie and you would think the presence of the robot Hal is there to allow Kurumi to learn to move on from the loss of her human lover. Unfortunately, the movie's final quarter attempts to toss in a rushed and poorly explored plot twist that leads to all the buildup throughout the movie to feel like it didn't matter because of the sudden revelation concerning its premise.This is a bit of a pity too, as Hal is a gorgeous looking film to look at sporting vivid and detailed scenic shots with character designs looking nicely drawn and detailed. While not a prominent element in the movie, the animation depicts characters being natural in their movements and there isn't a sign of any shortcuts present throughout the film's run.Overall, Hal is something of a disappointment as much of its run had the elements and buildup to create one of 2013's best anime titles before implementing its sloppy ending. While much of the movie is still great from much of its earlier buildup, the ending feels like a bitter aftertaste when you realize that the movie's creators duped you and you might be hesitant to rewatch this film again. more of what Kurumi's life was like with Hal before his death.

"", ""As a cuber, I got triggered because of all of the inaccurate cubing scenes.If you are a cuber, I recommend you to be prepared for serious trigger warnings.Like the logic doesnt make sense.

The plot twist in my opinion was entirely unnecessary and it pretty much ruined all the story and character development. If it wasn\'t for the stupidity at the end of the movie. I would\'ve given this movie a better score. Way better. Sadly, the past change be changed therefore fuck this shit.Though this show\'s interpretation is respectable. To a great degree, I don\'t agree with it. The ""humans can be comforted by robot"" cliche is utterly cretinous unless the story\'s actually immensely good.

So for that reason, good bye.', 'The show starts out rather strange with a plane suddenly exploding over a quiet little town. Then they suddenly talk about a boy named Hal who had passed away and a girl who seemed to be his girlfriend is taking it pretty hard. To me, this beginning just feels like it was a promo for the show instead of the actual show because we don’t really get any information at all. We can speculate what’s going on, but that’s all. We don’t get a full picture of what is actually happening. And then we have a robot that becomes human in order to help the...young girl. I’m actually not sure if we could really call him human right away though as he doesn’t seem to know how to actually act human or feel human. I know this is going to into philosophy but this really does ask the question, what does it take to be human?Throughout the whole show, we learn a lot about Hal. I mean the real Hal in fact, not the robot one. I like how we learn through Robotic Hal’s way of learning then just being told straight out. It gives us a mystery to solve then just a romance. In the end, there is a point when Hal’s past seems to haunt the two. And then in the end, it really changes around, making things a bit more confusing but making it really fun all the same. It’s not like any other love story between a robot and human. It’s hard to explain because of it being such a big spoiler that it would mess with you. You really should watch it if you are interested in knowing what the hell I am talking about with switch. And even at the end, there are one or two things that don’t seem to not be closed up, things that should but don’t take away from the story.The artwork is amazing, and the sort of playful toy aspect to this is rather cute. All the vibrant colors and amazing little adornments all over the place. I didn’t really see any problems with the animation being poor, though I didn’t like some of the design aspects they did for a couple background characters. It doesn’t mess with the story but it makes me frown slightly at that. Still, the design of the rest was wonderful and made me happy to even watch the show.The English dub was so good; I couldn’t believe how wonderful the voice acting was. Of course funimation did give it the dub so I shouldn’t have expected anything less and yet I have seen some that felt like they needed a bit more. Each person sounded like what I thought they should sound like, even the ladies at the adult day care sounded good and those are normally the ones that would of sounded bad if there was a bad voice. The strange thing is that there were not that many names that stood out to me in the cast.

I picked out this movie because the cover image was colorful and caught my eye. I am a sucker for android involved story lines, so I knew I had to watch it after I read the synopsis. In the end, the movie didn't quite reach my expectations.Story (4/10):There was a steady story line in the beginning, but I was disappointed around halfway through. It felt like a lot was lacking, but I'm not sure what it was. A lot wasn't explained....Are there other robots besides Q01? How did Ryuu and Hal exactly meet? Who is Ryuu besides him being Hal's friend? The story was just a bigger let down than I had wanted it to be.Art (8/10):I really liked looking at the characters. The way they were drawn was nice, and the animation was smooth. There was nothing overly amazing about the art though.Sound (7/10):The sound was good. I didn't pay much attention to any of it, so there was something else making up for that loss that kept my interest. The ending song wasn't that catchy, but it was pretty to listen to. None of the background music was anything really special.Character (4/10):This is the area that has the most problem. The characters have no personality or much background on them at all. Nothing was said as to why Kurumi had a thing for sewing. There wasn't much depth to Hal at all then besides that fact that he was far in debt and had a childhood friend named Ryuu. I'm not even sure what Ryuu's part was to play in the movie. The only part he played was at the end to make Hal come to his senses over Kurumi. I just couldn't sympathize with any of them.Enjoyment (5/10):I didn't cry, but I did laugh maybe once. I didn't feel any eagerness towards any of the characters because of their actions. I had a poker face the entire movie mostly, but this movie was an okay watch.Overall (6/10):I'm not happy nor disappointed that I watched this movie. It was a nice refresher from all the other bloody fighting anime I have been watching. I wouldn't watch it again by myself or with others.

A messed up story in my opinion.It's said to be that a Robot turns into a guy in order to save her feelings or whatnot, however it starts off great and the story is smooth, then it takes a turn for the worse and your like....what? Now you've lost me. To me it was confusing once this turn took place and it...didn't make sense, made the movie all weird like.Apart from the plot being all crazy and weird, the character development in my eyes was really nice, pretty much two people falling for each other again in a romance. Hal was nicely done, the way he acted was great and funny, his character development you could see throughout the movie which was interesting as a Robot. and then the girl...you rarely see her personality at the start but once she 'Comes out of the Shell' she develops more into a being. However...it's not over.My favourite of this series was honestly the music and the art, the music was nice a peaceful and enjoyable in part. The music actually made you feel in the era and feel like you understood the scene. The art another personal favourite, I liked how they did the art work and the colours, all the scenes was well worked on to make it stand out and give it that real feeling. The art really was better than I thought it would be and this makes it to me a whole lot worth it watching this anime even if the story isn't great. The vivid colours used in scenes and the way they'll nicely tone into a peaceful art colour rather than in your face, was pure brilliant.I gave this an overall 6 as I really didn't like much of the plot and the character development was ok but not that great with the 'twist' that is involved while watching this movie. I did however enjoy it a little bit with the music and the lovely art that was displayed through out.If your into Romance between a human and a bot with a crazy whacky twist then this would be the one for you, I gambled and sadly this wasn't one of my favourites but hey....it could be yours! I'd say to give it a try, what can half you watching a 1hour movie to knock off your list? You could even enjoy it more than I! Though the art in itself is beautiful.~ Canaan didn't make sense, made the movie all weird like.Apart from the plot being all crazy and weird, the character development in my eyes was really nice, pretty much two people falling for each other again in a romance.

The vivid colours used in scenes and the way they'll nicely tone into a peaceful art colour rather than in your face, was pure brilliant.I gave this an overall 6 as I really didn't like much of the plot and the character development was ok but not that great with the 'twist' that is involved while watching this movie. I did however enjoy it a little bit with the music and the lovely art that was displayed through out.If your into Romance between a human and a bot with a crazy whacky twist then this would be the one for you, I gambled and sadly this wasn't one of my favourites but hey....it could be yours! I'd say to give it a try, what can half you watching a 1hour movie to knock off your list? You could even enjoy it more than I! Though the art in itself is beautiful.~ Canaan"", ""I just watched this anime after reading the manga since i found out that there is actually a movie.This movie is probably the best movie i've ever watched. The story line is absolutely unexpected(basically sobbing and weeping ugh). I am quite sad with Haru's past though.I enjoyed it very much although i'm not really a fan of robotsxhumans. It is a masterpiece and i was sobbing till the last end (yupyup.) It is very touching, and painful. This anime/manga shows that love cant be broken as long as you have faithfulness in each other.Overall; 10+++/10 "", 'From the studio behind Attack on Titan, comes their first ever anime film Hal. A film that at first may seem like your typical romance story, but once going into it, you\'ll find that it\'s a much bigger story than you can imagine. But how big can a film that\'s only a single hour long can be?Story: Set in near future where robots and other technology are part of everyday life, we center around a robot named Hal, who\'s assigned to perform ""Robot Therapy"" on a girl named Kurumi, who recently lost her boyfriend in a fatal plane accident. Taking the form of her old...lover, Hal does whatever it takes to open up to Kurumi by learning about her and her deceased boyfriend so that she can find the will to move on.One very noticeable thing about the film is it\'s length. One hour is relatively short for movie standards, so I was worried that it might interfere with the pacing and character development. But I was happy to find that it wasn\'t the case.....for the most part. Not one scene felt to fast or to slow and it really took advantage of it\'s short time. Putting a lot of emphasis on the characters and how they were going to change throughout the film. You learn about Hal and Kurumi enough to get what they\'re gong through and feeling that you do want them to end up okay at the end. And not to give away any spoilers, but there\'s a plot twist at the end of the film that really caught me off guard and changed how I viewed the film prior, which what makes a twist work in the first place. Though while I do credit the film for using it\'s short time wisely, I still believe it could\'ve used an extra half hour to it\'s running time. You know, if it really wanted to be on the same level as Miyazaki and Hosoda and be even better.Art: I must say this is pretty impressive for their first film. I really liked all the attention to detail to the character design, the backgrounds, and a lot of the many symbols to the films like the Giraffes and Water. The water looks like it\'s really their to me. I also really like a lot of the many ideas about all the technology and how they work and function. Wilt Studios is off to a pretty solid start, but it\'s kinda expected when it\'s founded by people from Production I.G.Sound: The soundtrack really knows how to make the audience feel even more invested in the plot by making tracks that are gripping, soothing, and just overall fits the themes of grief and finding the will to live again. It also helps the characters feel even more alive when something happy or sad happens to them.Characters: Much like the plot, the characters really are well executed during their short amount of time together. Haru plays as a good robotic lead who tries to learn about Kurumi and even his deceased counterpart. Kurumi\'s is a character that you\'ll really sympathize with, and even more towards the end of the film. They both share very sweet chemistry and I credit the film for having each one have a different side to the story. Prior to the events of the film, you learn that the old Haru did something that at first, would make him seem like a selfish jerk, but you\'ll understand quickly once you learn more about his past. That\'s another thing I like about the film, there really is no villain. Each character has a backstory and motive that really sounds justified and believable to get across. The other characters are just their to play off of our main stars, but they\'re still likable enough to really leave an impact to the plot.Overall: While it\'s major shortcoming (No pun intended) does hold it back to being on par with Studio Ghibli or Mamaru Hosoda, HAL still does it\'s job well with it\'s heartbreaking story, deep themes and morals, and a very believable bond. If you can look past it\'s one flaw, you\'ll be left with a short, but sweet love story. lover, Hal does whatever it takes to open up to Kurumi by learning about her and her deceased boyfriend so that she can find the will to move on.One very noticeable thing about the film is it\'s length.

In fact, it took me an entire day to watch this because I just got so bored with the story line. If I didn\'t know the twist already, I would\'ve stopped watching maybe about...10-15 minutes in???I LOVE romance Animes....I LOVE psychological Animes that make you really think about life. I really do. That\'s why I dove into this movie.I found that the way they made the robot & the young adult (assuming the 2 were young adults because they ran a store together before 1 died) to be very...interesting?It was a very stereotypical way where 1 doesn\'t want the attention of the other & the other is trying hard to please them.The concept of this stereotypical way that they\'re interacting works though because it IS robot therapy but regardless...the plot leading up to the climax is so dry.The characters are all pretty dry as well. I couldn\'t connect with ANY of the characters. This might\'ve just been me but all of the characters were so...boring. Ordinary. Stereotypical.Dry.A lot of the movie is drier than a desert. Very dull interactions. As I said previously, if I didn\'t know the twist I would\'ve dropped this movie extremely fast.-Now WHY DID I FIND IT UNIQUE??I found this story very unique because it has very blatant metaphors.The metaphors are things I would\'ve NEVER thought of using.The giraffe was more of the fun she had with Hal & the dreams of the future she wanted with him (that\'s how I interpreted it)The red button represents Hal\'s lost soul/heart.The rubix cube for example represents all of the things Kurumi wished & wanted to do with Hal.I found the rubix cube to be the most unique of all because the robot tries to complete/do all of the memories, Kurumi wanted to have done,  with the sulking young adult to help heal their broken heart over their lost one.The plot twist was totally unexpected. I knew the plot twist & I was still moved by it. In fact, the plot twist made me bump up the overall score from a 7 to an 8.I ALMOST made it a 9 but the fact that it took so long to pick up made me keep it at an 8. It doesn\'t pick up until the 3rd section of the movie. But then again I found this ALMOST nice because this is supposed to be a psychological movie and these movies don\'t usually have that much ""FUN"" or ""EXCITING"" interaction.These movies make you think.This movie definitely will make you think about relationships more.Life.What do you really want to do with it? Would you rather live poor but happy or rich. Not doing what you wanted to do?What would you do?-Overall this anime is good. Not amazing, despite the twist. Not bad, despite the long minutes of it being dry in the plot.If you\'re okay with movies that take a while to pick up...If you\'re okay with a movie as long as it has a good ending...If you\'re okay with a movie that will make you think about life...This is your movie.

I wish I'd known about it sooner.This movie explores love and the painful truths about life without dwelling so deep in the pain you feel you can't go on, and the ending is worth the price you pay to get there.I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say this. The movie is set in a 'futuristic' Kyoto. To those who've been to Kyoto you'll recognize the streets, the beautiful mountains, and the lovely people.

The answer is simple. Working towards understanding one another and growing closer to each other through the process. Hal is not your typical romance show, but instead, strays from the norm by bringing touching on the post-romance theme, which seems to be taboo in anime nowadays.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Story & Setting:The story holds in the near future, japan. Which now Robotic technology and actual Robots roam the country.To put it simply… A girl named ""Kurumi"" has lost her beloved “Hal” in a plane explosion. Now she’s in a trauma, which is really hard to wake up from....She can’t sleep, eat, drink or even get out of her room. So her grandfather asked their Android “QO1” to help him to replace her beloved Hal, by asking his friend “a Genius professor” who made a robotic surgery on QO1 to make him look like “Hal” and make him feel like a human also. All of this has been done to make her wake up from her depression.Verdict: 8/10The story was very good, but it needed a little more kick, ya know?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Characters:This will be really quick.Simply put, the characters lacked depths, and even names! Yes most of the supporting characters don’t have names.The Main Characters Lacked, at a point that it’s annoying!You tell me I’m exaggerating? Then tell me that, an unexplained flashback is to you? Yes, I thought so.Verdict: 7/10The characters are likable but still, no depths means no becoming the character, which let’s you get bored easily.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Soundtrack:Most of the soundtracks were beautiful, they fit the atmosphere of the movie perfectly, they were memorable, and made me want to download their OST.Verdict: 8/10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Animation:OH MY GOD! The animation is just beautiful! Stunning! Gorgeous! Marvelous! Exquisite! They really have done a really good job in the arts department.

I'm sure I will be receiving a lot of hate for this review but let me just write honestly what i have in mind. I won't be adding poetic story summaries and shit so I'll just get to the point immediately.I have read A LOT OF SHOUJO MANGA(s) so i could tell that Hal's plot is actually pretty common and plain. The typical save someone's miserable soul kind of film. I know i'm starting off with a bit negative choice of words but don't get me wrong, i don't hate it one bit. You see with...the frequent use of dead-lover/family/friend as one of the main factor for tear-jerker films and series', viewers tend to get sick of reoccurring storylines. So if you want your story to appeal to your audience more, you have to make sure that your story and character development is well paced to make it stand out. This is where Hal comes in. Even with an ordinary shoujo-ish plot the film managed to quirk my interest because of it's development and massive plot twist, which is wicked sick by the way. I was honestly getting bored of the progress of the story when i realized i've already watched 3/4 of the film but still confused as hell on where the story was going. But then came Haru's battered scene and his lost memories. With eyes wide open, all those puzzle pieces floating on my head came to fit the whole image perfectly. I was shocked and speechless. The way the film presented the actual truth is amazing. One of the best twist i've seen on an anime romance film so far and without a doubt that twist is literally the redeeming factor of Hal. Well i mean, gorgeous visuals aside. Yep. Without that twist it would have been your stereotype raburabu shoujo.STORY - 7Actually i was about to give it a 5 for a so-so plot but the final revelation was superb so i'll give it a +2 for that unexpected twist. And well for the fact that it made me cry at the end.ART - 9Beautiful. I was actually anticipating this film because of it's visuals. So after watching it i'm all satisfied and happy with Production I.G's great work.SOUND - 6There's a BGM? Really? Well the theme song was indeed fitting for the story and i like it but I can't remember if there was actually a bgm. I guess it didn't caught my attention enough to make me remember.CHARACTER - 6It's ok. Everyone was lovable, well except for Ryuu which i find really gay maybe because of the seiyuu but well nothing to hate nor love. It's so short that i can't get myself to sympathize with character's feels not until the twist. Even about their past scars and sufferings, it didn't pain me one bit. The only thing that made me cry was the revelation, i felt sorry for him and the way he coped with his loss.ENJOYMENT - 8Well of course i could recommend this for people who love romance and beautiful art. Despite my previous remarks, i actually enjoyed this quite well. Don't be disheartened because of this review, i just stated what i thought but this is a really well liked film. If you like heart warming drama with romance then this is definitely for you. the frequent use of dead-lover/family/friend as one of the main factor for tear-jerker films and series', viewers tend to get sick of reoccurring storylines.

A disaster separates a happy couple from each other, and the only one who can put the pieces back together is a robot who looks like a human. Of course, this idea initially brings out my cynical self, eliciting questions of whether a true romance can be achieved between this robot and Kurumi; however, as the events of the story progress quickly, these questions gradually begin to fall away and the movie begins to prod the more emotional side of myself. Essentially, the...story is what you would have expected after watching the trailer - Hal gradually becoming intimate with Kurumi - but unlike many other stories that follow a similar story, it does it right. Now if you\'re reading this and asking yourself \'Wait, if I know what the movie\'s going to be about, then why should I watch it?\', I will say that the ending is really something to look forward to.The only gripe I have about the movie is that it seemed a tad bit too short. Perhaps this is due to the my emotional side wailing that the experience was over, but I truly believe that more development between the couple should have been stretched out more. Certainly, at times there are some anime that have too many pointless ""filler"" scenes that tried to develop the characters\' relationships with one another; however, I feel that Hal falters in that area. Most of the movie\'s beauty comes from the new blossoming relationship between the new Hal and Kurumi, and yet there seems to be a lack in emphasizing it.Character: 9Because of the short length of the film, I didn\'t get to see in-depth to the characters\' lives and personalities. But I am pleased to say that even within such a short span of time, Hal manages to impress me with the way it was able to churn out a surprisingly detailed backstories and character development for the both Hal and Kurumi.Due to spoilers, I do not want to disclose too much about the characters (as much as I want to) since discovering the stories behind each character is an interesting aspect of the movie.Overall: 9I\'m sure anyone even slightly interested in the romance genre will appreciate this piece of work. The story was well introduced and executed throughout the short one hour with proper pacing (considering its time) and the development between the characters is just something to watch. If it was longer and contained even further development between the two characters, a score of 10 would be in order. story is what you would have expected after watching the trailer - Hal gradually becoming intimate with Kurumi - but unlike many other stories that follow a similar story, it does it right.

By having gone through something horrible personally, the reality of the show resonated more deeply with me because I could feel the protagonist’s grief and suffering.

However, as I was watching I couldn’t help but wonder a few things. It wasn’t quite enough to break my suspension of disbelief, but I do wish they had addressed them. For example, if they’re a robot, how are they feeling emotions? Considering emotions are simply the result of chemicals in our brains… You could argue that they transplanted the brain into the robot, but then how did they connect it? As I said, not enough to break my suspension of disbelief, but things I do wish they had addressed. Maybe if...they’d had more time, who knows.Story: 8/10The story really good, with decent pacing. It started out slow and revealed more and more as the plot progressed. And that twist. I am about to start talking about the twist, so if you don’t want to be spoiled, stop reading. Okay, so apparently it was Kurumi who was the robot, not Hal. Which was really fucking great. When Hal’s friend was like “let us sell her” I was like “wtf” and then they revealed that she was the robot and my head exploded. But that got me thinking, how come Kurumi acted weird in the beginning of the movie. I distinctly remember her saying “I don’t remember asking for a robot that looked exactly like Hal”. It’s like the plot sort of forgot that she said that. Not a huge big deal, since the rest of the dialogue and events worked fine with that twist. You’d also think Hal would notice she was a robot when he heard the electronics moving? And how did they simulate the softness of her skin. I’m about 90% sure she didn’t feel like plastic or he would have noticed something. And why didn’t she sort out when she was in the water? I very clearly saw little bits of wire sticking out. Either way cool twist and interesting plot.Characters: 7/10The only characters that really mattered were Hal, Kurumi, and Ryuu. Although Ryuu didn’t get much development, he was a fun character and it was nice to see his easygoing attitude disappear when he was worried about his friend dying. It gave the impression that he actually cares a lot about people underneath that happy mask. Hal and Kurumi didn’t get that much development either, although we learned about their past together. Hal was the caring boyfriend, except he wasn’t in the past. They seemed to fight a lot, and we saw Kurumi’s wish that he would stop using violence. So he wasn’t always Mr. Nice Guy. Kurumi the least interesting character. She loved Hal and that was about the end of her personality. She was almost but not quite a prop. I guess you could say she was very ROBOTIC! No? Not funny? Okay.Art: 8/10The art was decent, but not spectacular. I actually saw a few people complaining about the artwork, which I didn’t get at all. Oh well, different tastes I suppose. Everything seemed slightly textured. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it looked really cool. I wish more anime were colored like this one.Sound: 6/10The only reason this isn’t getting lower is because of the crying. The voice actors did a fantastic job with the crying, especially Ryuu’s. The music was unspectacular, as is evidenced by the fact that I can’t remember any of it and I’m writing this literally right after I finished the movie.So, should you watch Hal? I say yes. It’s a very touching movie, even if it does have its flaws. The music and voice acting wasn’t amazing, but it was made up for by the plot and the twist about 3/4 of the way through the movie. The dramatic scenes were very dramatic and had me biting my nails throughout. It might be a little bit slow for some people, but I thought it was fantastic. they’d had more time, who knows.Story: 8/10The story really good, with decent pacing.

The whole story is good and all, but it could have been better. Maybe if the movie was a bit longer and went in more detail about this sci-fi world, though I'm no movie critic so I can't say exactly what the movie was missing. However I don't regret watching this movie (even though I should have been able to predict the ending). Hal is definetely one of those unique movies that are different than others that reuse the same plot or cliches'.If all else...and if you're a music lover, the ending credit song sang by Yoko Hikasa is sung beautifully. and if you're a music lover, the ending credit song sang by Yoko Hikasa is sung beautifully."", ""First of all I have to admit the movie ended before I even knew it, so enjoyment wise, it got me hooked and by the time the conclusion came I was shocked it's over. I highly recommend to watch this if you feel like exploring new storytelling ways, it might not be one of it's kind, but it's rare to run into such movies where even though it's slow paced, it fools you through and through. I'm trying my best not to ruin the plot twist because when you watch it you'll know it's one of the best plot twists out there story wise.Although the...story is compelling the characters seem lacking a bit, that's probably one of the reasons I felt like there has to be more to the story because I could count a dozen of times where there was more story to explore. The art is nothing special even though there are some pretty scenes, but in general they played it safe in that regard, even though some of the environments are really reflective of the characters and the tone of the story which I liked.This might be one of the first reviews I write that I don't touch the story in, as in write a summary or hint at characters because this movie is best experienced going in knowing nothing. So, overall, I highly recommend you watch this if you're feeling like you don't know what to watch now, it'll captivate you in a weird way, and it's a good weird way, you'll leave feeling you need more, but you'll be grateful you got introduced to the world of HAL. story is compelling the characters seem lacking a bit, that's probably one of the reasons I felt like there has to be more to the story because I could count a dozen of times where there was more story to explore.

The art was, overall, pretty gorgeous. I\'ve definitely seen better art out there, but Hal had nice, tranquil environments to it that were nice to be a part of. The music wasn\'t anything special. I can\'t really comment on it.The story is the main issue I had while watching it. I think most of the issue could\'ve been fixed with a longer movie or even with an 11 episode anime. No. 6 is a good example of an anime that can get in...and get out with a quick story while still having a complete and sensical story.

The emotions are there.', 'Hal Movie ReviewBy Ryotaro MakiharaMay 18 2019Overall: 10Plot: 10Before watching it, I already have an idea that this movie will break my heart. Long ago, I\'ve already read the manga version of it and as far as I know, it is only a one shot story. This movie is about a tragic teenage love, missing and longing for each other. The feeling of regret, misery, and pain because of the words left unsaid. It shows how one need to move forward despite everything that pulls him down. That even if all the part of your life is so mess up, there\'s still a reason not...to give up. That you can still find happiness and joy. And you should still he grateful that you are still alive with so many chances to change for the better.Character: 10There are few characters of the story. And among those few, only two characters stand out. Two characters that will show how one can die even if they are still breathing. The characters are created in an unfair world. Well, I guess the world is really unfair to begin with. The development of the character from the one who\'s barely breathing to the one who decide to step and move forward is satisfying.Sound and Animation: 10How the animation was created looks like Ao Haru Ride. In short, it was great. Every parts of the movie, the background, the expression on the character\'s faces, the characters itself, is good. At most, when the characters are crying, you will also get into that mood and might as well cry. How the emotions are being displayed is really a plus. It was really heartbreaking when the main character broke into tears. The pain his face show, the crack in his voice, its terrible.Enjoyment: 10Since I\'ve already read it before, I know that it will be a good watch. And there\'s a fact that I don\'t actually remember the whole plot of it. As a person who loves tragic stories, this one will be added on my top list. It\'s just a short anime, but it left a spot in my heart. Lesson, check. Heartache, check. Animation, check. Plot, check. It\'s a good deal.Ending: 10The story ends in a shock. Like ""Wait, what the fuck just happened?"" expression. Since I can\'t remember the plot anymore, the ending made me speechless. I\'ve really pressed the backward button to absorb what I\'ve just watched. The twist in the ending is amazing. Not all stories will shatter the level of audience expectation and make a new higher one. It\'s really unexpected. And yes, it has a very good ending. to give up.

It has a very touching story with a plot twist which was totally unexpected. This movie brings you a bittersweet taste.Story: 10It's very unique I should say. It combined a little bit of science fiction as well as romance. Chobits is the only other anime I know of that managed to do this. So what would you do if your lover has died and a robot came to you as a replacement?  The movie Hal explores this scenario. The story moves very rapidly in a 1 hour period and focuses on the relation ship between Hal and Kurumi. The...ending however, requires a little more thinking to understand the story.Characters: 8There wasn't much character development, but this was probably due to the short length of the film. Despite this, I'd say they did a good job. You learn a lot more about the characters background than you would expect.Art: 10I loved the art. I think the characters are drawn very well.Sound: 9The sound was utilized very well in this movie. It was used to create atmospheres that give the audience different thoughts and feelings at different scenes.Overall: 10I enjoyed this movie very much. I'm slightly disappointed that the movie is only 1 hour long and felt a bit rushed, but despite this they have done very well in making this movie. There are some parts which are not explained and possibly confusing. This may have been done deliberately for the audiences interpretation.

This time love must blossom anew between two entities in which one suffers a horrible fate. Immediately afterwards, an android takes the place of one of them and this interesting tale tries to mirror the emotions of a lifelike scenario between a human and human-robot.The movie is full of subtle twists and overall good camaraderie.  There is a quirky family involved that supports the relationship and just brings a little bit of fun, as well.Do you really want to miss out on how this strange love story ends?

They should have invested more time so that we can relate to the characters more. I wished that they did not rushed it. It has a good plot. The story goes out with a drama of losing some one dear to you and the main character is in denial of the things that had happened. Never have I imagined they can create a concept about it with the story. Hence; the rushed paced really ruined the teary moments for me. I wanted to...have an emotional state when I watched this, but i just can't cause the involvement with the characters are lacking so much with the way they did it. have an emotional state when I watched this, but i just can't cause the involvement with the characters are lacking so much with the way they did it."", ""The build up is not enough to make me care about the characters. Honestly I got bored for the first 40 minutes. Yeah the plot twist is unexpected and the animation is great, but it only makes me a bit sad and not cry.I can't blame the duration as there're movies with shorter duration like Garden of Words or Hotarubi no Mori e (both only 45 mins) but is much better in terms of conveying the emotions. The problem is in the pacing, the development between the 2 characters feels rushed and it lack details.Overall, it didn't work for me and I'm disappointed. "", ""With themes of reflecting on and dealing with grief, regrets, loss, healing, and understanding, I highly recommend this as an anime for everyone to watch. It is a really bittersweet ride, but I think everyone can take something from this. The ending has really stuck with me and that last scene hit me hard. I don't want to spoil it because it is most potent when you go in blind.I honestly can't recommend this enough.

"", 'What happens when the person you love the most passes away?Do you stay stagnant or do you learn to move forward and fly?Hal is a movie with an endearing premise. Set in the future were robots are far more common than in our current time, a robot is sent to impersonate Hal, Kurumi\'s lover who has passed away in a fatal airplane explosion. At the loss of Hal, Kurumi has closed herself away from the world and her emotions. The premise of this story brings forth a new twist to the plot of bringing back love into someone who\'s world has lost its color. Needless...to say one can easily be captivated, as we see robots becoming less a thing of the future and more of a possibility for today. But what brings forth color to the audience, and what fails to bring real emotion into the mix?The story is set up in a fairly lovingly manner. With his soft mannerism and innocent words, Hal attempts to learn about Kurumi and Hal\'s worlds so that he may care for Kurumi. We all react to grief in different ways, and Kurumi\'s behavior is believable considering Hal has been gone for some time now. Thanks to the artwork and music, we find ourselves wanting to cheer for not only Kurumi, but Hal as well. We want them to learn about the beauty of the world together, as Hal has mentioned before being confused about the meaning of certain emotions and human needs. Learn and love, Hal and Kurumi.Wit Studios took on this project, so it comes to no surprise that the artwork in Hal is of great quality. Every frame has its own level of detail and charm, Kurumi\'s home is abundant in buttons and knick knacks, allowing for a feeling of homeliness into a shut out Kurumi\'s world. The music works well with the tones in each scene, truly taking the audience on a journey of growth. Character designs are well made; there\'s an enjoyment that comes with seeing characteristic embedded into each personality and character. It makes you want to learn more about everyone.Where the story falls short, however, is in its writing. The main relationship that should have been created with care- Hal and Kurumi\'s- is mediocre. We get bits and pieces of the couples relationship pre-accident, and while that wouldn\'t have been a story breaker on its own, it fails to motivate. We get to witness what a charming human Kurumi was to those around her, there\'s an evident glow that radiated from her and it makes you want to see her happy. But the reason for her change, Hal\'s death, feels off. There\'s a basic framework for the couples relationship, but it all feels too rushed, their words sound fake in the climax the scenes were emotions run high and while that can be blamed on their youth, that does not excuse mediocre writing.However, this would not be enough reason to place it in a 6 range of score. Unfortunately, the writing does not get better as the story moves forward. Kurumi becomes visibly happier as her interactions with robo Hal increase, and the pair seem to grow increasingly fond of one another. The execution of this is fairly well done, although with more time their relationship could have felt more believable, After all, this isn\'t just any caretaker coming to bring Kurumi back to the world of love and general happiness, it\'s a robot who looks and sounds just like Hal. There has to be some sort of emotional consequence as a result. After all, this is not the real Hal. He does not contain Hal\'s memories. He is not Hal. If the story had taken a route of choosing to dive deeper into this, the story may have felt more real. Instead, Hal\'s old companion is thrown into the mix, and he tries to attack Kurumi and Hal near the end of the story. This plot point is skin and bones, attempting to throw in intense tension without building up to it properly. Without spoiling anything major, the ending falls completely flat. A major plot twist is thrown in that breaks the foundations of what has been set up. While the idea of this plot twist is notable interesting, it is so rushed that it does not make much sense.As much as I want to give this story a higher score, as it has some higher tier art and animation as well as an interesting story, the execution of said story fails to receive anything higher than a 7(although I would put it at a high 6). I expected more from this movie; I\'ve heard some great things about it being a move one would never forget. Unfortunately, the story did not live up to the expectations it set. If it took more time to flesh things out, the movie could have been a smashing success. So what does happen when a loved one passes away? For this story, we remember that the world is still beautiful and that we must take things one at a time. It\'s a shame the story could not make it to the end.**the rest of this review contains SPOILERS and expands on the FAILURE in story**Hal\'s plot twist. For those who have watched, will watch, or just want to know, we find out that the person who actually died in the plan accident was not Hal, but Kurumi. This whole time Hal has thought of himself as a robot, and does not recall his memories until the last 15 or so minutes of the story. This plot twist puts the mind to work, but not in a good way. If Hal thought he was a robot, but the true robot was Kurumi, why did everyone go with Hal and encourage him to think of himself as a robot? No one denies that he\'s a robot and they encourage him to remind himself that he is one. But why? Why put Hal deeper into this confusion? You could argue that it was the only way to make him remember, and while the idea of bringing the world back to him through going with his delusions puts up a good fight, it does not psychologically make sense. There are hints that the plot twist will occur, his friend Ryuu questions why Hal was gone for so long, but he\'s not surprised to see him ""alive."" In the beginning, the robot is never specifically told to help Kurumi just a ""child."" And yet, the actions of the rest of the community don\'t make much sense. What would have happened, if Hal continued to believe that Kurumi was real and him a robot? Would they just allow him to live a lie so long as he seemed happy? Additionally, there\'s the problem of who\'s paying for a robot; it has been mentioned before that robot maintenance is costly, and Kurumi nor Hal are known for having money, in fact, a huge issue in the couple\'s relationship is their lack of money. There\'s too much left in the air, and not in a way that leaves you content and thinking, but upset.There is so much to this story that is intriguing. Robots could become prevalent in the not-so-distant future, and the notion of them being part of our emotional journey through grief does not feel out of reach. Unfortunately, because the plot twist reaches to much, and falls with more questions than there should have been, I find this to be a 7/6 movie. The story is interesting enough that I don\'t vote for not watching this movie, but I this was not an enjoyable enough story to make me want to watch again, nor recommend it to a friend, when there is so much more content available to see. to say one can easily be captivated, as we see robots becoming less a thing of the future and more of a possibility for today.

The execution of this is fairly well done, although with more time their relationship could have felt more believable, After all, this isn\'t just any caretaker coming to bring Kurumi back to the world of love and general happiness, it\'s a robot who looks and sounds just like Hal. There has to be some sort of emotional consequence as a result. After all, this is not the real Hal. He does not contain Hal\'s memories. He is not Hal. If the story had taken a route of choosing to dive deeper into this, the story may have felt more real. Instead, Hal\'s old companion is thrown into the mix, and he tries to attack Kurumi and Hal near the end of the story. This plot point is skin and bones, attempting to throw in intense tension without building up to it properly. Without spoiling anything major, the ending falls completely flat. A major plot twist is thrown in that breaks the foundations of what has been set up. While the idea of this plot twist is notable interesting, it is so rushed that it does not make much sense.As much as I want to give this story a higher score, as it has some higher tier art and animation as well as an interesting story, the execution of said story fails to receive anything higher than a 7(although I would put it at a high 6). I expected more from this movie; I\'ve heard some great things about it being a move one would never forget. Unfortunately, the story did not live up to the expectations it set. If it took more time to flesh things out, the movie could have been a smashing success. So what does happen when a loved one passes away? For this story, we remember that the world is still beautiful and that we must take things one at a time. It\'s a shame the story could not make it to the end.**the rest of this review contains SPOILERS and expands on the FAILURE in story**Hal\'s plot twist. For those who have watched, will watch, or just want to know, we find out that the person who actually died in the plan accident was not Hal, but Kurumi. This whole time Hal has thought of himself as a robot, and does not recall his memories until the last 15 or so minutes of the story. This plot twist puts the mind to work, but not in a good way. If Hal thought he was a robot, but the true robot was Kurumi, why did everyone go with Hal and encourage him to think of himself as a robot? No one denies that he\'s a robot and they encourage him to remind himself that he is one. But why? Why put Hal deeper into this confusion? You could argue that it was the only way to make him remember, and while the idea of bringing the world back to him through going with his delusions puts up a good fight, it does not psychologically make sense. There are hints that the plot twist will occur, his friend Ryuu questions why Hal was gone for so long, but he\'s not surprised to see him ""alive."" In the beginning, the robot is never specifically told to help Kurumi just a ""child."" And yet, the actions of the rest of the community don\'t make much sense. What would have happened, if Hal continued to believe that Kurumi was real and him a robot? Would they just allow him to live a lie so long as he seemed happy? Additionally, there\'s the problem of who\'s paying for a robot; it has been mentioned before that robot maintenance is costly, and Kurumi nor Hal are known for having money, in fact, a huge issue in the couple\'s relationship is their lack of money. There\'s too much left in the air, and not in a way that leaves you content and thinking, but upset.There is so much to this story that is intriguing. Robots could become prevalent in the not-so-distant future, and the notion of them being part of our emotional journey through grief does not feel out of reach. Unfortunately, because the plot twist reaches to much, and falls with more questions than there should have been, I find this to be a 7/6 movie. The story is interesting enough that I don\'t vote for not watching this movie, but I this was not an enjoyable enough story to make me want to watch again, nor recommend it to a friend, when there is so much more content available to see.', 'I\'ve watched many anime\'s that delve into the theme of ""what it means to be human"".

But this was a concept that was built for an episodic-type of anime series. Maybe one 20-plus season, or a two season anime would have fleshed out this relationship between Hal and the women a little more. But nonetheless, the progression of the relationship was a bit forced. I thought that the women felt comfortable with Hal a lot quicker than normal. Also, there was this bit of a backstory with Hal and how he was in some sort-of child labor industry. I would of loved to learn more about this, but it wasn\'t mentioned in a major way for the resto of the film.

This premise of the film, it was misleading. I won\'t spoil, but this twist in the middle to end of this film is something that isn\'t quite obvious. It turns this film from a light-hearted, melodramatic tale of a love blossoming between a heartbroken women and a lookalike machine, to a somewhat tragic, dark but hopeful, and powerful film about how a tragedy could mold a persons mental state, and how to find the strength to move on with your life. It only had one hour to fit this all in, which is the major issue for me. This potentially could have been possibly the next Clannad or something of that caliber. This was such an intriguing concept. I won\'t go as far to call this a waste or terrible work.

Just kidding, but really, people who like happy or light hearted romance anime should stay away from this. But to viewers like me who like to watch anything or just the romance genre, this is definetly a film to watch. However, don\'t look at this film with an objective lense.

Conclusion for TL;DR at the end of the articles.Reading time: 2 minutes readReview:This is one of the few anime from back then that's so good but so few people know about it. It's a very compelling anime with the right amount of drama in a 60 minutes span, by itself it's a good anime that's able to evoke various emotions throughout the show, but if I compare it to similar anime, it's a rather underwhelming since the other similar anime...have 90 minutes or longer duration, so the plot feels more natural, while this anime's pace feel so rushed. I feel like they wasted a lot potential by not exploring the side character such as Ryu. There's a lot of things left unexplained so it feels like there's hole here and there, but since I still got the gist of what happened (and what they implied) I feel like it's okay, but some people might found it to be a very bad thing.The arts are just lovely, it's on par with the visuals from 2020, it's so highly detailed with lots of colours spread through the show. Although the high details brought alive the city among many things, it also made some mistakes to be apparent, such as the unnatural way of explosion of the plane, among many. The thing that surprised me is that the animation during the later half of the show, because I didn't expect such a fluid animation in this kind of anime, which focused more on the dialogue between the characters instead of action scenes.The songs are great, but that's the extent of it, because it failed to made me cry at the climax moment, and it failed to register in my memory a.k.a forgettable... The sound effects used along the show are just top tier, it felt so real that it even overweight the other aspects at some scenes. The seiyuus did a very well done job to convey the emotions of each character, I can feel the change of emotion, anger, feels of longing, regret and many more, it's one of the rare anime where all the seiyuus able to sink deep in their characters.Conclusion:Reasons to watch:-A decent short drama anime with a bit twist at the end-An eye candy visualsReasons NOT to watch:-Rushed plot made it a bit underwhelming compared to other similar anime have 90 minutes or longer duration, so the plot feels more natural, while this anime's pace feel so rushed.

I also have a twitter by the same name. Big anime nerd. First anime I'm reviewing on MAL. How quaint that it's a movie.Forgive me, for my grammar is mediocre which is why I wish to practice in reviewing to help others decide for themselves.Story:HAL is a 60 minute film and I'm not really sure we can call this a romance film since it inflicts heavily on sci-fi, shoujo for most of it. The story I gave a 7/10. I thought it was enjoying enough. I believe strongly though if the movie was 2 hours they could've progressed...it more. Maybe further the development of the characters a little. Nevertheless it's importance was trying to pull Kurumi back into reality. That's where our robotic friend HAL comes into play.The Art: Hmm....In all honestly, I gave it a 7. It looked a bit rushed though for a 2013 filmed. Like it was quickly put together. I didn't complain though. The characters complexion was brought out through the film.Sound: Like any other anime or film there's sound. A, 7. I usually don't review much on sound unless the music is bad. Which it wasn't.Characters: I gave it an 8. I have to say I loved HAL the robot. Trying to learned about the real HAL and adapt to the situation is never easy. Sometimes it's hard to find acceptance. But if you watch this film you'll understand why I gave it an 8. HAL had no problems jumping in and doing what he had to. I enjoyed seeing Kurumi react to him to. Aranami was a good support character. Always there for him when he needed advice, HAL.Enjoyment: I gave HAL a fair 7 in the enjoyment column. I was confused with a few parts towards the end. if you haven't seen it, I won't include why in this review. Reviews are not meant for huge spoilers, they're meant to convinced. I strongly think Shoujo fans would love this film most.Overall: My official score for this film is 7/10. I think it could've earned a 8 if it was a longer movie as I suggest. There's much they could've done with this movie. But that's how originals are. They're scripted by ideas and put into play. No content.

At first, I thought I should just watch it subbed for free on Youtube in 480p, but I\'m glad I rejected that idea and paid money to watch it English dubbed in HD because it really made the experience for me. Reading subtitles...is an extra step in perceiving visual imagery and it\'s helpful when you can bypass that with a dub that\'s in your language. For this film, I appreciated it all the more because I was able to focus heavily on the setting, atmosphere, and characters.In terms of character, I really like Hal a lot because he lives like the world is new to him. There seem to be many things he doesn\'t understand and he ventures through each day as a child would; making little mistakes along the way. His bright and expressive blue eyes retained my attention right away and lead me deeper into his character when I could read his reactions.I did not care much for Kurumi because she was hiding in a closet most of the time, but I was intrigued by the peculiar things she did inside the closet. For a long time, she would not come out so this allowed for some touching interactions to occur between her and Hal.Overall, the art was very pretty, but it was the characters that drove the story home and made this movie enjoyable for me.

I love the way it trickles the worldbuilding in throughout, teasing enough about this world of robots and other sci-fi technology to make sure the audience understands what's going on, but, while this might sound strange, doesn't explain just enough that the sci-fi aspects just feel like everyday life. By not explaining it, it makes it feel like it doesn't need an explanation.Most importantly, though, I love the base premise. I love the dynamic between the two protagonists, the titular Hal and female protagonist Kurumi. I love the way it...slowly teases out the emotions, and builds the dynamic between the pair of them slowly. I love the way things slowly start to fall into place.And then it burns the premise with ten minutes to go. Oops.I have a rule. If you're going to throw a massive twist into a story that changes the fundamental premise, if you are going to pull the rug from under me and make the story something quite fundamentally different, you have to make me like that new premise more than the old one. If you leave me disappointed that the original premise isn't the story I was watching, we're going to have a problem.Ultimately, this is where Hal fails for me. I was really enjoying the story I was being shown before the twist, and, to me, the twist didn't really add anything, and stopped the story from being the story I was enjoying.

The setting itself takes place in a realistically futuristic world and needs little elaboration as many aspects of the world are nonverbally understood and the things needed to be explained usually are (hint, usually). The problems occur when relatively important things are brought up briefly but then never acknowledged or explained. The core story and interaction between leading characters was fine and the plot twist was actually very interesting, as I've never seen such before. But the little nuances and side stories are inconsistent and unresolved, weighing down the story score...to a less than optimal result.But the art, voice acting, and just environmental effects overall are just phenomenal (as expected from Wit and IG). If you don't like the story, at least it will be stunning to look at and listen to. The OST was nice and suitable but not necessarily exceptional. Overall, the production quality is undeniably the best part of this movie.Speaking of non-exceptional things though, the cast of characters vary greatly, fluctuating the score of this category. Core characters and even many side characters are distinguishable and impressionable, each with a moderate amount of screen time and importance. But a few certain characters are inconsistent, unexplained, and mysteriously disappearing at the end of the movie, leaving various questions unanswered and more questions than answers. With such poor characters, the score drops SIGNIFICANTLY (as I averaged the good characters, 8, and the bad characters, 3, to get the mediocre score you see now). Don't get it wrong, the main characters are fine. It's just a select few that are terribly written (and I'm sure you will be able to tell who they are at the end of the movie, or else you are too lenient towards bad writing).Despite small infractions that left relatively devastating impacts, I still enjoyed this modern classic and I believe many of you might too, if you just give it a shot. It is only unfortunate that a few characters nearly drag down the entire score of a movie by nearly two whole points (in the end, it barely rounds up to an 8 but I digress), but objectivity is a thing and it's objectively poor when it comes to story and a few characters. to a less than optimal result.But the art, voice acting, and just environmental effects overall are just phenomenal (as expected from Wit and IG).

"", 'SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!With a movie with a premise that is basically just if Steven Spielberg’s Artificial Intelligence was a romance anime, one would think Hal would be a pretty epic film. And it seems like a lot of people thought that it WAS epic and were pretty depressed after watching the ending. But personally, I couldn’t get past its major flaws enough to really feel invested.The main problem? The characters. Which is pretty fatal considering that this is a movie on characters. It’s so disappointing because I think the film was great in all other departments. The art was excellent both frame-wise and conceptually. I loved...watching their glimpses of the streets of Japan. And might I just add, the water in the climax was GORGEOUS (we will set what happened in that scene). The plot was also great. I love a good psychological sci-fi (although I, like a few others, wish that they explored this a little more). I thought the plot ended with a pretty interesting conclusion, even if it was a bit of a stretch. The only reason I didn’t get choked up by the ending was because I felt like I didn’t even know the characters, which brings me to my next point…The audience must feel like they understand the characters in order to connect to them. Even if the character is “mysterious” at least that’s something the viewer can say about that person. But in the case of Hal, it feels less like the writers were being purposely ambiguous about the nature of their characters and more like they just didn’t take the time to characterize them enough. Even when some interesting ideas were brought up about the characters, they were very quickly skimmed over as soon as they were dropped. For example, I wish the writers had added a bit more about Hal’s backstory. The flashback to him and Ryu as kids was actually intriguing and I kept expecting them to connect back to it and they never did. I also wish that they explained the dynamic of Hal and Kurumi’s relationship. There isn’t really much there for us to learn about them and at some point it seemed from a flashback that they might’ve had kids together, but then we never hear anything about the kids again? The pace of their reunion was really wonky too. Where was the build up to that?? At the time, the audience was made to believe that HAL was the robot so wouldn’t make sense to have Kurumi be disturbed that her dead boyfriend is in front of her, but not really?? Of course eventually there would be a point where she would warm up to him, but the writers completely skipped over the “warming up period” which really bothered me. And as a result of all these problems, any moments in the film that were supposed to feel dramatic felt very “meh” to me.In conclusion, if you like sappy love stories, I recommend this, but it is nothing groundbreaking by any means. I do think that this film took a rather mature look at relationships in contrast with most other romance anime which tend to be a bit more juvenile (not me trashing on romance, just objectively, they tend to target younger audiences). The movie is pleasant enough and doesn’t overstay its welcome.___________________________________________________________Score Breakdown:~ Story ~6~ Art ~10~ Sound ~6 (generic, but it gets the job done)~ Characters ~3~ Enjoyment ~6~ Overall ~6 watching their glimpses of the streets of Japan. And might I just add, the water in the climax was GORGEOUS (we will set what happened in that scene). The plot was also great. I love a good psychological sci-fi (although I, like a few others, wish that they explored this a little more). I thought the plot ended with a pretty interesting conclusion, even if it was a bit of a stretch. The only reason I didn’t get choked up by the ending was because I felt like I didn’t even know the characters, which brings me to my next point…The audience must feel like they understand the characters in order to connect to them. Even if the character is “mysterious” at least that’s something the viewer can say about that person. But in the case of Hal, it feels less like the writers were being purposely ambiguous about the nature of their characters and more like they just didn’t take the time to characterize them enough. Even when some interesting ideas were brought up about the characters, they were very quickly skimmed over as soon as they were dropped. For example, I wish the writers had added a bit more about Hal’s backstory. The flashback to him and Ryu as kids was actually intriguing and I kept expecting them to connect back to it and they never did. I also wish that they explained the dynamic of Hal and Kurumi’s relationship. There isn’t really much there for us to learn about them and at some point it seemed from a flashback that they might’ve had kids together, but then we never hear anything about the kids again? The pace of their reunion was really wonky too. Where was the build up to that?? At the time, the audience was made to believe that HAL was the robot so wouldn’t make sense to have Kurumi be disturbed that her dead boyfriend is in front of her, but not really?? Of course eventually there would be a point where she would warm up to him, but the writers completely skipped over the “warming up period” which really bothered me.

The story is composed of 2-D characters who are a support towards our protagonist Hal.This story is simple but easy to follow....The use of flashbacks is probably the best I have ever seen and is a key component to understanding the current timeline of the story.

However, one day, a freak airplane accident occurs with Hal on it.  As a result, Kurumi goes into a deep isolation and refuses to interact with the world at all.  In an attempt to make things right for his granddaughter, Kurumi\'s father enlists a robot, known as Q01 to be sent to Kurumi\'s house with the looks and voice of Hal.In the one hour runtime, the story doesn\'t let up...at all, attempting to keep you in the story for the entire time.  They throw plot point after plot point at you, one after the other.  The beginning to middle of the film were very well told.  Some of the points are clearly more significant than others and it feels like they should have been given more screen time to those in under told tales.  For example, I feel like they addressed how Hal and Kurumi weren\'t completely the perfect couple really well, but they could have gone into more detail about Hal\'s past and background.  Some of it is given in pieces from the conversations that characters have with each other, and yes, we get a general sense of Hal\'s life pre-Kurumi, but it feels like there are so many details given in there that we could have got, and never did.Unfortunately, I don\'t feel like parts of the ending were done well.  Hal has a history with a character named Ryuu, who we don\'t sense is the purest of characters, but after the final time we see him and his ""friends"" on screen, we\'re left with more questions than answers.  It feels like that entire bit is missing.  The way they chose to end the film was okay, and there is closure, but the way they got there felt mediocre at best.  (6/10)Characters: With such a short film, there weren\'t a ton of major characters.  Hal\'s past is a bit of a dark one, which does somewhat affect how we see him act in a bunch of flashbacks.  However, you can clearly tell that some of his people skills are rough.  He\'s far from a deep character and, like I alluded to above, I wish they went more in depth on him because there are some strong points there.  They didn\'t make his character out to be ""really good"" or ""really bad"", which they should be commended on.  I feel like that could have been a trap, waiting to happen, and they avoid it completely.  Kurumi, understandably, breaks down after Hal passes away.  The few shots we do see of her at the start are effective and we even see bits of guilt when she tries to fix a video camera.  After locking herself away, she feels like an empty shell, trying to hold onto what little of Hal she had.  I wouldn\'t say she was either strong, or weak, but kind of predictable.  Still, she represents the theme of loss really well.Aranami seems to be in charge of health care in the area and due to the small town size, he seems to be one of very few people with medical knowledge.  His interactions with Hal are a lot of fun and I\'m glad they gave him the screen time that they did.  He was great.  Ryuu grew up with Hal and plays a pretty major role in his past, but I struggle with why he\'s still important to the story.  There was an attempt at telling us, but it feels very inadequate.  I really don\'t get this guy.  Generally, the characters in Hal\'s town know what happened with him and seem very willing to help.  The side characters together make nice additions here, even if our main cast had problems.  (7/10)Art: Hal does a good job at showing us what we need and the environments are really well shown.  The flashbacks use very effect lighting effects, indicating what they should mean.  This is a very well animated movie.  (8/10)Sound: The tunes in the film are fine, but I never found myself being heavily into it.  The VOs also do a fine job with Bryn Apprill (Kurumi) and Bill Flynn (Aranami) likely being the best of the bunch.  But, I was generally pretty meh on the sound.  (7/10)Overall Enjoyment: Hal does a great job at setting us up for a journey that we want to see, but the one hour runtime does play a factor in some of the details not being where we want them to be.  For such a strong start, I really wish they followed it up just as well.  There are clear attempts at making the back half powerful - and it will reach some people for sure - but it feels like there are too many gaps in the story to make this an automatic recommendation.

Everything is half-hearted in this show.Long version:I was so excited going into this film. Seeing the Kibuneguchi (貴船口駅) sign set me off, and I knew it had the makings of a beautiful, heartfelt anime... good looking characters, a colorful craft / souvenier shop set in the heart of Gion... what's not to like? It's got the recipe for the perfect love story in Kyoto, and (almost) everybody loves Kyoto. Except that this film wasn't so much about 'love story in Kyoto/Japan' as it was 'mediocre sci-fi fanfic.'Things they should've improved...on to make it a 10/10 in my completely biased and uneducated opinion:- StorytellingOhmygod. This movie could have been almost completely salvaged if it wasn't for the poor storytelling. There is very little information given throughout the movie, so it's hard to follow the story. You're forced to piece together what is even GOING ON with the few scraps of plot 'hints' that you get when the characters fight, make up, whatever.- World-buildingBecause of the focus on Kyoto and surrounding areas, it's easy to believe that this is a movie with a realistic / current day era. There's almost no mention of robots or how advanced AIs came to be and what their purpose is in this movie ... even though the entire movie plot is ABOUT ROBOTS. The main characters discuss it for like two sentences ... and that's it. It left me as the viewer feeling very lost, and I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a sci-fi or romance movie. It didn't really feel like either, it just felt very contradictory and half-hearted. ... like the button.... yeah, pun intended.- CharactersIt was hard to care about any of them, because we don't learn much about each of them beyond the flashbacks that happen. The dynamic that this couple has is a 'well that's nice' but not really inspiring or even ... fun, because it's so predictable. I was actually really disappointed by this part, because I was looking forward to learning more about Kurumi. Someone who sews buttons, dolls, clothes, has entire walls of craft supplies is definitely a soul sister to an artist like myself... but we don't learn anything about why or how she even started sewing. Does she have any other hobbies? Any friends? She must have inherited the home or shop from somebody... but who? I was expecting this movie to have a character I could relate to and support, a new favourite, and Kurumi fell short. I don't think the writers ever gave her or Hal the opportunity to build any depth.Half hearted effort also gets half hearted score from me, so a 5 seems fair. Honestly, if it wasn't for the stunning art and scenes of Kyoto - which was probably prioritized way too much, so that you would forget the lack of poorly-told story... I would even give it a 3.

Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3076/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_SuperS_Specials,"[""I was surprised to see there's anything Sailor Moon left on MAL that nobody has reviewed, so I thought I'd do a quick write-up. The long and short of it is that this is worth watching, especially if you happened to want to see more of Uranus and Neptune, but it's also skip-able and has no important plot points.Originally airing after episode 4 of SuperS, this 1 hour TV special is broken into three 16 minute mini episodes. The first is a simple recap episode of the three seasons prior and you can essentially skip it, it has no new material besides Usagi and Luna's...narration.The second however takes place early in the story of SuperS, shortly after the solar eclipse. It tells what Sailor Uranus and Neptune were up to during this arc (and tries to handwave away their absence from the rest of the season with a brief explanation). The plot itself is a typical Sailor Moon style monster-of-the-week story, but hey, we get to see Haruka and Michiru being their glorious gay selves for a whole 16 minutes and what more can you ask for, we get Haruka being a playboy and Michiru getting jealous, a bit of fluff, and some fight scenes. Perfect.The third on the other hand is protagonized by Chibi Usa who has a vampire monster pretend to be a student at her school. It's purely forgettable filler, the highlight of the whole thing is Ami arguing against the science of using garlic to fight vampires, but nothing about it is particularly bad either (besides, like the rest of SuperS, having its screentime overwhelmingly dominated by Chibi Usa).Really, I'd recommend everyone just watches the second of the three minisodes and calls it a day, unless you happen to *really* love Chibi Usa and desperately want to see more of her. If only because of the Haruka/Michiru focus I give this an overall 7/10. narration.The second however takes place early in the story of SuperS, shortly after the solar eclipse.

For Haruka and Michiru fans especially, you get some of their best scenes together in their special especially with them not being in the SuperS season itself. The episodes are fun and fast paced. They also show off the peak of the dreamy disco artistry that Sailor Moon achieved in later seasons. I definitely recommend giving them a watch. There is nothing too deep that happens, just basic enemy appears/fight plot. They are not to be taken too seriously, just fun filler to grow closer to the characters and get deeper insight. ']"
Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,https://myanimelist.net/anime/586/Ayakashi__Japanese_Classic_Horror,"[""Sadly when I received this series, the information about Japanese Culture which was supposed to be included was not there. This was important in order to receive a fuller understanding of the stories. I tried desperately to get hold of a .pdf file of the information, but sadly I couldn't find it. Although many of the images and symbols probably got lost in the series due to my Westernised mind, despite this I decided it could be a good way for me to interpret it from my standpoint. The stories in itself did not get lost to me and certainly didn't hinder my enjoyment. So...don't be reluctant to watch this series if like me your knowledge in Japanese Culture is lacking.Japanese Horror is well-known to most of popular culture through the Hollywood re-makes such as “The Ring” and “Ju-On”. Ayakashi offers something different to the horror genre by giving us three “classic” tales, by incorporating many symbols and traits of Classic Japanese Tales such as Gods, Demons and the all too famous “Yuurei”. Each story offers a different type of story in the horror genre, which gives you a good taster especially since the whole series is only eleven episodes long.The first of the three is the well-known legend of Yotsuya Kaidan and arguable the most famous Japanese ghost story, which is told with an active narrator (who is the originally the person who penned this story). It has the ingredients for a good horror story: revenge, love, betrayal, murder, and curses. It also has a MacBeth-ian curse.The art style fitted the mood of the story of revenge, but also the ukiyo-e style suited the story as it had been quite famous in kabuki theater at the time it was written. The art alone also lets you know what sort of story it is.There are three things that makes this story stand out: Each character proves his or her own worth to the story, no character is left out or forgotten. They are needed in order for the story to be completed. This is a sign of a good story and partially the reason why Yotsuya Kaidan has become such a classic. The second thing, is the excellent use of imagery throughout the story, although I stated this above that I lacked the knowledge of Japanese Culture to appreciate parts of the story to understand it fully, the imagery I did understand certainly made this story stand out. The third thing which ties into the second is the artful way of telling the story. It was the major reason why I liked this story so much. The way the narrator discussed the idea of horror stories and the way the audience perceived it, the responsibility the author and the audience had towards a story. A theme that always gets discussed again and again is how much you are subconsciously and unconsciously controlled by a story as a writer. It reminded me of one of my favourite quotes by John Fowles, “It is only when our characters and events begin to disobey us that they begin to live.” The last two factors is  what made this re-telling so good, especially since this story has been filmed, put on theatre x-times and now for the first time as an anime. One needs to pull in the audience through other means than just a good plot, in order it to appeal with a classic story. These two components of an active narrator and putting imagery to good use is why I enjoyed this re-telling of Yotsuya Kaidan story so much.The second story is based upon a play from Kyooka Izumi called “Goddess of the Dark Tower”. This centres around the forbidden love between a goddess and a human.This anime represented many of the traits of Kyooka's work such as the supernatural, his narrative style which was similar to traditional rakugo, this can be seen through the two friendly demons and their commentary on what happens in the story, especially at the end of the story. Dramatic dialogues, which were used in kabuki drama is another element of Kyooka's writing, you'll notice this throughout the story. The most striking of all the concepts used in his stories, which is a driving force of the story is that of a beautiful older woman (the goddess) taking care of a young man (the falconer) or that is how I interpreted it. His plays are quite famous in Japan and are still performed now, so this may come to be lost to many Westerners since many of his plays have sadly remained untranslated.This attempt to put one of Kyooka's into anime form was left much to be desired due to one downfall, but a crucial one and that was the timing. His plays are well-known for their complex plot and suspense. It's difficult to build up a complex plot in three episodes and at the same time build-up suspense. The suspense was not completely lost, but certainly much of it lost, as it was lost by fitting it into such a small time constraint. This time constraint became the reason for many of its failings, this is illustrated especially through the characters. I questioned the logic behind the characters' decisions and plot holes,[spoiler] for example how the falconers' girlfriend is able to enter the castle without any of the goddesses noticing, especially since no-one comes back alive and this statement is made pretty clear about the castle. [end of spoiler] The character development also became lost otherwise it might have explained the lack of logic behind characters' decisions. It made the characters forgettable, especially with such a large cast. If it had the full eleven episodes, it might have turned into something worthy instead of something that felt full of gaps.The art certainly made up for the rest, as it had a more optimistic feel compared to the first story. As all in all, it has an optimistic ending or better said it ends on a positive note. Not only that, but the art changes in each part of the story to suit the world it is in. The world of goddesses, the world of humans and the “in-between”. The goddesses with their gorgeous kimonos and the enchanting castle that they live in, the whole place is like a fairy tale from afar, but once you become seduced by all that beauty, it's too late. It's illusion. The art used in the world of humans is clearer and defined with more use of primary colours. No tricks, it gives a sense of what you see is what you get. The “in-between” world is different with everything undefined, as the lines are fainter and the colours blend into together.Sadly this story had been failed due to one component, because of this many viewers would question not only the things I did, but also why is such a story in this collection, although if it had been done under more desirable conditions it would be a horror story, but it comes off more like a fantasy genre fairy tale. The goddesses need for cannibalism appears to be excuse from the directors to call it a horror story and to place it in this collection.Ah, the last arc, the reason why so many people possibly have picked up this anime. Reviewers and people who recommend this series tell others if the other two stories are not to your taste, skip them and watch the last arc: “It's definitely worth it!” Well, everyone, it certainly lives up to its hype, despite the fact that I had the gg version which apparently made a major translation mistake and would confuse viewers. (What this mistake is I have yet to find out.) I will definitely give it merit for being the best of the three.The story is based on the famous “bake neko” or goblin cat from Japanese folklore and is an original story from the writers of this anime. The opening scene already winds you into it, where you see a scene of panic and a mysterious man commenting calmly on the situation, while assessing it at the same time. The story is full of mystery, while you and the medicine seller are trying to find out what has happened, which has caused the grudge of this “bake neko” haunting the family. The first two episodes builds the suspense and let's us get to know each individual and the finale reveals the secret of this family.The arc is full of Japanese folklore and it would have been quite useful for me to have had the .pdf included when I got hold of this series since there was certainly a lot I missed. This is alone seen by the pictures on the wall, this is exemplified when two of the characters speak to each other in the first episode and the camera shoots includes the picture on the wall while the character is speaking. It seems the character is represented by that picture or better said the animal on the wall and the conversation is between the two animals since the second screen shots switches to the animal of the wall and the voice of the character is the only thing heard. As though the animal is speaking and not the person.Once again, the way the story was told was masterful, as it combines it's beautiful and unusual art to tell the story. The way the characters were drawn and the clothes they wore were representations of the characters they were, simply by contrasting the medicine-seller with his air of arcane and the pompous, sake-drinking uncle. The switching of scenes is beautifully done by using the sliding door, a simple but wonderful effect. It's as though you're watching it on stage and the sliding doors are like the curtains. This enhances the effect of the art, with its rice paper overlay effect and the vigorous colours used. It really is like the reviewer Malyrush states a “moving representation of Japanese ukiyo-e”. The background stays still, while the objects that move in that scene move, this can be seen quite clearly in first episode when the medicine seller arrives in the area that you can see the smoke moves, but the rest is still. Beautiful. It would be nice if anime producers and creators would finally break conventions and experiment with art, as beautiful and unusual art like this could be created and be used to facilitate the story-telling like in this final arc.This final story is definitely worth a look, especially if you enjoyed Mushishi. It brings across many of the components that Japanese horror is well-known for, the key element being the idea of “what could be out there”.The music in each story is wonderful, especially in the last arc. But what deserves a special mention is the opening. I'm very picky when it comes to openings and most of the time I skip them because they mostly grate my nerves, but this one. Oh, wow! It starts with traditional Japanese music and then uses that to bring in the rap.. I thought it was quite skilfully done, since combining both genres could have quite easily gone wrong. I absolutely loved it. The opening changed its art every time the arc changed and the best one once again was the final one. Just have a look on youtube for it and you'll see what I mean. The ending was also quite good, but it wasn't quite as good as the opening. It suited the mood of all the stories and used scenes from the episodes you had just watched and also at the same time discreetly previewed the next episode.This series is definitely worth a watch, in particular if you're interested in Japanese culture and history in anyway. All the arcs represent many issues going on in the Edo period, in particular the misogyny, which also represented the powerlessness of lower ranked people. It is also a breathe of fresh air to a lot of anime with its art and its refreshing way of story-telling. If you're looking for something different or want to try a different style of anime give this a look! don't be reluctant to watch this series if like me your knowledge in Japanese Culture is lacking.Japanese Horror is well-known to most of popular culture through the Hollywood re-makes such as “The Ring” and “Ju-On”. Ayakashi offers something different to the horror genre by giving us three “classic” tales, by incorporating many symbols and traits of Classic Japanese Tales such as Gods, Demons and the all too famous “Yuurei”. Each story offers a different type of story in the horror genre, which gives you a good taster especially since the whole series is only eleven episodes long.The first of the three is the well-known legend of Yotsuya Kaidan and arguable the most famous Japanese ghost story, which is told with an active narrator (who is the originally the person who penned this story). It has the ingredients for a good horror story: revenge, love, betrayal, murder, and curses. It also has a MacBeth-ian curse.The art style fitted the mood of the story of revenge, but also the ukiyo-e style suited the story as it had been quite famous in kabuki theater at the time it was written. The art alone also lets you know what sort of story it is.There are three things that makes this story stand out: Each character proves his or her own worth to the story, no character is left out or forgotten. They are needed in order for the story to be completed. This is a sign of a good story and partially the reason why Yotsuya Kaidan has become such a classic. The second thing, is the excellent use of imagery throughout the story, although I stated this above that I lacked the knowledge of Japanese Culture to appreciate parts of the story to understand it fully, the imagery I did understand certainly made this story stand out.

Each arc was done by a different, and then-unknown director, though the director of the third, Kenji Nakamura, went on to make the critically acclaimed series ""Mononoke"" and ""Trapeze"" (He also made [C], though that fails to fall into the previous category). This review will mostly be split up into the three arcs. (NOTE: The R1 release of this series switched the first and second arcs around. This will be...listed in the original order).Arc 1 - Yotsuya Kaidan (episodes 1-4)Yotsuya Kaidan (Yotsuya Ghost Story) is a story based on someone who died in horrific circumstances, due to being wronged by pretty much everybody around her, and manifests as a vengeful spirit, laying a curse on all those responsible. This tale is actually told as a story within a story, as narrated by a scriptwriter adapting it into a play.This arc happens to be the only one based on an actual Japanese tale, but that doesn\'t lend it many favours. It begins on very bad footing, the key reason for it being this: The characters actions make insanely little sense. Every character is a stunningly terrible person with absolutely no train of reasoning to follow. They could not be more one-dimensional if they tried. This was obviously an attempt to make us hate them more, and make the inevitable ramifications of the curse more cathartic, but it\'s done so ham-fistedly that it simply becomes stupid rather than cathartic.Unfortunately, the horror elements that could have made this halfway entertaining are botched as well, as a result of a limited animation budget and some really bad directing causing major corners to be cut, making large chunks of the arc funny instead of horrific. The art isn\'t terrible, but it\'s not impressive either, and it makes itself quite clear on how low-budget it was. There are also frequent live-action sequences as well, which would probably have seemed more impressive if it wasn\'t so obviously yet another corner-cutting method. At the end of it all, we have a poor-quality story with poor quality directing and terrible characters, giving Ayakashi a very bad start. The only redeeming feature of this arc is an excellent monologue in the final episode, detailing the aspects of this as a story in the real world, and how it transcends its existence as a story to be something much more real.Story: 4/10.Characters: 1/10.Production: 3/10.Overall: 3/10.Arc 2 - Tenshu Monogatari (episodes 5-8)Tenshu Monogatari (Goddess of the Castle), in spite of being in a horror anthology, is less a horror story and more a tale of forbidden love. While there are horror elements, courtesy of the Forgotten Gods the arc focuses on, it mainly focuses on one of the Forgotten Gods falling in love with a human rather than, say, the Forgotten Gods eating people as the arc starts off with. However, this change of style is somewhat welcomed after the overblown style of the previous arc.But unfortunately it\'s not very good either.While this arc does fare better than the first, it succumbs to a major pitfall quite common of romance series: We have to actually give a crap about the main characters for it to work. And in the course of a mere four episodes, which are far more plot-focused than they are on characters, this becomes an impossible task. This is a shame, because unlike the last arc, there is actually a halfway decent story to be told here.However, just like the previous arc, this story is damaged by blatant directing issues, corner-cutting, and a low animation budget. And wow, the animation budget really doesn\'t get much lower than this. The animation is amazingly cheap. While this doesn\'t make it funny like it did in the previous arc, it completely nullifies anything the action in this had going for it. Which is sad, because there were obviously some good ideas at hand here. With a decent budget and more episodes to develop the characters in, this could have been good, but sadly this isn\'t the case. So while Tenshu Monogatari manages to be better than the first arc, it still produces nothing of worth and is generally a waste of time.Story: 6/10.Characters: 4/10.Production: 1/10.Overall: 4/10.Arc 3 - Bakeneko (episodes 9-11)Wow. Talk about saving the best for last.The Bakeneko (Goblin Cat) arc is an enourmous departure from the last two arcs in every sense. The first, and most obvious, is that everything in it looks beautiful. Corner-cutting is obviously at hand here, but it is used to the arc\'s benefit in every single way. Its method of corner-cutting is to use an unmoving plaid style similar to that of Gankutsuou. However, it far out-performs Gankutsuou in that sense. The way that the Bakeneko arc is animated makes everything look as though it is a moving Edo-period painting, and is executed flawlessly. But the budget they saved on animation, rather than simply going unspent, is used to create absolutely mind-blowing action sequences.That isn\'t the only aspect of the production that is leaps and bounds ahead of the previous two arcs, however. The directing in the Bakeneko arc is absolutely mind-blowing. The transition in directing quality from one arc to the next is effectively the difference between Tommy Wiseau and Stanley Kubrick. Toei probably weren\'t even trying with the first two, and merely saving their resources for this arc. The amazing directing in this is responsible for the key factor in this arc: It\'s the only one in this horror anthology that is genuinely scary. This is as a direct result of Nakamura handling the tension in this arc amazingly. Every moment of fending off the titular monster is incredibly intense. This is also probably the best example of Monster Delay (not revealing your monster\'s appearance for a long time) that I\'ve ever seen. And as mentioned before, every action sequence is brilliant. This includes what is easily the most beautifully-animated rendition of people being torn to shreds and having their remains splattered across a wall that I\'ve ever seen, to name just one moment.Another aspect of this arc\'s excellence is our main character, The Medicine Peddler/Kusuri-Uri. This arc has taken a lesson from the previous arc in not trying to develop characters in too short a space of time. Instead, Kusuriuri relies on how little we know about him to be an interesting character. His otherworldly appearance, his strange mannerisms, and his charisma all make Kusuriuri an excellent character. But moreso, it is the method with which he needs to slay demons that makes him stand out. For him to be able to unsheathe his sword, he must know three things: The form the demon takes, the truth of how it came into existence, and the reasoning behind the demon\'s actions. Only once he truly understands the demon is he able to exorcise it. This, I believe, adds an excellent layer of depth to this arc.But while the directing behind this arc is certainly its most stunning aspect, it is carried by an excellent story as well. The aforementioned requirements behind unsheathing the sword cause the backstory behind the demon to unfurl, creating a stunning, tragic tale that I daren\'t spoil the details of.Story: 8/10.Characters: 8/10.Production: 10/10.Overall: 9/10.General:The music in Ayakashi is shared between the arcs, and is the only aspect that is consistently excellent between them. The background music is always fitting, is rather excellent, and in the Bakeneko arc\'s case, the absence of outside noise is used to more amazing effect than any of the music is. The only letdown in the case of the music is the opening theme, and even that is only hit and miss. The melody and beat to it is actually extremely good, and is a disturbingly apt mixture of classical Shamisen music and hip-hop, but is unfortunately let down by a terrible vocalist.The acting in the original Japanese is adequate, but mostly unmemorable. But it is still significantly preferable to the dub, which you may recognize as sharing the entire cast of Vision of Escaflowne. And if you ever saw the Escaflowne dub, you should know to stay away. The only character whose performance really matters is that of Kusuriuri, who is given an excellent, otherworldly charm by Takahiro Sakurai in the original track, and is given a terribly normal-sounding performance by Andrew Francis in the dub. In case you didn\'t get the point already, don\'t go anywhere near the dub.Overall, Ayakashi is two thirds poor quality and one third stunning. However, the last third is told in different format in the spinoff series Mononoke, and while I don\'t yet know which version of this arc is preferable, it\'s probably not worth watching the first two arcs of Ayakashi just for this arc as a result.Final Words: The first two arcs are very bad, but the third is amazing. If all of Mononoke is as good as the third arc it may well be one of the best anime ever made.Also Recommended: Aoi Bungaku, MononokeMusic: 9/10.Japanese track: 6/10.Dub track: 2/10.Overall: 6/10. listed in the original order).Arc 1 - Yotsuya Kaidan (episodes 1-4)Yotsuya Kaidan (Yotsuya Ghost Story) is a story based on someone who died in horrific circumstances, due to being wronged by pretty much everybody around her, and manifests as a vengeful spirit, laying a curse on all those responsible.

This, I believe, adds an excellent layer of depth to this arc.But while the directing behind this arc is certainly its most stunning aspect, it is carried by an excellent story as well. The aforementioned requirements behind unsheathing the sword cause the backstory behind the demon to unfurl, creating a stunning, tragic tale that I daren\'t spoil the details of.Story: 8/10.Characters: 8/10.Production: 10/10.Overall: 9/10.General:The music in Ayakashi is shared between the arcs, and is the only aspect that is consistently excellent between them. The background music is always fitting, is rather excellent, and in the Bakeneko arc\'s case, the absence of outside noise is used to more amazing effect than any of the music is. The only letdown in the case of the music is the opening theme, and even that is only hit and miss. The melody and beat to it is actually extremely good, and is a disturbingly apt mixture of classical Shamisen music and hip-hop, but is unfortunately let down by a terrible vocalist.The acting in the original Japanese is adequate, but mostly unmemorable. But it is still significantly preferable to the dub, which you may recognize as sharing the entire cast of Vision of Escaflowne. And if you ever saw the Escaflowne dub, you should know to stay away. The only character whose performance really matters is that of Kusuriuri, who is given an excellent, otherworldly charm by Takahiro Sakurai in the original track, and is given a terribly normal-sounding performance by Andrew Francis in the dub. In case you didn\'t get the point already, don\'t go anywhere near the dub.Overall, Ayakashi is two thirds poor quality and one third stunning. However, the last third is told in different format in the spinoff series Mononoke, and while I don\'t yet know which version of this arc is preferable, it\'s probably not worth watching the first two arcs of Ayakashi just for this arc as a result.Final Words: The first two arcs are very bad, but the third is amazing. If all of Mononoke is as good as the third arc it may well be one of the best anime ever made.Also Recommended: Aoi Bungaku, MononokeMusic: 9/10.Japanese track: 6/10.Dub track: 2/10.Overall: 6/10.', '(the stories portrayed have some graphic images like murder/gore, rape, etc. so watch as your own risk!!) *THIS IS LONG SO READ THE ""IN SHORT""SThe series is split up into three main stories:episodes 1-4: a story about a beautiful woman who falls in love with a man who ends up betraying her, abandoning her and her new born. in an angry rage she kills herself and turns into a vengeful spirit out for revengeepisodes 5-8: a story about the forbidden love between a ""forgotten god"" and a human commonerepisode 9-11: a story about a wandering medicine seller who specializes in finding and vanishing Mononokes (or...restless spirits who cause harm/disease/death). the bride of a family dies on her wedding day at the hands of a mononoke and the medicine seller needs its reason, form, and truth to put the spirit to rest.STORY (7/10):the stories were interesting to say the least (although i admit i have a personal bias towards the last story because it was made into a fantastic spin off called Mononoke, 10/10 would recommend). needless to say episodes 9-11 were perfect. it was equal parts lively, sad, entertaining, and creepy. episodes 1-4 were also very good! i have a think for mythology and folklore so i read up about them and it was refreshing to encounter something i havent come across. it was quite suspenseful and beautifully made. i also loved the effect the cure had on people in japan during the modern era; it reminded me of the cure of MacBeth! 5-8 was my least favorite. it wasnt really much of a horror story but more of a romantic fairy tale. there was really nothing scary or creepy or edgy about it. however it did serve as a nice break in between the other two stories.IN SHORT: all of the stories brought their own flavor in interpreting the folklore but story 2 (episodes 5-8) turned out to be more of a love story. nothing edgy or scary about it.ART (9/10):this is always my favorite category and im anxious to get started (this might be the longest section) so the first story looked very pretty!! the art style depicted the Edo era of japanese art styles and how the characters were drawn resembled people being painted during that time but with obviously a modern twist. it was really creative and they used their dark color scheme to their advantage. the last story had a similar art style as the first (which i adore)! i also love the use of the really bright colors and different patters and designs on objects (it might make some people sick though) animation wise there werent anything to complain about. the last story is my favorite because of the artistically places jump cuts that characters will do for dramatic effect. the second story got pretty low marks. the art style was much different than the other two and it was kind of jarring. as more animation, there was nothing bad about it.IN SHORT: no problems in the animation department. stories 1 and 3 were beautiful homages to the medieval japanese art style. again, story 2 seemed out of place and i found it quite ugly to be honest.SOUND: (7/10)the music was fitting but didnt enhance the scenes. background music should do both. ambient noise was pretty good! the sword and fighting sound effects were pleasing. soundtrack is a different story. the outro music was very pretty but the intro was confusing. rap music wasnt a good way to set the viewer up for what they were about to see in my opinionIN SHORT: pretty but not enough to evoke/enhance an emotion depicted in scenes. intro was jarring and didnt set the viewer up for what they were about to see. outro was beautiful!!CHARACTERS (7/10):no characters really stood out except for the Oiwa chan (vengeful spirit in story 1) and the medicine seller (story 3). every other character was kinda washed over. that doesnt mean the other supporting characters were good and didnt help enhance the story and the experience; they just werent as memorable. The ""forbidden goddess"" had the most depth. she had a back story with some potential and with more time we could have seen her develop into a more meaningful characterIN SHORT: medicine seller was the most bad-ass. the vengeful spirit was the most memorable. the goddess had the most depthENJOYMENT AND OVERALL (7/10):it wasnt too bad. the boredom i felt during story 2 was made up for by the other two stories, but i understand why that story was put in and was put in the middle. it was a good palate cleanser. after watching episode after episode of just gore and terrible scenes, the viewer might bet bored/too disgusted/being to wash over scenes because they all look similar. i enjoyed story 1. i really enjoyed the other two. the length on the stories seemed to fit well, they didnt seem rushed or drawn out.IN SHORT: story 2 was a good palate cleaner between the other two stories. pacing was spot on. it was pretty to look at as well.RECOMMENDATIONS: dont watch this:***if you have a weak constitution***faint heart or are triggered by something like domestic violence (story 1),    gore, rape (story 3), abuse (story 1 and 3).***if you like shonen animes (you will probably be disappointed)watch this if:***you liked being creeped out***you like historical animes restless spirits who cause harm/disease/death). the bride of a family dies on her wedding day at the hands of a mononoke and the medicine seller needs its reason, form, and truth to put the spirit to rest.STORY (7/10):the stories were interesting to say the least (although i admit i have a personal bias towards the last story because it was made into a fantastic spin off called Mononoke, 10/10 would recommend). needless to say episodes 9-11 were perfect. it was equal parts lively, sad, entertaining, and creepy. episodes 1-4 were also very good! i have a think for mythology and folklore so i read up about them and it was refreshing to encounter something i havent come across. it was quite suspenseful and beautifully made. i also loved the effect the cure had on people in japan during the modern era; it reminded me of the cure of MacBeth! 5-8 was my least favorite. it wasnt really much of a horror story but more of a romantic fairy tale. there was really nothing scary or creepy or edgy about it. however it did serve as a nice break in between the other two stories.IN SHORT: all of the stories brought their own flavor in interpreting the folklore but story 2 (episodes 5-8) turned out to be more of a love story. nothing edgy or scary about it.ART (9/10):this is always my favorite category and im anxious to get started (this might be the longest section) so the first story looked very pretty!! the art style depicted the Edo era of japanese art styles and how the characters were drawn resembled people being painted during that time but with obviously a modern twist. it was really creative and they used their dark color scheme to their advantage. the last story had a similar art style as the first (which i adore)! i also love the use of the really bright colors and different patters and designs on objects (it might make some people sick though) animation wise there werent anything to complain about. the last story is my favorite because of the artistically places jump cuts that characters will do for dramatic effect. the second story got pretty low marks. the art style was much different than the other two and it was kind of jarring. as more animation, there was nothing bad about it.IN SHORT: no problems in the animation department. stories 1 and 3 were beautiful homages to the medieval japanese art style. again, story 2 seemed out of place and i found it quite ugly to be honest.SOUND: (7/10)the music was fitting but didnt enhance the scenes. background music should do both. ambient noise was pretty good! the sword and fighting sound effects were pleasing. soundtrack is a different story. the outro music was very pretty but the intro was confusing. rap music wasnt a good way to set the viewer up for what they were about to see in my opinionIN SHORT: pretty but not enough to evoke/enhance an emotion depicted in scenes. intro was jarring and didnt set the viewer up for what they were about to see. outro was beautiful!!CHARACTERS (7/10):no characters really stood out except for the Oiwa chan (vengeful spirit in story 1) and the medicine seller (story 3). every other character was kinda washed over. that doesnt mean the other supporting characters were good and didnt help enhance the story and the experience; they just werent as memorable.

It is written by Nanboku Tsuruya IV, and the story is also narrated by him during the anime.Tenshu Monogatari (episodes 5-8): A story of  a forbidden love between a goddess and human. Zushonosuke, a falconer, falls in love with a woman whom he saw bathing in a lake, without knowing...that she is a forgotten god.Bake Neko (episode 9-11): A wandering medicine peddler arrives in Sakai Clan on the wedding day of the eldest daughter of the family. However the bride dies mysteriously and a ghost begins attacking the house and the other family members. The medicine peddler tries to understand the reason why the creature that attacking the house became a vengeful ghost to kill it.Story (7/10):First of all, this anime must be watched by people who is interested in Japanese culture, as each story have the elements of their original time, or the people who likes classics and historical anime.Yotsuya Kaidan (7/10): It is classic ghost story, so it may not be very unique in 21st century. However 4 episodes makes a good job depicting the original story of Nanboku Tsuruya IV. The story successfully makes Oiwa’s and her sister, Osode’s stories intersect in one point and later concludes without leaving anything out. The writer Nanboku Tsuruya IV himself narrates the story and I liked his narrating voice.Tenshu Monogatari (7/10):  A falconer, Zushonosuke and a goddess falls in love with each other at first sight. The goddess, who is forbidden to love a human, struggles in choosing love and living as a human or to continue living as an immortal entity. I think it would be better if they didn’t just fell in love with each other and meet and talk with each other to develop feelings for one another.I personally liked the words Zushonosuke said to her the most, that living 20-30 years while enjoying your life as a human is far more beautiful than living an infinity like a dead.Bake Neko (9/10): The shortest story in the series, but I loved this one the most. The search for the reason for bake neko to seek vengeance, and revealing the dark secrets of the family members were great to watch. The protagonist medicine seller was also the most impressive character in the series. I will watch Mononoke, another anime he is also the protagonist of, next.Sound (9/10):The soundtracks of the anime are all perfect except one— the opening. I don’t know why they made a rap-like song opening, while making all the songs in anime classical Japanese musics. The ending is also pretty good. I listened a few songs in the anime a dozen times.There weren’t anything odd with the characters’ voices. They were all fit for an anime like this.Art (8/10):The art is pretty good. You feel like you are in the medieval Japan when you are watching this. Nothing looks out of place, and there are of course no colourful eyes or hairs like we often see in animes.Characters (6/10):There aren’t many unique characters. Medicine seller from Bake Neko, who is an exception of this, is the character I liked the most. The goddess and Zushonosuke from Tenshu Monogatari are not very bad either. The characters from Yotsuya Kaidan are the weakest ones comparing to the other two stories.Enjoyment (9/10):Each story is as long as they should be. If it was shorter, the story would be rushed, and if it was longer it would be boring. Only Tenshu Monogatari could be better if it was a bit more longer to give time for the goddess and Zushonosuke to develop feeling for each other.  I never got bored while watching this and finished it in two days.Overall (8/10):The characters are the weakest point of the series, while the sound is the strongest. I recommend this anime to the people who likes history or classics as I have said before. As I am a person who likes both the history and the classics, I absolutely loved this series. But a person who likes only shonen or shojo might be disappointed after seeing my high point for this series. I give an 8/10 for Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror. that she is a forgotten god.Bake Neko (episode 9-11): A wandering medicine peddler arrives in Sakai Clan on the wedding day of the eldest daughter of the family.

But a person who likes only shonen or shojo might be disappointed after seeing my high point for this series. I give an 8/10 for Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror.', 'Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror is a group of three different storylines, of which a couple are adaptations of classic japanese stories. As such, this review will naturally be longer than many I\'ve done before as all three arcs deserve their own review, I believe. Also, not that I have not seen the original versions of the stories told in this series, so I have no prior knowledge of any material covered.The first story told ""Yotsuya Kaidan"" is about a woman being betrayed, and effectively killed, by her husband and her seeking revenge as a ghost. The atmosphere is effective, but the actual attempts at ""horror""...just didn\'t come off as scary or chilling. Part of this is because the characters didn\'t have any room to breath and, as a result their motivations and actions just seemed random at times and another is because the horror felt very very forced.It is possible to develop characters in a short arc, it has been done before in stuff like Aoi Bungaku\'s ""No Longer Human"" story arc so..when you don\'t care about hardly any of the characters, it\'s hard to care if/when they die or whatever. That said, the unfortunate Tamiya Oiwa was at least decently sympathetic and Tamiya Iemon was very very hate able...but there could have been more depth to the side characters as well.The art style and music for Yotsuya Kaidan is very well done. The realistic and dark edge the art has really goes a long way to set the mood the story has, particularly the life like appearance the characters have is agreeable. The music is a great mood setter as well, and the voice acting is great.  Particularly Hirata Hiroaki, the voice of Sanji from One Piece, did a wonderful job as the down right bastard Iemon.The second story arc, Tenshu Monogatari, tells the story of forbidden love between a ""Forgotten God"" name Tomi-Hime and a human named Himekawa Zusho-no-Suke. The Forgotten Gods actually feed on humans and Tomi Hime\'s mother had actually met a sad fate for falling in love with a human as well, so it\'s at least an interesting subject in theory for a story.The problem, once again, is that the characters just don\'t have any depth to them and the actual love story is handled very..sloppily and is just rushed in general. When the viewer doesn\'t connect with the characters in some way, it\'s just really hard to care about their plight or whether they can make it out alive. That said, one interesting thing the story does is how it handles the actual wife of Zusho-no-Suke and how she reacts to his falling in love with a ""demon"" as she calls Tomi-himi. Of course, it isn\'t handled very well in the end but it still is somewhat interesting.Again, the music is very good and the voice work is top notch. Though there really wasn\'t much that stood out particularly well in the vocal department either, but the voice work did fit the characters and such. The art style is a bit different from the first arc, not quite as dark and, well, it doesn\'t hurt the tone of the story much at all. Though the actual animations seemed to take a hit, the art did fit the love story and all.The final story arc, Bakeneko, is as advertised: easily the best part Ayakashi as a whole. Ironically, it is also apparently the only arc to be original to this anime. Part of this is probably because of the fact that the creators could come up with their own story and could do as they wished since they didn\'t have to strictly adapt a famous work and thus were much more creative in their efforts as a result.And, oh boy, does it show. Telling the story of a family being haunted by a cat demon and a certain mysterious Medicine Seller\'s attempt to save said family and put the ""Mononoke"" to rest, Bakeneko is trippy, suspenseful, and oh so engaging. The story is effectively about how and why the demon is attacking the family, with the suspense being built throughout the first two episode and the last one does an excellent job at pure storytelling as you learn the circumstance of the ""Mononoke.""But, definitely one of the high points of this arc is the main character Kusuriuri who is a guy that just oozes cool and is genuinely interesting. You don\'t really learn anything about him, unfortunately, you just sort of get glimpses of his personality and ability. It\'s enough, though, to make the viewer wonder just who the hell is he.The other characters are actually interesting as well, with the families past getting a large amount of development. Ironically, this only serves to highlight the flaws of the other two story arcs as these characters are very well handled in only 3 episodes, which is ONE whole episode less than the others.Visually, Bakeneko is a treat. The art is beautiful, very detailed and does a great job of highlighting the atmosphere of the overall story. The character designs, particularly Kusuriuri, are very stylistic and just incredibly pleasing to the eye and much of the story is actually told through the art which makes the best of the animation medium to help the story. Really, I\'d find it difficult to imagine anyone saying this isn\'t one of the best looking anime out there. The animation is very well done as well, Toei obviously pulled out all the stops here.As far as sound, the music is as excellent as ever and the voice work is great. Sakurai Takahiro does a great job as  Kusuriuri, adding a great deal to his characters mystique and overall charm. The music in the last episode particularly should be commend as it was powerful stuff.Story: 7There is obviously some worth in the overall storyline for these tails as two of them are considered Japanese classics, but it feels as though something was lost during the adaptations. Feeling heavily abbreviated, it\'s just hard to really care about the happenings of Yotsuya Kaidan and Tenshu Monogatari. Though I will say that the formers take on what a story could possibly mean to a author and how a viewer/reader could influence a story is very interesting.Bakeneko\'s tale of a families dark history is just very well done even though it is actually the shortest of the three arcs. The writing was top notch and just did a fantastic job at building suspense.Art: 8Art is top notch for the most part throughout Ayakashi, though it does take a bit of a hit animation wise  during Tenshu Monogatari. Still, for the most part the characters designs and such fit the mood of each storyline and most definitely do not hamper any enjoyment what so ever.Sound: 9Great sound across the board, particularly the OP and ED. Never would have thought rap would work so well for a historical piece, but ""Heat Island""does. The ED song, ""Memento of Spring"", is excellent and is very nicely inserted  into the end of each episode. The music used during the actual episodes are very nicely done, though not exactly memorable. Just good for atmosphere building.Voice acting is great with Sakurai Takahiro and Hirata Hiroaki being particularly note worthy as  Kusuriuri and Iemon respectively.Character: 6The characters\' actions are largely questionable for the first two arcs, the actions they take seem sort of random and can sometimes seem to come out of thin air with no buildup. It feels as though what ever character development that may have been part of the original was cut out and, as a result, the characters and the plot just moves way to fast.Bakeneko has pretty good development considering the story arc is so short, and Kusuriuri is a very interesting character who is great to watch.Enjoyment: 6I spent a good percentage of especially Tenshu Monogatari just randomly check how much time it had left to go each episode, that should say enough about enjoyment right there. I can tell there is a good story hidden inside, it just wasn\'t adapted very well that is painfully obvious. Pretty much the same for the first arc.Bakeneko was, predictably, very entertaining. Interesting characters and plot, along with great art and music add so much to enjoyment.Overall: 6Overall, Yotsuya Kaidan and Tenshu Monogatari are just plain weak and poorly adapted. This is very much worth watching for that final arc though, and I\'d very much say watch this series in it\'s entirety. Who knows? The viewer may enjoy it much more than I did as a whole. just didn\'t come off as scary or chilling.

It feels as though what ever character development that may have been part of the original was cut out and, as a result, the characters and the plot just moves way to fast.Bakeneko has pretty good development considering the story arc is so short, and Kusuriuri is a very interesting character who is great to watch.Enjoyment: 6I spent a good percentage of especially Tenshu Monogatari just randomly check how much time it had left to go each episode, that should say enough about enjoyment right there. I can tell there is a good story hidden inside, it just wasn\'t adapted very well that is painfully obvious. Pretty much the same for the first arc.Bakeneko was, predictably, very entertaining. Interesting characters and plot, along with great art and music add so much to enjoyment.Overall: 6Overall, Yotsuya Kaidan and Tenshu Monogatari are just plain weak and poorly adapted. This is very much worth watching for that final arc though, and I\'d very much say watch this series in it\'s entirety. Who knows? The viewer may enjoy it much more than I did as a whole.', ""The first two arcs are okayish... They weren't very horror, so the sole redeeming factor would be the Bakeneko arc. If I could review it on solely that, I'd give it a perfect 10. But the other two arcs are just a hindrance in my opinion, so I'd just watch the Bakeneko arc. "", 'I had a really hard time deciding how to rate this anime - not just because it consist of three different stories  (having nothing to do with each other), but also because I just had mixed feelings.Story: 9All three stories were great, but seem to be part of the actual Japanese culture, so it wasn\'t something ""new"". Still very good though.Art: 5I was definitely not very impressed with the art in either of the stories (drawn differently!) The first wasn\'t special, though the scenes/backgrounds weren\'t fantastic in it, and I didn\'t really like the way people were drawn - they all looked mean and...scary (not everyone is mean in the story). Not a super-supernatural and odd coloured hair or the like. Much more realistic than many others.Second story was as close to the average anime as we get. Wild hair, some with odd colours, but luckily no excess spark and gloss. More colorful than the first, and the people didn\'t all look mean :b More had been done to create scenes, but again, it\'s not something fantastic or outstanding.Third story - let\'s just say I\'ve never seen that kind of art before. There were so many colours and shapes that it was sometimes hard to distinguish between objects. A constant ""layer"" was in every scene - like it has been drawn on crumpled paper. It also often looked like it was just drawn in 2D - there isn\'t much depth in it.One of the women looked a bit like a black person - big lips and skin more tanned than others\'. Had I only seen a bit of the anime, I would have guessed it to be a comedy.Though, I must say that the art was pretty good at the climax - the art did something to the action scenes.Generally, I really don\'t know if I like it or not. It\'s very unique, but I think it\'s kinda odd.Sound: 5I don\'t even remember much of the soundtrack... I do believe though, that there were some scenes where the background music really made the mood.Charachter: 5I don\'t know... It\'s about 3-5 episodes to each story, so you don\'t really get to know a whole lot about the people, hence I don\'t have much to say.The charachters in story 2 were somewhat interesting though...Enjoyment: 7I did enjoy the show a little after all. The stories were interesting because they seem be part of actual Japanese culture (correct me if I\'m wrong).The first story was gory, the second way more beautiful, more romantic, and the third was Mushishi-ish in plot. Not bad, and I would encourage people to take a look at it, as it is quite interesting, and maybe even more to others than to me.I give it an overall on 7. scary (not everyone is mean in the story).

Written in 1825 as a Kabuki play by Tsuruya Nanboku IV it tells the story of Oiwa and Tamiya. The dutiful wife who was betrayed and her piece of cow dung samurai husband. The way this is presented is a little unusual as we get the author himself narrating the tale and laminating both the events in the play and out of it.Yotsuya Kaidan has gone on to gain a reputation not...unlike that of Macbeth in the west. It the cursed play, don\'t speak it\'s name and make sure to visit Oiwa\'s shrine before you have anything to do with it.Overall this one is the stand out. The drama between the characters, the twists and turns, the added supernatural element all work to produce something haunting.It\'s one failing is attempting to gild the lily in a few scenes. The hair combing one in the play is quiet giving it a haunting feel and far more effective than her screeching through out.To me this was the best one regardless. A complex plot, beautiful art and fluid animation.Story two “Goddess of the Dark Tower” 7/10Adapted from a the Kyooka Izumi play called Tenshu Monogatari (the tale of the keep or castle) is a love story between a god and a human. While Izumi\'s writing often hide social commentary under a thin vail of the supernatural this one was more direct. There are quite a few fable staples like humans/spirits turning into other creatures because it emotionally fits the moment.However there is something lost in translation with this one as the emotions of the play didn\'t carry over. Perhaps it was the timing as the pace was hurried to fit into three short episodes.Over all this one was just ok plot wise, the animation though was rather unusual giving the spirits an unworldly feel in a few scenes.Story three ""Ghost cat"" 5/10Unlike the other two this one is an original tale created for the anime. An exorcist under the guise of a medicine seller visits a house that\'s haunted by -read the title of the story-.Plotwise this is the weakest of the lot, stylistically though the art and animation is the best. I like that there can be more than just one truth. The truth that really is, and the one we tell ourselves.Most hype up this one as the medicine seller (Kusuriuri) is very popular. While I do like the character this one was style over substance.Overall it\'s a 7.5/10. A solid show, whatever your taste is one of the three stories is sure to suit it. unlike that of Macbeth in the west.

They are just simple ghost stories although I don’t know if you would sit around a camp fire and talk about. They are not so much horror stories, as more stories of caution against different things. They seem to have a story that has a lesson at the end.The first story is a sweet story about forbidden love and fallen gods. I’m not so sure why they have the stupid little spirits that keep...laughing. It just seems like a waste to have characters there that are only for comedic affect The story doesn’t need it and they have no purpose in the story that I can see. The story without them is rather beautiful, and the language they use is so high class old Japanese that it has a ring of sophistication in it. The art style is rather nicely done, looking mostly like it was done in this year then 2006. It has gentle lines and the only time it really lacks is when the characters are far away making them look so less detailed. Sometimes they even become blobs of color alone. Music is rather nice, a hunting tone that sets the mood. English voices are pretty well done. Again, not so interested in the crazy spirits that they bring in for comedy. Tomi’s voice is rather nice and pretty much perfect for the character.The second starts interesting with a narrator, supposedly Nanboku telling the play he wrote, calling it the most chilling he had ever written. I’m not sure exactly if it’s chilling or not because the anime version seems a little lacking in the horror. The only thing that makes it any chilling is the fact that he says he was compelled to write it. Ya, real frightening. Unfortunately, the narration breaks whatever tension the story did have and so kills the mood it needed. The artwork is rather odd, showing the characters eyes rather squinted and turned up. It is almost super realistic in a way but then also turned to be cartoonish. It’s not a style I admittedly would like. Sometimes, the characters are also twisted into strange poses and the necks look almost broken. It’s a little two odd for me and I guess it did give me chills on that account. Music is pretty much same as the first one.The third story feels more like a group of opening episodes for a new series called Mononoke. The story follows a medicine peddler who destroys evil spirits but we never get any information about his background or anything about him for any of it. For all we know, he is a spirit himself. The artwork is somewhat interesting, almost a wallpaper or drawn on a piece of parchment like charactering. The faces are well detailed and almost surreal in a way. The characters voices are really nice and though the English voice of the medicine peddler is different then the Japanese, it gives him a little bit more of a sexy voice. I don’t really know if it’s a good thing exactly because it did not have enough time to rub on me although it did not bother me ether. They also make him talk a little more then the Japanese version. Andrew Francis actually made me think he was Crispin Freeman when I first heard him. It was rather good and I would love to hear him more often then the small parts he seems to be getting. Music is like the others, although it brings in some from the Mononoke series to give it a flavor of its own.The opening of each is really nice,  giving the spirit of how old the show is, though gave it also a rap feeling that felt more like it would fit in this timeframe instead of the Endo period. The artwork is rather interesting, changing depending on the show and it always seemed to be the concept art for the characters. The finished pieces with some moving across the frame.

They are mostly horror stories, however I would say the the last two ones were dealt more with mythical phenomenons and were not so scary. Specifically, it is not as scary as Japanese horror movies are a days. However it is kind of psychological and revolves around issues that have some kind of melancholy into them. It is definitely a very good way to learn about Japanese literature while getting entertained.Art:The art is not manga art actually. It resembles ukiyo-e, which is a type of traditional Japanese...way of drawing. Nevertheless the last story has a different type of art and is a prequel to the anime Mononoke. The last stories art is more like manga art but it seems as if the surface in which it was drawn was some kind of wrinkled paper, I don't really know the reasons which the artists decided to make it seem that way but in my opinion it doesn't really look attractive that way, though the characters design was quite pretty.Sound:The sound was mostly Japanese traditional music which made the story more intense and interesting. On the other side I found the ending really nice, because it wasn't completely traditional music, it also seemed to have some elements of more modern music.Character:There wasn't any character development at all, but it seemed like at those times folklore legends/stories didn't really deal with character development (maybe there was some in the second story). Generally these types of stories concentrate more on the topic of revenge and hatred encountered in the plot.The characters were kind of similar between them, I must state that all the stories deal with women that have been deeply hurt because of some man, in one way or another.Enjoyment:Finally I found this show really enjoyable because I learned new things about Japanese culture and their traditional stories while I experienced some of the Japanese classic horror aura which made me think about how it evolved to Japanese modern horror encountered in movies such as Ringu or Hanako-san. way of drawing.

Each of them stands alone and has nothing to do with the other two. They also share a totally different art style, atmosphere, motives and characters for each of these tales.Ayakashi begins with the story called Yotsuya Kaidan. The first episode is horrible, it starts just so boring, and keeps this on until the end of it. But then again, that was easily the worst episode of Ayakashi. The good part starts at the second episode, when some great deaths come past the screen, ending at the fourth episode with a satisfying climax. The...art style is really old-fashoned, though it remains ugly. Though I guess that that was meant to be that way, as the theme of this story is ugly as well. It’s about the evil that humans can accomplish, and these humans eventually get punished. The characters are all horrible bastards, with a few exception, which only makes it more enjoyable to watch when these characters go berserk. Still, even though it was an enjoyable tale, the story itself is mostly one-layered, with a small exception in the second and third episode.Then comes the tale Ten Shu Mono Gatari, and if it wasn’t for the fact that they share both the name Ayakashi, I would’ve been unable to identify it with Yotsuya Kaidan. Ten Shu Mono Gatari is suddenly a love story, the total opposite of its predecessor. The Horror-part of Ayakashi is also nowhere to be found in this story, it’s just a normal human and a supernatural being falling in love with each other. The art looks really nice this time, especially when compared to Yotsuya Kaidan. The first three episodes build up perfectly, and end into a very satisfying climax. Though, I have to say that Yotsuya Kaidan is the better one of these two, as it featured some memorable scenes, and it has chaos included which Ten Shu Mono Gatari misses.Then the third story, Bake Neko, comes. And without a doubt it’s the highlight of the series. The art turns into something really unique, I can only say that I loved it, though it takes some time getting used to. The Horror-part is finally clearly distinctable, and the entire three episodes it consists of turn into an amazing roller-coaster ride with a couple of amazing quiet moments. The characters are each wonderful, and I haven’t even began about the story, which was truly one of the best ones I’ve yet to see.Overall, I’m recommending Ayakashi ~ Japanese Classic Horror. Especially to the ones who love great deaths, though the fans of love-stories will also be satisfied, and even if you’re not one of these people, just give this series a chance. The first episode is what turned most people off, though it you manage to survive that one, you get treated to some brilliant scenes. You can also just skip the first eight episodes, and immediately turn to Bake Neko if you wish, as each of the stories have no relationships with each other. art style is really old-fashoned, though it remains ugly.

Hmmm, I suppose there is not a real equivalent in Western culture, but basically…just as a mortal might attain godhood, so too can a god attain mortalhood. Forgotten gods as they were referred to, although I’d refer to them as decayed gods…as their transcendence from purity to worldly is a transcendence from benevolent to malevolent.Yotsuya Ghost Story; This one was one of...missed potential. It could have been better, but it was not half bad either. An onryo tale; that of an angry vengeful ghost that bears a terrible grudge against its wrongful and grotesque death. Morbidly frightful to be honest, despite its short comings…especially since towards the end they weave the story into its real life relevance in Shinto, Kabuki, and folklore. Which adds a certain creepiness, I definitely do not want to end up dead from watching this!!Goblin Cat; Apparently this one was the more popular of the tales and even got its own spin off series. To be honest, I was not so very thrilled by it. The anime style I did not care too much for and the storyline was rather hard to follow. This tale dealt with a bakeneko, a cat goblin. The cliché’ scenario of course where an assorted party is trapped in a house that is being assailed by ghostly/demonic entities and the only person who can do anything about it is some sort of demon hunter or exorcist sent by providence.All in all; I would recommend these tales to anyone interested in traditional Japanese style ghost stories. Personally, I would say that a movie style format for each tale would have been better then the mini-series style formatting they used for each tale. missed potential.

It's also the series that Mononoke was a spin-off of. Like that series, it's a horror anthology. I really enjoyed Mononoke and I'm hoping that this one will be at the same level. Let's examine it and see.Story:There are three distinct stories in this anime. The first is based off of a classic ghost story by the kabuki playwright, Nanboku Tsuruya IV. The second is based off of a play by Kyouka Izumi. The third is an original story featuring the medicine seller with the same voice as Cloud who we all know...and love from Mononoke. Since these three parts are pretty different and each one has their own strengths & weaknesses, I'm going to be discussing each one separately.The  first four episodes are dedicated to the story of a ronin named Tamiya Iemon. He marries a beautiful young woman, Oiwa but quickly loses interest in her. This results in tragedy and he finds himself haunted by her vengeful spirit. This is easily the weakest story in the anime. It relies pretty heavily on exaggerated melodrama which, to be fair, is pretty normal in kabuki. But, at the same time, the story doesn't come across as a kabuki production in any other way and it can be a bit grating. They also make some changes that don't make sense. A damaging face cream gets changed to an ingested pill so the effect it has no longer makes sense. On the positive side, the way the narrative is tied to its history as a production is pretty interesting. I rather like that take on things.Our second story, which also takes up four episodes, follows a young falcon tamer who loses a falcon he's been training and is forced to go searching for it. In the process, he has a fateful encounter with a hauntingly beautiful woman. Turns out she's a forgotten God who lives in a Keep that's known for having mortals enter but never leave. The biggest flaw with this one is that the romance, which is at the core of the tale, is pretty shallow and under-developed. They meet for all of five minutes and it forges a strong connection and then in the span of a short conversation it turns to full blown huggy muggy love. Maybe I'm just overly cynical and my cold, dead heart doesn't feel love any more, but I call bullshit on that. Especially when he has a fiancée he's presumably known for a long time and spent a far more substantial amount of time with. On the positive side, the story is pretty compelling and the turns it takes are well foreshadowed. The climax is also intense and gripping.Then we have our final story, which only gets three episodes. The Medicine Seller goes to an estate that's preparing for a wedding. Unfortunately for the bride, something slays her as she goes to leave, and not in the sense that she finds it really funny. The household blames our elfin hero, even though he was nowhere near when it happened, but he knows the truth. The house is being haunted by a mononoke & unless he can find its shape, truth & reasoning there will be a lot more casualties. This story is the best of the lot, by far. It follows the same pattern we saw in the Mononoke sequel series. The Medicine Seller encounters a problem with a mononoke. The creature has some connection to its potential victims and finding out the truth behind the situation serves to highlight some of the worst aspects of humanity in a way that's chilling and pretty creepy. The story is full of tension and intrigue. Watching this, it's no surprise that there was a sequel just dedicated to giving audiences more of this sort of thing.Characters:Once again, I'll go from story to story with this.The big issue with the characters in the first story is their motivations. The motivating factors for the characters really don't have verisimilitude. Take our Iemon. He murders someone because he wants to be with Oiwa so much, then grows tired of her within maybe a year for no adequately explored reason. It really comes across as the character actions being based on contrivance to get to the next melodramatic moment.The second story fares better in that regard. Even if the romance is bollocks, our main characters feel somewhat fleshed out and real. The motivations of his fiancée make sense. As do the actions of her advisor and maids. If there's a weakness, it's the lord he serves. The dude comes across as pretty cartoonishly evil, but more extreme in regards to the things he does.The final story is, once again, the best. The Medicine Seller unravelling the facts behind the mononoke attacking them provides insight into the characters who are in danger and it also serves to showcase the karma inherent to the situation. In some ways, we actually end up rooting for the mononoke since some of its potential victims clearly deserve retribution. Then there are the characters we're more invested in and we want to see make it out all right. All of the characters in the situation have relevance to the story and they do come across as actual people. Not good people, in many cases, but people.Art:The artwork in this works really nicely. It's designed to be theatrical and it does shift a bit between stories to better fit the artwork to the narrative. It's a level of polish that I appreciate from an anthology series.Sound:The performances vary. The actors in the first story (Hirata Hiroaki, Koyama Mami, etc...) are a bit prone to exaggeration on account of the nature of the tale. The acting in the second story, featuring  performances by Kuwashima Houko, Midorikawa Hikaru and others, is more nuanced and they are quite good. The final arc, featuring Sakurai Takahiro & Yukana has the most memorable, intense performances. The acting in it goes beyond good and right to bloody phenomenal. In terms of music, the music composition by Takanashi Yasuharu, who worked on Mononke, Gantz & Shiki, is really well done. REMI's chorus work is expertly done. I will say, I didn't like the opening theme tune. Not only is it out of place, but it's kind of annoying. In contrast I really enjoyed the ending theme tune, performed by Hajime Chitose.Ho-yay:There really isn't any to be found.Final Thoughts:For the first story, Yotsuya Kaidan, I would say it's pretty average. It has some significant issues that hold it back, but it also keeps you interested and has some good bits. The second story, Tenshu Monogatari, is pretty good. It's not great, but it's good. The final story, Bakeneko, is excellent and definitely serves as a worthy precursor to the series that came after. So, factoring in all three of them, I'll give Ayakashi a solid 7/10. Next week I'll continue horror anime month with a look at Gyo. and love from Mononoke. Since these three parts are pretty different and each one has their own strengths & weaknesses, I'm going to be discussing each one separately.The  first four episodes are dedicated to the story of a ronin named Tamiya Iemon. He marries a beautiful young woman, Oiwa but quickly loses interest in her. This results in tragedy and he finds himself haunted by her vengeful spirit. This is easily the weakest story in the anime. It relies pretty heavily on exaggerated melodrama which, to be fair, is pretty normal in kabuki. But, at the same time, the story doesn't come across as a kabuki production in any other way and it can be a bit grating. They also make some changes that don't make sense. A damaging face cream gets changed to an ingested pill so the effect it has no longer makes sense. On the positive side, the way the narrative is tied to its history as a production is pretty interesting. I rather like that take on things.Our second story, which also takes up four episodes, follows a young falcon tamer who loses a falcon he's been training and is forced to go searching for it. In the process, he has a fateful encounter with a hauntingly beautiful woman. Turns out she's a forgotten God who lives in a Keep that's known for having mortals enter but never leave. The biggest flaw with this one is that the romance, which is at the core of the tale, is pretty shallow and under-developed. They meet for all of five minutes and it forges a strong connection and then in the span of a short conversation it turns to full blown huggy muggy love. Maybe I'm just overly cynical and my cold, dead heart doesn't feel love any more, but I call bullshit on that. Especially when he has a fiancée he's presumably known for a long time and spent a far more substantial amount of time with. On the positive side, the story is pretty compelling and the turns it takes are well foreshadowed. The climax is also intense and gripping.Then we have our final story, which only gets three episodes. The Medicine Seller goes to an estate that's preparing for a wedding. Unfortunately for the bride, something slays her as she goes to leave, and not in the sense that she finds it really funny. The household blames our elfin hero, even though he was nowhere near when it happened, but he knows the truth. The house is being haunted by a mononoke & unless he can find its shape, truth & reasoning there will be a lot more casualties. This story is the best of the lot, by far. It follows the same pattern we saw in the Mononoke sequel series. The Medicine Seller encounters a problem with a mononoke. The creature has some connection to its potential victims and finding out the truth behind the situation serves to highlight some of the worst aspects of humanity in a way that's chilling and pretty creepy. The story is full of tension and intrigue. Watching this, it's no surprise that there was a sequel just dedicated to giving audiences more of this sort of thing.Characters:Once again, I'll go from story to story with this.The big issue with the characters in the first story is their motivations. The motivating factors for the characters really don't have verisimilitude. Take our Iemon. He murders someone because he wants to be with Oiwa so much, then grows tired of her within maybe a year for no adequately explored reason. It really comes across as the character actions being based on contrivance to get to the next melodramatic moment.The second story fares better in that regard. Even if the romance is bollocks, our main characters feel somewhat fleshed out and real. The motivations of his fiancée make sense. As do the actions of her advisor and maids. If there's a weakness, it's the lord he serves. The dude comes across as pretty cartoonishly evil, but more extreme in regards to the things he does.The final story is, once again, the best. The Medicine Seller unravelling the facts behind the mononoke attacking them provides insight into the characters who are in danger and it also serves to showcase the karma inherent to the situation. In some ways, we actually end up rooting for the mononoke since some of its potential victims clearly deserve retribution. Then there are the characters we're more invested in and we want to see make it out all right. All of the characters in the situation have relevance to the story and they do come across as actual people. Not good people, in many cases, but people.Art:The artwork in this works really nicely. It's designed to be theatrical and it does shift a bit between stories to better fit the artwork to the narrative. It's a level of polish that I appreciate from an anthology series.Sound:The performances vary. The actors in the first story (Hirata Hiroaki, Koyama Mami, etc...) are a bit prone to exaggeration on account of the nature of the tale.

Next week I'll continue horror anime month with a look at Gyo."", 'This is an anthology of three stories. The first two, Yotsuya Kaidan and Tenshi Monogatari, each consisting of 4 episodes, are both adaptations, though I can\'t vouch for whether or not they are faithful. The final segment, Bakeneko, at only three episodes, appears to be an original story, though just as with the other two, it\'s influenced by Japanese folklore and pre-20th century Japanese art periods.Although there might be some important distinctions between the terms, Ayakashi is similar to the word Yokai, which is a type of demon or spirit. Like most anime listed as horror, these are probably not stories a person into western,...or even eastern, horror would seek out. Yes, they have demons, ghosts, violence and gore, and are rather grotesque, but they\'re really more discernible as supernatural tragedies.To begin with, the opening for the series features the strange choice of a rap song with Japanese-styled background music. The Samurai Champloo creators were able to make the hip-hop tracks fit the show, despite the music style and time period being anachronistic. Here, it\'s just odd and the song doesn\'t mesh well at all. The ending theme and other music tracks are much more appropriate and fit the darker tone of the episodes.Yotsuya Kaidan is a tragedy with very reprehensible characters. Most of them are highly immoral and cruel. Probably the only remotely sympathetic characters are the child and the two exploited women. This particular story bears somewhat of a resemblance to Masaki Kobayashi\'s Kwaidan anthology, with the rejected wife of the callous and ambitious samurai dying and becoming a vengeful spirit.However, it manages to become fairly convoluted with its two intersecting stories and multiple plot twists. There are some loose threads, such as the grownup child appearing in one scene and never appearing again. But worst of all is that none of the characters are compelling, and whether they are wicked or sympathetic, they\'re all equally flat. As it is unlikely for most viewers to become invested in the plight of the characters, the tragedy that permeates the piece remains hollow, if not completely artificial.The animation is generally as good as it needs to be for such a story, though it obviously never rises to the level of Hakkenden or Akira. The production design is striking in many scenes, most notably the dusk scenes where the male protagonist leaves everything behind. The contrast of the saturated red sky and the silhouetted surroundings, with some selective illumination upon a solitary grave, is very ominous. Lightning is also used to excellent effect. All of the scenes at the house surrounded by graves are also visually striking.As enjoyable as I found the adaptation to be at times, it all feels rather pointless by the end. A very standard revenge story once you peel away all of the aesthetic flourishes. It seems the writer felt the same way—that the story didn\'t hold up on its own—for he employed metanarrative devices by the end. Each episode has a narrator, who enters into the story very directly after what should be the end sequence. Alongside live action footage, occasionally with bits of animation, he meditates on the nature of the story being told. Essentially, the ghost is to the characters as the story is to those who experience it. Yet this element doesn\'t mesh very well and seems more like a half-baked idea than anything profound.Tenshi Monogatari is a tale of a human and a demon-like woman (referred to as a ""forgotten god"") falling in love. The woman is the head of a female clan responsible for devouring humans. The man is attempting to climb the ranks of society and also has a wife (or mistress). Both characters have something to lose that provides conflict throughout, and there is an exploration of the demonic becoming more human and vice versa.It\'s a predictable story every step of the way, featuring saccharine music for the romantic parts, along with a happy end that had me snorting milk. The production design is rather solid, especially in the first episode. It\'s clear that by the end there\'s too much going on to be animated effectively.The highlight is the third segment, a mystery about a botched wedding of two affluent families and a medicine seller who possesses magical means to vanquish a cat spirit that begins haunting the family, but before he can unlock his powers, he has to solve the mystery behind the spirit. This spawned a series called Mononoke the next year, featuring the medicine seller (as well as the maid, Kayo, in one arc) and the same distinct style, reminiscent of a luridly colored Ukiyo-e painting in motion. Similar to Gankutsuou, the animation is never distractingly bad, but it\'s the artwork that carries it. The story isn\'t anything terribly original, but it\'s a well-presented mystery. The pacing is also much tighter than the other stories because of its shorter length, though it may leave the piece feeling slightly rushed.For fans of Mononoke or anyone who is intrigued by the art style and presentation of Bakeneko, the preceding segments can be skipped, as they\'re all independent stories.

', 'When I started watching Ayakashi, I did not have any high hopes for it. Horror as a genre is not easy to pull off successfully. But Ayakashi was pretty good at what it does. It is not the kind of horror that scares you or disturbs you, but it does leave a strong impression on you. It is probably more reasonable to classsify it as an anthology of tragic dramas than a work of horror. All the stories are set in the classical Japanese period and they accurately portray the cruel and harsh conditions of that era. The horrifying elements are not that of the...paranormal monsters but rather of the violence and cruelty that is part of the humans.The animation is pretty good, especially in the ""Bake Neko"" segment with some pretty unique artwork. The background score is pretty much on the mark, creating the appropriate atmosphere to complement the plot. ED track is among my favorites. I was instantly hooked the first time i heard it. The Characters are what make the story intriguing. It becomes all the more significant during the ""Bake Neko"" part which is more or less a whodunit thriller. Can\'t wait to check out ""Mononoke"" which is a spin-off from ""Bake Neko"" segment.If you are a fan of anime set in edo era, be sure to add Ayakashi to your collection.

It is binge-worthy in my opinion.', 'Where three groups of writers given ""Japanese Classic Horror"" as a prompt, and this the end result? It\'s a possibility seeing how each story uses a different writing style, and even a different art style.The first story, Yotsuya Kaidan, is a classic Japanese ghost story that has been adapted into a play, a few films, and now in anime. The art style is that of a dark anime series (which fits the tone perfectly), and the writing style is that of an older story. Funny thing is, Yotsuya Kaidan is the only one of thee stories that has narration. Of course, the narration is about...the author of the original play and whether or the Curse of Oiwa is still around.The second story, Tenshu Monogatari, is based on a kabuki play, but unlike Yotsuya Kaidan, it both looks and feels contemporary. Even if Ayakashi is your introduction to Tenshu Monogatari, you might get this feeling like you\'ve seen it before. I mean, it\'s not like there aren\'t other stories about a romance between a human and a deity.The third and final story, Bake Neko, is actually an original story (about traditional Japanese creature), but it\'s told in a way that feels like classic storytelling. The art style seems like it\'s halfway between kamishibai and anime, and it\'s beautiful! Now, Bake Neko got three episodes, when the other two got four. However, the medicine seller got his own twelve episode series, which is just as good.SHORT VERSION:Yotsuya Kaidan - Extremely good, would highly recommend.Tenshu Monogatari - Meh, nothing to impressive, but no badBake Neko - Highly recommended, don\'t miss it! the author of the original play and whether or the Curse of Oiwa is still around.The second story, Tenshu Monogatari, is based on a kabuki play, but unlike Yotsuya Kaidan, it both looks and feels contemporary.

I hope I don't get cursed and nor do the producers(just kidding!) I really like the way it shows ancient Japanese folklore and culture, it's superbly portrayed and scripted with additional trivia.Story 2: Inevitable plot from the beginning. Slightly boring, could have been condensed into fewer episodes. Didn't really like the story, hence I'm giving it a lower overall rating .Story 3: Amazing! the theme is about how humans can be more cruel than demons and things like morality are shown in a very creative yet smooth way.Overall: It's a nice series of stories, really like the art and sound, it's...pleasing and has a grace to it all which is difficult to put into words. A good traditional horror in short! pleasing and has a grace to it all which is difficult to put into words. A good traditional horror in short!"", ""It's a shame that nowadays shows like “Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror” are on the verge of extinction for how different the storytelling varies between a normal standalone show and one that pacts along multiple stories each with its own context.With the word “horror” in the title, it was probably something they added in the English translation to add more intrigue to the series, I was personally drawn to it with simply reading that word alone, goes to show how effective and clever that methods of selling something is, but it turned out nothing more than a sneaky click bait. A bait set up way back...in 2006 and still did its number on me, but that was nothing compared to the impact some of the presented stories had, and given their origin is several centuries ago is only more astonishing.“Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,” tells three different stories from the of a traditional Japanese background that deals heavily on supernatural and spiritual concepts, something that still today far fetched and questionable to tackle. But as they say, not every apple in the barrel is a divine one.Story (7.8/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Stories of revenge have always been told by masses, probably because how relatable of a motive it is for most human beings, but not every outcome of it is served tidely. As cold as it philosophy behind it, it remains quite cheesy most of the time and hard to buy, and most of the time, easy to grasp. Person A holds grudge against person B and sets for revenge, it's how it's always been, so simple and yet unforgiving, right?Yotsuya Kaidan took a more complicated approach to that by introducing a lot of key characters and a wider conflicting timeline of events by not only discussion a revenge quest but managing two related stories of the same depth with twists almost every ten minutes worth of material that it becomes quite predictable and overwhelming later on, it really wears out the storytelling and makes it somewhat less interesting, like how fast major turnouts are introduced. Had it been a longer series, it would have definitely worked out for the better.Tenshu Monogatari (7/10): Love stories are probably the most common type of storytelling that comes from tradition, it's not only a source of honesty and pride but also a drug that renders the most honorable of men into a brainless addict looking for the sweet overdose of meth that is his lover.What started as a casual honest Samurai with a respectable wage, and a loving girlfriend, ended up as a controversial cheater of a kind he never predicted. The story felt pretty plain for the most part, but it was the execution that made it stand out a little bit.Bakeneko (8.5/10): Probably the only faithful entry out of the three for the word “horror” in the series' title. As short and concise as it was, started out of nowhere and made itself wrap up very quickly making you begging for more (Mononoke is a spin-off of this 3 episodes long tale, thank God there is more.). Both horrifying and saddening, and at the same time beautiful (Visually, more on that later) and fun, it tackles the story of a mysterious medicine seller that tries to exorcize a monster targetting a select members of a household, trying his best to drag the darkest secrets they were keeping, the secrets that made the monster look nothing more than a cute kitten compared to what they truly were.Art (6.6/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (7.5/10): In my opinion, out of the three stories, this one had the most realistic artistic choice, not only its use of dark colors and gloomy lighting and shading was toned down to compliment the portrayed era, but people's anatomy and facial expressions were more or less on point with the heavy use of Japanese attire of course. Speaking about the art style here and not the animation, as the latter was an entirely other story while nothing mind-blowing, it managed to keep you focused on what's important.Tenshu Monogatari (4.5/10): This series was seriously a let down when it came to visuals, and the visual alone is probably the most important aspect that an Anime should master, not only is it the magnet for a new audience but it's what carries the plot ahead. The character anatomy was just horrible, talking here about the faces, most the most part, they were distorted and poorly traced, they felt very cheap and lazy, and that's not to talk about the bad use of colors and shading, it was like setting up a high value for gamma output on an old display device, it was just horrible. Could as well make it to my top-poorly-animated list.Bakeneko (8/10): While not as realistic as the first story's, Bakeneko is definitely the winner here, talking artistically. Everything felt like staring at an old Japanese abstract painting that has taken some beating from time.However, don't let the old atmospheric touch of weariness fool you because it can suddenly fill the screen with beautifully animated frames that make your eyeballs almost jump out and eat the sweet candy it sees in front of it.I'm talking about some serious webgen level animation that might sound from this paragraph like it won't fit the portrayed style, but believe me, that was some of the best-animated sequences I've seen.Sound (8.1/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (8/10): The soundtracks in this one highlighted the revenge aspect tackled by the story very well and that didn't fall short on delivering a great performance from the voice acting cast's part, they surely were some talented individuals.Tenshu Monogatari (8/10): Despite the poor production animation-wise, they really did this show justice when it came to vocals in general that I feel like the voice acting cast did the series a great deed by having it finally stand on its own, some great performances those were, the sound of a desperate couple confessing, the madness on a wife watching her husband cheating on her, all of those feelings were just so natural.Bakeneko (8.5/10): The medicine seller's voice actor, need I say more? And that's not to say that the others fell short on delivering, well, he was surely the stare of the performance, the way he calmly talks, it highlights how the animation had his face muscles move, you could almost swear the said frame is alive and consciously talking. The sound effects were another thing. They had a heavy use on scattered camera focus to help convoy the horror element of the story, and sound effects played a huge role in racing that to being even more impactful and horror-worthy. Nothing of the cheesy jump scares sfx or anything like that.Character (7.1/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Just what I like about a well-written plot. Interesting enough character to complement the events, I mean, if you're doing a world-class commercial, you're best to have a modal feature your merchandise than a normal fella passing through the street.As wide as the character cast was, and given the complex background they came from, even for a western head that's foreign to the Japanese culture was able to connect and understand their motive. Most of them at least is a well developed and fleshed out as both key and side characters.The bad folks aren't bad just because, they are given a reason, something that defies the classic rotten bad guy, after all, everyone is born pure but then decides what route to take.Tenshu Monogatari (6/10): I mean, I want to say that I've seen more interesting wooden planks, mostly for how amusingly humiliating it is, but also for how really blunt a character they were. Aside from the Goddess Tomi Hime, we never got any characters that actually explained their origins to back up their decisions later, and even the Goddess after fleshing out herself still didn't make any sense for how she ended up like and how everybody involved just coped with it. A lot was left open for interpretation and it wasn't even justified why.Bakeneko (7.5/10): I would have loved if they presented more intriguing figures, the medicine seller was really one of a kind, without a doubt, the best character from all of the stories. But one character couldn't possibly make an excuse for every other character, right?Enjoyment (7.5/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (7.8/10): It was certainly more of a chore at the beginning to keep up with complex Japanese names (I'm from an entirely different cultural background myself, so no wonder), but once you get past that, you get a lot of thrilling moments and shocking plot twists. Very immersive, just the type of show that gets better and better on every re-watch as you get more familiar with the characters and the historical background of the told story.Tenshu Monogatari (6.5/10): Not quite as good compared to the other two, but still a better love story than Twilight for sure. The characters were far interesting for me to care about and the art style and animation didn't help either.Bakeneko (8.3/10): I was totally treated to something I never was ready for. Before diving into it, I had the first story “Tetsuya Kaidan” as my favorite, but as soon as I got into it I knew that wasn't the case anymore. This story did a lot of things right and it was only 3 episodes, the shortest one out of the three. I loved the medicine seller as a character and I adored the premise behind the story and the theme it handled perfectly. If I was going to recommend this series, Bakeneko is probably going to make 70% of the decision.Overall (7.4/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (7.8/10): Really amazing revenge story with its own twists and unique conclusion that breaks the fourth wall even, a definitive classic for me.Tenshu Monogatari (6.4/10): It did not leave a good taste in my mouth, and I would probably end up forgetting about it in a matter of months, if any time I'm re-watching the series, this certainly wouldn't be something to look forward to.Bakeneko (8.1/10): Certainly one of my all-time favorites now, and I would totally re-watch it like crazy from this point on.If you're going to watch the series, I highly recommend watching all three arcs on your own decision and decide for yourself, after all, I could just be a sucker for real horror and not so much for romance, you can never know. in 2006 and still did its number on me, but that was nothing compared to the impact some of the presented stories had, and given their origin is several centuries ago is only more astonishing.“Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,” tells three different stories from the of a traditional Japanese background that deals heavily on supernatural and spiritual concepts, something that still today far fetched and questionable to tackle. But as they say, not every apple in the barrel is a divine one.Story (7.8/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Stories of revenge have always been told by masses, probably because how relatable of a motive it is for most human beings, but not every outcome of it is served tidely. As cold as it philosophy behind it, it remains quite cheesy most of the time and hard to buy, and most of the time, easy to grasp. Person A holds grudge against person B and sets for revenge, it's how it's always been, so simple and yet unforgiving, right?Yotsuya Kaidan took a more complicated approach to that by introducing a lot of key characters and a wider conflicting timeline of events by not only discussion a revenge quest but managing two related stories of the same depth with twists almost every ten minutes worth of material that it becomes quite predictable and overwhelming later on, it really wears out the storytelling and makes it somewhat less interesting, like how fast major turnouts are introduced. Had it been a longer series, it would have definitely worked out for the better.Tenshu Monogatari (7/10): Love stories are probably the most common type of storytelling that comes from tradition, it's not only a source of honesty and pride but also a drug that renders the most honorable of men into a brainless addict looking for the sweet overdose of meth that is his lover.What started as a casual honest Samurai with a respectable wage, and a loving girlfriend, ended up as a controversial cheater of a kind he never predicted. The story felt pretty plain for the most part, but it was the execution that made it stand out a little bit.Bakeneko (8.5/10): Probably the only faithful entry out of the three for the word “horror” in the series' title. As short and concise as it was, started out of nowhere and made itself wrap up very quickly making you begging for more (Mononoke is a spin-off of this 3 episodes long tale, thank God there is more.). Both horrifying and saddening, and at the same time beautiful (Visually, more on that later) and fun, it tackles the story of a mysterious medicine seller that tries to exorcize a monster targetting a select members of a household, trying his best to drag the darkest secrets they were keeping, the secrets that made the monster look nothing more than a cute kitten compared to what they truly were.Art (6.6/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (7.5/10): In my opinion, out of the three stories, this one had the most realistic artistic choice, not only its use of dark colors and gloomy lighting and shading was toned down to compliment the portrayed era, but people's anatomy and facial expressions were more or less on point with the heavy use of Japanese attire of course. Speaking about the art style here and not the animation, as the latter was an entirely other story while nothing mind-blowing, it managed to keep you focused on what's important.Tenshu Monogatari (4.5/10): This series was seriously a let down when it came to visuals, and the visual alone is probably the most important aspect that an Anime should master, not only is it the magnet for a new audience but it's what carries the plot ahead. The character anatomy was just horrible, talking here about the faces, most the most part, they were distorted and poorly traced, they felt very cheap and lazy, and that's not to talk about the bad use of colors and shading, it was like setting up a high value for gamma output on an old display device, it was just horrible. Could as well make it to my top-poorly-animated list.Bakeneko (8/10): While not as realistic as the first story's, Bakeneko is definitely the winner here, talking artistically. Everything felt like staring at an old Japanese abstract painting that has taken some beating from time.However, don't let the old atmospheric touch of weariness fool you because it can suddenly fill the screen with beautifully animated frames that make your eyeballs almost jump out and eat the sweet candy it sees in front of it.I'm talking about some serious webgen level animation that might sound from this paragraph like it won't fit the portrayed style, but believe me, that was some of the best-animated sequences I've seen.Sound (8.1/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (8/10): The soundtracks in this one highlighted the revenge aspect tackled by the story very well and that didn't fall short on delivering a great performance from the voice acting cast's part, they surely were some talented individuals.Tenshu Monogatari (8/10): Despite the poor production animation-wise, they really did this show justice when it came to vocals in general that I feel like the voice acting cast did the series a great deed by having it finally stand on its own, some great performances those were, the sound of a desperate couple confessing, the madness on a wife watching her husband cheating on her, all of those feelings were just so natural.Bakeneko (8.5/10): The medicine seller's voice actor, need I say more? And that's not to say that the others fell short on delivering, well, he was surely the stare of the performance, the way he calmly talks, it highlights how the animation had his face muscles move, you could almost swear the said frame is alive and consciously talking. The sound effects were another thing. They had a heavy use on scattered camera focus to help convoy the horror element of the story, and sound effects played a huge role in racing that to being even more impactful and horror-worthy. Nothing of the cheesy jump scares sfx or anything like that.Character (7.1/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (8/10): Just what I like about a well-written plot. Interesting enough character to complement the events, I mean, if you're doing a world-class commercial, you're best to have a modal feature your merchandise than a normal fella passing through the street.As wide as the character cast was, and given the complex background they came from, even for a western head that's foreign to the Japanese culture was able to connect and understand their motive. Most of them at least is a well developed and fleshed out as both key and side characters.The bad folks aren't bad just because, they are given a reason, something that defies the classic rotten bad guy, after all, everyone is born pure but then decides what route to take.Tenshu Monogatari (6/10): I mean, I want to say that I've seen more interesting wooden planks, mostly for how amusingly humiliating it is, but also for how really blunt a character they were. Aside from the Goddess Tomi Hime, we never got any characters that actually explained their origins to back up their decisions later, and even the Goddess after fleshing out herself still didn't make any sense for how she ended up like and how everybody involved just coped with it. A lot was left open for interpretation and it wasn't even justified why.Bakeneko (7.5/10): I would have loved if they presented more intriguing figures, the medicine seller was really one of a kind, without a doubt, the best character from all of the stories. But one character couldn't possibly make an excuse for every other character, right?Enjoyment (7.5/10):Yotsuya Kaidan (7.8/10): It was certainly more of a chore at the beginning to keep up with complex Japanese names (I'm from an entirely different cultural background myself, so no wonder), but once you get past that, you get a lot of thrilling moments and shocking plot twists. Very immersive, just the type of show that gets better and better on every re-watch as you get more familiar with the characters and the historical background of the told story.Tenshu Monogatari (6.5/10): Not quite as good compared to the other two, but still a better love story than Twilight for sure. The characters were far interesting for me to care about and the art style and animation didn't help either.Bakeneko (8.3/10): I was totally treated to something I never was ready for.

They even have differences in their art style, making it even more difficult. So I'll just mention my opinion of each story below.The first arc, a famous revenge story named Yotsuya Kaidan, is my least favorite. I can say, however, that it is dramatic and that revenge is served in the end. It has an overall grim and depressing tone, and if you're not in the mood for that I would suggest you skip it. It's definitely horror to the core.The second arc is more of a...tragic love story between a human and a spirit. This one is quite depressing as well, but it has moments of comedy thanks to a pair of side characters and there is more positivity in general. The art and colors are less grim than the first arc and is definitely an upgrade from the previous episodes.The third arc is most likely the reason people watch this series. The story about the bakeneko and medicine seller is a leap above and beyond the previous two. The artstyle and colorful decor and outfits more than make up for the darkness in the previous two stories. Not only that, but there is some mystery and tense dialogue that carries the episode along. The character and style proved popular enough to warrant an anime of its own called Mononoke.All in all it was entertaining enough, if only because it's different in content from most animated series I have seen so far. tragic love story between a human and a spirit.

This is the one that visually aged the most of all parts, nonetheless it tells an interesting tale with an satisfying twist. Its story unveils at a very slow pace and is the most gory of the three, as such it's the one that's the hardest to recommend and if one of those sounds unappealing then...it's probably best to skip it.Tenshu Monogatari is source material for second arc, also based on a classical play. A visual shift can be noticed since previous story, mostly with character designs. Pacing is a lot faster with this part, I'd recommend watching all of it in one go, more like a movie than part of a show. I won't spoil story too much, it's a tragic romantic tale with striking scenery and appealing character designs.Bakeneko, unlike previous arcs is named after a supernatural creature. It's the most well-known of the stories due to existence of Mononoke, a successful spin-off to Bakeneko that retroactively made this series more popular. It's a story of wandering medicine vendor whose talents extend dealing with supernatural beings known as mononoke, one of them being bakeneko. Visually it's the most striking of the 3 stories, it has its own distinct art style similar to the likes of gankutsuou. Main theme of this story is mystery behind creation of the titular mononoke.All those stories can be enjoyed on their own and offer different experience with Bakeneko being a clear step-up in terms of quality and storytelling, despite that I'd still recommend all of them depending on viewer's preference and tastes. it's probably best to skip it.Tenshu Monogatari is source material for second arc, also based on a classical play.

So I was surprised to hear it was actually a spin-off from this series. I was able to fine all the subbed episodes since the dubbed unfortunately didn’t sit well with me.** I listen to both subbed anime and dubbed depending which sounds better**So I watched everything with a friend. For the most part  we were waiting for the medicine seller. The first story was pretty interesting especially since it is an adaptation of an actual story that even has a wikipedia and other sources. I do know...a person’s wrath has no bounds. Ep. 1 -4The second story was okay a bit bittersweet romantic for my taste all that star crossed lovers kinda thing. That was fine though I will admit the demons in the story were interesting I would have loved more lore. Ep. 5-8 I guess to sum it There’s a gaining of humanity but a loss if different ways.The final story, oh that made me realize why Mononoke came to be the spinoff it came to be. The art style, the mystery, the slight humor, and the medicine vendor, loved it. Just loved it. It really does stand out on it’s own. Honestly, it could have been added to the spin-off or something. Ep. 9-11I feel like the series as a whole was fine. Though, admittedly I might have had too much hope because, I watched Mononoke first. Probably if I had watched this first I wouldn’t have been a bit let down but I think I’d like Mononoke just the same, maybe I’d be less harsh in reviewing this series, not sure. Though I can truthfully say this isn’t a dire must watch series. Though it’s interesting, especially if you like folklore. a person’s wrath has no bounds.

We don’t have a rich history or a deeply embedded culture. We don’t have folklore, other than bigfoot. Any stories we hear originate from other cultures and countries, or are otherwise books like Frankenstein. And so I find the cultures of other countries very interesting, and mostly because of Ghibli, Japanese culture has especially captured my attention. My favorite movie of all time, The Tale of The Princess Kaguya, is an adaptation of an ancient Japanese folktale. And so while the first 2 stories of this anthology show adapting Japanese horror tales could be considered...just mediocre, I found them to be very enticing. This show may very well deserve to be lower but just because of the folktale vibes it gave off, I highly appreciated this show.Yotsuya Kaidan (Episodes 1-4) (6/10): Woman gets betrayed by her shit husband, becomes a vengeful spirit. This tale is very cliche and kind of cheesy. It’s hard to be scary with this low budget animation. It’s an intriguing tale but it really is just kind of average. In the latter half of the last episode for this part, they were explaining the history of the tale and its meanings and it was the most interesting part of the arc. Still it wasn’t bad and as I stated before, even though it was mediocre I was enticed. I have a certain appreciation for generational verbal stories like fairy tales so it’s cool that they get to be animated.Tenshu Monogatari (Episodes 5-8) (7/10): This story was less ‘scary’ but more gripping. It’s a sort of romance between a forgotten goddess which eats humans and a human who brings her out of loneliness. The themes are a lot more gripping and interesting then the first tale, having to do with humanity and immortality and the likes. It’s bittersweet and the finale was incredible. Still a bit cheesy and cliche but this is so fairytale-like that it’s enthralling.Bakeneko (Episodes 9-11) (9/10): Easily the most creative and captivating tale. The animation style is so intriguing, it makes sense that they made a spinoff for this arc in particular (Mononoke). The medicine peddler is such an interesting character and the story is gripping and just so fucking mystical and cool. Looking forward to Mononoke. just mediocre, I found them to be very enticing.

Looking forward to Mononoke.', 'I\'m gonna be real with you here and say that the only reason I watched this was because I wanted to watch Mononoke and the completionist in me would not let me even gaze upon its first episode without watching this first. And technically I could have just watched the last three episodes but as I said: a completionist.Sadly the pdf that was supposed to accompany the episodes wasn\'t on the website I was using so I had to rely on my own limited knowledge of Japanese culture and of course strategic google searches.I honestly went into it with an open mind, pretty excited too...since an anthology of traditional horror stories is music to my inner sophisticated wannabe goblin\'s ears. It is definitely a mixed bag. While the last story is the best one, the first two aren\'t bad per se but they are definitely lacking, especially compared to the Bake Neko.The best way to review them is by talking about them individually so that we shall do. I\'ll try to avoid spoilers but a few might come up here and there so I\'m giving a warning in advance :""Yotsuya Kaidan"" (episode 1-4)A retelling of the famous story, written by the 18th century kabuki playwright Nanboku Tsuruya IV. In the anime, Nanboku himself becomes the narrator. He at first laments on why he is retelling the story he wrote and every episode of this arc opens like that. At the final episode we learn why that\'s happening and while it\'s very interesting from a storytelling point, it is a little clumsily executed. Just like the rest of this story.While it IS a horror story, a lot of the ""horror"" elements aren\'t executed very well. Which is a pity since the story and the way they chose to tell it is very interesting (the cynic in me says it\'s just toei being toei but alas). The animation is lackluster, to say the least. There are no interesting shots, it doesn\'t flow smoothly and the color palette is just drab and boring, with no distinct feeling to it. But the character design is very unique and reminiscent of Ukiyo-e style art that at least gives it a bit of personality.Nitpicks include: How Iemon ""killed"" Oiwa. He did conspire against her and while her death was caused by grief and betrayal and all those fun emotions, it was accidental. Maybe I\'m just an idiot and don\'t get it which is very possible mind you, but he didn\'t ACTUALLY kill her. Was he the absolute worst husband and actually DID conspire to kill her? Yes. Is it just a phrasing/translation thing? Yeah, probably and I do hate that of everything THIS was my hyper fixation.Also, the way she dies makes no sense to me. Like the sword was stuck on the wall, the sharp side towards it and all... how did she slice her neck on the dull side? And how did she cut it so deeply that she just dropped dead immediately?The sound design is also something that confused me, to say the least. While the music and voice actors were decent and the swords when drawn made this very neat sound, when someone was stabbed it sounded like the most cartoony blunt shot was fired instead of someone actually being penetrated by a katana. And while my inner goblin would indeed prefer something gorier, it plain out sounded odd and anything else more subdued would be better. It definitely made intense scenes less tense and along with the animation, it\'s one of the top two mood breakers.In conclusion, an interesting retelling of an old classic with a mostly boring and sometimes poorly executed presentation. Sucks because I feel like with a bigger budget this would have been really good.Tenshu Monogatari (episodes 5-8)Horror? Lmao, where is it, girl? I wanna know!While the opening does try to set a ""horror"" type of mood and while the Forgotten Gods DO eat humans and they... exist and all, there really aren\'t many horror elements to talk about. It\'s a romance story.It\'s honestly the worst of the three and while I was engaged for a bit after I finished it... I felt like I wasted my time. The story isn\'t told interestingly, the animation is still lackluster and the character design was a bit boring, it didn\'t feel unique enough.The sound was a bit better but nothing noteworthy. The music was still alright, the voice actors said their lines convincingly and the battle sound effects were okay enough or I might have just expected mediocre quality and didn\'t think about them too much.I would have liked to see more horror elements since there definitely was a chance for them to exist but I do realize that they only had 4 episodes, not a whole season to flesh this out and the main focus was the romance between the two leads.In conclusion, a not-so-horror romance story with a low-budget presentation. The worst of the lot, easily forgettable.Bake Neko (episodes 9-11)Good God, I love it here! I understand why people wanted to see more of this, I wanna start Mononoke right now!A massive up in quality. The story is amazing, both in the way it\'s being told and the contents of it. It has you hooked from the first few minutes.That is partly because of the stunning art this arc has. The character design is great too and the CG really isn\'t that bad at all. While the animation may be a bit stilted at times, it definitely makes up for it with more fluid animations during the battle and it is actually not that noticeable. If anything it uses it to its advantage at times. There are a ton of interesting camera angles too and while I\'m not too wild on the repetition of the dutch angle, I\'ll allow it this once. Not all of them were bad anyway but it did feel a bit overused in the first episode despite feeding into the unsettling atmosphere that was starting to take over. Maybe it\'s because we\'re overexposed to them in western media that I am so aware of them.I could wax poetry about the art all day but a million people that are way better with words than I am have already analyzed it further and know more than me so if this is something that interests you, I highly suggest you look more into it.The sound design is so good in this one. The sounds, the music, the voice actors, it all works perfectly together, it\'s so good that I genuinely can\'t think of anything to say. The voice actor for the lead, Takahiro Sakurai, is so good at capturing the snarkiness and energy of Kusuriuri, he has this mystical vibe to his voice that is very easy to get ~charmed~ by.Overall an amazing time and the arc most deserving of your time. Hopefully, Mononoke is as good as this.----I would like to finally touch on the intros and outros. While I have seen positive reviews about the intro song... I just can\'t get behind it, the beat is nice and it mixes traditional Japanese music with modern elements quite well but the song... and the vocalist... if the website I was watching it on didn\'t give me a pop-up ad every time I so much as blinked at the screen I would have honestly skipped it and I NEVER do that with intros (completionist). Honestly, my expectations for this series dropped when I heard the first bar. But since I didn\'t skip it, I actually got to see all the different intros for the different stories. You won\'t be surprised to know that the last one is the best, I wasn\'t too big on the other ones but it was a nice touch.The outro song is alright but I found myself watching this series during mornings where I was particularly sleepy so, in fear of falling asleep during it or the uninspired mute edited recap of the episode we just watched, I found myself skipping it. A shock I know. It wasn\'t bad at all though, I thought her voice and the music was very pleasant and calming. Just a bit too calming for my sleep-deprived mind to handle.Overall, as I stated in the beginning, it\'s a mixed bag. A mixed low-budget bag. While the last three episodes are definitely worth a watch, I\'m not too sure about the first two stories. They are interesting in their own way and they are traditional Japanese stories so if you\'re interested go for it! Just don\'t have too many expectations. since an anthology of traditional horror stories is music to my inner sophisticated wannabe goblin\'s ears. It is definitely a mixed bag.

The music was still alright, the voice actors said their lines convincingly and the battle sound effects were okay enough or I might have just expected mediocre quality and didn\'t think about them too much.I would have liked to see more horror elements since there definitely was a chance for them to exist but I do realize that they only had 4 episodes, not a whole season to flesh this out and the main focus was the romance between the two leads.In conclusion, a not-so-horror romance story with a low-budget presentation. The worst of the lot, easily forgettable.Bake Neko (episodes 9-11)Good God, I love it here! I understand why people wanted to see more of this, I wanna start Mononoke right now!A massive up in quality. The story is amazing, both in the way it\'s being told and the contents of it. It has you hooked from the first few minutes.That is partly because of the stunning art this arc has. The character design is great too and the CG really isn\'t that bad at all. While the animation may be a bit stilted at times, it definitely makes up for it with more fluid animations during the battle and it is actually not that noticeable. If anything it uses it to its advantage at times. There are a ton of interesting camera angles too and while I\'m not too wild on the repetition of the dutch angle, I\'ll allow it this once. Not all of them were bad anyway but it did feel a bit overused in the first episode despite feeding into the unsettling atmosphere that was starting to take over. Maybe it\'s because we\'re overexposed to them in western media that I am so aware of them.I could wax poetry about the art all day but a million people that are way better with words than I am have already analyzed it further and know more than me so if this is something that interests you, I highly suggest you look more into it.The sound design is so good in this one. The sounds, the music, the voice actors, it all works perfectly together, it\'s so good that I genuinely can\'t think of anything to say. The voice actor for the lead, Takahiro Sakurai, is so good at capturing the snarkiness and energy of Kusuriuri, he has this mystical vibe to his voice that is very easy to get ~charmed~ by.Overall an amazing time and the arc most deserving of your time. Hopefully, Mononoke is as good as this.----I would like to finally touch on the intros and outros. While I have seen positive reviews about the intro song... I just can\'t get behind it, the beat is nice and it mixes traditional Japanese music with modern elements quite well but the song... and the vocalist... if the website I was watching it on didn\'t give me a pop-up ad every time I so much as blinked at the screen I would have honestly skipped it and I NEVER do that with intros (completionist). Honestly, my expectations for this series dropped when I heard the first bar. But since I didn\'t skip it, I actually got to see all the different intros for the different stories. You won\'t be surprised to know that the last one is the best, I wasn\'t too big on the other ones but it was a nice touch.The outro song is alright but I found myself watching this series during mornings where I was particularly sleepy so, in fear of falling asleep during it or the uninspired mute edited recap of the episode we just watched, I found myself skipping it. A shock I know. It wasn\'t bad at all though, I thought her voice and the music was very pleasant and calming. Just a bit too calming for my sleep-deprived mind to handle.Overall, as I stated in the beginning, it\'s a mixed bag. A mixed low-budget bag. While the last three episodes are definitely worth a watch, I\'m not too sure about the first two stories. They are interesting in their own way and they are traditional Japanese stories so if you\'re interested go for it! Just don\'t have too many expectations.', 'TLDR: Just watch the last part of the story, ""Bakeneko"" (Ep. 9 - Ep. 11)Before I started watching this anime, I was expecting horror anime with scary ghost and jump scare. I pretty much disappointed because apparently the meaning of horror from this anime is different with mine. I stopped watching after the first act of \'\'Tenshu Monogatari"". I picked it up again months later as an \'anime to watch while I\'m in lobby queue,\'. Then come ""Yotsuya Kaidan"" which is also mediocre. At this point, I pretty much want to drop this anime but I tried to finish the last story, which only includes...three episodes. Lo and behold, I glad that I decided to watch ""Bakeneko"". Although it does not really fit the description of horror in my dictionary, it\'s still damn good. The characters, the storyline and the sound effects are all good. The art style is unique and well done. If ""Bakeneko"" is a stand-alone anime, I will simply rate it 8 or 9. ""Bakeneko"" is the only reason why I bother to write this review. Also I did found out that there is a sequel to the journey of the ""medicine seller"" in anime called ""Mononoke"" (2007). Welp, gonna watch it now. three episodes.

The music was gorgeous and I really love the clothing and hairstyles. But due to that, it's not everyone's cup of tea. I didn't find it hard to follow but I've read some of these stories when I was younger so maybe I'm used to it? I expected it to be more horror, but it might just be too old (in comparison to today's jump scares and gore), so I appreciated the more subtle classic horror of it.It's pretty quick so definitely worth a watch if you're into historical Japanese plays and stories. "", 'The show is broken into three acts. Oiwa is a youthful woman. She was betrayed by the person she loved and so hed become an Onryō – a vengeful spirit. Some scenes are disturbing, but the story is engaging because of its characters. It has the “feel” of a drama, it is almost like theatre play.it resembles some Greek tragedy as well . The second part of the anime is based on Tenshu monogatari . It is the tale of two star-crossed lovers. A princess from a castle of forgotten gods falls in love with an ordinary man. The story morphs into a Shakespearean tragedy....This is the least powerful of all three parts because it does not supply anything that could be interpreted as horror. It is the least original, even by Edo -period standards. However, it’s interesting in what ways. The feel of a theatre play is still present, but the characters are weaker than in the first part. The third segment is the first story by Nakamura Kenji and Yokote Michiko. It relates the story about an evil cat-demon who is haunting and killing a family for no known reason. A “medicine seller” tries to help them by learning the story of their spirit in order to get rid of it. This is arguably the best part of the series. It has elements that are disturbing and at the same time a “detective story” feel, lots of great action scenes to enjoy as well there is a compelling backstory of how bakeneko originated.In all three stories, there is a common theme the real evil always comes from human heart. There are tragedies acting in each story which arise from the greed, jealousy and conceit of people. Oiwa’s spirit kills people, but it ultimately belongs to those who wronged her. Also in Tenshu monogatari , there is an element of tragedy caused by jealousy and pride; the woman’s envy had led to actions taken against a daimyo . to see how cruel humans can be is the scariest part of the mononoke’s origin in Bakeneko Story. There are flawed or outright evil characters in the stories like greedy samurai, selfish brat, lustful man , falconer who abandons his wife etc.There is also a princess whose behavior changed with time and she exploited her womanhood for personal motives hence an inconsistent personality. Although the characters lack depth, this character mix is balanced and well played giving an old-school tragedy that works.The art style in the first two arcs of this series is good, but not great. The action sequences are a little stiffer and clumsy. But the art style in third arc is peculiar and unique. It has a constant “filter” on the picture and smooth CGI in some shots. The character design is more cartoon like, though overscale yet good enough. The action is good and the interior of the samurai family’s house is luxurious. However, the style may not be to everyone’s liking. For instance, the secondary characters design may appear to be too “parodic”.The series also features a decent-but unsatisfying soundtrack. It is not bad and I like the fact that it sometimes uses instruments for Kabuki theatre in Japan. It punctuates the action scenes effectively during its third arc. But it doesn’t operate as smoothly during the other two arcs. For instance, it doesn’t make the most disturbing scenes a step from “horrifying” up. I would be fine if they used Kabuki orchestra for all music in first two arcs of this series and even more – an opening credits song has shamisen melody start out only to turn into samurai rap.Ayakashi is about a collection of three stories that do not seem to be very frightening or impressive still are good enough to have some fun. The voice acting is terrific, and the third story has an interesting art design. It also makes you wonder about what is really scary. If you love reading about Japanese literature and theatre, then this is a must-try because it feels like being in the theater. Although you may not be a horror enthusiast if anything, I would still recommend this movie to watch because it will definitely spook the living day lights out of you. It’s just good and mediocre but at the same time it is not bad to watch, there will not be any strong impressions left.

The ghostly elements near the end of the short story were fantastic and really were spooky.Art:The art was very interesting. I'm not really into old school art, but I thought it was beautiful none the less. It reminded me...a lot of the old Japanese art, which was mostly what it was supposed to do. It was not 'moe' or 'kawaii' or 'bishie' but it does the job and really adds to the feel of the story.Character:I thought the characters were a little cliche though. I know the Japanese hold a strong sense of the supernatural, but their reactions weren't really fear, but surprise. Then they changed their moods and ideals so quickly too. It was like an artificial emotional roller coaster.Enjoyment:Despite my own tastes, I really enjoyed the first story. It was interesting and a well done ghost story. If you have a short attention span and aren't really interested in dramatic speech and complicated characters, I really don't recommend the first story to you. a lot of the old Japanese art, which was mostly what it was supposed to do.

Blue Archive the Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54309/Blue_Archive_the_Animation,"['First of all *sob emoji* *sob emoji* *sob emoji* *sob emoji* *sob emoji*.Now, ""Blue Archive the Animation,"" the adaptation of the hit mobile game ""Blue Archive,"" finally aired, and so far IT\'S SO GOOD.From the animation to the opening sequence, characters, and background song, it\'s safe to say this is one of the best gacha game-to-anime adaptations.The plot itself follows and adapts the same story present in the game with a little bit of tinkering so it fits the anime aesthetic, and some anime-only scenes were added BUT don\'t affect the original story whatsoever. Sadly, they don\'t really animate the prologue of this anime, so...anime-only watchers might find difficulties understanding the lore and world-building, like ""what is that thing on top of their head?"" or ""why are they bulletproof?"" or ""why does that guy keep a girl inside a fcking iPad?"" or ""SHE\'S FIFTEEN?"" and so on. There are also a few character cameos that only game players can notice and appreciate.The songs are amazing. There\'s a saying that gacha game studios are actually just music studios in disguise, and this saying still proves to be true. No bad songs are to be found in this anime, be it the main theme or the background songs—it\'s all good.The animation is almost, if not as good as, the ""Princess Connect! Re:Dive"" anime adaptation. Yostar definitely put all of that gacha money to good use—it\'s vibrant, colorful, and serene. The same goes for the opening animation—it\'s without a doubt one of the best openings I\'ve ever seen. A banger song combined with video game PV-quality animation that also fleshed out the core of the Blue Archive world itself—a world filled with joy and conflict. It\'s perfect.The characters... oh man... don\'t get me started. It\'s just so... peak. Never have I thought that they could make all of these already cute characters EVEN CUTER. And it\'s funny how they buff some ""parts"" of the characters while also nerfing some ""parts,"" but BALANCE is needed. You can\'t buff everything because it\'s going to be overflowing, and you can\'t nerf everything because it\'s going to be shallow. And it\'s always the way Blue Archive designed its characters—crudely tame and subtly lewd. Tame enough to make them precious and warm your heart, but lewd enough to flick the hidden beast inside you.And now for the most important part—the MC himself, Sensei. Quick reminder, Blue Archive is a self-insert game, which means, in the very first place, the main character has no actual physical form. Even in most ""media,"" he is depicted as a cute and funny doodle. But Yostar, for the first time, learned their lesson, so instead of making the MC a person with Schrödinger genitals or A FCKING CHICKEN, they actually made him a young man with a soft-looking physique with an even softer personality, lovable face, and friend-shaped. They designed him to look average enough while at the same time showing the reason why every student in Kivotos wants a piece of him.Overall, this is a top-tier adaptation of a mobile game. Yostar definitely knew which audiences they wanted to please this time: their fans, which fortunately is easy since Blue Archive was already very popular before the anime was announced, so it already has a large audience in the first place. Safe to say, this anime is not merely to promote the game but also a cheer and thank-you gift for all the Sensei around the world who have been supporting the game.Is this recommended? For the players, absolutely. For the anime-only watcher, it can be hard to understand the plot and world-building sometimes, but you can still enjoy this as a cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime... just with guns and A DUDE.Now, before I lose my composure to not say the C-word, I have to end my review with a message: let\'s enjoy this cute and funny anime to the fullest, my fellow Sensei.

Alas, that is WAY not the case.We are thrown directly into conflict. The world is encased in desert, the girls are all trying to figure out how to keep their school from going under, even though they are a gorillion dollars in debt, the school...is foreclosing, the girls are up in arms, and woo! We get a new teacher. His name is Sensei apparently, he is not important enough to have a name. Shame. Also as an anime only, I find myself googling more stuff just to understand what's going on.

It's like, here's the girls, that's what you get, enjoy.But who cares about that? We have random battles with other schools to focus on. And man are they great.It's a slaughter fest! Bullets flying everywhere, missiles, grenades, dynamite, machine guns! Sniper rifles! Dear lord it's a BLOOD BATH...Except it isn't. The girls are apparently all gods, or something. No idea, but bullets to them are basically paintballs, or BBs. They do about as much damage as stubbing a toe. So in this anime, no matter how many bullets or explosions happen, there's zero consequence, effectively making all conflict meaningless. Literally zero damage taken. Sniper to the face? Eh, walk it off. explosions? Flashy but useless.This anime also breaks one of my fundamental character design rules. Some of the girls have TWO sets of ears. Why? It's such a dumb design characteristic.Anyway, the girls are the only pros of this show. They are all different, the designs are cute, the voice acting is fantastic, their personalities compliment each other well, and we have a good mix of different viewpoints with all of them. So thats cool.Overall as an anime only I'm giving it a 4/10. There's just nothing explained, the conflicts being pointless takes a ton of excitement out of the show, the world building and character development are non existent.

And...talk about weirdness what up with the thing above everyone head? and do these people built like hulk or something because a normal person would\'ve been dead  if they get shot in the head.I suppose this anime is targeted to their players but why not maybe give the watcher who is not playing the game an explanation about the story? I stayed watching until episode 6 thinking there would be an explanation but going further I\'m just getting more and more confuse.Regardless, I think that the va, animation and all is really good. Maybe the selling thing in this anime is about the waifu. But really I don\'t really planning to continue watching because I\'m just not enjoying it.So, should you watch it base on my opinion? I mean, sure you could try it especially if you\'re playing blue archive. But just don\'t get high hopes. talk about weirdness what up with the thing above everyone head? and do these people built like hulk or something because a normal person would\'ve been dead  if they get shot in the head.I suppose this anime is targeted to their players but why not maybe give the watcher who is not playing the game an explanation about the story?

I see lot of people doesnt understand how ""real bullet"" didnt kill them, what is that above them head?, why everyone looks animal beside the student, why only sensei/main character is human? etc etc.This is advertisement for ""GO F YOURSELF AND PLAY THE GAME OR DONT WATCH"" i agree, it appealing toward long time blue archive gamer like me, who know the plot of the story (forgot most of it). If you want explaination, it...ruined everything tbh, they just follow direction of the game, when earlier game, there is no single explanation about anything until Episode 3 (Eden Treaty) which pretty faraway. If they explain everything, it loses them charm, for me, u are like sensei and other day 1 player, no idea what happened and no idea what we going. We just keep going, dont expect explanation just enjoy it while u can.Maybe if we get s2, thats where spicy stuff happened.Let\'s talk about character, oh boi oh boi, its harem anime!!!, i know i know, they are one dimersional, i know i know. Again this is just introduction to deeper plot later on. Most of the characters is pure nostalgia on my end tbh. I still remember serika being panic all the time while i first time play. Remember that shiroko going rob the bank to save the school, remember that hoshino past who darker than the other, fighting against whole world. Just play the game manLet\'s talk about animation/visual, the best one, even GFL anime cant even compareable toward this anime. If u are compare that to this, this one masterpierce. Not gonna lie, it probably few of lot of anime out there get the gun work right, they reload, they shoot, even stance they shoot, its all good. Big negative point that sometimes they shoot like 100 rounds from 30 rounds mag then reload time.Overall : 10/10 peak archive, just take it as a grain of salt. It is fun ride, give me hope that other game adaptation could be this good and stay faithful toward the game story and mechanic itself. I dont want to talk about logic here like how shiroko survive jumping from 5th floor.Cheers everyone, have a great day(I know u guys gonna put confusing or funny, but i prefer funny because whole anime is cute and funny :sobbing:) ruined everything tbh, they just follow direction of the game, when earlier game, there is no single explanation about anything until Episode 3 (Eden Treaty) which pretty faraway.

There aren't many anime out there I could describe as wholesome genuinely, the story and characters of Blue Archive is incredible for this. While there are many darker storylines and there is plenty of conflict between students and schools, at the end of the day it's beautiful how well the story manages to portray its world and how all of the students have their struggles within it, while always striving for their best and wanting to find their place in it.In terms of the anime adaptation at hand, I couldn't be happier. The animation, sound design, voice acting is pretty much perfect....The students are lovely and fun, and quite incredibly well realized to their game counterparts. The action scenes have some great animation, though that is, not to take away from the detail and expressiveness of the calmer scenes.  The opening and ending are absolute bangers, as is the soundtrack which, despite featuring a few too repetitive parts, manages to weave the games soundtrack really well.As for a little constructive criticism: The pacing is a little on the slow side at the start, deliberately I should stress, as in-game as well as in the anime you spend some time acclimating to the world and learning how it works with the academies, and getting a sense of how daily life is for the students, which taken as a story, a fan-service letter to anime fans, or as the start of a hopefully long series, with many slice-of life moments in this first arc, is exactly what it should be. Though despite it, I would agree that not much happens in the first few episodes in terms of story-heavy events, which might be a positive for some, but could have been better handled to perhaps appeal to a larger audience.On more of a personal note, seeing some of the discussions of the site it is baffling and frustrating, with people saying they find it hard to understand the world, or how the students are somewhat impervious to bullets or some such... It is not necessary to have knowledge of the games story beforehand. Obviously it helps to clear up some questions and expand on some aspects, but anyone without the prerequisite knowledge, and doing the bare minimum of actually watching the show and paying attention will understand everything just as well as any game player, or a normal person watching the anime.

As non-this-anime-type-of-gamer-viewer\'s opinions, the story a bit slow for me to understand. But gratefully, in few episodes it makes more understandable which is good for story-telling.Characters is winnable. Lots of designs, every each designs and textures, represent their characteristics as well. VA\'s also suitable and matched with their characters. The production really know how to pick which VAs represent the character and know who their goods at. Just, why...one of their leader (Takanashi, Hoshino) is almost 90-100% copycat of Mahiro in ""Oniichan wa Oshimai! (Onimai: I\'m Now Your Sister!)"" in term of the designs, visual and animations? LOLFighting, kind of lame. It is a turn-off for me, the fighting scenes looks like pixel or arcade games-level of animations. There is no smoothness in it, and not sync-up to the VA\'s voices (example, there\'s an explosions and the VA\'s just ""uuh!"" or ""aaaahhhhh"", not ""AHHHH!"").

It is good.But if the people who don't know anything about Blue Archive decide to watch I'm sure 80% they not going to like it. The problem is in anime they don't explain anything or everything they explain which makes people even more confuse, for example, why all...characters using guns? Why character barely scratch from getting shot? Why has the town turned into desert? Who is Sensei? Who is the girl in Sensei's tablet called Arona? All of this is never explained and it is weird because in game some of this has been explained while in Anime it wasn't.

Hoshino's story / 68 is interesting.Disadvantages - This is just a work that was made for people who came to see the service of the characters in the game only. But in terms of storytelling/story telling, it's pretty bad. There's nothing interesting about World Building that barely tells a story. It makes people who only watch the anime not understand it at all.And what's frustrating is that Sensei's role is completely unnecessary. Sensei's presence in this story is...equally important.

Its 10/10 because I\'m incredibly biasedBlue Archive the animation is an adaptation of the gacha game made by Korean game company Nexon Games. It follows Sensei (the player character) as he follows his students around in their daily lives, spending time and learning more about them and the world they live in.Here in lies the first problem and in my opinion one of the biggest ones. Sensei. In the game we follow Sensei\'s perspective, as he is a self insert type character and thus its also OUR perspective. That is not...the issue here. Sensei is NOT the main character in the anime, the main focus is one of the girls, but its usually Shiroko. Sensei thus ends up feeling unnecessary, and the viewers have a hard time wondering WHY he\'s so important to the girls and why the world would quite literally end without him. In the game because it\'s his perspective we follow, we get to see him interact with his students one on one not just as a group, thus he ends up forming bonds with them as individuals, and the students actually finding Sensei so important suddenly makes a lot more sense. Also he steals lines students say which butchers his timid, kind nature the anime gives him and make him feel arrogant. Why the hell would they give him a line Nonomi says?The anime should have taken the classic harem anime route because Blue Archive is at its best when focusing on Sensei and his relationship with each of the girls instead of the girls only cast route. Although looking at the director\'s resume I\'m not suprised it ended up taking the latter.Next we have the pacing. Oh the pacing. It\'s far too fast, if it wasn\'t for the fact I know the entire story so far I would have been seriously confused. Now, one might sag thats ok because it isn\'t made for new players and watchers but veterans like me, but at that point I\'d rather re read the entire story with a voice over. I\'ll give an example. In episode 5 a certain restaurant gets blown up. One of the girls, Serika, happens to love this restaurant as she works there and is devastated by its destruction and is seriously pissed. Thats what happens in the game. However in the anime because they\'re trying to feed 24 visual novel like chapters into 12 episodes they don\'t have time to stop and see Serika\'s reaction so it only seems like shes mildly annoyed by its destruction. One could argue that ""24 episodes is too long I like to watch a quick anime, I\'d tell you, then mind as well read a summary of each chapter because at this point thats what this anime is. A summary of 2 chapters of the game"". One could also say theres not enough material to which I say with the approach they\'re going with yes, but had they taken the harem anime approach we would be able to see Sensei interact with the girls individually which is through the bond stories which are canon and take place on story.The characters. I\'ve already said my issue with Sensei. Vol 1 which is what the anime is based on is focused on Hoshino (as the secondary protagonist) and her feelings about her school and the debt they have, and as the senior what SHE can do about it. However the anime is focusing on Shiroko who gets her spotlight at least 100 chapters later. What this results in is Hoshino\'s development she had being reduced and Shiroko, who honestly barely changes in vol 1 seeming stagnant as a character and it ends up affecting everyone else too. Serika technically gets development but they don\'t go anywhere with it and she just ends up going back to how she acted before her arc. This again could be solved, *if they used the damn momotalks and bond stories* where we get to see the girls on their own and as individuals and how they interact and grow with Sensei one on one. Again we could see why Sensei means so much to them, and how it affects them as individuals.Next the music: Good, just doesn\'t sound like Blue Archive. If you listen to Blue Archive\'s soundtrack in game you would immediately notice how drastically different it is compared to the anime. Probably doesn\'t help none of the 3 main composers or like any of the game staff actually helped with the anime. The music just... doesn\'t work that well.The artstyle and animation: It sucks compared to the game. Some shots look like studio Deen did it during SDS. No one expected some amazing art and animation but definitely not... that bad. The artstyle itself looks like a washed down, almost bland version of the game. The fight scenes are boring, which isn\'t a problem since Blue Archive is a lot of SOL but the thing about SOLs is they make up for mediocre animation with a beautiful artstyle and Blue Archive in its anime state does not have said beautiful artstyle.Doesn\'t help we\'ve been spoiled by Studio Ppuri who has done animation for the Korean/Global version of the game and shows that not only can Blue Archive be directly adapted one to one, but have heavenly animation and fight choreography. They are 30 second pvs and thus usually are higher quality although I also think thats a lame excuse since JP version has their own pvs (animed by Yostar) and they look significantly worse, and a lot like the anime.Overall. Just read the story on YouTube or something. Please. Blue Archive is by no means a masterpiece but it is still a wonderful story many people (mostly fans of the harem and girls only cast) can enjoy. the issue here. Sensei is NOT the main character in the anime, the main focus is one of the girls, but its usually Shiroko. Sensei thus ends up feeling unnecessary, and the viewers have a hard time wondering WHY he\'s so important to the girls and why the world would quite literally end without him.

Vol 1 which is what the anime is based on is focused on Hoshino (as the secondary protagonist) and her feelings about her school and the debt they have, and as the senior what SHE can do about it. However the anime is focusing on Shiroko who gets her spotlight at least 100 chapters later. What this results in is Hoshino\'s development she had being reduced and Shiroko, who honestly barely changes in vol 1 seeming stagnant as a character and it ends up affecting everyone else too. Serika technically gets development but they don\'t go anywhere with it and she just ends up going back to how she acted before her arc. This again could be solved, *if they used the damn momotalks and bond stories* where we get to see the girls on their own and as individuals and how they interact and grow with Sensei one on one. Again we could see why Sensei means so much to them, and how it affects them as individuals.Next the music: Good, just doesn\'t sound like Blue Archive. If you listen to Blue Archive\'s soundtrack in game you would immediately notice how drastically different it is compared to the anime. Probably doesn\'t help none of the 3 main composers or like any of the game staff actually helped with the anime. The music just... doesn\'t work that well.The artstyle and animation: It sucks compared to the game. Some shots look like studio Deen did it during SDS. No one expected some amazing art and animation but definitely not... that bad. The artstyle itself looks like a washed down, almost bland version of the game. The fight scenes are boring, which isn\'t a problem since Blue Archive is a lot of SOL but the thing about SOLs is they make up for mediocre animation with a beautiful artstyle and Blue Archive in its anime state does not have said beautiful artstyle.Doesn\'t help we\'ve been spoiled by Studio Ppuri who has done animation for the Korean/Global version of the game and shows that not only can Blue Archive be directly adapted one to one, but have heavenly animation and fight choreography. They are 30 second pvs and thus usually are higher quality although I also think thats a lame excuse since JP version has their own pvs (animed by Yostar) and they look significantly worse, and a lot like the anime.Overall. Just read the story on YouTube or something. Please. Blue Archive is by no means a masterpiece but it is still a wonderful story many people (mostly fans of the harem and girls only cast) can enjoy.', 'yea not good for recommendation, as anime watcher only i can feel already there\'s lot been skipped or change or atleast maybe some got cut then didnt know it happen, because that theres no context anymore, lets say its one of those ""Everyone making this out to be a big deal but turns out bad"" again in anime industry and the best example to this is the content of this anime itself.spoiler:the girls talking to sensei like hes sort of important figure as an adult to them at some point already but they didnt show why it happen or how it happen to get to...that point cause ever since day 1 sensei is always been side character to the story, he didnt do anything to make him that important to them at all even a ""sensei\'s advice"" he didnt do it, but were still in episode 10 so maybe he will in next episodes,in the end this anime adaptation is all about ""FAN SERVICE"" anime, showing a original anime only sensei\'s face that doesn\'t show in game or showing girls in anime for fans to enjoy(like that one random scene where yuuka and noa out of the blue shows up accidentally met sensei and current main girls)Afterthought:I can already imagine why this anime turn out this way more like this would naturally happen, cause gacha games has ALWAYS BEEN either a very slow pace story or concrete detailed story (like in arknights do)and this blue archive anime is in the ""former"" so yeah most content are basically like a filler-ish/slice of life happy-ish episodes, to add more salt to that its only 12 episode so yeah basically we don\'t see anything in the story except 1 mini character story arc that fills the whole season like wtf, heck its not even prologue to the story yet since gacha games are always aiming to prolong their game so their aim in story should also super big, TO BE MORE CLARIFY the story in gacha games are basically should be a shounen story way like bleach, one piece  or etc.. but only differs are main character is us with no character development and only guiding other characters get character development instead,anyways if people think this is good anime and want to recommend it then they are either idiot or just delusional cause they unconsciously forcing us anime watchers-only to understand that its good but they have more understanding to this cause they played and read the game but were talking about anime only perspective here and ITS NOT GOOD! unless they release another seasons to make us understand its a good show, i want to rate this higher than 6/10 but if its slice of life anime that is, normally i rate this lower than 6 actually but their OP and ED are good and ED is my favorite cause it has aesthetic vibe of old animation.I know at this point im just yapping but seriously their doujins are even better at directive story than the current anime\'s story thats focused more on romance with mostly main girls are either yuuka, noa, mika or rio.P.S i played the game but not read the story(im one of those gamers) that point cause ever since day 1 sensei is always been side character to the story, he didnt do anything to make him that important to them at all even a ""sensei\'s advice"" he didnt do it, but were still in episode 10 so maybe he will in next episodes,in the end this anime adaptation is all about ""FAN SERVICE"" anime, showing a original anime only sensei\'s face that doesn\'t show in game or showing girls in anime for fans to enjoy(like that one random scene where yuuka and noa out of the blue shows up accidentally met sensei and current main girls)Afterthought:I can already imagine why this anime turn out this way more like this would naturally happen, cause gacha games has ALWAYS BEEN either a very slow pace story or concrete detailed story (like in arknights do)and this blue archive anime is in the ""former"" so yeah most content are basically like a filler-ish/slice of life happy-ish episodes, to add more salt to that its only 12 episode so yeah basically we don\'t see anything in the story except 1 mini character story arc that fills the whole season like wtf, heck its not even prologue to the story yet since gacha games are always aiming to prolong their game so their aim in story should also super big, TO BE MORE CLARIFY the story in gacha games are basically should be a shounen story way like bleach, one piece  or etc.. but only differs are main character is us with no character development and only guiding other characters get character development instead,anyways if people think this is good anime and want to recommend it then they are either idiot or just delusional cause they unconsciously forcing us anime watchers-only to understand that its good but they have more understanding to this cause they played and read the game but were talking about anime only perspective here and ITS NOT GOOD!

However, what I witnessed left me utterly disappointed.The anime's most glaring flaw lies in its inability to capture the essence of the characters. The vibrant personalities and intricate relationships that make Blue Archive so special feel diluted and lifeless. The characters lack depth, making it impossible to forge any emotional connection with them.The addition of Sensei, a character absent in the game, is an unwelcome change that detracts from the overall experience. While not expecting a direct translation of the game's story, Sensei's...presence feels forced and unnecessary. Rather than enhancing the narrative, the anime could have easily thrived without him, focusing instead on the beloved characters and their intricate relationships already established in the game. This would have allowed for a more streamlined and engaging story that truly captures the essence of Blue Archive.The animation, while not terrible, leaves much to be desired. It lacks the polish and fluidity one would expect from a modern anime production. The character designs feel off, and the action sequences are underwhelming. It's evident that choosing a first-time director was a grave mistake, as the anime lacks the artistic vision and experience needed to bring Blue Archive's world to life.While the anime does attempt to adapt certain events from the game, it fails to capture the emotional weight and significance of those moments. The overall tone feels flat and uninspired, making it a chore to watch.As a fan, it pains me to say this, but Blue Archive: The Animation is a missed opportunity. It fails to capture the magic of the game, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of those who love the original source material.I strongly recommend skipping this anime and revisiting the game instead. It's a far superior experience that truly does justice to the captivating world and characters of Blue Archive. presence feels forced and unnecessary.

Before it, they released some PV along with animation it looks pretty good. Now, to be fair I\'m gonna say my thought about Blue Archive The Animation.Not least people said this anime was meant to be a fanservice for the player andit doesn\'t have such a good world building. I could understand it if you only watch a single episode, but for me this anime would be difficult to understand for someone didn\'t play the game. They wrapped the entire prologue into a...minute, that\'s why this show would leave a lot of question like ""what is that halo ring thing above their head?"", ""why there is a sand all over the city?"", ""how can they didn\'t die after getting shot?"", etc.[PROS]Well, in my opinion the opening has a good animation and well made by it\'s VA. But to be honest, I prefer if they use the Blue Archive song that released by ClariS -Blue Canvas. Another good point for this anime is the ending, it has nostalgic and \'90s vibes, great song, good animation, but honestly I think it\'s not really fit the show. Next one I\'ll just say the story, based on the game the story will be heartwarmin, full of comedy, and somehow dark at the same time. So I think we could see a random things will happened in the further episode and I promise it would be hilarious. Honorable mention, I like the character design even though I prefer the in-game illustration but the anime adaptation didn\'t fail to make me uwogh *sob emoji*[CONS]As I said earlier, in the anime adaptation the world building is not well presented and people would think it\'s a plot hole. Second is the animation, especially the battle animation, I\'m expecting more than a clunky and goofy animation. Last but not least, the audio. I\'m not a military expert but this anime has a terrible sound effect, especially the gunshot. For some people it shouldn\'t be a problem but, it feels off and annoying if you heard something doesn\'t sounds like what it be. For example, Nonomi\'s M134 Minigum sounds like 600rpm firearm, the smoke grenade drop sound effect sounds like an empty can, shotgun sound\'s like small caliber arms, etc.[OVERALL]World Building : 6/10Story : 9/10Character Design : 9/10OP/ED : 7/10Animation : 4/10Audio Visual : 3/10 minute, that\'s why this show would leave a lot of question like ""what is that halo ring thing above their head?"", ""why there is a sand all over the city?"", ""how can they didn\'t die after getting shot?"", etc.[PROS]Well, in my opinion the opening has a good animation and well made by it\'s VA.

This anime feels like more of a crowd pleaser or an advertisement for the game. It doesn\'t know what it want to do. Like you\'re gonna be an action show? a cgdct show? a drama? a mystery? what is it, and it trying to be everything is such a mess. Even though it listed genre as action and fantasy, it even fail at such, and all because the failing world building, with no prominent plot to stand on. No amount of sob emoji can save this one i\'m afraid.Recommend for: Animation, Production quality, CGDCT, CharacterNot Recommend for: Writing, World building, StoryFULL REVIEW:Background:...I didn\'t play the Blue Archive game, so I have no knowledge of it, and purely review this as an anime critic.THE PROS:This show would succeed as a cgdct. The character design is very good, but the plot does interfere with it and does sometime do deus ex machina over the character in some place, will get into that in the cons section. Though overall the character design is ok, there\'s some stereotyping but also have some uniqueness to each character, and not all of them have a strict 1 personality to stick, so it\'s really refreshing and feels real. [8/10]The animation is also beautiful on the eyes to watch, the style fits the show really on whatever mess they\'re trying to do. The comedy also got complimented by the animation really well too [10/10]. With some perfect mixing of the soundtrack, not overused, and overall not make the show boring [8/10]. Overall very good production quality alone.THE CONS:First of all, the world building is one of the biggest flaw. From someone totally not related to the game, this show fail to make sense of the world to the viewers. Even if the world is VERY VERY interesting in its own right, not showing it or even explaining it in a meaningful way make the interesting world feels more like a mess rather than a cool world to be intrigue about. I first expect it to slowly explaing / show to us the world through the story, but 3 ep in and nothing in sight. [4/10]Next is the story, the story might be good enough on the gacha game standard, but when translated to an anime, the standard is held much higher, and this show fails at having an interesting good story. Even if it\'s on a comedy / cgdct standard (expect to have chill plot/non at all), it\'s still below average. This wouldn\'t be a problem if its laid the ground work for the world building better than this, to let the audience know what to expect of the world, and what characters in this world decision are made from / their environment. So with the unsaid world building, the story took a hit from it. [5/10]Last and the worst, is the writing. The one thing that make me say this is episode 2. THE WHOLE OF EPISODE 2 IS LITERALLY FABRICATED FROM A DEUS EX MACHINA, just because they want to do something. Full reason with spoiler can be found under the note of this anime on my profile list. Though to conclude, bending a character thoughts and action just to make an event happen is not right. Not giving the reason to that decision is even not more right. Even with the ""caustious"" argument that that character could be doing it because they\'re cautious, then it should be the whole group, not just 1 character. So it\'s just the biggest most blatant plot hole that do effect the plot and story a lot. [1/10]THE NEUTRAL:The action is pretty good to action anime standards. With some uniqueness to it. Though flops on the choreography and sensible, since it\'s all just power blasting everywhere. [7/10]OVERALL:In conlusion, this show got some good production quality to back it up, with some good characters and cool unique style to the world. However, its flaw with the conveying of the world building, combined with the writing that\'s low quality and many plot-holes everywhere, really drag the show down, along even with its shenanigans story.RECCOMENDATION:If you enjoy cgdt, guns, and funni stuff, go for it.If you are sensible to sensible plot, may be try it out, but might not please you.Overall score as an action fantasy: 7/10 I didn\'t play the Blue Archive game, so I have no knowledge of it, and purely review this as an anime critic.THE PROS:This show would succeed as a cgdct.

Chiisana Penguin Lolo no Bouken,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4138/Chiisana_Penguin_Lolo_no_Bouken,"['Since my man Kenny Lauderdale recently made a video on what is and isn\'t anime, I decided to go on a quest and find the least anime entry on ALL of MAL!Different anime rating sites have different criteria. Anime News Network is probably the strictest. It absolutely has to be written in Japan, directed in Japan, and made for a Japanese audience first and foremost. There\'s no Chinese animation, no Korean animation, no co-productions. It HAS to be Japanese.Kitsu is the least strict. They say that ""anime"" is just the Japanese word for cartoon, so why shouldn\'t all cartoons be added? Avatar the Last Airbender...and Korra are in the top 50. Stephen Universe and Houseki no Kuni are rivals. There are serious arguments over which series has the best gemstone girls! Meanwhile, Elfen Lied is locked in an eternal feud with Teen Titans Go to be the most hated thing on Kitsu. Last time I checked, Elfen Lied was rated slightly lower, but that was before Teen Titans Go made that entire episode trolling the shit out of Thundercats fans, which is a popular anime on Kitsu. TTG probably retook the gold medal after that.MAL is generally in the middle. The definition of anime on MAL has shifted around since it was founded in 2008. When I joined in 2014, there really weren\'t Korean and Chinese entries on this site, but those were added because MAL now considers anime to be ""Asian cartoons"". MAL has held steadfast on excluding American cartoons that look ""anime"" such as Avatar because America doesn\'t share the same cultural influences and isn\'t an Asian country. A MAL entry can be co-produced by America, but Asians have to play a leading role. Doesn\'t this mean that ""The Nutshack"" is an anime under MAL\'s definition? Yes! Yes it does! However, I spoke to a mod and the Philippines is currently not being shown the same treatment as China, South Korea, and shockingly North Korea. This isn\'t due to any ethnic discrimination, but because the mod assured me that Nutshack WOULD skyrocket to #1 the second it gets added and they want to avoid the headache.So I wanted to find an anime that isn\'t remotely Japanese. An anime with a production team whiter than mayonnaise in blizzard. It took me surprisingly little time to find Lolo the Penguin. I accidentally first read the title as Loli the Penguin, which made me giggle. This film was financed by the Soviet government. It was written in Russia. It was directed in Russia. The audio is Russian. The animation was done by Soyuzmultfilm in Moscow. It was made specifically for a Soviet audience plus Warsaw Pact nations. The only reason that this is an ""anime"" is that Toei apparently provided some film equipment to Soyuzmultfilm. They didn\'t even help animate it. This is less anime than any Hanna Barbera cartoon! Why not just add Swat Kats or Pirates of Dark Water? At least those were animated in Japan and inspired by 1980s anime. There is simply NOTHING Japanese in the DNA of Lolo the Penguin.So how is the actual film? Eh...it\'s ok. It\'s a 3 episode, made for TV miniseries that was spliced together into a direct to VHS movie. As an aside, my favorite anime OP in this sub-genre is ""Guest From the Future"" and anyone who disagrees is cordially invited to go fuck themselves. The plot is pretty reminiscent of Don Bluth\'s the Pebble and the Penguin, which would be made 10 years later. However, it\'s not clear if Bluth took any inspiration from this film. In both films, an adventurous but kind of stupid young penguin gets lost out at sea, has to escape from leopard seals, and finds himself captured by poachers. All of this is likely coincidence. Leopard seals are the main predator of penguins and you have to fit humans into the film somehow. What\'s odd is that in both versions the main penguin is an Adelie penguin who befriends a rockhopper penguin that isn\'t native to Antarctica and has to get back home. It\'s still probably a coincidence, but I found that interesting. What definitely DOESN\'T happen in Pebble and the Penguin is that the poachers open fire on the penguin colony and kill dozens of penguins before an avalanche kills all the poachers. You might think that\'s a little bleak for a children\'s movie, but the 90s were a BAD time for Russia, so at least it prepared those 80s kids for the tough times ahead. Russia ain\'t easy.Overall, it\'s an ok movie for its time. It\'s not great like Hedgehog in Fog, although oddly enough it has the same narrator! If anything it\'s still far better than The Pebble and the Penguin because it isn\'t crammed full of bad musical numbers. Do I think Lolo should be an anime? HELL no! However, I don\'t work for MAL.

I\'m just some random dude who writes reviews for fun.', ""Since it’s a Soviet-Japanese joint production, “Chiisana Penguin Lolo no Bouken” is an anime that doesn’t really feel like an anime. The animation style, dialogue and story progression seem distinctly non-Japanese, and the credits (and voice acting) are all in Russian. Japanese staff did work on this, however, and the background music in particular sounds like something you’d hear in a Japanese production.This 3-episode OVA is about an Adelie penguin named Lolo and his friends and family, and it follows him from when he hatches from his egg as he grows into an adult. Inquisitive and rambunctious, he gets into lots of dangerous situations while...going on adventures with his friends.While the penguins do look cute, their actions sometimes contradict their cuteness and make the viewer realize that life for these creatures is indeed “survival of the fittest.” We see them stealing rocks from each other to make nests, for example. There’s also a scene where Lolo’s parents spank him (of course, this isn’t natural penguin behavior). There are also lots of predators that the penguins have to watch out for, and these are depicted menacingly — the killer whales and the seals, in particular, look frightening. Another interesting narrative choice here is that the penguins seem to be able to communicate with the “good animals,” like the dogs and the blue whales, but not the “bad animals,” like the skua gulls. There are also bad and good humans, and the bad ones are shown to be ugly while the good human is not.Plot-wise, this OVA tells a series of connected stories that are entertaining and suspenseful to watch, and that convey the harshness of nature and what being part of the food chain entails. These stories culminate in a conclusion that is largely satisfying but open-ended. Some of the major developments at the end happen too suddenly, and the characters’ reactions to them are glossed over. There are a few plot developments, particularly in the final episode, that don’t make much sense. In general, however, the story and characters are pretty good.Regarding technical aspects, the animation is usually fluid, although it can be blocky at times, and they recycle some shots.

I can’t comment much on the quality of the voice acting since it’s in Russian, but it sounded okay.There is some potentially objectionable content, most of which I think got cut for the English-language releases of this OVA.

There’s also a scene where Lolo’s parents spank him (of course, this isn’t natural penguin behavior). There are also lots of predators that the penguins have to watch out for, and these are depicted menacingly — the killer whales and the seals, in particular, look frightening. Another interesting narrative choice here is that the penguins seem to be able to communicate with the “good animals,” like the dogs and the blue whales, but not the “bad animals,” like the skua gulls. There are also bad and good humans, and the bad ones are shown to be ugly while the good human is not.Plot-wise, this OVA tells a series of connected stories that are entertaining and suspenseful to watch, and that convey the harshness of nature and what being part of the food chain entails. These stories culminate in a conclusion that is largely satisfying but open-ended. Some of the major developments at the end happen too suddenly, and the characters’ reactions to them are glossed over. There are a few plot developments, particularly in the final episode, that don’t make much sense. In general, however, the story and characters are pretty good.Regarding technical aspects, the animation is usually fluid, although it can be blocky at times, and they recycle some shots.

Captain Tsubasa Season 2: Junior Youth-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54803/Captain_Tsubasa_Season_2__Junior_Youth-hen,"[""Captain Tsubasa has been an absolute and total disappointment. I truly loved the previous 2018 anime, animated by David Production, but the current studio is just terrible. I don’t know what happened, but everything is bad from A to Z. The animation, sound effects, sound design, music, and even the opening theme are all lackluster. The voice acting and dialogues are dreadful. Having skimmed through the manga, it's clear that the anime significantly deviates, often in a childish manner, especially with the introduction of Karl. This anime has so many flaws; it's unbelievable. I can't even point out one good aspect. I continue watching it...out of desperation, confused about the series' distribution and wishing to explore the older anime series and the manga. However, I detest the author's style. The 2018 anime touched me deeply with David Production's style, which was fantastic. But now, they’ve produced something completely disrespectful.It feels like a deliberate sabotage of Captain Tsubasa. My conspiracy theory is that Tsubasa didn't meet their expectations in 2018 despite the mobile game, video game, etc., so they aimed to just fulfill a quota with a subpar anime.When comparing to the works of David Production on series like Undead Unluck or what’s seen in Jujutsu Kaisen by MAPPA, even though MAPPA has its issues, this is a letdown. Even compared to other anime like Kishin or football-themed anime like Inazuma Eleven, the treatment of Captain Tsubasa is disappointing. I don’t demand extraordinary animation or phenomenal elements, but I expect a minimum standard. It’s heartbreaking to see years of anticipation culminate in such a flop. We waited over 5 years for this season 2, and it's a catastrophe. This anime disrespects the series and its legacy. out of desperation, confused about the series' distribution and wishing to explore the older anime series and the manga.

The magnificent world created by Yoichi Takahashi has yet again gazed our eyes. The deft, unique and world-class manga that has inspired many around the globe returns. As I opened the television, the new theme song alongside its introduction hits with a new, exhilarating yet nostalgic feeling. The storyline, constructed by Takahashi as per usual and expected was sublime, engaging the audience with the use of various different anecdotes and backstories as Tsubasa and his teammates faces a new challenge. Characters that had appeared in season 1 was well-developed, such as Hygua, Wakabayashi and Masaki. Taking Hygua as an example, his personality...clearly changed as he weaves through obstacles that he encounters. Still hot-heated with a strong determination to victory and everlasting glory, he is no longer the ""caged tiger"" both on and off the pitch, actively communicating with teammates. He now accepts defeat as a motive to hone his skills further and understands the importance of teamwork as seen with more frequent passing and the acknowledgement of Tsubasa as captain.Apart from these, the animations in later episodes were also catchy and engaging. Fire shoot from Schneider captures precisely his fury and strength of his shot, making use of imagery to allow the audience to understand his emotions behind each and every kick of the ball. His fire, fueled by his will to reconnect his family. Genius Dribbler Diaz shows similar trait. His delicate, skillful yet cheeky South American dribbles were captured by a flashback to his childhood and upbringing under poverty in Argentina. By engaging with this backstory, Takahashi reflects the will and hope of every Argentinian audience alike. A prominent footballing country, where all levels of people play the sport.If I had time, I would dive in further but overall I strongly recommend a watch to this nostalgic-inducing masterpiece as you are able to relive all emotions and skills alongside the Japan National Team with everyone\'s favourite Tsubasa Oozora. clearly changed as he weaves through obstacles that he encounters.

Nostalgia makes people less objective. This season, in only its fifth episode, shows the high quality that all of us fans expected and deserved! Finally Tsubasa has the anime it deserves. Really beautiful animations, more in-depth story: the historical version, in fact, cut practically all the off-screen scenes (and not only). On the contrary, this version also focuses well on the characterization of the characters and off-field situations. I wanted to wait until the end of the season before doing a review, but I couldn't bear to see such a well-made remake so criticized, without valid reasons....I had given it an 8, but now I temporarily give it a 9 to raise the rating. Can't wait for the others episodes and sequel! I had given it an 8, but now I temporarily give it a 9 to raise the rating.

I've read the manga and you know it's bad when even that feels like it's moving more then whatever this collection of still images is. YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO SEE THEM PROPERLY KICK A BALL TO ONE ANOTHER IT'S THAT BAD. Why even reboot it if you're going to give it this treatment? Who is this adaptation supposed to make happy? I doubt this adaptation would get anyone new into the franchise and the diehard fans are just hurt by this....Season 1 was absolutely fine animation-wise so I'm just confused as to what the hell went wrong in the production of this. I enjoy the franchise and the characters don't get me wrong but this adaptation is simply mediocre.

City Hunter: Ai to Shukumei no Magnum,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1474/City_Hunter__Ai_to_Shukumei_no_Magnum,"[""A great series, a sad excuse for a movie.When you imagine a series you enjoy, a classic like City Hunter, getting transformed into a movie, you hope for an epic storyline, that deepens and develops the characters, adds something new that couldn't be handled in the series, or, generally, something extra, not seen before. This movie doesn't deliver that product. At least, not entirely.As for the art, soundtrack and vocal acting, it's all the same, good City Hunter that we've been used to all the time, and the main cast is as delightfully bipolar as usual. (As a side-note, City Hunter makes Hammer Space look...GOOD.) In fact, the Ryo's past is explored a bit, to some interest, but still, it's annexed to the movie's main problem.And that problem is, this is pretty much filler.The story, unfortunately, doesn't fulfill the expectations one has towards a full-length feature movie, being a bit shallow, and having few connecting points to the larger continuity of the rest of the series. I'm no City Hunter specialist, but, surely, despite the mainly one-shot nature of the series, I was hoping for much more.But, let's be fair: It's still a good piece of entertainment, and it's always nice to watch Ryo nearly get his head blown off for peeping.

Boruto: Naruto the Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28755/Boruto__Naruto_the_Movie,"['Like many anime fans of my generation, I began my life as an anime fan through Cartoon Network\'s Toonami block, featuring shounen classics such as Dragon Ball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Rurouni Kenshin. However, for me personally, I was on the tail end of those shows\' airtime, only catching the Majin Buu saga and reruns of the first few episodes of other shows. I didn\'t come in at the beginning, so it wasn\'t like starting a brand new adventure, and it wasn\'t until around 2005 that I first got to experience the start of a brand new story, and that story, of course, was...Naruto, an epic reinterpretation of ninjas combined with the superpower action/adventure style of DBZ and other shounen tropes, though of course I had no idea what shounen was at the time. Now, after over a decade of popularity in the US, and half a decade more in Japan, the last story in the Naruto-verse has finally been told.Several years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Naruto has finally become the Seventh Hokage, and a time of peace and prosperity has descended upon the Leaf Village. However, this time our focus is not on Naruto, but on his son, Boruto, a young ninja desperately seeking the attention of his father, who has become overwhelmed with his duties as Hokage and barely has time to spend with his family anymore. Through his trials in the lead-up to the Chunin Exams, as well as a mysterious new villain making an appearance, Boruto attempts to garner his father\'s attention and force him to recognize his exceptional talent as a shinobi and give him the attention he so desperately craves.Much like Naruto: The Last, we\'ve moved past simply adding a new villain for our favorite characters to fight against, and instead the main focus of this movie is on the emotional turmoil that Boruto and Naruto have to work through in their strained father-son relationship. This part of the story is pretty straightforward and basic, though that\'s really all that it needs to be. Naruto doesn\'t have time to spend with his son, so Boruto gets angry and hates his dad\'s guts, yet still tries his best to get his dad to notice him. In terms of the franchise\'s history, Boruto is actually a fairly weak-willed main character at times and gives up a lot more easily than his father ever did, though this still seems to work because, rather than not having anyone in the first place like Naruto, or having his family taken from him like Sasuke, he instead feels abandoned by a father who is still technically there but doesn\'t pay enough attention, causing him to essentially lose hope that his situation will ever get better, and when he does finally start seeing reassurance from his father after Boruto starts making more headway in the ninja world, he subconsciously rebounds and does everything he can to keep his dad\'s attention, even if his methods start to deviate from the shinobi way. In a way, this sort of echoes Sasuke\'s history, which kind of makes sense since Sasuke is Boruto\'s mentor for a good portion of the film, and at times it almost feels like Boruto sees Sasuke as someone to fill the void left by his barely-there father, though this idea isn\'t explored too much in the film. The overall arc of Boruto\'s character is probably the best part of this film, as it reaches a satisfying conclusion in the final act.As for Naruto, this is probably the most difficult part of the story to convey to the audience, since they have to make Naruto look extremely busy without making him act like a douche to his family, and with the exception of a few lines, they manage to do that fairly well. You can definitely see that he\'s become overloaded and exhausted from his work as Hokage, and also that he\'s still trying to find time to spend with his family, although failing miserably. There are a few moments in the beginning though where the strictness he\'s adopted as the Hokage seems to be a bit too forced for his character and ends up making him look a bit uncaring, which is hardly the kind of trait you would expect from Naruto.As for the rest of the cast, most of them are fairly solid. I ended up liking Sarada a lot more than I thought I would since she ends up being an interesting support character for Boruto in sharing similar elements of their parental situations. I do wish they had explored her more in this movie, but I suppose that\'s what Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring is for. The rest of the characters fill out their own fan service and nostalgia roles pretty nicely, and I didn\'t really expect any more than that since it would end up clogging up the main story line. The main villain, unfortunately, is pretty much as generic as they come. Again, anything super-complex would have bogged down the character drama between Boruto and Naruto, but this guy\'s about as plain and standard as they come. They try to work him into the already existing shinobi history, which worked out fine in Naruto: The Last, but it feels like too much of a stretch in this case and a lot of the details feel a bit jumbled and rushed.The new technology they introduce in this film was also a bit odd at times. I\'ve always felt that Kishimoto has struggled with balancing how much advanced technology is used in the Naruto universe, and this movie almost fixes that problem by basically showing this giant leap forward in technology, and it even seems to address the debate of whether hard work and willpower or technology and cutting edge tools with spearhead the future of the shinobi world, but it\'s still just a tad too jagged and uneven at times.As for animation, this is definitely one of the best-looking Naruto films thus far, though I\'m not quite sure I would call it the best. The character designs are about as refined and polished as they\'ve ever been, though I did notice quite a few draw distance issues. Perhaps this was more a problem with the theater I saw it in...amongst many other problems I had with my particular theater viewing, that will eventually be fixed by the time the Blu-rays come out, but it\'s still something worth noting. To my delight, this film does not rely nearly as much on CG environments as previous movies have done, though there are still a few whiffs of that pungent CG stench hanging around. As for the action scenes, once again, it does a lot of things right, and a lot of things not so right. When it gets into the huger scale of things, the choreography and particle physics are outstanding, with tons of vivid colors and unique attack designs, and watching these massive explosions and earth-shattering jutsu go off in everyone\'s faces is spectacular to watch. On the other end though, a lot of the smaller, hand-to-hand choreography is a bit disappointing, especially compared to the previous film. There are a few moments where the hand-to-hand gets pretty awesome and some of the more complex strategies and jutsu are fun to watch, but these moments largely fall by the wayside in exchange for a “whoever has the biggest jutsu wins” competition like the latter half of the main Naruto storyline fell into. The very end of the battle did have at least some smartness to it though, so I wasn\'t dissatisfied by the ending to a significant degree. Despite its flaws though, this is some of the better work that Studio Pierrot has put out so far, and it\'s a great way to view the shinobi world for one last time.On the soundtrack end of things, it\'s pretty much the same as it\'s always been: an epic combination of orchestral and rock compositions with that extra Eastern flavor of shamisen, taiko drums, and bamboo flute that has shaped the Naruto soundtrack\'s identity for the past thirteen years. The ending song played during the credits was provided by Kana-Boon and gives us that last burst of excitement as what is most likely the final chapter in the Naruto world comes to a close. Oh by the way, make sure you watch the after-credits scene because it is absolutely something that you do not want to miss.Overall, if you go into this movie thinking it\'ll be the big final hoorah of the Naruto franchise and that it\'s the best story yet, you\'ll probably be disappointed. To me, the final climax of Naruto was in Naruto: The Last, if you couldn\'t tell from how often I brought it up during this review, and Boruto is more of a fan service/second generation side story that serves as more of a dessert dish rather than the last bite of a spectacular main course. Despite that, though, I still highly recommend that you see this movie if you are a Naruto fan because, despite all its flaws, it\'s still probably the last major project that Kishimoto will make for the Naruto franchise, and that\'s...kinda sad for me. Even though there are so many other, much better anime out there, Naruto is the one that, for me and thousands, possibly millions of other anime fans, shaped how we viewed anime as we were growing up, and to know that the story is now completely finished is kind of depressing. Sure the TV anime is still going...for some reason, but the manga\'s story is completely finished and now there\'s this void left behind from a series that\'s been a massive part of my life for so long that I can\'t even remember what life was like without Naruto. From the first volume to the last, from Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow to Boruto, and the dozens of side stories in-between, this has been one hell of a ride. Knowing that there\'s a future without more Naruto is really weird for me, and, in time, perhaps a new franchise will take its place...but, that\'s a story for another day.For now, I say ""Sayonara"" to a franchise that, despite its flaws, means more to me than others can possibly imagine.

Knowing that there\'s a future without more Naruto is really weird for me, and, in time, perhaps a new franchise will take its place...but, that\'s a story for another day.For now, I say ""Sayonara"" to a franchise that, despite its flaws, means more to me than others can possibly imagine.', 'I really wanted to review this movie, because it\'s officially Kishimoto\'s final involvement with the Naruto franchise (if nothing changes, that is) and I wanted to make somewhat of a tribute to this series, that has been part of my life for quite some time.Story: 50%Characters: 30%Art: 10%Soundtrack: 10%Story (3/5):The story is nothing special. It\'s basically an encore to the series\' epilogue and centers around the new generation, that got introduced in the final chapter of the main series. The focus is Naruto\'s son Boruto, who is torn between admiring his father as the hokage and rebelling against him for not having any time for...his kids. It amounts to a really good first half, but a somewhat cookie cutter second half, that is not without it\'s flaws. What threw me off the hype train in the second half, was how much they bothered introducing new characters to rival the likes of Madara and Kaguya. The end product was Momoshiki, who had flashy abilities, but lacked to grab my attention and had too little screen time. I would have preferred it, if they went with a villain of a smaller scale. They could problemlessly pull through Boruto\'s conflict, even if they used a weaker antagonist. I mean the antagonists in ""Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal"", were no way near the threat level of Shishio and some other antagonists of the main series, and yet the film managed to have a good and consistent plot. So why didn\'t they do something like that in Boruto? Also [minor spoiler] the lead up to the final battle was too rushed and Boruto fellt out of place in that company. So yeah... if it weren\'t for the well animated battles, the second half would have kinda sucked.Art (4/5):The art was pretty good. The battles were fluent and well choreographed. The Sasuke and Naruto VS Momoshiki battle definetly deserves to be mentioned.Soundtrack (4/5):Another pretty good field. In my opinion Naruto always had a great soundtrack. They recycled some songs from the series though.Characters (3,5/5):I guess the main focus is on Boruto, who has daddy issues. A common internal conflict in the Naruto universe and may likely be off putting to some viewers. Personally I didn\'t mind it, because I thought it was handled pretty well here (definetly better than in the Sarada manga). Especially interesting were the changes done to Naruto Uzumaki. His characterization in this movie was surprisingly good, considering the fact, that he was a pretty irritating character in the last 200 or so chapters. Here we see him as an actual adult, who no longer shouts around bullsh*t spontaneously and who reflects upon his status as the hokage and a father, hoping he\'ll figure out a way to balance the two out. I found this humanization of this ""Jesus-esque"" character to be one of the more pleasant surprises in this movie. There was also Sasuke, who smiled more in this movie. Also he apparently developed some social skills. So I guess Sasuke was okay. I would have wished to see more mentor/ student chemistry between Sasuke and Boruto though. A minor complaint was how little the other new genin were shown. I really wanted to know more about them.Critical score: 6,7/10+considering enjoyment to round it up to a whole numberFinal score: 7/10 his kids.

This movie is by far my favorite. It did have it\'s ups and downs, which I will eventually deal with. By the way, expect to be spoiled.So this is literally what the Naruto Gaiden manga as led to. We finally get to see the new generation in all it\'s glory. We see Naruto fulfilling his dreams, as well as juggling his children, we see the Chunin Exams, as well as Sasuke going in. To be honest everyone gets to shine to an extent....Except TenTen. What I found odd about this story was the villains(Momoshiki and...Kinshiki) defeat and Mitsuki\'s father. Wish I had received more closure around that fact. The story gets a 10/10.-The art and animation are top notch, seriously superb. Why can\'t we get this for Shippuden. Either way, I am giving this a 10/10.-Characters like Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Sarada and Boruto got some pretty good development. Boruto being one of them, getting to see the new ""Naruto"", however this at first made me think he was a spoiled brat. Going into this movie, I had a massive hatred for this kid. He could have learnt to respect his amazing father. But hey, he eventually learns to respect his father. I mean hell, the job that you dream of doing will always be hard. The main goal for Naruto was to be Hokage. Boruto not understanding that is what got to me. Sakura was impressive. To be honest, I have gained a new respect for her. Sarada has also become one of my favorite heroines in the Naruto series. Sasuke, I have seen amazing things with this guy. He has taken badassery to a whole new level. Training Boruto and even admitting his wrongs. The guy as really grown on me. 9/10-Other characters, like the new 4 kage(Darui, Gaara,Kurotsuchi and Chojuro) where rather impressive, they held their own against villains as strong, if not stronger than Kaguya. Shikamaru, Shikadai, Inojin and Mitsuki where characters I held a genuine interest in as well.-The villains. The skinny one is known as Momoshiki and the massive one is known as Kinshiki. To be honest, I really loved these villains. They had a strange air to them, which made them feel fitting. Hell they where even better then Kaguya. What I disliked about these villains is the fact that they where defeated with a rasengan. Having Boruto do the job, felt like the torch was being passed though. In the end, it does make sense. Since the villains had lost their ability to adsorb power. I do wish that this was actually manga chapters because of how well these villains where fleshed out. 9/10-Enjoyment: I really enjoyed this movie. Seeing Naruto become Hokage and look after his children rather well. Seeing the original team 7, as well as Boruto deciding to become someone like Sasuke, while Sarada becomes Hokage. To be honest, this is what I admire. Not having Boruto follow his father\'s footsteps and having Sarada become hokage.Here is a summary:Story: 10/10, loved it. I did hate Boruto at the beginning. Pacing was also a problem. I wish the characters where fleshed out a bit more.Art: 10/10 the art is always amazing.Character development: 10/10. Sarada and Boruto. As well as Naruto and Sasuke.

The best movie yet.', 'Starting with a clever dialogue and moving into an emotional and tension filled story, Boruto delivers some of the best that Naruto has had to offer throughout its original run.Boruto picks up marginally after the time skip between the end of the manga and the Naruto movie ""The Last."" If you have not seen those two yet, I recommend watching them before Boruto as many references and assumptions are taken from knowing those stories.In terms of art and music, Boruto delivered high quality work. The entire film was enjoyable as known melodies from Naruto intertwined with original soundtracks to give the viewer just enough...nostalgia to both enjoy and appreciate the progression of Naruto as a franchise. The art was outstanding as very minimal details were countless and even after watching the film with attention to detail, it is certain that in a second viewing one could get much more out of the subtleties. The fighting sequences were also very craftily created as they were fast paced, dynamic, and heart pumping for a large majority.In terms of story, Boruto delivered something different and much needed from Naruto movies; emotional tension over another big ""bad guy."" It isn\'t to say that Boruto had an absence of a good villain; that was fine, but more so that Boruto focuses much more on the events outside the villain. Instead of using plot as a means to defeat a tough villain, Boruto uses the villain as a tool to further develop the plot which to that point was filled with tension emotionally, mentally and even physically. Boruto manages to center itself around the bods between the people of this time and the dynamics of these brand new characters meshing with the old. Without spoiling too much, it is safe to say that Boruto takes on all the better part of Naruto\'s quest for overcoming hardship by means of companionship and extends the theme to family, the future and the difficulty of love.The only reason character gets an 8/10 is because Boruto could have done more to explore the development of characters outside of the Boruto-Naruto dynamic. We know nothing of Narutos relationship with Hinata, Sakura or even any old members from his class. We also know very little about the younger generation and their dynamics. There are a lot of cameo appearances but they could have been explored even a little bit more forward.Overall, Boruto was a massively entertaining experience from the themes of family, love and hardship to the epic action packed combat. Boruto definitely does not fall short of any expectations and though not a good conclusion for the franchise (leaves many loose ends) it leaves one with the feeling of content and nostalgia all leaving lasting memories in the minds of the fans from those who have waited years watching Naruto grow, to those who picked it up recently and enjoyed the world of the shinobi.Thank you Kishimoto. nostalgia to both enjoy and appreciate the progression of Naruto as a franchise.

Everything mentioned happens in the first 5 minutes anyways.So Boruto has to be the biggest disappointment ive ever come across.  And im a huge psycho-pass fan.  So let me get this straight. So for over a decade, 600 episodes with god knows how many flashbacks, of Naruto having this childhood of loneliness and no one paying attention to him and not having parents or friends, acting out to get attention. This TORTURED childhood of PAIN which allows him to reach anyones heart, and hes a shit...father?  Thats how this total hypocrisy of whats been shoved down our throats starts off?  Naurtos becomes an asshole who neglects his kids to the point they hate him?  He puts his own family thru the exact same thing that fucked him up sooooo bad as a kid?  That goes against everything Naruto is and has stood for these past 13 years. And apparently he needs anti-depressants.So with that out of the way whats next? Art? Exactly what youve seen already.  Music? Exactly the same. Characters? Sure its nice to see what becomes of everyone but its just Blah. So i guess Hinata is what? She pretty much did nothing the whole movie but call out to some people. This movie for real just brings down the whole series.So i guess theres a few action sequences.  Naruto doesnt use ninjutsu so dont expect to be impressed by anything Naruto does the whole movie apparently.  Sasuke being the only saving grace.So to wrap it all up i wish i could say just skip this garbage, it truly puts a bad taste in your mouth, but we know that isnt gonna happen cause we are huge fans and have to see whats out there.  If you walk in already disappointed maybe it stings less. father?  Thats how this total hypocrisy of whats been shoved down our throats starts off?

If you walk in already disappointed maybe it stings less.', ""The best word to descirbe Boruto is only; disappointing.The story cut short and its nothing different than the original old Naruto anime but there is one thing that really, really makes me mad.Boruto call Naruto 'dad' but suddenly Naruto got mad, and want Boruto to call him Seventh in the Hokage office like what the f*ck! that just  really cruel. Where's Naruto that we know and love, is he change to be an asshole to his OWN family after become a Hokage?The story only base on a 'daddy issues' that Boruto had with his so called father. But thank god Sasuke took a part...in this movie unlike Naruto: The Last which Sasuke only show up ONCE and literally said only 1 sentence after that he's gone.But in Boruto the movie Sasuke took a big part and become Boruto's teacher, and this is also another disappointing if you look at the trailer of this movie Boruto held a Chidori on his hands but in fact its nothing than a ninja tool that Boruto secretly use. Now that just burn everyone wishes that Sasuke teach him the Chidori jutsu.The art style is not so bad but it's pretty standard for anime movies. Hinata, Sakura and other grow-up women in this movie is actually gorgeous.[SPOLIERS]One thing I enjoy about Boruto is that I get to know who the hell is Mitsuki father or.... mother?The OST is played by KANA-BOON who also make a OP for Naruto Shipudden 16.Overall, this is the last Masashi Kishimoto creation but  it really can't be more disappointing.

If you love Naruto, you will love this movie. It is incredible."", 'Boruto the first movie, is a sequel to Naruto the Last movie, where the milking of the franchise keeps going by simply repeating the same crap all over again. Although Kishimoto was given the chance to start fresh with new characters and new storylines, all he did was making the children have the exact same personalities as their parents, and the plot being a repeat of everything that happened thus far. Despite trying to make it seem things are different, Boruto is still going through the exact same events Naruto did.The saddest part is that despite the rehash, the movie still has a much more...likable get up. Boruto is not a typical shonen protagonist, in the sense he is not an orphan hated by everyone, has super amazing hidden powers inside him, while also being the chosen one. Despite going through the exact same events as his father, he is a much more normal character, living in a much less emo world that is not constantly victimizing children. Unless you had a really messed up childhood, this was making everything much easier to relate with.Remember when Naruto stole the secret scroll in the first episode and never got punished for such a major crime? Well, Boruto does something similar; he cheats in the Chuunin exam by using technology instead of his own powers. He is exposed in front of everyone by his own father. He is not a victimized orphan driven over the edge, so he can’t use that excuse. This right here could have been the point where we get a good story about the protagonist dealing with the consequences of his mistakes. The last part of the movie could have been about him facing rejection and disappointment from everyone, which would have taught him a lot of important life lessons.But instead of that, we get the obligatory villain of the movie attacking and everything goes back to the same old done to death fighting shonen bullshit we’ve been getting for the past 15 years. Boruto doesn’t need to face consequences because the villain is conveniently someone who also became strong by using other peoples’ power instead of his own. Meaning, the conflict is no longer psychological because it got externalized and can simply be solved by punching the crap out of it.I know this is a movie for children so it makes sense that it would never try to handle its conflicts in a mature manner. But the get-up was so good and the villain attacked the moment the hero was about to be blamed, thus it’s essentially Kishimoto showing the viewer his middle finger. Kishi, you don’t present me with a juicy steak and then you take it away; you had us expecting a juicy steak and not the same old horseshit. You ruined the conflict by having a one dimensional villain who wants to kill everyone and take over the world.The last third of the movie is just a retarded battle shonen with powers working in any way the plot demands for them to work. Boruto instantly switches from a pariah whose father is disappointed of him, to the hero who saves the day and even gets to rescue his father with the power of plot convenience. I mean, holy crap, why did the four kage, the most powerful people in the world, accept to take Boruto, of all people, on the rescue mission? Without cheating he can barely do basic attacks. Why don’t they take Sakura or Hinata with them, who are a hundred times more powerful? Oh, I know why, because if you are a female character in a shonen story, the moment you are married is the moment you become a worthless housewife.Jesus Christ, it’s like everything that happens in these movies is a lazy excuse for children to feel privileged even when they don’t deserve it. And even then, it’s still bullshit in this one because for the most part it is Naruto and Sasuke doing all the work as they always did. The movie is called Boruto, and the only thing he contributed was to hit the villain in the face with an obligatory rasengan he got from Naruto. Are you freaking kidding me?Kishimoto clearly can’t write anything new anymore and this awful movie is proof of that. It exists only as a cashgrab that rehashes the exact same events and makes them worse than they already were. Let it die already. likable get up.

Let me start off saying that this review will have spoilers! If you haven't read the manga nor naruto gaiden then I suggest to skip this review, therefore, you shall not pass from here.Story: 7/10The story of this movie was very straightforward. Boruto doesn't like naruto and he became sasuke's apprentice to he can defeat his father. Kinshiki and Momoshiki are introduced as descendants of the Otsutsuki clan. Their objective is to reproduce what madara and kaguya did aka the big tree which contains all the chakra. They want that so they can gain immortality and...youth. I'll talk about the characters in the character section.Art: 8/10:The art was pretty good. I didn't notice a bad art like what you currently see in the anime.Sound: 8/10The soundtracks that were used on this movie were good, nothing special but still good.Character: 8:10The movie started off with sasuke fighting against Kinshiki and Momoshiki, who are descendant of the Ōtsutsuki clan. It started off with a lot of ninjutsu and taijutsu. The scenes were well done.Konohamaru introduced us a new tool that allows the user to seal techniques, which later on can be released from the small scroll and use the sealed technique.Boruto, he started off as your typical spoiled brat. He's the leader of his group conformed by sarada and mitsuki. Throughout the movie, he wanted his dad(naruto) to give him attention in every way possible. He doesn't want to become hokage.Sarada and Mitsuki convinced boruto to join the chunnin exams to prove how strong boruto is to his father. Naruto's duty is to watch the third round along with the other kages (Gaara, Chojuro, Darui and last but not least Kurotsuchi).Boruto did pretty well in the early stages by cheating using the device that Katasuke made (he did it for research purposes). In the last round, he had to fight Shikadai (the son of Shikamaru). Shikadai trapped naruto with the nara technique clan so boruto, he wanted to impress his dad, cheated there as well and naruto noticed it. Boruto, with the help of the device, makes a lot of clones that made shikadai forfeit. Boruto is later congratulated by everyone who was watching but naruto, who saw him cheating, told Shikamaru that boruto is disqualified for cheating. Boruto gets pissed off and told him that he is never there for him. And if it was there for him, he wouldn't have relied on the device.Kinshiki and Momoshiki appeared out of nowhere and then they start fighting (sasuke shows up). The other kages started evacuating the people who were watching the chunnin exams (they had no action at that part). The fight was dope though. Naruto, to save his son, took a direct attack (he was using a form bijuu mode with the sage chakra) and then somehow was captured by Momoshiki.Boruto believes that naruto died so he start thinking all the bad things that he told his dad. He goes into the hokage house and grabs his old outfit (naruto part 1) and start thinking about naruto. Sasuke shows up and told him that ''you're a bigger loser than your dad'' and tells him that naruto is still alive. He cries for happiness and uses naruto's outfit and goes to rescue his dad.It's shown to us that Momoshiki has been stealing naruto's chakra for a while and that he still have a huge amount of it. The gokages shows up along with sasuke and boruto and saves the day. Then the gokage starts fighting against Kinshiki. They are strong as hell! They live up for the title! Kages are OP! Somehow they were able to seal Kinshiki, in the same way that rsm naruto sealed one of madara's limbo with the truth seeking ball.Momoshiki fights against naruto and sasuke. He is outlasted very easy so he absorbs Kinshiki and becomes stronger. They keep fighting for a while. Naruto and Sasuke made a susanoo bijuu mode and then they ended defeating kinshiki. Then he goes into this lava golem version and start attacking our ninjas! Sasuke protects boruto and he request to make a rasengan. He tries to make a rasengan and then he throws it at Kinshiki, he noticed it and he prepares himself to absorb the attack but before the rasengan landed, it disappeared then he focused on naruto, the rasengan landed a hit on him. He ask why and that's because boruto's rasengan is a special case. His rasengan disappear and then appear (pretty cool!). Boruto goes to naruto and he helps his son to make a big rasengan (like the one that minato and naruto did in naruto shippuden lost tower). Boruto goes against Kinshiki and ends winning the battle.Enjoyment: 9/10The movie was well done in my opinion. It was pretty good to see other naruto fans enjoy this movie. The soundtracks were on point. The art was good. The story was pretty good.I started hating boruto since the naruto gaiden but this movie makes you like him. He goes from spoiled brat to a badass boruto.The movie ended boruto respecting naruto and wants him to keep working as hard as possible as a hokage. He later meets up with sarada and mitsuki and then sarada asks him if he still wants to become a hokage. He told her not and that his dream is to support sarada's dream, which is to become hokage, and that he wants to be her right man (the shippers went all crazy at the movies theater). Not gonna lie. I found that moment very funny because sarada blushes. Then they ask mitsuki who his parents are. Mitsuki told them that orochimaru is his dad and then they ask... is he the father or the mother? All the people in the movies theater started laughing, including myself. It was a pretty good ending!Overall: 8/10This movie was pretty good. Better than the last and I highly recommend it to everyone who has read the manga and naruto gaiden. 8/10 in my book! youth.

Here\'s all you need to know.The Good:- Definitely better than the ""Last"" movie.- The plot actually advances. Several characters undergo plot-altering changes, including the death of an important character in one of the opening scenes (that no one seems to care about).  The point is, this is not like in Last where everything just returns to normal and nothing new is revealed. The writers were given the power to forever alter the lives of the characters in a...meaningful (non-shallow) way, which is essential for the story to have any tension or depth.- The relationship between unlikely star Sasuke and Boruto is one of the best sensei-pupil interactions since Kakashi and Team 7 and has surprising depth and symbolism.- The Boruto character is not necessary likeable, but he\'s realistically depicted, given his circumstances. The writers shied away from making him just another Naruto clone (pun intended) and gave him a completely different personality, but you\'re still able to see the resemblence beyond just his looks. (Boruto\'s also not as OP as Naruto was, which is a good thing) I\'m sure this was a very tough and mature decision for the writers and Kishimoto to make, as it would have been much easier to just repeat some of Naruto\'s old storylines (not that they didn\'t) and milk this cash cow for what it is.- Sasuke and Naruto (aka Batman & Superman) team up Avengers style in some much improved battle scenes, which was what they should have done in the Last movie. The increased role of Sasuke meant that the artists could implement some very cool-looking taijutsu choreography that was missing from the Last movie (which closer resembed a rave light show than a ninja fight).- Regardless of whether you like him or hate him, Sasuke is easily the MVP of the entire Naruto franchise. He\'s the most interesting character, with the most interesting background, appearance, choreography, jutsus, and has some of the best lines in the series. No matter how big Naruto\'s Rasengan gets or what random animal shape it takes on, he really can\'t compare to Sasuke in terms of sheer appeal, even Boruto would agree. Of course, because of his often questionable and inconsistent personality, many fans hate his guts, myself included. But for the sake of this stand-alone movie, he is the unquestioned star. So if you like him, you\'ll find the movie enjoyable. If you hate him, then you won\'t.- This is a Naruto movie. This is a show that many of us grew up watching, and have a very deep connection to. It may have even been one of the first animes you\'ve ever watched. So given the sheer scope of the universe in which it is set, it really doesn\'t need to be amazing for it to be enjoyable. This movie was decent. Considering how bad all the other movies have been, this was easily a success. I would go as far as to say it\'s the best Naruto movie, but that\'s like saying Alec Baldwin is the best Baldwin (I mean, they all pretty much suck).The Bad:- The movie moves at a snails pace.- It also tries to cover too much ground, both in terms of plot development and overarching themes. It succeeds at some, and fails at others.- Emotional depth is between shallow and non-existent.- Boruto, the titular character, in terms of storyline, is completely unnecessary to the movie, and really prevents the film from drawing you into their world. For example, in the final scene of the boss battle, Naruto and Sasuke seemed more preocupied with teaching Boruto a lesson than defeating the mass-murdering demi-god. This really takes away from the story\'s immersion.- Because the movie is stretched so thin, several interesting characters are given little to no screen time, including - Sarata, the other kid in team Boruto (who reminds me of Sai), and Naruto\'s daughter are all high-potential characters that got no love in the movie. Naruto\'s daughter literally got no love from Naruto in the entire movie, as Boruto is clearly his favorite child (makes sense, since Boruto reminds him of Sasuke, and his manlove for Sasuke is pretty epic).- The antagonist is very poorly written and his motivations are often confusing and nonsensical. He\'s esseentially just a ""bad guy who wants to do something bad."" This is the result of the producers trying to do too much in one film. There was too much fat in this movie, a lot of which could have been trimmed down to depict a less meaningless antagonist. This is probably the movies greatest weakness.- The producers still have grammar issues. -_-;Story: 4Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 7Enjoyment: 8 (10 if you\'re a Sasuke fanboy/fangirl)Overall: 7All in all, this movie is the frontrunner for: ""Anime you would shamefully watch twice, then pretend to all your friends you never saw it."" meaningful (non-shallow) way, which is essential for the story to have any tension or depth.- The relationship between unlikely star Sasuke and Boruto is one of the best sensei-pupil interactions since Kakashi and Team 7 and has surprising depth and symbolism.- The Boruto character is not necessary likeable, but he\'s realistically depicted, given his circumstances.

The music is catchy too. However these things do not save the whole movie.To tell the truth, by the time I finished Naruto, I have been totally fed up with Kishimoto characters\' design, and plot and other stuffs.He keeps making the same mistakes. As a female, I\'m really disappointed to see Sarada - such a potential character, being pushed to the background by a lame ""father issue"" character. Naruto and Sasuke play major roles while their wives are still useless as usual. DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A BADASS FEMALE CHARACTER HERE?!Then again, the...story, at least it certainly is better than ""the Last"". But, it moves slowly in the opening, then too rush in the final battle. And... I mean what\'s wrong with you people?! For the last 2 movies Naruto is a completely different person, a hypocrite that is.This is a new area and nothing new is going around, still the same faces, same issue fighting some psycho white fellows from time to time, almost makes me think that\'s a deja vu. I really think they should spend time on exploring the new era rather than displaying such an obnoxious brat and why he hates his hypocrite dad.*I heard that Kishimoto is writing a new series about Boruto, well truly hope he would really move on and stop dragging Naruto\'s crew back. story, at least it certainly is better than ""the Last"".

Though that being said, this movie did everything you would expect to see in a Naruto movie, or rather have already seen in Naruto.... seen far too many times. To put it simply it was unbearably cliche.Before I continue, let\'s talk about target audience. I hardly doubt that anyone who hasn\'t read the Naruto manga to it\'s fullest will be going out of their way to watch this movie that is indeed set after the events that occur in Chapter 700 and even...after the Naruto Gaiden.So obviously, the only people that are going to be watching this movie are going to be people who have invested a great deal of time with the Naruto franchise. Which is something this movie definitely made a note of. It showed tons of cameos from almost the whole main cast of Naruto doing something completely obscure. Just to have people start fanboying when their favourite character appears on screen. With that and having Naruto\'s name in the title of the movie, the movie could\'ve been some romance between Kiba and Ichiraku\'s daughter for 95 minutes and the studio would still make profit.So needless to say, I went into this movie with very low expectation, but during my watch, there were times where I was actually enjoying it.Story (4/10):The story is so freaking cliche it make me want to cry. Boruto, is having family troubles, Naruto gives a sort of pep talk and they\'re friends now, Boruto messes up, they break up, final fight happens, and they\'re back to being friends.That\'s the main story. It was boring, I hated everything about it. But there were certain premises in the movie\'s setting that I sort of liked.This is going to get a bit spoily, so read at your own risk.The scientific ninja tools that they had were one of the really cool things this movie introduced. Being someone who has been following Naruto for a long time, it mind boggled me how much these new ninja tools changed the power system in Naruto. It was like, everyone had their own pair of sharingan. Everyone was the Copy Ninja. But for some reason the movie shunned on it, which was a big let down.Also, the bad guys. They could have been really interesting, actually they were interesting, but we hardly got any of them. They came, they rekt, and then in the next 15 minutes proceeded to get rekt, and that was the end of that. They were somehow related to Kaguya and Kaguya\'s plan of creating the White Zetsu army, which was hardly explained. Leaving out the motives of the antagonist like that = bad, bad writing.Characters (4/10):The main character of this movie were, Boruto, Naruto, & Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke went through absolutely no character development... sort of.In Naruto\'s case, in the beginning of the movie he turn in to a douche bag, but then by the end of it he was back to being the same old Naruto, it\'s like reverse character development.Sasuke didn\'t change at all.Boruto sort of had character development, since by the end of the movie he stopped being a idiotic prick, but since he was a prick the whole movie you can\'t really like him, which turns into not caring about him.The supporting characters were pretty much the entire cast of the Naruto manga with their kids.Sarada has changed. She was a lot better off in the gaiden, she had the good components of both Sasuke and Sakura. Now she has just turned into a  less dramatic Sakura. She isn\'t a prick though, like both of her parents were.Her trying to be Hokage is cool, but that\'s from the Gaiden, and the movie really just adapted it.Mitsuki, was the sarcastic asshole. Which is totally awesome because you don\'t get that in Naruto. But he had almost little to none screen time.The other kids were the same, they made small appearances to show that they exist.Though I must say that the kid using the bugs (not confirmed to be Shino\'s son), has a badass character design.The other characters from the original Naruto manga, made small cameo appearances, but weren\'t all that important. Shikamaru & Hinata were the only one\'s who actually tried to do something against the villains, of which Hinata\'s attempt was off-screen... something I don\'t I\'ll ever understand the reasoning behind.Oh... and then there were the Kage\'s. I hate them. I mean like why do we need to care about these guys, apart from Gaara, they are all fodder. I wanted to see Lee fight some bad guys not freaking Chojuro. Who the fk cares about Chojuro?Anyway, yeah the Kage were there, and they were somewhat important.The bad guys were really bad. Not as in evil, as in just bad. There purpose was glossed over and they weren\'t all that strong either. Just the fact that they had to use only taijutsu against them, (AND THEY STILL DIDN""T BRING ROCK LEE FOR THE FINAL FIGHT).Enjoyment (8/10):I did somewhat enjoy this movie, despite its many faults.One of the reasons was because of the high production value.The animation was absolutely brilliant and fluid, something Naruto is usually not so good at. The action scenes were some of the best I have ever seen in anime, and definitely the best Naruto has ever offered.As a long running Naruto fan, I did enjoy seeing the character as adults, though I did feel that some of them didn\'t change much.Overall (6/10);The movie was pretty bad from a critical standpoint, in fact it was terrible. But considering its target audience and how bad it really could have been (see Naruto: The Last for an example), it did  a somewhat mediocre job. And hence should get a mediocre score. after the Naruto Gaiden.So obviously, the only people that are going to be watching this movie are going to be people who have invested a great deal of time with the Naruto franchise.

And hence should get a mediocre score.', 'The movie is so awful,  I literally wish I could forget I ever saw it. I really loved Naruto and I was extremely sad it ended but there\'s no reason to drag the series any longer. If you love Naruto as a character, I suggest you to forget all about Boruto . The story is stupid and the newly introduced characters are badly drawn, uninspired, with no interesting character traits. I found the kids annoying and superficial considering they are training to be future warriors. Αnd all this hype around Boruto, regarding the alleged Naruto\'s death, is a cheap commercial trick.WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERSWell, Naruto...is a complete asshole in this movie. They had a great character, who was easy-going, pleasant, friendly, loved everyone and made people all around the shinobi world instantly like him and they completely changed his character into a boring, bossy, always serious and obnoxious person. This Naruto almost never laughs and always disappoints his family, having lost sight of what is important to him. It\'s like a badly written fan fiction novel, by someone who really hates the main character. I refuse to aknowledge this fake Naruto.Naruto demands his son call him ""Seventh"" or ""Hokage"" instead of dad in his office. Are they kidding us? He called everyone ""jiichan"" or ""baachan"" and was always disrespectful, and now he demands his child to be this formal with his own father? He, who never cared about rules, and put above everything bonds between people would even think of saying something like that?Naruto seems to always neglect his family, being all day in his office and using his shadow clones to cover for himself. Boruto implies his father doesn\'t even remember his daughter\'s birthday and then we actually watch Naruto not going to the birthday party! He sent a clone which disappeared while holding the birthday cake. So, the birthday cake fell on the floor, the party was ruined, and everyone was sad, but Naruto didn\'t even bother say he was sorry, or try to make up for it. Are they really trying to persuade us, that Naruto, a person who grew up alone and always wished for a family, would ever treat his family like that? He, who spend so much time with other kids, like Konohamaru, would neglect his own children, to the point that they hate him?Naruto doesn\'t even bother congratulating his son for passing the first round of ""chuunin exams"". Instead he sends a text message. In the second round it gets even worse as he discovers Boruto is using a machine to cheat, so he ridicules his son in front of everyone, disqualifies him, and then goes as far as taking his son\'s Konoha band saying he doesn\'t deserve to be a shinobi(!!!!). Well, I don\'t know who this horrible person is, but it definitely isn\'t the Naruto we all know.There are many more scenes like these. In general, they just wanted to make Boruto likeable, and the only thing they managed to think in order to make us pity the child, was to destroy everything we knew about the previous protagonist. If it was a random movie, regarding the strained relationship between a father and his son, it could be decent. But that is not the case here. is a complete asshole in this movie. They had a great character, who was easy-going, pleasant, friendly, loved everyone and made people all around the shinobi world instantly like him and they completely changed his character into a boring, bossy, always serious and obnoxious person. This Naruto almost never laughs and always disappoints his family, having lost sight of what is important to him. It\'s like a badly written fan fiction novel, by someone who really hates the main character. I refuse to aknowledge this fake Naruto.Naruto demands his son call him ""Seventh"" or ""Hokage"" instead of dad in his office. Are they kidding us? He called everyone ""jiichan"" or ""baachan"" and was always disrespectful, and now he demands his child to be this formal with his own father? He, who never cared about rules, and put above everything bonds between people would even think of saying something like that?Naruto seems to always neglect his family, being all day in his office and using his shadow clones to cover for himself. Boruto implies his father doesn\'t even remember his daughter\'s birthday and then we actually watch Naruto not going to the birthday party! He sent a clone which disappeared while holding the birthday cake. So, the birthday cake fell on the floor, the party was ruined, and everyone was sad, but Naruto didn\'t even bother say he was sorry, or try to make up for it. Are they really trying to persuade us, that Naruto, a person who grew up alone and always wished for a family, would ever treat his family like that? He, who spend so much time with other kids, like Konohamaru, would neglect his own children, to the point that they hate him?Naruto doesn\'t even bother congratulating his son for passing the first round of ""chuunin exams"". Instead he sends a text message. In the second round it gets even worse as he discovers Boruto is using a machine to cheat, so he ridicules his son in front of everyone, disqualifies him, and then goes as far as taking his son\'s Konoha band saying he doesn\'t deserve to be a shinobi(!!!!).

I enjoy watching it from the first till the very last minute plus credits and the cliffhanger of Mitsuki's parent after that. Everyone was laughing on that!The plot and scenes are arranged beautifully that I feel no time is wasted. Graphics animations and music soundtrack also have amazing effects!Even if you don't read the Japanese manga or previous movie, you can tell that the essence of story about a boy who's longing for a father's acceptance but ended up overwhelmed by the fact that Boruto's father (Naruto) has overcame so much weaknesses that viewers should...know how did he do that. On the sideline, we also see how Naruto's best friends like Sasuke, Shikamaru and the Gokages teaming up in ways we've never seen before as the new united generation. The scenes where Naruto and Sasuke fighting Kinshiki are awesome, beat my expectation!Movie is about 90% close to the novel which is excellent. Some scenes like Sakura & Temari, Chunnin Exams, flashback on Naruto learning Rasengan with Jiraiya, Neji's death really brings fond of memories of Naruto stories.The movie could've been a little better with deeper interaction between Naruto, Hinata and Himawari, as well as Konohamaru and Kakashi. I hope this is not the last from either Naruto or Boruto. know how did he do that.

I love the original and even Shippuden with all it\'s flaws could still keep my interest to the end. That\'s the keyword, ""end."" Sadly, Boruto manages to rear his ugly head in like an outro at the end of movie credits that makes you say, ""wait there\'s more?""This...movie is so soulless and boring that it managed to surpass my already low-expectations going into it. It\'s the movie equivalent of 2 month old expired milk. It tasted really good once upon a time so you thought it\'d be okay to pull out again and pour onto your cereal only for you to get moldy, poorly aged chunks of garbage.Why are all the characters so dead? Everyone became indifferent pencil pushers that dislike being alive. 95% of the personality from the original cast just died and went into their kids. And even their kids are still all unlikable and try way too hard to be their dad/mom or to be as edgy as possible. The entire movie is just ""how long will everyone be lifeless husks that ignore Boruto until he\'s pissed and fucks something up."" I was hoping the villain would redeem the movie at least a little bit but no, he somehow made it worse with how nonsensical his motives and appearance was. I guess the art and sound is okay? But I don\'t think it can really excuse all of the garbage I had to sit through nor did it make the experience any better.At this point I\'m convinced Madara wanted to complete the Infinite Tsukuyomi to prevent Boruto from happening.

It is a great introduction to the new generation of ninja and also is a nice revisit to past characters. You have to go into Boruto itself knowing that it is not Naruto or Naruto Shippuden, it is its own entity, and it is best to be open minded. The movie takes place around the new generation of ninjas' chunin exams. I will not spoil any plot, but the film features both these new children but also the adults...from the past anime. If you are considering watching the Boruto anime, I think this can be a good gauge on if you will enjoy it. from the past anime. If you are considering watching the Boruto anime, I think this can be a good gauge on if you will enjoy it."", ""My Review from JapanatorBoruto: Naruto the Movie takes place several years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, in which Naruto has become the Seventh Hokage of Konoha and formed a family of his own. However, even though Naruto has already reached his goal, he still has his own struggles as Hokage and as a parent of two children.As shown in the manga’s epilogue, the Naruto Gaiden chapters, as well as the previous movie The Last: Naruto the Movie, we know that Naruto is now married to Hinata and had two children named Boruto and Himawari.Given the name of the movie, naturally, the story revolves around...Boruto and the new generation of Shinobi. With Naruto as Hokage, we see the struggles that Boruto has to face such as growing up without his father’s attention and becoming a great Shinobi.The movie already starts off with lots of action, featuring Sasuke fighting with both Momoshiki and Kinshiki in the ruins of Kaguya Otsutsuki's palace. From that battle scene alone, you can already tell how well the movie’s animation will be and it’s a great way to get the audience hook to the movie.Just like Kaguya, Momoshiki and Kinshiki Otsutsuki’s goal was to recollect all chakra and create it into a new chakra fruit, which would grant unlimited power, eternal youth, and immortality. However, they don’t have any affiliation with Kaguya as she created the White Zetsu Army in order to fend off against them should they ever attempt to steal her chakra.Throughout the movie, it is easily noticeable that Konoha has evolved technologically as the use of computers is pretty frequent. However, was stood out the most, and what basically was an important part of the movie, was the forearm device called Kote made by Katasuke.Kote allows the wielder to use any jutsu of their choice, without the use of chakra, as long as they had the scroll to use the sealed technique. Kote suggested that he wanted to introduce the device Chunin Exams but Naruto considered it cheating and denied his request.When Katasuke brought up the device to Boruto, he denied his request and he told him he wasn’t going to be entering the Chunin exams anyway. But after discussing about the Chunin exams with Sarada, and with her convincing him to enter be telling him that it was a way to show off to his father, he decides to enter.Even though Naruto has reached his long-term goal of becoming Hokage, the movie still shows that the character has so much to learn as he continues to prioritize work over family obligations, especially when he sends a shadow clone to his daughter's birthday dinner.  When Boruto finds out, he states that Naruto was luckier than him, reasoning that a dead father is better than one that neglects his children.Later that night, Boruto meets his father’s enteral frenemy and rival Sasuke Uchiha. Boruto being aware of that, he begs Sasuke if he can become his student and hopes he educate him about Naruto's weaknesses. Sasuke stated that he will take Boruto as his student under the condition that he can master the Rasengan, an attack that even Naruto struggled to perfect.Given the condition, Boruto goes to Konohamaru and asks him to teach him the Rasengan, which took Boruto a few long days to learn. When he finally approached Sasuke to tell him he learned the Rasengan, Sasuke notes that it’s far too small then smacks the Rasengan from Boruto’s hands as it slowly flies at a tree and disappears before it can make contact. Boruto storms off the scene with a sad look on his face and headed directly to Katasuke, the creator of Kote.With Katasuke’s initial plan to introduce Kote during the Chunin Exams, He wants Boruto to pass the Chunin Exams using Kote. Even with his father banning the use of Kote during the Chunin Exams, Boruto still decides to use it because he's tired of relying on his teammates and wants to achieve victory by himself.However, during the first round of the Chunin exams, he doesn’t use Kote, but was able to pass the round thanks to his teammates. Naruto later finds out and congratulates his son via e-mail. With Boruto excited after receiving recognition from his father, he decides to use Kote on round two, which he successfully passes and Naruto instead congratulates him in person, Naturally, this makes Boruto extremely happy.Unfortunately during the third round, Naruto catches him using Kote and later confronts his son in front of the entire village, confiscates his forehead protector and states he will never become a Shinobi. When Naruto scolds Boruto and tells him they will talk after the exams, Boruto angrily replies that they will never talk as Naruto is too busy being Hokage anyway.A few moments later, both Momoshiki and Kinshiki arrive to the scene with the goal of extracting the Kurama from Naruto. Unfortunately, Boruto made matters worse by using his Kote since the Otsutsuki absorb chakra-based jutsu. With Momoshiki gaining that power boost, Naruto was forced to sacrifice himself and was pulled into their dimension.After learning that his father is still alive and afraid of what could happen to his father, Boruto regrets all the resentful thought he was towards Naruto and accompanies Sasuke and the visiting Kage into the other dimension to save him, in order to make things right.During the fight in the other dimension, clearly the highlight of that moment was the teamwork between Naruto and Sasuke, especially with the beautiful done animation and the combination of both Perfect Susano’o and Kurama.After an intense battle, Naruto was weakened so Sasuke suggested that Boruto and his father combine their Rasengans. After creating the gigantic Rasengan, with the help of his shadow clone and Sasuke, he obliterates Momoshiki. However, the most important part of that scene to me was when we see Boruto and Naruto smiling at each other while combining their Rasengan.At the end of the movie, Boruto and Naruto reconcile their differences as Boruto respects his father and Naruto spends more time at home. The following morning after the battle, Boruto and Naruto fist-bumped and asked the other to do their best as they left for a mission and for work respectively.That final scene was special as it shows how much their relationship has built up as father and son, especially when they first-bumped. The movie concludes with Boruto, Sarada, Mitsuki, and Konohamaru going on a mission to capture a panda that is running loose in the village.Overall, this movie exceeded my expectations. The story isn’t exactly the best, especially because both the villains and their motivations were boring as they were the same as Kaguya’s. However, I did enjoy the character development shown for Boruto, and the relationship build-up with his father, Naruto, was really heartwarming.After seeing his father battle throughout the movie, and he understands how hard Naruto was worked to become Hokage, not only that but, after learning what Boruto has been through, he learns that Boruto still needs his father.Additionally, I really disliked how Momoshiki wasn’t really a threat and the battle was one sided on Boruto. Even Toneri in The Last put up a bigger fight against Naruto. However, the latter was more of a love-story if anything.In addition to the character development, I would also recommend this movie based on the animation and the fight scenes as well. The fights in the movie easily match those in the Dragon Ball series and watching it in theaters only made the experience even better.With the new generation of Shinobi, it would great to see more of them in action. Personally, I really want to see Sarada follow the path of Hokage while Boruto follows Sasuke’s path, and protects the Hokage, as stated at the end of the movie.I really appreciated how Kishimoto switched path with their children, how Sarada holds Naruto in a higher pedestal while Boruto holds Sasuke in a higher pedestal. Naturally, both still love their father very much.I would definitely recommend the movie to any Naruto fan. Even though I believe other material related to the franchise may come in the future, the movie was a nice way to wrap up the story of Naruto. Boruto and the new generation of Shinobi.

The antagonist of this movie,(did not...care to remember his name) wanted to absorb the chakra of the Bijuu to become the strongest being without training and that is the theme of this story.One have to work hard to achieve result without cheating.In this movie,it was shown that Konoha's head of technology department created a device that can make a simple commoner use advanced Ninjutsu without using any chakra.This device is quite dangerous when you think about it.With this,it might results into another war.Hence,i did not find the reasons why Naruto did not banned this project from beginning.He was shown to have knowledge of it so he ought to know.Anyway, Boruto learned the hard way why training is important.Art:7Compared to The Last,the animation is not up to par to it but still a good enough coming from Naruto.Sound:6Well it was okay i guess.Character:8Contrary to The Last,this movie showed a lot of the old casts which i am happy to see.Each one of them holds some role though a bit disheartened that Tsunade and Kakashi was not shown at all.Are they dead?Oh well, this movie featured Boruto from a cheating and spoiled child to a spitting image of Naruto i've known.In a way,he have grown to be as stupid as Naruto is.Although,being stupid has its merits. It was shown as well that Naruto is a busy man,not giving attention to his children which is bad.Although i get where he is coming from.He, who lived alone wouldn't know how to bring up a child.He unconsciously treated them the way he grew up as,which is alone.Maybe he finds it awkward.

A short review, on Boruto: Naruto the Movie.Since it is just a movie, I'll skip my usual review sections and just talk about it freely. But first of all, SPOILER ALERT (If you haven't read the Naruto manga til the end)!Naruto, finally grown up, finally the HOKAGE. His dream, and our dream I think finally came true but it is not that easy, even for the hero of the village. Even tough he is...Konoha's hero, he is also has to be the hero of little Himawari and Boruto, his children. In the middle of the story, the older son Boruto, who is not a great fan of his father being the Hokage. He is working all the time, and he doesn't have much time for his family. Boruto feeling frustrated wants nothing else but his father's attention. Good that the jounin exams are on the way where Boruto finally wants to show his father how strong he is.Reason I loved this movie? The feels come back. All the time spent with Naruto, crying, cheering, hoping...Everything is back, just with a lot new young faces being at the same level Naruto was in the beginning. It really puts a smile on my face seeing Sakura again, Sasuke, Hinata, Shikamaru, the whole crew. And what's more important, their children. I can't describe the feeling I had watching it again. And I have to admit, it even made me cry at one point.The story of the movie is emotional on one side, and action-loaded on the other. You get the best of Naruto in 1h and 35min, approximately.When the movie started (in Eng SUB), I was 100% sure that something wasn't right. Not the animation, it was great, and sure a bit different. (Ah, how the time passes). It were not the characters, they were also cool. And than it came to my mind. It was not in Japanese. Background info: The Japanese DUB version could only have been seen in Cinemas in Japan, but the Koreans made their own DUB and it somehow leaked into public. Soon English subtitles were made and now the whole internet is full of a Naruto movie with Korean DUB and English SUB. Still, it is watchable, can't deny that one. But it sure is strange as hell.So if you don't mind hearing a bit Korean instead of Japanese, go and enjoy the Eleventh Naruto Movie: Boruto! I am sure you will love it.

Bonus point for ninja tool device.The best part was the characters. I thought Boruto was a mini Naruto clone but I was wrong. He is insolent just like Naruto was, but he is also his own persona.He doesn't want to be Hokage, he is talented but he isn't a super hardworking guy. He is  a priviledged kid but...also a  sympathetic character.Naruto matured and kinda lost his dorkiness.The fact that he doesn't know how to be a father ùakes sense sinnce he didn't have a father or family for the matter to show him. Sasuke and Sakura were pretty good too. The villains were transparent but since the movie forcused on Naruto and his son I didn't mind.The action scenes felt too DBZ . I wish we would see Boruto and his teammate fight more in Chuunin Exam. also a  sympathetic character.Naruto matured and kinda lost his dorkiness.The fact that he doesn't know how to be a father ùakes sense sinnce he didn't have a father or family for the matter to show him. Sasuke and Sakura were pretty good too. The villains were transparent but since the movie forcused on Naruto and his son I didn't mind.The action scenes felt too DBZ . I wish we would see Boruto and his teammate fight more in Chuunin Exam."", 'Complete evolution?I believe the big challenge for anime writers after a successful run of their work is when to  stop. Questions like what are their target group, and when would these fans stop believing in their ideas should dominate their thoughts. And for the kingpins of anime series such as onepiece,  Detective Conan, Pokemon, Gintama etc, due to their loyal fan base, plot nature or no-plot nature they don\'t even consider it. Well Pokemon simply targets a younger age group and do not mature their theme as this group grows. Onepiece tries to mature its theme (time skip) but Luffy and the gang...still feel the same ever. But with Naruto, they\'ve been more successful(shippuuden) among the Kingpins... and trust me, I know loads of grown ups who still have a thing with naruto.  But unless you\'ve been living under a rock, naruto has ended (Manga) so the question is what is this movie about Boruto trying to archive...Character (old generation)Well I intentionally skipped my comments on the story because there was very little there (heck I\'ve even forgotten what the villain wanted). But the story was largely dependent on the characters in the movie. Of course  we get to see an all grown up Naruto whose development was spot on. Kudos to Kishimato for a real depiction. I don\'t get why people are crying that he was depicted as too cold. Yes he couldn\'t express his true feelings to his son and he was so immersed in work as Hokage that he didn\'t get enough time to spend with his family but c\'mon guys what did you expect. Naruto was always emotionally daft and he\'s been practically singing ""I going to be Hokage!"" Since forever. In fact if Kishimato depicted any other version of a man Naruto it wouldn\'t be true to the story.Sasuke was also all mysterious and super cool as he\'s always been. But I could sense more maturity in his relationship with people especially with his wife and daughter and surprisingly with Boruto. I really love the developments on Sasuke and how the whole Naruto-Sasuke friendship has blossomed. There were quite a number of fight scenes featuring their teamwork which were awesome and nostalgic.Well the other matured characters were got given enough screen time but they were quite consistent anytime they reappeared.Characters (new generation)Boruto: Ok I know what\'s on everyone\'s mind... Does he bring anything fresh to the table? Well I\'ll say let\'s wait and see but so far not bad. He does have some uniqueness but yet still resembles little Naruto and that\'s the beauty of it. But c\'mon Kishimato! You could do more with his techniques. I don\'t want to spoil too much tho.Sarada: She definitely feels more unique than Boruto and I definitely have high hopes for her.The rest of the next gen cast were very well introduced and would definitely leave you hungry for more.ArtI think the art was well done but not the best. The fight scenes were smooth but was lacking in detailsOverall /enjoymentI really enjoyed the movie, if you are a true fan of Naruto you should . This movie does an excellent job pulling down the curtain on the old Gen and throwing the spotlight on the new. The Naruto series is a perfect testament  on how a long standing series could evolve with its fanbase through the years, reward them with a complete ending for their loyalty and then finally offer them hope for their kids to also start a new journey on their own. A complete transitioning! still feel the same ever.

A complete transitioning!', ""Some major nostalgia momentsFight choreography was amazing (to be expected)Lots of recycled material but wasn't that bad; could have been way worse.Hate the way they designed naruto's personality, they exaggerated his features too much.Sasuke was pretty cool, but they made him very 2 dimensional and NOTHING like how he used to be.Story turned out better than i expected; the synopsis made me hate boruto's character before i even watched it. I'm glad he wasn't overly bratty and resentful.Very nice seeing all the old characters showcasing some moves here and there....Overall, WAY better than the last: naruto the movie. the last is a 3/10 Overall, WAY better than the last: naruto the movie. the last is a 3/10"", ""Finishing Naruto: The Last and Boruto: Naruto the Movie, it seems I was finally able to decide which conclusion is more fitting to end this amazing franchise...and that was Boruto - the film of course. Nobody talks about the other one. Now don't get me wrong here; it's not that I found The Last disappointing, but rather, I feel like Boruto was able to deliver a stronger impact than what The Last presented.Starting off, both films unveiled a breathtaking introduction that caught my attention, especially with the hand-to-hand combat and exciting choreography, and simply witnessing the first few minutes of the film, I know I'm...up to something entertaining. Though, to be honest, Boruto had a better hook than the Last, having a much longer fight scene and mindblowing taijutsu right from the start.Voice acting, visuals, animation, and music - I'm basically wasting my time if I were to explain how well both of these films did in handling those aspects, and thus I leave this area blank. Seriously, both these two, considering there are films aired in the same year with better visuals and music, still managed to leave a good taste in my mouth.Now let's get to the main point.Having finally reached his dream, the struggle continues as even the 7th Hokage, is too busy to mind his own son, and thus leaves us in the eyes of Boruto. At first, I simply thought Naruto was out of his character in this film since, knowing our guy, he's the one that always allots time for his friends, based from the series. But things are different in the past than in the present. Naruto grew up without the care of his parents, so why must he, should already know what being a parent feels like? In his current situation now, it's no matter that his son will grow up to be a spoiled brat that expects a lot from his father. I find it amusing at the very least that Kishimoto, or whatever team it is, managed to insert a character that is irritating to the eyes.But it's this irritation that made me look forward to seeing the development of Boruto since we the fans understand that Naruto isn't the shit of a father he is; it's just that Boruto doesn't know any of the things his father went through to put himself in his current situation, and the film exactly does that. Compared to The Last, sure I looked forward to seeing more intimate moments between Naruto and Hinata, but I felt like what I've witnessed was deficient as to what I've anticipated. Maybe it lacked impact, maybe it isn't cheesy enough, or maybe I was just tired when I watched the film.Boruto, however, especially upon reaching the climax and seeing him suffer just like I've wanted, brought me to my senses when the time has finally come to realize how self-centered of a shit he was, and thus peaking my attraction towards the film. Anyways, to make it short, Boruto had moments perfect for a turning point of his life compared to how events took place to develop Naruto and Hinata's relationship with each other.The villain follows what the last part of the series tried to hint at: remnants of Otsutsuki that Kaguya tried to shield Earth from. Not interesting or any sort, treat them simply as conquerors that thirst for power. The reason behind their actions is superficial, compared to the antagonists that appeared in the Naruto series.Ending this highly opinionated review of mine, I genuinely feel that I'm contented to see the end of Naruto's phenomenal run between the years 2007 - 2015. There are still loose ends that are yet to be tackled,  but knowing that the characters have grown into something that surpassed our/my expectations, I highly doubt a problem would give them trouble in any case.I've grown up alongside Naruto, and to see his generation end, leaves me afraid to see what's in the future. But one of the many things that Naruto has taught me, is to keep doing what's good for the present, so we can move on knowing the times we've had...were simply the best.(Still, I didn't expect that the Boruto series would end up as an abomination that does nothing but wastes our time) up to something entertaining.

As a very long time fan of Naruto (I started watching as a freshman in high school, and am in my late 20's now) this was extremely nostalgic for me and I'm hoping the Boruto anime has the success of it's predecessors. The story felt a bit recycled, however that was most likely the intent. The over all theme of this was to show that this is an extension of the original Naruto series, and that it isn't over. The reviews of this are mixed to say the least, however I...personally enjoyed it quite a bit.Story: I won't go into too much detail so as not to spoil the plot, however it does give insight into how the characters of Naruto deal with the challenges of parenting in a world filled with violence and strife. There is a lot of what we come to expect from this long running and beloved series, but with the added depth of knowing the adults of the series while seeing how the next generation handles the sorts of challenges their parents faced.Art: The art was pretty consistent with what I've come to expect from the Naruto franchise, if you aren't familiar with that art style already then I strongly emphasize that you should watch Naruto and Naruto Shipuden before picking this up.Sound: The sound was similar to what the later part of Naruto Shipuden had,   the score had a lot of the same familiar tracks that the rest of the two series have shared.Character: The characters share a lot of traits with their parents, however they aren't simply copies. as Naruto states, Boruto is more like Sasuke than Naruto, but not quite the same as him either. Boruto is definitely his own character, and it will be interesting to see what kind of ninja he becomes. In my opinion Sasuke's and Sakura's daughter is much more interesting that Boruto, and the two of them are on a team with the child of Orochimaru.Enjoyment: If you are a long time fan like I am then this will be a nostalgic experience, if not I'm not quite sure why you're reading this. As I stated before, you should watch the rest of the franchise (maybe skip the filler) before watching this, if not you probably won't enjoy it.Overall: I rated this a 9 because although it was intended, this was a somewhat recycled plot, so I couldn't justify giving it a 10. I did enjoy it quite a bit though, and if you're a fan of the Naruto franchise I definitely recommend it. I don't write hardly any reviews, but this felt like it deserved one. It's only one movie, if you're a fan you'll most likely enjoy it, and if not it's not going to waste much time. This movie really helps to bring the series full circle, so if nothing else it brings closure to a very long series that has touched the hearts of countless anime fans across the world. personally enjoyed it quite a bit.Story: I won't go into too much detail so as not to spoil the plot, however it does give insight into how the characters of Naruto deal with the challenges of parenting in a world filled with violence and strife.

It\'s a starting point, for someone like me, who didn\'t follow naruto from the start due to the fact that I will need to consume a very long hour  to watch it and the fillers are real pain in the ass but after...I saw this movie I started to think"" what happened to naruto?"" and unexpectedly, I got hooked to naruto series. I saw this movie I started to think"" what happened to naruto?"" and unexpectedly, I got hooked to naruto series.', 'Just when we all thought that Naruto would finish. Lately, Naruto has been showing signs that it will soon finish. Shippuden is currently in its final arcs and the manga has recently ended at 700 chapters, and considering this franchise has been around since 1999, it’s about time. It is true that Naruto’s story will end, and soon, but when one epic saga is ending, a new one arises. Thus, we have Boruto, the tale of Naruto’s son. While some people view this as a mistake, I view it as a new opportunity. An opportunity to show a whole new story in the same world...that we know and love, but with a new perspective. A perspective, that, while similar, is different enough that we get a fresh take on the series. A new spin in the world of ninjas that we have grown to love since its inception 20 years ago, and that it’s still going strong today.Story:Boruto takes place around when Naruto became the Hokage which means that a huge amount of time has passed from when the original series began, to where Boruto began. Because of this the technology in the ninja world has greatly advanced and the inhabitants now have TV’s, computers and video games which was a nice addition to the world. Everything looks more modern to coincide with how the real world is changing which I found to be a nice touch that made the world feel even more alive that it has before. Even if the whole movie takes place in the Hidden Leaf Village (which is starting to look like the Hidden Leaf City).Like the original series, Boruto: Naruto the Movie tells the story of a boy that feels alone in the world he lives in. While it may seem like a rehash of the original, it’s very different considering that unlike Naruto, Boruto has a family to live with. While he does have his mother, Hinata, and his younger sister, Himawari to keep him company he is mainly upset that Naruto doesn’t spend enough time with him. This is where most of the problems come from in the story. Because of this, throughout the movie Boruto becomes distant from everyone in the village and acts angry at everyone around him, much like his father at the beginning of the original. People may see this as a problem, but I didn’t mind it. It gives a new perspective on the kind of story that was told in the original and is basically what things would be like if Minato was still alive when Naruto was growing up. Especially to someone who was wondering what Naruto’s life would be like if that happened, it was nice to see this movie tackle that kind of plot. The main problems I have with the story are with who the hell the villain is (I think he’s related to Kaguya but since I haven’t seen a lot of Shippuden I don’t know who she is and what importance she has in the plot. That problem is basically on my end) and a somewhat major plot point that goes nowhere. Without spoiling anything, there’s this device introduced that Boruto uses during the Chunin Exams that gets him in trouble and humiliated in front of everyone. This was all fine except that the whole plot around these things go nowhere and after the final battle, everybody moves on like nothing happened and nobody’s mad at Boruto anymore. It may be because he helped saved the day in the end, but the whole plot surrounding the devices is just forgotten by the end. It’s not like that’s really a bad thing considering they didn’t serve a whole lot of purpose anyway. It still would have been nice if they put some conformation as to what happened with it. In terms of story, Boruto does a pretty good job.Characters:Much like how Boruto borrowed quite a bit in the story department from its predecessor, it borrows even more with its characters. But in the end, it’s not really a bad thing. Of course, the characters that you know and love from the original series are back and all grown up and a lot of their kids appear as main characters in this new installment. To start with, let’s talk about Boruto. He’s a lot like his father, hot-headed, angry and stubborn. But unlike his father, Boruto lives a more normal life than Naruto did when he was Boruto’s age. Boruto has a lot more to protect since he has a mother, sister, friends and teachers that all like him. What I like the most is that because his father is busy with being the Hokage, Boruto doesn’t want to be the Hokage, and instead wants to focus on being a strong Shinobi. The Hokage goal is left to his friend and fellow squad member: Sarada Uchiha, the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura. From the decent amount of screen time that she gets, Sarada seems to be a nice mix of Sasuke and Sakura’s personalities, mostly borrowing from Sakura’s side since she seems to have borrowed her mother’s tough personality and signature ‘CHA!!’. Apart from Sarada the only other new characters that we see are Mitsuki, who is Boruto and Sarada’s third team member. Unfortunately, we don’t see a lot of Mitsuki in this movie but he seems like a cool ninja. It’s especially cool when you find out who his parents are at the end of the movie which is hopefully set up for what’s to come in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. We also see other new ninja like Shikidai Nara (Shikamaru and Temari’s son), Chouchou Akimichi (I think she’s Chouji’s daughter but it doesn’t reveal anything), Inojin Yamanaka (Ino and Sai’s son I think) and some returning characters like Rock Lee, Tenten, Kakashi, Darui, Killer Bee and a grown-up Konohamaru who is Boruto, Sarada and Mitsuki’s sensei.The worst part of the characters is the extremely bland villains. The two villains Momoshiki and Kinshiki Ootsutsuki are bland, boring and seem to only be there to have a plot to this movie. They’re both descendants of the Ootsutsuki clan and they do some bad-ass things but it is never explained why they are doing what they do and why they want unlimited power. It’s unfortunate since they could have made the movie slightly longer and gone into their motives without the movie feeling like a slog. It’s 90 minutes anyway so it’s not like it would have made much of a difference anyway. I only say this because Naruto was always good at giving backstories to minor villains in the series. Characters in the original like Haku, Zabuza, Zaku and Kimimaro could have been left to just be generic villains but where fleshed out during their fights and it made you sad when they all died. Even one of the earlier filler arcs in the original fleshed out it’s villain more, and that says a lot since the Land of Tea Race Arc isn’t that great. This problem could have easily been avoided, which is unfortunate since this is a good movie. Hopefully they’ll fix it if they bring them back in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.Sound:What can I say, Yasuharu Takanashi returns to compose the music for this movie since he did the music for Shippuden and as usual he did a good job. They’re not the most memorable but they get the job done. I watched this movie in Dub and as usual, they did a fantastic job with this movie. All the same voice actors return to voice the characters they did in the original and the new actors brought in to voice the new characters do a fantastic job. Amanda Celine Miller does an amazing job as Boruto, especially considering she hasn’t done a whole lot in the past. It’s always nice to see newer actors getting big roles and getting recognized in the community. Cherami Leigh does a great job as Sarada, which isn’t surprising since she’s one of my favorite voice actors. The only other notable performance is Robbie Daymond as Mitsuki, who I’m looking forward to seeing more of, if not only for Robbie’s great performance. The Ending Song, Diver by KANA-BOON fits perfectly as the credits theme and almost made me tear up when the movie ended. Further proof that KANA-BOON is one of the better bands doing anime songs for new shows. In the Sound department, Boruto does an excellent job.Animation:Never has the world of Naruto looked this amazing. All the colors pop, the world looks vibrant and lively and the fight animation is breathtaking. Even though the only big fight scene is at the end, it is well worth the wait if you only care about watching awesome fight scenes. The whole scene is filled with insane amounts of sakuga and every attack has a nice impact to it that makes you feel every hit that the characters take. The animation is spectacular and is probably the best Naruto has looked. I say probably since I’ve only seen the first movie and the first couple of episodes in Shippuden. In the Animation department, Boruto does an amazing job.Final Thoughts:If you are a fan of Naruto and you haven’t seen this movie, you owe it to yourself and to this series to immediately watch it, even if you haven’t seen the whole series. Boruto is a must watch for all Naruto fans, but for anyone that isn’t you should at least try the series out and start the original series. Naruto proves time and time again that it never fails to entertain and tell a compelling narrative, and Boruto: Naruto the Movie is no exception.Score: 8Rating: Great that we know and love, but with a new perspective.

They’re both descendants of the Ootsutsuki clan and they do some bad-ass things but it is never explained why they are doing what they do and why they want unlimited power. It’s unfortunate since they could have made the movie slightly longer and gone into their motives without the movie feeling like a slog. It’s 90 minutes anyway so it’s not like it would have made much of a difference anyway. I only say this because Naruto was always good at giving backstories to minor villains in the series. Characters in the original like Haku, Zabuza, Zaku and Kimimaro could have been left to just be generic villains but where fleshed out during their fights and it made you sad when they all died. Even one of the earlier filler arcs in the original fleshed out it’s villain more, and that says a lot since the Land of Tea Race Arc isn’t that great. This problem could have easily been avoided, which is unfortunate since this is a good movie. Hopefully they’ll fix it if they bring them back in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations.Sound:What can I say, Yasuharu Takanashi returns to compose the music for this movie since he did the music for Shippuden and as usual he did a good job. They’re not the most memorable but they get the job done. I watched this movie in Dub and as usual, they did a fantastic job with this movie. All the same voice actors return to voice the characters they did in the original and the new actors brought in to voice the new characters do a fantastic job. Amanda Celine Miller does an amazing job as Boruto, especially considering she hasn’t done a whole lot in the past. It’s always nice to see newer actors getting big roles and getting recognized in the community. Cherami Leigh does a great job as Sarada, which isn’t surprising since she’s one of my favorite voice actors. The only other notable performance is Robbie Daymond as Mitsuki, who I’m looking forward to seeing more of, if not only for Robbie’s great performance. The Ending Song, Diver by KANA-BOON fits perfectly as the credits theme and almost made me tear up when the movie ended. Further proof that KANA-BOON is one of the better bands doing anime songs for new shows. In the Sound department, Boruto does an excellent job.Animation:Never has the world of Naruto looked this amazing. All the colors pop, the world looks vibrant and lively and the fight animation is breathtaking. Even though the only big fight scene is at the end, it is well worth the wait if you only care about watching awesome fight scenes. The whole scene is filled with insane amounts of sakuga and every attack has a nice impact to it that makes you feel every hit that the characters take. The animation is spectacular and is probably the best Naruto has looked. I say probably since I’ve only seen the first movie and the first couple of episodes in Shippuden. In the Animation department, Boruto does an amazing job.Final Thoughts:If you are a fan of Naruto and you haven’t seen this movie, you owe it to yourself and to this series to immediately watch it, even if you haven’t seen the whole series. Boruto is a must watch for all Naruto fans, but for anyone that isn’t you should at least try the series out and start the original series. Naruto proves time and time again that it never fails to entertain and tell a compelling narrative, and Boruto: Naruto the Movie is no exception.Score: 8Rating: Great', ""My opinion is fairly objective though probably too invested. From the stand point of someone who has looked into the Naruto series with a pretty fine tooth comb the movie is the cherry on the sundae of disappointment. Whatever character development/sense of plausible story/enjoyable characters/dignity etc that the show possessed is pretty much gone by the time the movie begins. Unfortunately, the series has turned into a really big cop out that caters to fan wishes. For some people that turned out wonderfully. I had the chance to see it at NYCC with a ton of fans and it was fun because there were so...many nostalgic grabs and inside jokes which made it fun at times. But in the end it leaves you wanting for a story. Boruto himself and most of the new gen kids are boring if not bratty. OG generation characters are kind of just diminished to their tropes. So.. yeah. If you can resist getting sucked into the new generation franchise I'd advise that unless you're gonna take everything at face value and turn a blind eye to some blatantly bad writing. many nostalgic grabs and inside jokes which made it fun at times.

It takes a glimpse of the effects of new technology on the ninja way and the various circumstances that can bind or break the connection between inter-generations of people. But the movie doesn't fully explore the technological theme on a societal level nor does it feel like Boruto earned his happy ending; this buildup is discarded for a thematically related antagonist that comes off as simplifying an once interesting idea.  Why go through the trouble of this set up when you're just going to hand-wave it away with...a final boss.This is Borotu's movie. If you were expecting the spotlight to be shared with Sarada or Mitsuki you will be disappointed, but this singular focus sets up an inter-generational question: How does the next generation deals with the legacy of the previous generation? As his early movie exploits prove, Boruto is a gifted ninja; this point is reinforced by many considering him to be most likely to be the eighth hokage. But Boruto resents the position of hokage due to the neglect that he and his family experience, and by extension that feeling of resentment bleeds into his integration of  the ninja way. In the best case scenario, his prodigy status contributes to his arrogance and thinks that he can overcome all challenges alone with a minimum amount of brute force. He ignores his teammates desires because he has the skills to finish tasks alone; which gets the job done but doesn't reinforce the cooperative aspects of the ninja way. In the worst case scenario, he is lethargic/apathetic showing disinterest in training and is willing to hinder his teammates progression. He's stagnate with his potential because of personal hang-ups with the hokage and the the ninja way in general. Sarada, on the other hand, shows a much healthier integration of the ninja way. Gifted just like Boruto, but the key difference is she has an admiration for previous generation and wants to live up to the standards they've set. Cue the: 'I going to be the next hokage' even if I'm not acknowledged like Boruto.I can go on about the characters and what they thematically relate to, but  I'd like to bring up two more characters that relate to the technology theme: Katasuke and Momoshiki . Katasuke, a member of the science ninja weapons team, one man petitions the hokage to allow use of scientific tools in the upcoming chuunin exams as a means of displaying value for potential customers visiting Konohagakure. Like any other intelligent leader, he flatly refuses because the exams are a coming of age tradition for ninja and to use a technology that allow high level skill use without serious training will lead many to develop attitudes similar to Boruto earlier in the movie -'I can brute force my way through obstacles  without considering the other qualities that ninja need' - . Sly-fully, he disengages from the hokage and manipulates Boruto's yearning for attention as a way to get promotion for his tools. Understand that Katasuke represents scientific/technological progress without the foresight of how progress will disrupt contemporary traditions, people, and societies , for better and worse. While Momoshiki represents the worse outcome of that technological progress. He has no need to practice since he can just take from others, mirroring Boruto's use of the ninja tool in the exams and his video gaming habits. Why work hard when you can just use a cheat code?These are two of the movie's best qualities, even though all other characters in the movie are secondary and static (no character development) they provide the foils, support, and contrast necessary for Boruto's introspection and growth. And with simple observation all characters with screen time are relate to the themes. Its a two for one deal that works. The underside of those strengths are that due to the inclusion of Momoshiki, Boruto's failure isn't fully realized and his redemption just comes off as given not earned. Movies can't go that in-depth, it can't be helped but it could covered more if given the time.Now I'm not an expert on sound or art design but I do have criticisms. Boruto's character design (and others of the new generation), why is it so similar to the older generation? I don't understand why a character struggling to break out of the the previous generation's shadow is designed just like him. He hits the same visual cues as young Naruto (Blond hair, headband placement, blue eyes, etc). The music does fit the moods explored in the film but none of it comes off as something made for Boruto first outing; no electronic-esque instrumentation to use in tandem with the story theme. Guess that's why the subtitle for the movie is 'Naruto the Movie'; even though its Boruto's story its still stuck in the shadow of Naruto.Overall, Boruto: Naruto the Movie is bland outside of the semi-strong thematic undercurrents. I personally enjoyed it but I don't really see myself watching it again or recommending it to a friend. If you're looking for the origin story of a legend in the making this isn't the movie for you. If you're looking for something with more thematic depth this isn't the movie for you. Honestly, even if your a fan of Naruto this movie isn't really worth it outside of seeing the characters you love in supporting roles. a final boss.This is Borotu's movie.

We finally get to see post-war Sasuke in action and alongside Naruto once more, as well as some cool new ninjutsu and gadgets. I think the shining part of the movie was its comedy, i was laughing the entire time and overall enjoyed it regardless of the somewhat weak plot, but then again its Kishimoto so i\'ll give him a clap for this one. I do think the ending however, was a bit rushed--they could\'ve made it a bit longer but the overall pacing from the start of the movie to the end was a LOT better than The Last: Naruto the movie.It wasn\'t the best naruto movie, but not the worst either.If you\'re a hardcore fan and love comedy and don\'t mind a plot that is just ok, i\'d definitely recommend watching this one! Skip the previous installment though, that one was god awful. and really cool.The animation style was great!

But he pulled himself up with his own strength and became Hokage"" - (Sauske Uchiha).The last chapter of the Naruto manga (chapter 700) felt like it was setting something up by introducing bunch of new characters as the new generation of konoha shinobi, including the main character of this movie and the son of naruto known as boruto. This movie revolves around boruto and his relationship with his father.Story:Naruto is now the seventh Hokage and a living legend in the eyes of the world, while his son boruto struggles to...adapt to this situation in which his father is busy and can no longer spend time with his family, so he turns to his father\'s old rival and Sasuke Uchiha to be his teacher so he can one day beat Naruto. .The idea of Boruto going for sasuke for help is a very interesting idea, it works amazingly in this movie and it\'s a main plot point in the story.The fact that Naruto is finally the hokage the title that he wanted his whole life yet he looks tired and somewhat exhausted all the time of this office job. This whole ideal has a sense of realism that we see in the real world which I enjoyed very much in the movie.Art:The art is amazing which is very noticeable especially in the action scenes and it\'s definitely one of the pros of the movie.Sound:Sound was very good, same voice actors and the new voice actors are good and overall the sound worked very nicely.Character:The movie is mostly about Boruto and his relationship with Naruto and then Sasuke as his teacher. But also most of the character from the original series are present and this movie does a good job of giving most characters a time to shine.Sasuke is the best character in this movie, he is almost a completely different character from the original series and all the consequences and the developments of Shipuden is present in the movie.The villains are definitely not interesting or special in anyway but they serve as plot point that drives the story and their abilities are very cool at least visually which makes the fights between them and naruto and sasuke really good.Enjoyment:This movie is very enjoyable for a Naruto fan and it’s so much better than some of the other naruto movie which mostly feels like filler. This movie feels like the original anime/manga something Kishimoto would write, except it\'s done with amazing animation. So most Naruto fans will like and enjoy this movie but I can\'t promise the same for people who are not fans of the  naruto anime/manga.Overall:+Naruto\'s life as hokage.+Adult Sasuke!+Boruto dynamic with Naruto and Sasuke.+Amazing Animation- Flat villains adapt to this situation in which his father is busy and can no longer spend time with his family, so he turns to his father\'s old rival and Sasuke Uchiha to be his teacher so he can one day beat Naruto. .The idea of Boruto going for sasuke for help is a very interesting idea, it works amazingly in this movie and it\'s a main plot point in the story.The fact that Naruto is finally the hokage the title that he wanted his whole life yet he looks tired and somewhat exhausted all the time of this office job.

I think we can all agree Boruto the show gets boring around ep 40? And up, the movie itself is outstanding. Seeing it at first glance, you would thing its just like the show boring Shonen Jump. But in this case it has a lot of action!The fight in this movie is really enjoyable! Totally recommend watching this movie. The sound very good,  story great, art it's okay, sound very good, characters they're decent.. enjoyment 10/10! overall its just a good movie. An amazing Shonen Jump movie, I watched it a lot of times it never...gets old! It's without a doubt in my top ten movies overall enjoyable 9/10 totally recommend! gets old! It's without a doubt in my top ten movies overall enjoyable 9/10 totally recommend!"", 'I put the score 8 just for the final fight, the story was ok not great, i really dont like boruto, he is just destroying all the naruto universe, in the anime this part is probably the most interesting, boring sometime, but after this part is just trash and boring af for me.i really hope that boruto grows up and if its not AT LEAST be powerful and cool just like in the anime first episode at the begging.Naruto is stilll cool for me, the battle betwwen...sasuke and naruto vs momosiki in my opinion t make the hole movie, i cant rewatch the hole film because it will be boring but that fight i will watch it 100 times because is just fire. sasuke and naruto vs momosiki in my opinion t make the hole movie, i cant rewatch the hole film because it will be boring but that fight i will watch it 100 times because is just fire.', ""(Note this is from someone who watch the TV show version before the movie) The movie isn't bad but it's not good either also some of the characters on the cover don't even 2 lines in the movie the pace is way to fast we don't have any time to really feel for the characters and some of the major events in the movie. I think story was not the issue but the way it was executed was awful. In some parts of the movie you are just left asking who what where and why.Besides characters we already know cause we have watch them grow...up from years of connecting, feeling and crying with we don't really get a chance to connect with any of their kids well we get a chance with boruto but as I said executed was bad.The way Boruto feels is what Naruto would have felt if Minato had not died and lived with Naruto but the pace kills that feeling we are trying to build up.The TV show version was a 1,000 times better before you say well they have more time to work with well that is a good point still I feel that they could have done a much better job than what they gave us with the movie. up from years of connecting, feeling and crying with we don't really get a chance to connect with any of their kids well we get a chance with boruto but as I said executed was bad.The way Boruto feels is what Naruto would have felt if Minato had not died and lived with Naruto but the pace kills that feeling we are trying to build up.The TV show version was a 1,000 times better before you say well they have more time to work with well that is a good point still I feel that they could have done a much better job than what they gave us with the movie."", ""Okay. So... After watching some of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, the anime, I decided to watch the movie. Uh... the only part I really enjoyed was watching the characters from Naruto older, more experienced, and all that. Honestly, I kind of dislike the children. Many of them (such as Boruto and Sarada) are mad at their parents for not being there, but they don't know what the parents went through.Watching their Chuunin exams too... they don't have a possibility of death, etc. Boruto makes some VERY bad decisions, which makes me dislike him more.I especially enjoyed the battle scenes, though. It's a little different...than in the alternate anime version, but still great. As usual, I like watching Naruto and Sasuke work together to defeat a common enemy, because why not.So, basically, I rated it an 8 because yay old characters, not yay to the new characters.(and as usual I am surprisingly bad at writing reviews, so I may have to update this a lot) than in the alternate anime version, but still great.

I like the story quite a lot. I won't spoil any of it here though, I guess i just have to talk about why i liked it so much.You follow these characters around and watch them interract with each other, which makes them feel super real. I just can't get enough of social interaction because it is frankly something us anime reviewers don't get enough of so we instead watch fictional characters having more fun than us.The story feels real. It is something that can happen in real life too, but never will. Again, I won't spoil too much because...I feel like it will ruin the story. Frankly, just get some weeb friends and watch this together, you will have a blast!Art is great. Everything looks great, the lightning effect are not overused they are only used in the perfect moments. The animation is fluid and it feels very cinematic. It is quite rare that animes are animated this good! I was disapointed in Attack on Titans animation and artstyle (very ugly, shaders everywhere and no good looking girls). But Tsurezure Children uses their resourses they have and use it to the 100% potential. Very few animes use this. It is not 100% perfect, it seems lacking at times but it is still very good.Sound is good! The soundtrack is just amazing and the voice acting is really good too. Nakazama-chan is my favorite voice actor on the market. just listen to the soundtracks on youtube or dailymotioncharacters are very well made and is probably the reason u watch this show. Very much like the story, i wont spoil the good parts. some characters seem a little lacking, but they make up for it later in the show.Enjoyment.

This is no surprise as Masashi Kishimoto himself. The plot was strong and quite clear from the start, and worked well to develop at a steady pace and finish strong with a nice resolution. What you\'d expect from a good plot, right?Not entirely. I couldn\'t give the story a higher score than 7 because I realised...that a lot of the premises in the movie was based on the original series. This creates a problem for those who didn\'t follow the Naruto series, albeit the problem being not entirely major. I guess a Non-Naruto fan could still enjoy the movie, but it\'d be impossible for them to enjoy it 100% and they would have to consistently bombard others with questions like: ""What\'s that circular pattern eye? What\'s so special about it that everyone is shocked? Why is there a huge tree stump?""However, assuming you have sufficient knowledge of the shinobi world (by sufficient, i mean more than just being able to identify which one is Naruto) you will surely enjoy the story, as there is just so much nostalgia.Boruto behaves like Konohamaru when he was younger. Naruto becomes the ""Itachi always busy"" kind of guy. This kind of nostalgia.ART - 9/10Anyone who follows the Naruto series knows that animation quality and consistency is not one of it\'s strong points. (Just watch Naruto VS Pain and you\'ll understand) However, the producers really did it this time. A movie is definitely easier to animate than a 500+ episode series. Given this fact, the backgrounds, characters, powers, battles, special effects, were really good to the point that it would impress anyone.The animation panels were fluid and consistent, and the animation style remained the same through out the story. The colours were vibrant enough to bring out the emotions of each scene, making anyone feel the nostalgia.SOUND - 9/10The sound is great too. The OST were very good, (as expected given that the Naruto series had some of the best OST ever) and brought out all the emotions in every scene without necessarily overpowering the scene. The background music resonated with the emotions of the viewers, drawing them closer to loving the movie.The Voice acting was impeccable too. There was no hint of inconsistency in the execution of the voice acting. Each voice fitted the role they were acting perfectly, making anyone, even non-Naruto fans, be able to tell apart who\'s voice belongs to who.CHARACTER - 7/10The characters were great, well developed, and not forced into the plot. It felt natural having everyone be where they were. The exchange between the main protagonists and villains were also great to the extent that it felt natural enough for anyone to develop empathy for the hero and develop anger against the villains.I must say, the one thing I didn\'t particularly like and had a problem is Naruto and Sasuke. They were too overpowered. (Well, it can\'t be helped really) I don\'t have a problem with their strengths, but the fact that they were so strong, it seemed illogical and unrealistic that Naruto could be in a pinch in any point in the movie.That\'s why I could only give up to 7.ENJOYMENT - 8/10Overall, the action, adventure, suspense and emotions blended together perfectly into a movie that was very enjoyable. Anyone could watch the movie and say, ""that was awesome!"". In fact, some Naruto-otakus out there might end up watching this movie too many times in the future.Well, to sum up everything, this movie has every ingredient of a good movie, and anyone watching it wouldn\'t realise 2 hours of their time passing by. that a lot of the premises in the movie was based on the original series. This creates a problem for those who didn\'t follow the Naruto series, albeit the problem being not entirely major.

There was no hint of inconsistency in the execution of the voice acting. Each voice fitted the role they were acting perfectly, making anyone, even non-Naruto fans, be able to tell apart who\'s voice belongs to who.CHARACTER - 7/10The characters were great, well developed, and not forced into the plot. It felt natural having everyone be where they were. The exchange between the main protagonists and villains were also great to the extent that it felt natural enough for anyone to develop empathy for the hero and develop anger against the villains.I must say, the one thing I didn\'t particularly like and had a problem is Naruto and Sasuke. They were too overpowered. (Well, it can\'t be helped really) I don\'t have a problem with their strengths, but the fact that they were so strong, it seemed illogical and unrealistic that Naruto could be in a pinch in any point in the movie.That\'s why I could only give up to 7.ENJOYMENT - 8/10Overall, the action, adventure, suspense and emotions blended together perfectly into a movie that was very enjoyable. Anyone could watch the movie and say, ""that was awesome!"". In fact, some Naruto-otakus out there might end up watching this movie too many times in the future.Well, to sum up everything, this movie has every ingredient of a good movie, and anyone watching it wouldn\'t realise 2 hours of their time passing by.', ""I've never watched any of the Naruto movies, hell, I don't watch any anime movies PERIOD. I often feel like they're rushed and over packed with information, but I found myself enjoying Boruto a lot.I particularly enjoyed the story line. Although it's overdone in the Naruto franchise and sends the same message many other Naruto movies do, I think that's what made me like it so much. It was nostalgic to me and made me want to re-watch the older Naruto episodes. It also made me genuinely curious as to what Boruto will do once he is older. His dream differs from Naruto, and that...means that there are countless ways the story can be directed. Hopefully they don't botch it and give us a shitty story for the TV show.As for the art, that's something that will have to take some time for me. Even the Boruto tv show art has me feeling like I'm watching a poorly drawn anime. It's still better than some animes out there, but it could be so much better.I think the biggest thing I like about this was the character development for Boruto. You really got to see him grow as a character in the short (yes short) two hours that the producers had. At first, Boruto couldn't understand his dad and often despised him for being busy, but at the end of the day Boruto realized that his dad is the way he is because of what he has experienced. It's not only that his dad has to ensure the safety of others, but that others look up to his dad as someone who will protect them in times of need.I think a lot of people are upset because they don't recognize the Naruto now, but I think it's safe to say that Naruto is still who he is deep down. However, he is more limited in what he can say and do because the responsibilities of a Hokage are no joke.Overall, Boruto pleasantly surprised me and it really made me interested in watching the TV series. means that there are countless ways the story can be directed.

We have an excuse for the climax to be exclusively hand-to-hand combat with a demon and it\'s gonna kick ass.""Yo, this was such a breath of fresh air. Not just a real, actual movie this time, but one with a story it deliberately wanted to tell. Now, I predictably hate the message of this film. Plagiarism is a beautiful thing and the idea that Boruto shouldn\'t take advantage of anything at his disposal to win just because it\'s ""cheating"" is bullshit. After all, what the fuck did...Naruto do in literally Episode 1? He stole a forbidden scroll and copied a technique that literally everyone in the world would suddenly be able to do one day. Copying is based. The villains in this should have won just because they were plagiarists, IMO.But, beyond hating the message, the execution is so good. There\'s a lot of breathing room given to the scenes that need it. Not everything is spelled out in long speeches about friendship. There\'s no escort mission. Lots of side characters get moments to shine, albeit still not quite enough. Naruto isn\'t the main character, even if Boruto is very similar. There\'s so much to love about this one when you put it in the perspective of the other movies.I didn\'t necessarily like this arc for Naruto, though. If being Hokage was this exhausting at all times, we would have seen it with Tsunade. Unless Tsunade was just so much better at doing the job than Naruto, which raises the question of why she even stepped down.For Boruto\'s part, he\'s a little shit, but I like the cut of his jib. He\'s absolutely a privileged fucker and the show doesn\'t seem to realize that teasing him as a potential Hokage is turning that position into the hereditary thing he says it isn\'t. And I know that he says he doesn\'t want to be Hokage, but that\'s a path he could still go down, and I would have preferred a more adamant denial of him wanting to do it. Boruto should never be Hokage. More than anything else ever has or could, that would destroy the series.I also like how Sasuke is here in a big way and it\'s NOT just him being shoehorned in. He\'s a real character again, and I think I like him as a teacher more than I ever did as a main character.So, yeah. This is the most exciting Naruto story in years. Might fuck around and watch some of the Boruto series one day. Who woulda thought? Naruto do in literally Episode 1?

Who woulda thought?', 'This movie is really hitting home with me, as I\'ve grown up watching the anime series from its start and now have children of my own and have entered the world of parenting, like our hero from the series. This movie is focused on Naruto\'s son, Boruto (Bolt), and his struggles as a shinobi and the son of the seventh hokage.If you\'re looking for a great, new and original story, I\'m afraid this is going to be a disappointment. There\'s nothing new or original about this movie\'s story. In fact, it\'s not much different from Naruto\'s own story. Regardless, I give it a 10 in...story, as it had me glued to the tv the entire film. Not becuase it was new or original, but because it wasn\'t. Because Boruto was going through the same struggles as his father and seeing the two of them interacting with each other, and away from each other, was really hitting me emotionally. As a father, and as a long time viewer.As the anime series comes to a close, this is just the kind of movie to make it feel like the story has ended. And what a great ending this is to such a great series we\'ve been watching for such a long time! I don\'t like to give 10\'s out unless something really stands out. So, with that being said, I really feel like this is something that anyone who has grown watching this series should definitely watch, as it\'s such a great ending to the Naruto series but also a great beginning to the Boruto series.As for the other ratings:Art - 8Naruto doesn\'t necessarily have the best artwork in anime, but it\'s by no means horrible. I would like to have seen a few good drawings of landscapes or the city and the hokage faces thrown in, but I didn\'t see any that just stood out with a ""bang"". It\'s pretty typical artwork from the Naruto series.Sound - 8Same as before. Typical sounds and music style that we\'re all familiar with from the series.Character - 6So many new faces, and many old faces we\'re seeing in new ways with new styles. It feels like almost everyone we\'ve known has completely changed! I really liked that! Unfortunately, The new faces remind me a little too much of their parents. Boruto looks almost just like Naruto. And he\'s not the only child I can say that about. Almost every child looks just like one of their parents. From the clothes, to the faces. The techniques and styles all look like they\'ve been washed and cleaned and handed down.Enjoyment - 10I couldn\'t stop watching it. There was mainly story throughout the bulk of the movie, setting up backgrounds and what not. But I didn\'t find it boring at all. The ending was quite epic, however and definitely outshines the rest of the movie in its 15-20 minutes of glory. story, as it had me glued to the tv the entire film.

The animation was simply incredible, and the action (though I am embarrassed to say) was so thrilling that I actually ended up sweating. The soundtrack, as always, was fantastic. However, I will comment that Naruto and Boruto's voices were a bit too similar at times, and therefore the age difference didn't come through well.A pretty major let-down for me was the whole initial...conflict between father and son, since it's difficult to imagine that the hero and most emotionally feeling person in the story is neglecting his own son. But I can't deny that it made for a good story and resolution, not to mention character development.All in all, I simply can't reduce the score very much, and I am basing this also on my mother's opinion who had to watch it with me without ever seeing the show before. She wanted to rate it a 10/10 as well, so I can't argue with the boss. conflict between father and son, since it's difficult to imagine that the hero and most emotionally feeling person in the story is neglecting his own son.

She wanted to rate it a 10/10 as well, so I can't argue with the boss."", 'This is my first reviewI knew that this series was going to be a massive disappointment from the moment I heard about it and it\'s obvious that this affected the ending of Naruto shippuden as I found it weird how the shippuden foreshadowed madara so much throughout the series is brought back to life and then is taken out by a villain that came out of nowhere and introduced a faction at the last second. Why because someone must\'ve told kishimoto during the war arc that they wanted to extend the Naruto story during the madara arc and he quickly had to come...up with a faction related to the Naruto universe so he quickly thought up aliens which is a jump the shark moment considering that the Naruto setting is about ninja wars and that kishimoto wanted to end the series after madara was defeated. But then boruto wouldn\'t have any other villains to fight.Now to the actual movieThe movie takes place almost a decade after shippuden Naruto finally achieved his dream and became hokage after all his hardships he married hinata and is now a father to 2 kids boruto and himawari. All of the friends have children and the villages of the world are at peace ( this will be important later on) and the hidden leaf village has expanded to become a full fledged city  this is a red flag, one of the things in Naruto that made it special was the medieval Japan setting it was in there was electricity powered devices like computers in the world but the aesthetics was mostly old school Japan with how the buildings and the characters clothing looked a mixed of old and new but in boruto they decided to go full modernized with sky scrapers video games and broadcast TV, this ruins the unique blend of modern and medieval setting of the original because now it mostly looks like a generic city.Then we have our main protagonist boruto the son of Naruto the hero the world over and possibly the worst character in the series to date and I don\'t say that lightly, btw I watched the English dub as I did with part 1 and 2 and the the English voice actors in the original are pretty good in the original and here too with the exception of boruto voice actor now I\'m pretty sure that the voice actor is good in other things but wtf did the director decide to give to make boruto sound like the most pompous stuck up kid you\'ve ever seen. Seriously boruto sounds like that arrogant kid in grade school school who has rich parents and nice stuff, I\'m pretty sure that\'s the point but you just want to punch him because he\'s so bratty I mean Naruto voice in the original was bratty but it was executed well enough to make not slappable on site.Also I can\'t express this enough how little if any attachment you\'re going to have towards the main characters situation in this series, in the original Naruto was an orphan, outcasted and feared as a monster by his fellow villagers because he unwillingly became the host of a powerful and destructive beast to ensure that the hidden leaf village military power is balanced along with the other 4 villages, Naruto wants to become hokage so that the people will see him as a respected individual not a walking nuke but he\'s feared by the residents and looked down upon by his classmates and also he has no talent for ninjutsu, you feel attached and want to see Naruto story to the end from the first episode it\'s a great hook for viewers. So what is boruto attachment to the world and his situation fucking nothing!!!!! First of all he\'s an overprivledged little kid who acts like his life is so hard when he has a family, friends, and is respected amongst the people because of who his dad is, something that Naruto had to work hard for years to gain with the exception of parents because they DIED THE DAY HE WAS BORN. No shit his conflict of throughout the entire movie is that MY DADDY IS TOO BUSY MANAGING A HUGE GROWING VILLAGE TO SPEND TIME AT HOME!!! if you\'ve seen the original Naruto you know that being hokage is a massively time consuming job with very little free time in between and that\'s when the village was small now its the size of a city so of course he\'s incredibly busy hinata understands that his little sister understands that so why can\'t he. When I saw this I thought this was a plot from a B level Disney movie from the late 90s not a story set in a world forged by ninja war wtf, and btw this whole thing could\'ve been solved with a short conversation by hinata or any of his friends before the events of the movie and during the movie, scratch that hinata tells him about Naruto back story ( that he should known well before this point) and says and I quote "" he\'s lucky his parents were dead"" in front of his own mother and hinata doesn\'t punch him out for this, this is cw teen drama levels of writing that is completely out of place in this universe.Throughout the movie boruto acts like an entitled little shit who is a complete asshole to his team members. You may think that this is going to end with boruto accepting that he\'s wrong about his father and respect, but not only is this incredibly obvious and can be seen from a mile away but they actually want you to relate to him. It\'s like the people who like this have never had parents with actual jobs or responsibilities and no one calls him out on this really?And one last thing he becomes sasukes apprentice in the movie to teach boruto how to perform a rasengan (don\'t know how Sasuke knows how to do the rasengan since it requires 3 steps that the sharingan can\'t copy, also his team is konohamaru he knows how to do a rasengan from Naruto why didn\'t boruto ask konohamaru to train him) and during the training he asks Sasuke about Naruto. This makes no sense because Naruto saved the entire world and is the strongest shinobi on earth how the hell is Naruto story and accomplishments not known by everybody did konohamaru, Naruto\'s friends, or even his mother whose known him since they were kids hasn\'t told boruto about his legendary father whose a war hero. It\'s this level of contrived and bad writing that ruins this movie.Oh also boruto motivations are all over the place he either is a dick to his father for being busy, wanting to beat up his father, or wanting his father to be proud of him. The other 2 motivations are never shown beforehand and come out of nowhere, Naruto motivation was clear and simple become hokage and gain his villages respect.Oh and if you want another reason to hate boruto he\'s a lazy cheater. Yeah since he can\'t master the rasengan instantly he decides to use a ninja tool which is a device that stores jutsu and allows anyone to use said jutsu even if they don\'t have Chakra ( which is a whole security issue seeing as how the point of Naruto is to stop wars not encourage them and that even non ninjas able to use them is a huge domestic issue) obviously in the chunnin exams they are forbidden since they don\'t require skill and training but he decides to use it anyway because he\'s lazy and doesn\'t get caught until AFTER he wins the final round even though the exams are supervised by expert veteran ninja and is being recorded on cameras from multiple angles from the start of the exam til the end Naruto is the only one who notices that he had the tool under his sleeve. (Seriously in Naruto chunnin exams you had to expertly cheat for jounin to not notice this how the ones couldn\'t see what he was doing on multiple cameras).The story is nothing to talk about the aliens that are apart of kaguyas clan the ootsuki arrive to take the power of the tailed beast after 1000 years. (Seriously what were they doing all this time while kaguya was on earth why did it take them so long to find earth?) To create the ten tailed tree again so it can bear fruit that keeps them immortal but they seem to already be immortal but whatever they capture Naruto as he lectures boruto about cheating Sasuke and the 4 kage arrives to bring Naruto back. And for some reason Sasuke decides to bring boruto his best friends amateur son with for some stupid reason, boruto can somehow make a throwable vanishing rasengan which is a crappy version of the rasenshuriken Naruto hands boruto a massive rasengan ( which should have eviscerated his arm) and defeats the enemy Naruto says he\'ll find time to spend with his family but boruto says it\'s okay he understands ( not sure why they spent the whole movie on that sub plot just for him to "" no its cool"")So yeah this movie is bad and I haven\'t even mentioned the new characters because they are just copy paste versions of their parents which is lazy writing. The only good thing to say is that it has good animation and art but that\'s it waste of time should have ended with madara.4/10 below average!!!!!!! up with a faction related to the Naruto universe so he quickly thought up aliens which is a jump the shark moment considering that the Naruto setting is about ninja wars and that kishimoto wanted to end the series after madara was defeated.

The Naruto franchise and I have a strong love-hate relationship, as I have severely disliked almost everything that came after the Pain arc. It turned from a perfectly good shounen fantasy with interesting worldbuilding and great characters to a cheap Dragonball knock-off. As many have said before me, Naruto and Sasuke becoming literal gods completely defeats the original message behind the tale and also lead to a pretty boring story that seemingly only diehard...fans found much enjoyment in.Boruto picks up many years after the end of the Naruto manga/Shippuuden anime. Peace has settled in the ninja world. Our characters have achieved their goals and formed families. As such, we follow their children, most of the focus being on Boruto himself of course. And his dad. This is what the film truly succeeded in presenting - family issues. One of the main themes in the story is parental absence and child angst, which are presented in a rather uncomfortable manner. As they should be. I assume this is quite representative of contemporary Japanese society, where a strict work ethic often leaves children to grow up on their own. I do think the conflicts could have been created a little bit better, as I found Naruto's weird obsession with documentation unfitting to his character. I think it's also worth mentioning that Hinata did not serve any other role besides a loyal housewife, only serving to demonstrate further how poorly this relationship was handled. I wish there was more focus on her, as she absolutely deserves it.As weird as I felt coming back to the Naruto world after a few years, I ended up enjoying myself  quite a lot by the movie's mid-point. I grew attached to the characters, specifically Boruto. As inconsistent a character as Sasuke is, I loved the role he played in the main character's development. Boruto's team were rather interesting as well, even if they didn't get as much screentime as I think they ought to have gotten. Nonetheless, I appreciate how they stood as their own selves, while also having certain characteristics of their parents. Another aspect I really liked was the return to the more grounded and tactical battles of old-school Naruto. Characters actually had to make do with their limited skill set, finding ways to outsmart their enemies. Boruto spend a decent chunk of time learning jutsu, yet he also was a vessel for one of the main conflicts in the film. Technology has vastly evolved in the world over a dozen years, and we see how it has changed the future for shinobi. While these thematics aren't exposed in some great depth, they serve a decent role in showing how the land has changed.As I said, I enjoyed about half the movie, until it disappointed me by having to resort to the old shenaningans of godmode battles, with huge balls of chakra flying around in place of the classic strategic approach (except for one part at the end). The main antagonist is completely forced and unnecessary. I don't see why they had to bring back these huge epic battles. The movie was really enjoyable with its more mundane events. I wanted to see more of Boruto and his team interacting. What about him dealing with his personal issues in more detail? Instead, I got to see this supposedly great friendship of Naruto and Sasuke's reiterated, even though everyone knows Shikamaru is Naruto's true homie. I just don't buy it. Sasuke spent several years being angsty because it was plot-convenient, and now they're best buds with Naruto because they got to be teammates while they were kids. I swear, it's those two that should have married since they can't stop being overly sentimental with each other.The art and animation would be good if this were an TV series, but we're talking about a full-length anime movie. It's rather mediocre, about as good as the last few episodes of Shippuuden. Just unimpressive. Audio-wise, I wish the mixing was better. The speech was too silent, while the music and sound effects turned up several decibels. The music was good, though I couldn't help cringing at how much it was used to force the film's epicness. Because forget any sort of moderation, the movie has to be emotionally manipulative beyond the realm of thought possibilities. It's why I liked the family matters, which reminded of the more relatable topics of old Naruto. It never had to force me to feel a certain way, it was simply natural for the story. But of course, big blue balls need big epic music to accompany them.Speaking of, the movie knows damn well how to utilise nostalgia as bait. There was a point at which it practically presented a slideshow of iconic Naruto scenes for some poor attempt at refllection on the past. That was a bit too much. I don't mind looking back at the past, but maybe that's one of Naruto's big issues. Kishimoto was going in a direction he had not planned, so instead of continuing along with the story's natural development, he reverted back to tropes of old and stayed in this weird place where adult characters were idolising their childhood memories, never quite growing as proper adults.I went in the movie with fair expectations. Most importantly, I wanted to close this chapter of my life. As silly as it sounds, I devoted a lot of time to watching Naruto, waaaaay more than I should have. I watched all the movies and have even reviewed a few (though those are old reviews and they are kind of bad). I don't plan on continuing with the next generation of shinobi, but I am glad that I at least got to see the overall direction. This could have honestly been a fresh start for the world, but it spends half its runtime fetishising its past. It was an entertaining watch, I'll give it that, but I'm ultimately left with mixed feelings. I only recommend it for people who either loved Naruto up until the end or those who want a bit of an epilogue. Otherwise, there is indeed no point in watching this one. fans found much enjoyment in.Boruto picks up many years after the end of the Naruto manga/Shippuuden anime. Peace has settled in the ninja world. Our characters have achieved their goals and formed families. As such, we follow their children, most of the focus being on Boruto himself of course. And his dad. This is what the film truly succeeded in presenting - family issues. One of the main themes in the story is parental absence and child angst, which are presented in a rather uncomfortable manner. As they should be. I assume this is quite representative of contemporary Japanese society, where a strict work ethic often leaves children to grow up on their own. I do think the conflicts could have been created a little bit better, as I found Naruto's weird obsession with documentation unfitting to his character. I think it's also worth mentioning that Hinata did not serve any other role besides a loyal housewife, only serving to demonstrate further how poorly this relationship was handled. I wish there was more focus on her, as she absolutely deserves it.As weird as I felt coming back to the Naruto world after a few years, I ended up enjoying myself  quite a lot by the movie's mid-point. I grew attached to the characters, specifically Boruto. As inconsistent a character as Sasuke is, I loved the role he played in the main character's development. Boruto's team were rather interesting as well, even if they didn't get as much screentime as I think they ought to have gotten. Nonetheless, I appreciate how they stood as their own selves, while also having certain characteristics of their parents. Another aspect I really liked was the return to the more grounded and tactical battles of old-school Naruto. Characters actually had to make do with their limited skill set, finding ways to outsmart their enemies. Boruto spend a decent chunk of time learning jutsu, yet he also was a vessel for one of the main conflicts in the film. Technology has vastly evolved in the world over a dozen years, and we see how it has changed the future for shinobi. While these thematics aren't exposed in some great depth, they serve a decent role in showing how the land has changed.As I said, I enjoyed about half the movie, until it disappointed me by having to resort to the old shenaningans of godmode battles, with huge balls of chakra flying around in place of the classic strategic approach (except for one part at the end). The main antagonist is completely forced and unnecessary. I don't see why they had to bring back these huge epic battles. The movie was really enjoyable with its more mundane events.

Fresh Precure!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5684/Fresh_Precure,"[""It's time to review Fresh Precure! Another fantastic season and the one to praise for introducing a successful formula that most later entries followed in terms of villains and story.The story this time is set in Clover Town Street, a very cheerful place where the main characters live. After the protagonist of this entry, Love, gets involved in the attack of the enemies from this story during a performance of the unit band Trinity, becoming a Precure in the process, she and her friends will have to fight to save the world from a bad ending.The cast of Fresh is one of the strongest from...the franchise IMO, this time the main trio (the cheerful and passionate for dancing Love, the kind and animal lover Inori and the fashion fan Miki) were already friends from before the start of the series and they really felt like a group with their interactions. Due to what happened at the start they also started to practice dancing with the help of the leader of Trinity and that gives them another point to work hard together that gets really nice use through the story.While the main trio is solid (although I'm not that big on Miki, who honestly suffered from lack of spotlight) and I really like Love, it's with the fantastic side cast that the series really shines. The main villain trio of the story for example are characters I grew to love a lot. Wester is a super goofy character that delivered tons of laughs with his personality, Soular is the serious business one of the group that gave great challenges to overcome for the Precure with his plans, and lastly there is my favorite chracters of this entry: Eas, who had an incredible and emotional arc that I absolutely adored. The story does a great job showing the place and situation this characters come from and it's hard to not grow to love them as the episodes pass, maybe even more than the main trio.And I still have to mention other great side characters like Daisuke, who is a great love interest for Love and forms part of some of my favorite episodes of this entry with the focus on those two, and the mysterious Kaoru, who gives as many laughs as donuts he sells. This entry also has two of my favorite mascots with Tarte and Chiffon, the first feels very different to the usual mascot as Harry from Hugtto did due to his personality, and Chiffon is really freaking adorable. I can perfectly understand the dislike for baby characters (I'm not that big on them either) but this one particularly stood out in the positive side, being 99% aww 1% cry.Now it's time to talk about the art and music, Fresh is actually the entry that looked the least appealing to me visually from the few info I saw from each before starting, but I ended up being pleased with what I got even if I liked others more. The color palette of this entry is less colorful than usual, and while this entry had good quality overall, it rarely stood out as others did with fights outside of two or three very nice moments. The transformation scenes and stock footage attacks are solid although I feel that this entry suffered from the second ones being too long. Overall it could definitely be better but it was consistently good. When it comes to the music, this entry has one of my favorite transformation songs and nice OP and EDs, that together with some nice songs through the episodes made me satisfied on that department.Fresh Precure is one of the best choices for first Precure to watch thanks to the great execution of the formula and the lovable characters it has, I really recommend to give it a chance! the franchise IMO, this time the main trio (the cheerful and passionate for dancing Love, the kind and animal lover Inori and the fashion fan Miki) were already friends from before the start of the series and they really felt like a group with their interactions.

Tart, a fairy of the Sweets Kingdom has to find the 3 pretty cures. For a magic girl for little girls the story is simple. But sometimes you can say: O.o That was a surprise, I didn\'t believe that... In all 50 episodes we know all about the present and past of the cure\'s, what are they afraid etc. The story is also full of comedy become the enemies (they\'re in part silly) and tartIf you see other pretty...cure season, the art of this very showy, with too much  shiny color and very attractive. The mascots here are also attractive. Tart may look like a ferret, but he is a very proud fairy and he will not get tired to say it. The villains design are also attractive, Soular and Wester look like a shoujo manga man: very ""bishounen\', but too silly.About the sound, I really like both versions of the opening (I like better the hybrid version of the opening) and the two openings, but the soundtrack isn\'t any special. Comparing with the OP and Ed, the soundtrack is simple and boring.About the animation is good, but sometimes looks so lame, and ugly. And if you put attention the perspective of sizes sometimes is incoherent. But this only happens in the first episodes. When they transform and when they are fighting with the enemy the animation is great. Also I lime the CGI ending dance. Is good to see all ending dance, you will enjoy it.About the characters, as I said, the anime really one strived in showing all the personality of all the characters. What they like, they efforts to become they\'re dream come true, what are they afraid and other things about their present and past, how they interact with love prospective and all things what a girl of 14 years old do. I really like this.About the overall and enjoyment some of the episodes you can skip them, some of them are really boring and it won\'t affect if you see them or not.

I think technology was definitely an important theme, as it emphasized how machines are meant to be top quality, instant results types of things, but it sacrifices individuality: memories, the ability to make a lasting impression on your or someone else\'s life. I could probably write an entire essay on the topic of Fresh Precure alone, but I\'ll try to keep it brief. First off, Eas\'...arc. While I think that Splash Star was pretty good on Michiru and Kaoru learning the error of their ways, this was a huge jump from that, one might even argue a jump that, if done wrong, could not only be a bad story arc, it could even create unintentional themes of negative consequence Precure didnt mean to dive into (i.e., that it\'s okay to cause destruction and chaos as long as you apologize, etc.) I am happy to say that Precure did a great job not only emphasizing, but understanding the morals behind Eas decisions, her motivations. The season finale in my opinion has been a slow boil from episode one, although a moment never felt dull here. It\'s great that Moebius\' arc is essentially caused by humans, since this is a realistic theme of humanity to advance and evolve.Precure also did an outstanding job in taking the piss out of themselves: making fun of their own tropes and themes from past seasons, things that have seemed contrived from out of nowhere (such as the theming of seasons themselves; Flora barely had a part in her own season finale despite the entire adventure being about the Cure Rose Garden), and even the subversion of typical monsters-of-the-day into HELPERS-of-the-day, which I believe is a first in magical girl history to subvert this trope in this type of way. My point is, Fresh knew exactly what they wanted to get out of this show going in, and as a result they were able to build up not only tension, but make important moments completely iconic without wasting time. This is why no episode got a 1: they were extremely careful with not only giving characters time to build up and develop, but how they develop. Take Miki, a typical fashionista sterotype, who had to confront her fear of octopi and had the help of Setsuna, and managed to fight an octopus monster alone. Or Buki, who had a semi-irrational fear of ferrets that actually strengthened her and Tart\'s bond to the point I\'d say she and Tart were closest by even midseason. Not even a single side character annoyed me this season, nobody who I wanted to throw in the Delete Hole, not even the crushes or even Kaoru. In my opinion, this is peak Precure: it has hit its Golden Age. arc.

In my opinion, this is peak Precure: it has hit its Golden Age.', 'The Precure franchise is one I\'ve talked about pretty frequently. I started with Doki Doki and then I went back to the beginning with Futari Wa and I\'ve been going in order since. So far about half of the franchise has been really good (Futari wa, Splash Star & Doki Doki) and half has been mediocre (Max Heart, Yes Precure 5 & Yes Precure 5 Go Go). When I talked about Go Go, the topic came up about how it nearly killed the franchise and I speculated that the likely cause was that the characters in Yes Precure 5 weren\'t strong enough to carry a...second series. Hell, they couldn\'t carry a single series and have it be good. Well, Fresh Precure was the series that revitalised the franchise and ensured that it could keep going even to this day. So, I\'m pretty excited to see this one.Story:Tart and Chiffon are two denizens of the Sweets kingdom. Tart is given two important tasks, find the legendary warriors, Precure and look after Chiffon. The pair wind up in Clover Town where they meet up with Momozono Love, a girl who loves dancing and her very close friends, Miki and Buki. Obviously, all three of them are Precure. The three of them have to defend Clover Town from the denizens of the shadowy, mysterious labyrinth who are trying to fill the sorrow gauge to locate Infinity, while also seeking out the fourth Precure.The only real criticism I have for the narrative of this one is that I think the fourth Precure\'s integration into the group and redemption are a bit too easy. I don\'t want to go deep into spoiler territory, but this girl starts out more in the lawful evil alignment and just transitions to lawful good really quickly and immediately redeems herself. I get that it\'s a series for a younger audience and they don\'t want to be too fixated on a long redemption arc but I also think even Splash Star had a more gradual, stronger redemption story for Kaoru & Michiru and that a couple episodes where she has to really prove herself and work for that redemption would have done wonders.With that said, the series has a lot of strong twists and turns. The whole theme about cooperating as a group but still being individuals versus complete conformity is an interesting one and the series handles it well. The series even takes digs at being overly individualistic when our heroines decide that they\'re going to hone their own individual strengths only to realise that they\'re stronger when they work as a unit. I also do love the whole ending sequence. Again, I don\'t want to spoil anything, but what happens with the girls and their families as well as the way they affect Labyrinth once they go there and the truth about Moebius are all pretty brilliant. This series also has a strong subplot where there are some boys who are romantically interested in our heroines and we see them look for ways to let them down kindly without anyone being treated like ""the bad guy"" in that situation. The series also possesses a great sense of humour. There are a lot of strong comedic moments. The writers also knew how to pace things so that there\'s a steady progression but there\'s also plenty of time for the girls to face various monsters of the week, have light-hearted fun moments and build their relationships with each other.Characters:The Precure are all fantastic. Peach, Berry, Pine and Passion. They have strong personalities with plenty of information and build up for their back stories that help craft characters that are surprisingly complex. Fresh also does a really good job of building up their parents as characters. We get to meet Love\'s, Buki\'s and Miki\'s families, see how they interact with each other and get a strong sense of the parents\' personalities. Which really pays off during the ending stretch when we get that excellent scene with the parents. This is also the first Precure series where all the heroines seem to be in a polyamorous grouping with each other. They have strong interactions and they\'re very yuririffic. We saw the same thing with everyone except Ace in Doki Doki but this is clearly the instalment that started it.I also do appreciate the antagonists. The whole Eas, Wester & Soular trio is really strong. Wester is actually kind of a delightful goofball. Moebius has a compelling back story and motivation once the series gets into it and stops having him as a shadowy villain figure. Northa and Klein are kind of the weaknesses there since they\'re both a bit boring but the series actually explains why the pair of them aren\'t complex and it\'s in a way that works.Art:The character designs are fantastic. I especially like Cure Passion\'s costuming though they did an excellent job of giving all the Precure costumes that are kind of similar but have their own individual touches. The monster designs and action sequences continue to be strong. The dance choreography we get in various episodes and with the ending theme tune is really good. The one criticism I can offer is that the series might spend a little too much time on the stock footage. Though this one spends a lot less on that stuff than Go Go did.Sound:The acting is excellent. Oki Kanae, Kitamura Eri, Nakagawa Akiko, Komatsu Yuka, Matsumoto Yasunori and the rest of the cast do a really good job and they all play off of each other like they\'re performing a stage production instead of voice acting. The music is amazing too.Ho-yay:There\'s a lot in this series. Every member of Precure seems to be romantically interested in every other member. It\'s especially true with the other three and Love but they get their moments with each other as well.Areas of Improvement:1. Cure Passion\'s redemption arc could have used a few episodes that explored the whole thing more deeply.2. The series could have benefited from abridging the stock footage a bit more.3. Maybe a bit longer for the epilogue.Final Thoughts:It\'s pretty obvious why this series brought the franchise back. It\'s excellent. The characterisation, action, sense of fun, just about everything in the series works really well. Yes Precure 5 may have been the first instalment in the franchise to put the focus on a group dynamic but this was definitely the first instalment that did it well. My final rating is going to be a 9/10. If you\'re a fan of magical girl stuff, especially when they\'re heavy on les-yay, this is one for you. second series.

Cure Passion\'s redemption arc could have used a few episodes that explored the whole thing more deeply.2. The series could have benefited from abridging the stock footage a bit more.3. Maybe a bit longer for the epilogue.Final Thoughts:It\'s pretty obvious why this series brought the franchise back. It\'s excellent. The characterisation, action, sense of fun, just about everything in the series works really well. Yes Precure 5 may have been the first instalment in the franchise to put the focus on a group dynamic but this was definitely the first instalment that did it well. My final rating is going to be a 9/10. If you\'re a fan of magical girl stuff, especially when they\'re heavy on les-yay, this is one for you.', ""Story: 8.5Ho-ly! Of all the Precure series I've seen - which is to say, all of them - this one still has the absolute best writing in terms of character development, emotional attachment, and consistency. Unfortunately, the last 4 episodes tried a bit too hard and threw logic right out the window, which, while it makes sense with context, definitely keeps it from hitting a 9 or a 10.Characters: 8The characters - and more specifically, their relationships - is where this show shines. Love, Miki, and Buki all know each other prior to the series' start, which is a unique take for Precure, and this...familiarity is clear in all their actions and affections. Setsuna's treatment by the crew - no spoilers! - is realistic, and unexpectedly heartbreaking at times. There's so much more emotional maturity than in many adult shows!Art: 7I'll be honest here - Fresh is very clearly a product of its time. The CGI endings, while unique to Precure at that moment, make for cringe-worthy viewing today. But you have to appreciate it for trying to do it while it was new, if nothing else.The character designs are definitely unique, and much more mature than earlier Precure. The overall scene designs are pretty fine, as are the villains. Nothing bad but not exactly memorable, either.Sound: 7Once again, it's good for what it is. The general score is good, but nothing memorable. Unfortunately, the Openings sound like the poor singer is yelling at times, which is uncomfortable, but the ED's are the perfect blend of dance and chill, they're super catchy and demonstrate the show's atmosphere really well. familiarity is clear in all their actions and affections.

Let\'s begin!Visuals:1) not much difference from last season2) I didn\'t enjoy the transformations sequences compared to previous seasons3) characters look more like 16 year olds than 14 year olds. It\'s just 2 years but in puberty 2 years is a lot4) there\'s a few continuity errors. This is better explained with an example. On the 3rd episode, a character and a dog go play in a water area where the water level reaches this character\'s ankles. A few minutes later, we get to see an actual truck fall in and it sinks completely.5) inconsistent...animation, sometimes sloppySound:1) top notch casting as usual for most roles2) dialog and animation aren\'t always in sync3) it\'s much more enjoyable when cutesy characters aren\'t voiced by male seiyuus forcing their throats to give us a very high pitched sound4) soundtrack is forgettableStory and characters:1) I was super into this up until episode 12. It felt somewhat fresh (no pun intended) and it was pretty funny, too. However, the vast majority of the episodes after that it so predictable, boring and repetitive that my interest and level of enjoyment died down. It felt like every episode was the same. 50 episodes is too much for this type of show.2) There\'s this guy character that\'s meant to be a love interest for one of the girls. He\'s pretty annoying and I can\'t relate or sympathize with him. However, this guy confesses his feelings for this girl and because the world is going into chaos, they postpone the answer. Finally the world is back to normal and... THE GIRL TELLS HIM ""I\'m not going to answer!!! :D"" as if it\'s an acceptable response. This ruined what was being a very average ending to this season.So, despite the promising start, it still ended up being a disappointment.

Fairy Tail Movie 1: Houou no Miko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12049/Fairy_Tail_Movie_1__Houou_no_Miko,"['Let\'s not look at the score and assume so soon that I\'m not fond with the series altogether; I like Fairy Tail as a shounen series. I\'m not the biggest fan of the series, and granted that the series has lots of flaws which can be easily improved, but altogether the series is very entertaining, the characters are memorable and some arcs can be really fascinating. And now, the long-running popular shounen series finally gets its take on a movie. It\'s fun having a series you may love or like to get a movie, so I was naturally looking forward to some more Fairy Tail...fun.That was when I finally realized that movies don\'t really work that way.Movies are completely different from anime series, even if it doesn\'t seem like it on the surface. They\'re similar in how they tell tales of any kind of stories, achieving many things in the anime industry that cartoons and non-japanese animation can\'t and, of course, the fact that they\'re both animation. However, movies tend to be in a much more grand level, and it generally takes difficult steps to achieve the things series can\'t. Experience can be remotely different considering it being inside a much shorter animation time to tell the story, and it\'s not so surprising that presentation and development are taken in a completely differently way, as well as budget and production values going all out.And it\'s mainly the reason why people\'s expectations go up when a popular or favorable series gets given a movie. Movies tells a story in ways that series sometimes cannot do, and movies like Evangelion, Ghilbi films, Mamoru Hosoda\'s movies and many, many more are so spectacular in different ways. But what about movies in addition to existing series? Unless some kind of prequel/sequel/remake link is involved in any way, it\'s hard to add a newly born story to a long-running series because of time-line issues (difficulties as to where it takes place in the series, for example), which leads to many disadvantages with how you can tell a story. Because of this, it\'d have to be regarded as a side-story (or in harsher terms, a money milker), and even one where it doesn\'t effect the series at all.And Fairy Tail fell right into that trap.""B-but hey! It doesn\'t matter so much if the movie is regarded as a dairy money milker! Who cares, as long as the content is well-written, entertaining and unpredictably gripping with the same charm, right?"" Yes, you\'re kinda right. Except... the movie is nothing like that at all.Firstly, this takes place far in the series, and I don\'t when exactly but you\'ve got to pass the \'time skip\' bit in order to get what\'s going on around you (vaguely discribing for fans who haven\'t seen that much of the series). But then again, it doesn\'t really matter as it\'s only little details to limit the questions you\'d be wonderingly asking, so if you\'re really desperate to watch this then ask someone to fill you in the very basic details. In other words, do what I did because I haven\'t caught up with the series.Assuming you\'ve read the quick synopsis on the top, do you know how the bad filler arcs in Fairy Tail are like? Yes, and this movie is on par with them. Go up to the relations and realize that the actual movie is NOT an adaption of the original manga, so it\'s completely original. Remember that silly Gray arc for example? It\'s probably worst than that. Not that it\'s more complicated or contradicting, but the writing is just plain bad.It\'s basically another set-up like \'the heroes getting caught in a bad situation and they solve stuff\' sort of thing. You see the fun atmosphere of the Fairy Tail guild, they gets caught in a mess and get their asses kicked, figure out what to do and attempt to defeat the bad guys (and to stop the world getting destroyed too). If you can convert the inside story into summarizing words on a single paper, you\'d find out that it\'s really, really basic story writing about the fact that two stones would cause big trouble, and the new girl has one and the bad guys has the other. Considering it\'s made into a movie, the entire plot is basically about all said (with a little more background for teeny development), and it\'s just too uninteresting and unoriginal to be in film format, as well as being too little and less grand than nearly all the main arcs of the original series.The writing is so cheap that everything inside the story felt so uneven that... nothing seems right. The very fact that some girl with amnesia has some unimportant stone (to the main guild that is) which can destroy the entire world just gives a big sense of doubt, and that can subtract to the experience of watching the film by a lot. Given the thin, thin storyline, it\'s no surprise that it\'d be extremely predictable at some places too. You get your bad guys who shows off their skills and somewhat thrashes the guild at first, but with the comeback of various battles between the two sides, it\'s easy to guess who would win. And not forgetting to mention the battle of massive monster who\'s aiming to destroy the world, guess who won that one? There are some story twists in which may shift differently in accordance to what you may think during the film, but the story and premise just seems so silly that you can\'t even be surprised about it. It\'s really hard to sense a real feel of hope or anxiety towards anything, and I can ensure you your edge of the seat won\'t be necessary for you to sit on.Apart from those points, there\'s quite a few plot holes here and there, though not enough to hurt the writing (well it\'s damaged enough I\'d say). There also isn\'t enough background on the stones and Eclair (I\'ll talk about her later though), considering the time limit of the movie. And even with the background given, once again it\'s not nearly as interesting as what the bad story is, and it doesn\'t help if they\'re only presented in single explanations from either narrative or a character\'s point of view at scenes (which isn\'t a creative way of telling backgrounds). There\'s nothing much else to say about the story, except it\'s just child writing at best. Some may argue that this sort of writing is how shounen shows work, but it\'s nothing on par with the original Fairy Tail series, and that what mainly matters. It\'s so unoriginal and predictable that it passes the point where it\'s beyond help.Let\'s get aside the point of the writing content for now, and go into the production values. Let\'s not forget that this is in movie format, because one would expect that the animation would be taken in better consideration than the series. Results? Well... mixed answers actually.In comparison to the original series, the animation is certainly better. The most noticeable thing about it is that the animation is much more fluent and smooth in movements, and this makes the experience of some fight scenes more practical and less forced. With the more cartoony style, it\'s simply more fun to watch the scenes go less picture-moving style whilst it allows more experimental movements. However, that\'s the most worth noting in the department, because it\'s nowhere as close as ""movie quality"". The style in the art is a little different than the original series (and no worries, it\'s not by a whole lot) but what you\'d expect from a big movie isn\'t going to be in here at all. Also, quality. There\'s still a lot of \'quality\' moments where the faces from far distance are hilariously distorted, weird positioning at times, and the infamous cheap tricks of moving one frame in certain directions are used here.If anything was really worth getting out of the movie, it\'d be the opening song. 200 miles (Jang Keun-suk) is one of those rock songs that you\'d find in either classic anime openings or songs from old rock bands outside Japan. I\'ve listened to the full song like, 50 million times, and I still love it. It\'s a catchy and good-ass rock song, and it\'s probably the only really, really awesome part of the entire movie. That said, the OST and ED is fine, but nothing really worth saying. The newly composed OST is just on par with the original OST used, and it\'s mostly not noticeable because the scenes are cliché enough to not even care for the soundtracks. Voice acting is the same as what you\'d expect from the series, and Aya Endou (Sora no Woto\'s Filicia, Needless\'s Cruz) does a decent job voicing the new, unfamiliar character.Ah yes, Eclair, the new highlight character of the featured movie.The entire movie is based around Eclair (and her bird Momon). She\'s a pretty good character actually, personality wise. The big problem was though that she was more of a plot device than an individual; It was her being that Fairy Tail was driven into this mess, and if she never met Fairy Tail, then they weren\'t have the care in the world about whatever\'s happening (oh and the world would end too, woops). It\'s not necessarily a bad thing though, as many stories feature encounters of characters who then gets involved in all sorts of troubles, and Eclair even had a decent amount of past behind her considering the amount of time in the movie was only 86 minutes long. The past wasn\'t so significant though, and definitely wasn\'t too interesting to know about, especially if the story wasn\'t good at all. The other problem, again, lies in the fault of being in movie format; it\'s too short to bring up the development between Fairy Tail (especially Lucy) and Eclair herself; she kinda just met them by chance and became fond with them. This means you won\'t feel much for her on anything that happens to her, and considering she\'s the center character of the story, she alone isn\'t enough to drive my interest towards the story during the entire movie.The entire Fairy Tail cast is involved. It\'s fun to see every character again, but... that\'s really it. The lovely charm of seeing the tropes of every individual in funny scenes is there, and if you\'re a fan of the characters then it\'s a given that you\'d smile to how they usually act. But that\'s really what they\'re there for... oh, and the fact that they all try to stop the mess from happening and stuff. They\'re all trying to do the same thing as a group, and not one of them, apart from Natsu and maybe Lucy, do anything really significantly interesting or important as a whole. They\'re just there to involve the charm of the Fairy Tail; if Eclair, Natsu and Lucy were the only main characters (excluding bad guys), then it\'d still be enough to carry the burden of the thin, thin story forward to where it is.Oh, and the bad guys. The bad guys, uhh... I forgot their names, are bad. And not bad as in ""evil bad"", but they\'re actually ""badly-written"" characters (you can probably tell since I don\'t even remember their names at all, both group and people). In a long time, they probably have the worst motives anyone can come up with; the motives are generic, rubbish excuses that even contradict each other, and the fact that the world is going to end because of the given motives is just plain horrible for the movie. They\'re nothing worth mentioning (except a few bad guys are kinda cool), but the rest are your usual assholes with uninspiring motives.It wasn\'t zero percent enjoyable though. I got through the movie because the introductory was entertaining and was a okay set-up, but from where the story unfolds just unfolds a rotten smell and unpleasant cooking. It\'s a given that the fight scenes, unique style and seeing the characters again were quite enjoyable, but the story felt like a pathetic excuse to bring up an entire movie, and it\'s really not worth putting it in film format.A massive fan of Fairy Tail? You\'d probably enjoy this, as you get to see every character be themselves and cool fight scenes. But a casual fan of Fairy Tail? Don\'t bother, because this really isn\'t anything compared to the original series, and the story is just an extremely cliché, generic and dumb linear story which doesn\'t add to the series in any way possible. Movies are a cool addition to series, but sometimes they don\'t work at all, especially if they\'re setting the bar up high by making it a movie in the first place.But who cares, isn\'t it about the content? Oh, wait. fun.That was when I finally realized that movies don\'t really work that way.Movies are completely different from anime series, even if it doesn\'t seem like it on the surface.

The whole picture of we are friends because we say we...are was removed. This movie made me excited when the fights went on, and made me tear up at the later parts. They painted such a lovely scenery of how true friendship can be so lovely and how it helps you keep strong at the tough parts in your life, like death, sorrow and so on.

It doesn't deserve a higher mark though because they didn't work it out like I expected.I heard people say that the art of fairy tail is terrible. Maybe it could be a bit more modern (I also heard they have a rerun of fairy tail with a new animation team...so that's nice) but I personally love the STYLE of the art. You have those animes with a terrible art style. I don't know something out of my head now but it's understandable I guess.My problem is that it sometimes (and ESPECIALLY in the beginning. Like the first half hour and sometimes at a random moment) seemed like the art style just changed! And that bothered me a lot, so yeah a four.The sound is excellent. Fairy tail is one of those animes with awesome sound and music. Except for the second opening theme of the anime then.The characters were a bit different and I'm sorry, but I just don't know how to explain that mkay?But hey, I always loved the characters of fairy tail and I still do. They could've worked out the main character in this movie a bit more though. So enjoy your seven.The enjoyment was okay except for in the beginning. The beginning annoyed me a bit, but a seven seems good for this section.I gave a five for the overall, but a 5.2 or 5.4 would be better cxOne more important thing: The fights were way too short. I'm not expecting them to focus on the fights and make the duration of it forever. This is not the anime so we don't have to focus on the non very important fights, but c'mon. This was just too short. Everything was way too short starting from the middle point.

In Veronika, there is real Evil hidden away which has the power to destroy the whole world, yet many evil Magicians want to unleash that power, not knowing the real Truth, hence our Guild fights to save the world.As expected from the series, Art and Soundtrack are outstanding, like always.

I expected better from this movie, the movie has a lot of flaws that makes it almost unwatchable, however, I gave it the benefit of the doubt since it's the first movie. The start starts off, pretty interesting in fact, but then everything changed when the story grew stale, not even Natsu the master of epicness  can save this from this L, but what I...believe the fight scenes can save the movie.Again it's Fairy Tail, so the characters are pretty much the same ya know like Erza, Natsu, Gray, Happy, and Useless person.

I pretty much prefer this animation over the original, no need to say more it's basically the same.I roughly give this movie, a solid 6/10, gee it could've been better, maybe they just wanted some quick and easy profits. I strongly suggest if you're currently watching Fairy Tail, finish at least to the first season, before watching this movie. As stated before this movie has a lot of flaws some would be: Natsu, it's always gotta be Natsu when it comes to saving the day, why can't be someone like Erza, or maybe even Gray.

There was the humor we know and love in Fairy Tail and it was easily identified early on but it did eventually turn serious as the story progressed.2.  The music. Probably my favourite part, the opening I loved I believed it went well for the type of leadup for the movie. But i more liked the...background music throughout.3. The feels.

Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25731/Cross_Ange__Tenshi_to_Ryuu_no_Rondo,"['Cross Ange is a travesty. It\'s a horrible, stupid, illogical trainwreck of a show with shoddy production values that relies almost entirely on pandering to the lowest forms of human life and waving shallow moments of shock value all over the screen. The series has a narcissistic sense of self-awareness, and in each episode you can nearly hear a subtle narration by the director and other Sunrise execs laughing at how much of a moron you are for watching this garbage that they\'ve put in front of you.""Ha, I bet those glass-eyed imbeciles are getting bored, let\'s put in another lesbian threesome.""""No, not yet. Only...after we show the loli whipping someone again.""That said, it\'s one of the best things I\'ve seen out of this studio in years. With a big ""Fuck you, Sunrise."", let\'s go into this.Cross Ange is a lot of different things. Cross Ange is a magical princess show about knights and dragons. Cross Ange is a prison drama. Cross Ange is Mean Girls. Cross Ange is borderline yuri hentai. Cross Ange is Gundam Seed. Cross Ange is a catharsis for the type of person who has a Fetlife account. Cross Ange is what would happen if you made a Princess Peach anime starring Ronda Rousey. Cross Ange is proof that not only will Mizuki Nana play any role, but that she is also good at it. Cross Ange is anime madlibs where your only word choices are ""lesbians"", ""dragons"" and ""kill"".The actual premise of the story is that a pampered princess named Angelise, a thoroughly awful person, is thrown out of her castle and put in an all-ladies jail when it\'s found out that she\'s a fraud. She\'s then forced to pilot a Gundam and fight dragons, because. And then she\'s bullied, molested or beaten up a lot, until she finally becomes ""Ange"", the greatest main character to ever appear in a Sunrise mecha show. Then the story becomes about rebellion, alternate timelines and dimensions, fighting god, virtual realities, and uhhhhh... Yeah. The story progresses through a flurry of ridiculous plot twists, comically evil villainous acts, and lesbian sex scenes. It\'s certainly not boring, but you will hate yourself for watching it. One of my favorite things about this series is what they do with the episode previews, where the characters break the 4th wall and banter about how ridiculous all this shit is.My other favorite thing is that there are dragons in this show. But they\'re not dragons, they\'re DRAGONs, and they\'re called that because they\'re DRAGONs and not because they\'re dragons.But really, the legitimate thing you\'re watching this for is Ange. Ange is amazing. She\'s logical, pessimistic, she cheats, she\'ll insult you and everything you stand for, disarm you and then shoot you through the face, twice. She\'s so out of the norm for an anime protagonist I can barely deal. She doesn\'t want harmony, she wants destruction. She wants to demolish everything that\'s wronged her. She\'s not a victim. The show is called ""Cross Ange"" because she\'s cross about 90% of the time. She is the one who knocks.The rest of the cast is surprisingly good too. Cross Ange does a competent job at giving you multifaceted, developing characters to feel things about, even if those feelings are mostly hatred and/or pity. The other central females are almost all emotionally damaged in some way or another, and are in contrast to Ange, very fragile people. I thought this was very interesting, because not only is Ange a strong, domineering, unbreakable character on her own, but those qualities shine even more when you slowly see the deep-seated problems with everyone around her.This series only has like two male characters. One of them is Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed, except that he\'s completely useless and a stooge 90% of the time. If you\'re ever worried about Ange being overshadowed or saved by her boyfriend, don\'t worry, he\'s the bottom in the relationship. This was also refreshing. Except for near the end where he actually starts doing things, that was lame and subverted a lot of the good things about his character and the show as a whole.The other major male character is the central villain, Fetus-kun,  who is also the most self-aware jab at otaku I\'ve ever seen. The whole premise of his character is that he\'s his own OC, and is looking for the perfect waifu. It\'s insulting and hilarious at the same time, just like the rest of the series.Animation-wise, Ange looks pretty okay at its best, and pretty bad at its worst. Gundam Unicorn this is not. The character and mech designs are also pretty bland, making the series not seem like anything relevant when looked at out-of-context.The audio\'s good. Nothing to write home about. You get a bunch of Mizuki Nana and stuff. I can\'t recall much of the BGM at all even though I watch this series week by week. The recurring insert song sung by Ange is pretty memorable.Cross Ange is a big damn spectacle with one of the best female leads in any anime. It\'s ridiculous and stupid, and even Sunrise probably hates you for watching it, so that means you should. after we show the loli whipping someone again.""That said, it\'s one of the best things I\'ve seen out of this studio in years. With a big ""Fuck you, Sunrise."", let\'s go into this.Cross Ange is a lot of different things. Cross Ange is a magical princess show about knights and dragons. Cross Ange is a prison drama. Cross Ange is Mean Girls. Cross Ange is borderline yuri hentai. Cross Ange is Gundam Seed. Cross Ange is a catharsis for the type of person who has a Fetlife account. Cross Ange is what would happen if you made a Princess Peach anime starring Ronda Rousey. Cross Ange is proof that not only will Mizuki Nana play any role, but that she is also good at it. Cross Ange is anime madlibs where your only word choices are ""lesbians"", ""dragons"" and ""kill"".The actual premise of the story is that a pampered princess named Angelise, a thoroughly awful person, is thrown out of her castle and put in an all-ladies jail when it\'s found out that she\'s a fraud. She\'s then forced to pilot a Gundam and fight dragons, because. And then she\'s bullied, molested or beaten up a lot, until she finally becomes ""Ange"", the greatest main character to ever appear in a Sunrise mecha show. Then the story becomes about rebellion, alternate timelines and dimensions, fighting god, virtual realities, and uhhhhh... Yeah. The story progresses through a flurry of ridiculous plot twists, comically evil villainous acts, and lesbian sex scenes. It\'s certainly not boring, but you will hate yourself for watching it. One of my favorite things about this series is what they do with the episode previews, where the characters break the 4th wall and banter about how ridiculous all this shit is.My other favorite thing is that there are dragons in this show. But they\'re not dragons, they\'re DRAGONs, and they\'re called that because they\'re DRAGONs and not because they\'re dragons.But really, the legitimate thing you\'re watching this for is Ange. Ange is amazing. She\'s logical, pessimistic, she cheats, she\'ll insult you and everything you stand for, disarm you and then shoot you through the face, twice. She\'s so out of the norm for an anime protagonist I can barely deal. She doesn\'t want harmony, she wants destruction. She wants to demolish everything that\'s wronged her. She\'s not a victim. The show is called ""Cross Ange"" because she\'s cross about 90% of the time. She is the one who knocks.The rest of the cast is surprisingly good too. Cross Ange does a competent job at giving you multifaceted, developing characters to feel things about, even if those feelings are mostly hatred and/or pity. The other central females are almost all emotionally damaged in some way or another, and are in contrast to Ange, very fragile people. I thought this was very interesting, because not only is Ange a strong, domineering, unbreakable character on her own, but those qualities shine even more when you slowly see the deep-seated problems with everyone around her.This series only has like two male characters. One of them is Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed, except that he\'s completely useless and a stooge 90% of the time. If you\'re ever worried about Ange being overshadowed or saved by her boyfriend, don\'t worry, he\'s the bottom in the relationship. This was also refreshing. Except for near the end where he actually starts doing things, that was lame and subverted a lot of the good things about his character and the show as a whole.The other major male character is the central villain, Fetus-kun,  who is also the most self-aware jab at otaku I\'ve ever seen. The whole premise of his character is that he\'s his own OC, and is looking for the perfect waifu. It\'s insulting and hilarious at the same time, just like the rest of the series.Animation-wise, Ange looks pretty okay at its best, and pretty bad at its worst. Gundam Unicorn this is not. The character and mech designs are also pretty bland, making the series not seem like anything relevant when looked at out-of-context.The audio\'s good. Nothing to write home about. You get a bunch of Mizuki Nana and stuff. I can\'t recall much of the BGM at all even though I watch this series week by week. The recurring insert song sung by Ange is pretty memorable.Cross Ange is a big damn spectacle with one of the best female leads in any anime. It\'s ridiculous and stupid, and even Sunrise probably hates you for watching it, so that means you should.', 'The last episode came, many people watched it and at the end one thought was strongly resonating in their brain: ""Why did we underestimate this anime so much?"".  The beginning of this anime may be the biggest hoax in the anime history. Not only it made no sense, but it was like in the middle of night while you were sleeping someone blew up your roof, killed your family and then told you that it was your fault and you should be punished. No sense right? Still, slowly but surely this anime showed that it was a lot more than that. Sometimes  surprising...by the deep philosophical understanding of the human nature, and sometimes using its main card, the fighting, the best way possible. Many could say the entire premise of this anime was to not judge a book by its cover. No mater how ugly it may be, what is inside could be worth thousands of time more than a book with a cover that shines like gold. Anyway, lets do it the normal way:Story - 9, The story of this anime centers around a girl, Ange a royal princess, who at her coming of age ceremony is shown to be a Norma, a person not considered human in a society where everyone is using mana to control everything around them, thus making life easier. Everything falls into chaos, many sad things happen around her and after that she is sent to Arsenal, no, not the team, but a place where all Norma are disposed of, or so was believed. A lot of whining, hundreds of screams, enough to make you wish she was killed right on the spot. After a few episodes no one would wish the same thing. Not only because her character became a lot more interesting, but because the purpose of Arsenal is becoming clearer.The story becomes more and more complex as time passes so it should be impossible for someone to try to present the story in only a few words. There are betrayals, there is love, there is friendship, sadness,quite a lot of yuri, and we have an awesome antagonist who appears at the right moment. Still, its not like everything was perfect. There are a few blanks in the story, blanks that not only were not explained but it felt like a railway was missing some parts. For better or worse, we were made to forget about this and move on. I don\'t know if that part is to be explained in a movie, ova or maybe a second season, but it certainly needs one to explain a few missing parts without going back to the plot of the first season. Its the best ending for this anime and I really do not wish for everything to repeat in the same world as before.Now, after the story comes the art.Art - 9, Sometimes I wonder, how should we describe art? Some anime have such an ugly art that it would not be a surprise of everyone to hate that anime, but instead there are fans saying it receives a ten just because they feel like it fits. Sadly, I do not have the same opinion. Art is about beauty, about fluidity, about complexity, about impact. This anime excels at most, but some may say they could be even better just because .. . Anyway, every characters, robot, dragon looked awesome. Especially the dragons which didn\'t try to fit in the same criteria we were used to. Each battle was like a movie. They can make you forget to blink or breath. The only problem was its too fast pace. They moved to fast from one place to another and because of this it became tiresome to try to take in everything and instead were are left with the decision to only concentrate only on a few things forgetting about the rest.Sound - 10, extremely enjoyable. The bgm is very important, but its true role  is to make you feel attracted to the story, which this one did. If a bgm attracts to much attention, be it good or bad, then it failed in its purpose. Some forget about this and rate it poorly or better only based on this. The ost, op, ed and especially the seyuu\'s are the most important. And all of them are doing their job perfectly.Characters - 10, Vivid, strong, beautifully. Each and everyone of them had what you could call charm. Their personalities, feelings, point of view were attractive mostly because there are so many that its impossible to not see at least one that shared your emotions and state of mind. I can say that in my opinion this anime strongest point were the characters.Enjoyment - 9, there is not much to say about this. It was a gem found in the garbage. If you can watch it with an open mind you will not only not regret doing it but you are also going to remember it as one of the most surprising anime in the entire history.Overall - 9, The story was not perfect, this is clear. A story that is short but also complex can hardly manage what Cross Ange did. Its divergent points were not only large in numbers, but also had its own characters which had to do their job in a way that wouldn\'t hinder the progress of the story. I\'m going to re-watch it later this year for sure. Until then I can only recommend it to anyone who loves anime. by the deep philosophical understanding of the human nature, and sometimes using its main card, the fighting, the best way possible.

Until then I can only recommend it to anyone who loves anime.', 'This is possibly one of the most underrated animes from the fall season.You can read my overall + my final thoughts/notes at the very bottom of the review if you\'re feeling lazy and just want some quick feedback on the anime.I can\'t lie the first 5 episodes was extremely hard to get through for many which lead to the anime being dropped early on, and also given a poor rating due to its evaluation being solely based off of these first 5 episodes. It is now one of the animes I look forward to watching every week, almost as much as ""Your Lie in...April"".Anyways, on with the review!Story: 7The setting of the anime is that of a dystopia, it follows a Princess (Ange) who is stripped of all her rights after being revealed that she is a norma (which are like unwanted humans due to their inability to use ""mana""). This is one of the weaker points of the anime, although the story isn\'t bad, it wasn\'t done correctly for to be anything too special. Don\'t get me wrong, the story isn\'t boring in anyway and is fairly interesting, just not above and beyond (hence the 7).A plus for the anime would be the unexpected twist and turns they have which sometimes really caught me by surprise, they often leave you wondering what may happen in the future. Overall its a decent story, but nothing too amazing.Art: 7Honestly the art is pretty good the characters, background, ""ragna-mail"", and pretty much everything looks like it was done quite well. The animation is quite fluid and well done, and I honestly have nothing to complain about in this section. The art isn\'t exceptionally beautiful but it\'s pretty good, although you can notice the budget slipping in some scenes, but overall the art for all the characters + most of the animation is very crisp.Sound: 9One of the reasons why you SHOULD watch this anime. The sound track that they have is amazing in my opinion, both their OST and their opening/ending songs. Their use of music is on point for most of the anime, although there were a couple of times I felt that the music could have been used more effectively. I read one of the other reviews saying how the anime\'s OST + openings/endings were bad, please don\'t listen to them and give it a chance BECAUSE THE OST IS AMAZING!Character: 9Yeah so Ange is possibly one of the most BAD ASS female leads I\'ve seen in a while. She is extremely strong willed and self-righteous and that is the part I love about her. I REALLY like characters that can look strong enough to take on the entire world yet can look really weak and docile the next. The character developments and the revealing of a characters true nature/past is really well done in the anime, although some of the characters story could have had some improvements (cough Embryo).Enjoyment: 9I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime, some parts could of had some minor tweeks, but it was a great anime to watch. To those who are able to watch all 25 episodes of this anime at once, I\'m really jealous because you won\'t feel the pain I had to wait for this every week. :\'(Overall: 8I\'ll repeat this again, I love a strong female lead that can take on the entire world, but in the next second can be really docile, weak and in need of protection and support. Cross Ange is a mecha anime that is really well made, if you look over a few of the poor things that they have done. I promise all you mecha fans that you will thoroughly enjoy the animes OST, great animation, interesting characters and their unique background story (PREPARE A TISSUE BOX WHEN THEY\'RE REVEALING SOME OF THE CHARACTERS BACKGROUND). They do quite a few plot twist and a bit of romance in the anime, however little that romance may be. But with respect to the lifestyle transition Ange has been forced to live in, the romance does feels really \'cute\'.NOTE/FINAL THOUGHTS:-Please understand that this anime DOES contain mature content.-This anime is definitely one you should give a chance to (please at least give it until episode 6).-Review may be slightly biased due to my love for mecha animes.PROS:+Has an amazing OST. Really love their opening and endings + their music choice.+Ange is possibly one of the best female leads I\'ve seen in a while.+Highly recommended for those who enjoy the following genres: Dystopia ,Ecchi, Mecha+The anime has enough plot twist to constantly surprise you & keep you interested.CONS:-Personally I really dislike it when something isn\'t suppose to happens, not going to say who but when someone is suppose to die, they really should die.-You may sometimes notice in the animation where the anime was being ""efficient"" with their budget.-Although their OST is really good, their timing for their background music could use a little work.-The pacing of the anime is quite good for most of the anime, but some parts could have been slowed down.

It looks and sounds interesting but its overall presentation is just so bad.As I watched this I realized I saw a lot of plot holes by watching it once. Usually I would watch an anime three times to notice anything but every problem is just so provoking that it\'s noticeable.I won\'t be talking about rape, fanservice, or morality problems as other reviews I\'ve seen have, unless they\'re problematic in some other way. They\'re problems in their own right but I\'m not one to judge an anime based...off that.Story: 2/10On paper, the plot sounds very interesting, enough to drag me in. But the execution is god awful. The problem with Cross Ange is that it tries way too hard and ends up being edgy as hell. There\'s no coherency because anything it offers is so poorly implicated. The first few episodes were somewhat acceptable but it turns to a lot of illogical dialogue. A few episodes later it plays on a lot high school anime tropes and comedic plays that don\'t fit the anime\'s theme. Overall it just doesn\'t set the tone or setting that it should have. But I\'ve stratched a long and tried to watch it. By the eleventh episodes, I dropped this because of how horribly written it is. At that point it just felt like the creator realized how bad his work and was about to be fired from his job if he didn\'t do anything good, but he resulted in a cheap product with no good foundation. It has a lot of very interesting concepts but the way it\'s presented is just so bad.Now I know I said I wouldn\'t talk about the fanservice but this is something important. I would be fine if it were used for rape and a prison like environment, but it\'s used for comedy. It conflicts with the tone and is more annoying than fanservice should be. Only a few anime/manga have been able to be funny and keep a serious story, I.E. Fullmetal Alchemist, but this isn\'t one of them.Art: 1/10I am more critical of art and animation for various reasons, but let\'s not get into that. The animation is bad to the point where I actually notice the frames. The CG is very straightforward, it\'s either bad or not. This is bad. It\'s very out of place and obviously you can notice it. The CG ddoesn\'t mesh in too well with the background but that\'s ridiculous because the background when using CG is usually the blue sky.The artwork is meh-ish. The designs and concepts arejust so bland and generic. ""Yes let\'s have a blonde princess like every anime. Whatelse sshould we have?"" ""Oh, I have all these generically designed characters with me."" Was pretty much what I thought the creator was thinking. The mech designs are pretty stupid. What\'s with that royal royce on Ange\'s mech. They try to look cool rather than practical which is something I prefer in mech designs.Sound: 2/10I overall hate it. Nothing stood out and I found nothing powerful enough because of how conflictingly unnoticeable it is. That\'s a fault on Cross Ange itself because of how it can\'t keep a good atmosphere.The voice acting was average to below. The majority of voices sound so artificial that I can\'t help but be annoyed. Their voices sound like they\'re being faked. Like a character faking their voice in a cheesy television show I watched as a kid.Characters: 1/10Throughout, I have never hated characters so passionately. The characters I do like don\'t even get screen time. I can\'t believe how artificial the character development is. The reason is because of the plot contrivances and the lack of solid characterization so that we\'re given good ideology in the earlier episodes. Any event that provokes development is done so terribly, because there\'s no foreshadowing nor a natural flow. Everything is planned out like ""IT SHOULD HAPPEN"" rather than ""IT WILL HAPPEN.""Enjoyment: 1/10Generally, I couldn\'t come to love this because of how boring it is. I would usually watch something for gore regardless of how badly written it is but the gore just feels cheap and needless, because the presentation is just chauvinistically pretentious and overdramatic, and how the atmosphere is wrongly set through every little moment.Overall: 2/10At best I think this would be a six but I won\'t be here to see it get any bette or worse. off that.Story: 2/10On paper, the plot sounds very interesting, enough to drag me in.

I will be breaking this down into the stages MAL uses for rankings as there is a lot to cover with this one. As normal I will do my best not to spoil and keep it to the broad strokes. In addition I will worn you now. Watching this with friends is a no no. YES it is a bit risque, YES there are some very confronting things about this show, but that is not what I am talking about. There are a lot of girls in this one, to the point...wear there are like 4 male characters. And this mas of girls is hot and I mean HOT. I am telling you this now because I will not be held responsible for starting waifu war 4. Why 4? Simple! Because we all know waifu war 3 started when HuniePop was released, get with the times people. Que theme music aaaaaand GO!Cross Ange: Tenshi to so on and so forth is an action, sci-fie, ecchi... ish anime that dose a splendid job of just about everything. It was a masterfully crafted peace from start to finish with only a small handful of what one might call ""glaring"" flows to it, but I don\'t want to scare you off it so I will leave them until later, like right at the end. For now, I must gush like the fan boy I am.This was without question one of the best things I have watched in at least a year. I was  in love with this anime right from the first episode. It was fast paces but was not afraid to slow down the tiniest amount when it wanted you to feel things. It plays with the full gambit of emotions. Love, hate, sorrow and a hole bunch of others I cant seem to name coz well... I\'m a guy, but trust me they are there and in spades. Not going to lie, there was a point in time this show jerked a tear out of my eye. Other times I was literally laughing out loud, right before being angry for the same reason. It was like a roller coaster of emotion, not a crazy one but from episode to episode it definitely gets you. Some of the time the feelings are not the sort you should have for animated girls but hey, that\'s never stopped us before am I right internet? The big kicker to it all though is that its all about the basics of human nature. The need to be in control or how we don\'t relay function alone. The fact that they tell the story with fuck off robots is just gravy. Ok that may have been a bit of spoils but if you haven\'t gotten that from the first two eps your likely watching this anime for the wrong reasons. 10 for 10 on enjoyment. Moving on...This first thing that hit me about this anime was the outstanding use of colour. I am a devout follower of the high and mighty ""Lord Vivid Colours"" and I can say without a doubt this anime would pleas him. The pallet was vast, all the colours and not just a splash on a brown back drop modern day FSP style. What starts as a peaceful setting drenched in bright pinks, yellows, blues and whites gos down a darker path as the mood of the show changes. The are quickly replaced by blacks, grays and reds but stay with me I am not taking back what I said earlier. It takes an episode or two but the colours return in full force as the disposition of the characters improve and the reality of the world sets in. When the mood is good the colours are bright. When it is bad the pallet changes to reflect it. It is as much a part of the story as anything else and it helps immensely with the fast pacing of the show that there are visual ques like this to help keep the viewer on track. On a less ranty note the art over all was very well done with a lot of sharp lines and easily identifiable shapes, nothing just blended into the back ground. Each peace of furniture and the people on screen were easily recognizable but it very rarely felt cluttered. The distinct lack of copy and paste throughout the show was also very refreshing. 10/10 art  team, well done.Next down on the list of numbers is the characters. Good ol\' characters. You know what? There are lots of them and they are good. Not what you might call amazing but considering the pace of the show (fast as hell), I think they have done really well. Almost everyone has at leas a minor bit of character development no matter how short there life span may be or how close to the main story they are. And on the off chance they don\'t get developed they are acknowledged strongly enough that you know they are real. No single character feels phoned in and aside from the occasional mob there is no mas melding of opinion, people are always butting heads over something. There are plenty of twists in the development of the main toon pile as well and most of the time it is a bit of a surprise. I say surprise and mean it but occasionally there are some ill timed or even impossible shifts in mood. This is another factor the dev team seemingly utilized in the telling of the story that mostly worked in there favor... mostly. As I mentioned before in my disclaimer there is a lot of girls in this one and it IS a touch ecchi so there was bound to be a good amount of.... let us say lesbianism going around. This is not entirely forced though. On many occasions it is in fact used to make a point about the world they are living in or to legitimately build character. Some times it works quite well as a point puter acrosser, but other times it falls short, and then there are times when it is just strait up fan service. It was unavoidable but it is also mostly good..... 8/10 characters let us move on.SOUND! Not a lot to say on this one. I am not one to pay much attention to the sound in anime, or anything really. Due to my work I have a gift for hearing when something is wrong but that is about it. With that being said I didn\'t hear anything wrong as fare as the soundtrack went in this one. The action pacing of it did mean there was always some sort of music going so a lot the background was drowned out but the fight noises were responsive and seemed different enough that they didn\'t just meld into explosion. Normally this sort of thing would only warrant a 6 or 7 from me but in this case its a solid 8 from the theme music. It just fits. I don\'t know what the words are in English, I didn\'t have that sub file, but it sounded right. So 8/10.Now the hard sell. Story. I say hard for what seems like a number of reasons, but relay its just one. I found it SUPER hard to pick up and follow over all. It seemed to take forever for the story to kick in and then it would piss off for an episode or two and come back. The hole thing was just so fast paced that each episode up until the last third felt like individual events that some how strung together. It was a simple mater to pick up on the ""foreshadowing"" for me but I cant say if that\'s because it was obvious or just my veteran status picking up the right bits. I know I have already told you how much I loved the different methods used to tell the story and I do stand by what I said. But telling a story well doesn\'t make it a good story. The problem being that this IS a good story. It is deep and full of emotion, conflict and real issues that face the human race, though it is a tad embellished (meh its anime). They just over paced it. It felt like they had something truly great in the works.... and then they gave it to Michael Bay. All being said there were no plot holes for me to dig out and the last 8 or so episodes saved it hard. I will be re watching this one down the line, probably after its dubbed, just to see if I can follow it a bit better. It dose have a somewhat ""Blade Runner"" feel to it in that I think I would understand more the second time around. So right now I am going with a soft 6. It was a good story when I could find it and it was told brilliantly and in interesting ways. But I can say it irked me how long it took to kick in and was defiantly not my favorite thing about this show.So to cap it all off. Right from the start this show goes hard. Balls to the wall. It\'s speed setting goes from about 8 up to 11+. It throws things at you constantly in what I assume is an attempt to keep you from following the story 100% but keep you entertained enough to keep watching, and it dos it SO well. All is grand with this show and I would say to all seasoned anime watchers to get on it. On the flip side though, if you are new to the sport of anime watching I would let this one rest till you have a winter or two under your belts. I have been at this game for almost twenty years (that\'s right I started animes when I was 7), and it took me a bit to latch on to this. I mean, I may just be a dumb ass. Stranger things have been proven true. But as a rule of thumb I find I pick up on things in anime quit well. I stand by the Masterpiece ratting I have given and defy any who think otherwise, but that\'s what the Internets are for and as I said, personal opinion.I have been Kergen and you have been reading this review. CONGRATS and go forth to bigger and better anime. wear there are like 4 male characters. And this mas of girls is hot and I mean HOT. I am telling you this now because I will not be held responsible for starting waifu war 4. Why 4? Simple! Because we all know waifu war 3 started when HuniePop was released, get with the times people. Que theme music aaaaaand GO!Cross Ange: Tenshi to so on and so forth is an action, sci-fie, ecchi... ish anime that dose a splendid job of just about everything. It was a masterfully crafted peace from start to finish with only a small handful of what one might call ""glaring"" flows to it, but I don\'t want to scare you off it so I will leave them until later, like right at the end. For now, I must gush like the fan boy I am.This was without question one of the best things I have watched in at least a year. I was  in love with this anime right from the first episode. It was fast paces but was not afraid to slow down the tiniest amount when it wanted you to feel things. It plays with the full gambit of emotions. Love, hate, sorrow and a hole bunch of others I cant seem to name coz well... I\'m a guy, but trust me they are there and in spades. Not going to lie, there was a point in time this show jerked a tear out of my eye. Other times I was literally laughing out loud, right before being angry for the same reason. It was like a roller coaster of emotion, not a crazy one but from episode to episode it definitely gets you. Some of the time the feelings are not the sort you should have for animated girls but hey, that\'s never stopped us before am I right internet? The big kicker to it all though is that its all about the basics of human nature. The need to be in control or how we don\'t relay function alone. The fact that they tell the story with fuck off robots is just gravy. Ok that may have been a bit of spoils but if you haven\'t gotten that from the first two eps your likely watching this anime for the wrong reasons. 10 for 10 on enjoyment. Moving on...This first thing that hit me about this anime was the outstanding use of colour. I am a devout follower of the high and mighty ""Lord Vivid Colours"" and I can say without a doubt this anime would pleas him. The pallet was vast, all the colours and not just a splash on a brown back drop modern day FSP style. What starts as a peaceful setting drenched in bright pinks, yellows, blues and whites gos down a darker path as the mood of the show changes. The are quickly replaced by blacks, grays and reds but stay with me I am not taking back what I said earlier. It takes an episode or two but the colours return in full force as the disposition of the characters improve and the reality of the world sets in. When the mood is good the colours are bright. When it is bad the pallet changes to reflect it. It is as much a part of the story as anything else and it helps immensely with the fast pacing of the show that there are visual ques like this to help keep the viewer on track. On a less ranty note the art over all was very well done with a lot of sharp lines and easily identifiable shapes, nothing just blended into the back ground.

CONGRATS and go forth to bigger and better anime.', 'I can say with great confidence that Cross Ange is one of the trashiest, garbage series I have watched in quite a while. Its ridiculous amounts of over the top fan service and emphasis on shock and awe scenes are legitimate lunacy. However, after the travesty that is the first few episodes a compelling story begins to rise from the muck that is Cross Ange and give people a legitmate reason to keep watching besides the fanservice and some some good mecha action.The story begins by introducing us to our main heroine Ange, who lives in a world where magic is a used daily,...and those without magic are a persecuted group of people called the Norma. Ange is pretty unlikable for the first few episodes,  as she clings to the fact that Normas are inferior, despite the fact that she is revealed to be a Norma herself, apparently not realizing that not using Mana once in your life is a tell tale symptom. From there she is shipped off to a Norma prison island and told that she has to fight DRAGONs to save humanity, why in all caps? Apparently Sunrise thought it looked cool. From there Ange is introduced to the other Norma, who are all young girls, and the fanservice begins, and it\'s literary ridiculous. There\'s some weird rapey scenes, lesbian three ways to keep the plot moving, and Ange is naked  for about 60 percent of her on screen time, a trend continues as the series moves on. The first few episodes will test if you are ready for this series, from going for over the top shock affect on issues such as racism, lots of nudity, and little girls getting lopped in half by giant dragons. It is as ridiculous as it sounds, and it sometimes hilarious to watch the over the top nature, and the series seems pretty self aware of just how trashy and bad it is. The cast of side characters initially aren\'t very important to the plot or are given much attention, besides the leader Salia and the head lesbian Hilda. There is also a guy named Tusk who lives on an island and rescues Ange at some point, and all of their conversations consist of him accidentally bury his head in her crotch or something like that, than Ange shouts ""baka"" and beats the crap out of him. That is basically a summary of that episode. However Tusk shows some interesting characteristics as well as brings up some mysteries about the world of Mana.The story starts to pick up near the end of the first half, when the narritive shifts from the island back to the mainland, where we are given a lot more depth into Hilda\'s character that makes her much more likable and understandable, and we once again see how ingrained the fear of the norma is in the people who use Mana. However a large battle breaks out on the Norma battle island, and during this battle we are introduced to the main villain Embryo, whose main attack as well as the other special mechas is powered by song. I wish I was making some of this up, but it seems like Sunrise started throwing crap at a wall until it stuck. The story starts to get more and more interesting after this point, and has some twists and shows us how exactly the earth has ended up in this state and the true nature of the DRAGONs, and some honestly genuine twist regarding the cast of characters and how they have been manipulated by the great Embryo, and seeing how he played off the weaknesses of each girl makes him a cool character to watch. They start throwing a lot of science jargon around during the end that feels like it could be replaced with a recording of Jesse Pinkman saying, ""science bitch"" over and over as it seems like they are just sputtering straight nonsense. Also there is a ridiculous deus ex machina  near the end that left in tears as it tried to explain how a frying pain stopped a bullet and can also apparently save you from falling into a ravine and getting hit by an exploding car, its like they suddenly realized these characters are integral to the plot and has never heard of the no take back rule. But in all honesty, the second half is  a vast improvement and has an interesting plot that can suck you in.The characters are very diverse, with most falling in the categories of being Ange, wanting to bone Ange, or strongly disliking Ange because they want to be her. Ange falls in the being Ange category, and starts off pretty dislikable, but quickly turns into the chosen one who pilots the special mech with great skill and cares deeply for her comrades and friends. Tusk falls into the wanting to bone her category, and is a skilled fighter and nice guy who helps out the Norma and is considered to be Ange\'s knight, which as a side effect grants invulnerability. Salia is the leader and falls into the hate us because they ain\'t us category, and is initially a fairly competent leader who keeps a steady head, but is insecure due to the fact that she was not chosen and Ange was. Hilda wants to bone Ange and starts off unlikable, but as she learn more about her and she softens up she is a fairly likable character who goes through some nice development. Embryo wasnt to bone Ange, is the ridiculous Op bad guy with a justified God Complex, and is actually interesting to watch how he toys with others and manipulates them to accomplish his will. i was also impressed with the later development of some of the other side characters, as it really shows what\'s going through their heads and proves they are more than just boobs and ass.Overall Cross Ange is a train wreck, but is one that you can;t turn away from. It\'s over the top scenes can make it hilarious, and it seems aware of this fact which is honestly pretty funny. the fan service is up to ridiculous levels, and I would advise if you choose to watch this series do it in a sealed room because if someone walks in on you during some of the more fanservicey scenes you are going to have some explaining to do. The plot really gets going as the show completes it\'s run, but you have to put up with the trash that is the first few episodes and be able to take a ready helping of fan service. Cross Ange is definitely an experience, and one i would recommend giving a try, even if you can hear cackling Sunrise execs counting their money as you watch the literal crap they put out that somehow turned out to be pretty good. Nest year we\'ll probably have a mecha series featuring fully naked girls fighting GRIFFINs in space while trying to bring down two gods in a separate dimension, with a healthy dose of lesbian three ways, but that goes without saying. and those without magic are a persecuted group of people called the Norma.

(taken both ways, since you\'ll be seeing a lot of both)If you answered...yes, then please read on for this review of a journey filled with much oppai, BDSM, mechas, and made-up words galore!Do note that I\'m an offensive person by nature, so I do apologise for anything further aheadIf I had to describe \'Cross Ange\' in one single word; I\'d have to choose the phrase \'Identity Disorder\'. Tabling the fact that that\'s two words for now - I say this due to the fact that you\'re presented with an absolutely appalling princess of some generic utopia, who is an idol for the citizens and all their ilk. However, all is not well in genericutopialand as you might expect. This is due to the presence of third-class citizens who are termed as \'Norma\'.Now, these \'Norma\', or as luck might have it, sounds similar to the word \'Normal\'; and are just normal people, in that they are essentially plebeians like us people here in the real world. Meaning, they can\'t use magic. They are the minority and are thus prosecuted for some sort of obscure reasons, and are the stigma of humankind\'s evolution (Not our humankind, but the \'Cross Ange\' mankind).As this anime was produced by Sunrise, you should expect the obvious trademarks and troupes generic to everything they produce; like strife between a bunch of factions because reasons deem them necessary. You\'ll also see island episodes, romance, beautiful filial bonds and the long-awaited revival of Kira \'Jesus\' Yamato. (Not that you can ever kill him)The main character whose name was something along the lines of \'MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi,\' is forced to join a ragtag group of girls and fight against dragon-esque creatures, which happen to be called DRAGONs because convoluted acronyms sound cool.I realize I\'ve digressed, but I\'ll get to my main point eventually.In terms of characters, there are a bunch of girls to choose from if you\'re looking to find a new waifu. For example, early on in the story, you see two girls who try to make friends with MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi, otherwise known as \'Ange\'. These two girls are waifu material in that, they make friends with Ange despite her contempt for them. Not only that, they are definitely crucial to the story since they have hair that is feasible for real-life people and don\'t appear in the opening at all. You\'ve even got your pick of the litter with girls like Ange\'s friend no. 1 to 50. Top class waifu material if I do say so myself.At any rate, just know that anybody who isn\'t a Norma is basically a bad person. As for the, rejects of society, they\'re all either full-blown lesbians or are bi-curious. If you\'re looking for a male relationship, then you\'re in awful luck, since there\'s only three male characters around. The most notable of which is pseudo-RitoKira. As you might expect of anyone who bears resemblance to either of them, he is capable of fixing strange machinery like Gunda- oops, I mean \'Para-Mail\'. He is not only capable of being beaten up, but is also capable of living despite having a magnet embedded to his face which attracts him to Ange\'s crotch.I have nothing much to say about Ange, other than the fact that she seems too good for the show. She\'s a very likable person for me, but she does seem to suffer from a chronic case of \'falls-in-love-with-king-of-NTR\'. At one point, I even worried that he\'d steal her position as main character. Luckily, he\'s as useless as any other harem protagonist. Not in an endearing way though.I\'ve been ranting too long, so I\'ll  be brief about my main complaint. The plot. The plot started off simple, and I even considered it pretty decent at one point in time, but it breaks records in my book as the biggest piece of \'what the hell is this? I dont even...\'. The plot jumps around so much that it seems to suffers from DID in trying to be so many things a la Samurai Flamenco.Not only that, I even question what the hell went through the staff of Sunrise\'s minds when they decided on the premise of Dragons from the Nth dimension fighting robots piloted by the girls of Freezing. Whoever they were, I commend them for absolutely ruining what little remains of my good faith in Sunrise. I\'m sure all two of them had fun self-inserting themselves in Tusk\'s place as he smothered himself in Ange\'s panties to death.So in conclusion; if I\'m asked (not that anybody would ask me) if this anime is worth watching.I\'d tell them \'sure, go ahead if you\'re a fan of kinky stuff\'If you ask whether it\'s dark.Sadly the only thing dark here in this anime are the minds of its director, the lighting and the girls panties (in that case, it\'s be white censorship).Fret not though, since Sunrise will always find a way to shine the morning light of their company on all that darkness through the entity of BD, and Ange\'s glare-inducing coloured hair.Good job Sunrise!Don\'t give up Sunrise!Goodwork Sunrise!Learn to CG Sunrise! (Computer Graphics, not Code Geass)Farewell Sunrise.May you never produce anything better than Code Geass.Curse you Sunrise!Note that I\'m making fun of them not out of spite, but because they\'re dear to me.It\'s also for the sake of their own betterment. See, I\'m not rude. I\'m just Tsundere!Aren\'t I just a great person? (I know I\'m not, but just let me revel in my fantasies)I\'ll rewrite or edit this review when I have the time.I have a lot more to say, but I\'ll do that another time if need be.Note that I haven\'t finished the series yet, so I may change my opinion. yes, then please read on for this review of a journey filled with much oppai, BDSM, mechas, and made-up words galore!Do note that I\'m an offensive person by nature, so I do apologise for anything further aheadIf I had to describe \'Cross Ange\' in one single word; I\'d have to choose the phrase \'Identity Disorder\'.

As for the, rejects of society, they\'re all either full-blown lesbians or are bi-curious. If you\'re looking for a male relationship, then you\'re in awful luck, since there\'s only three male characters around. The most notable of which is pseudo-RitoKira. As you might expect of anyone who bears resemblance to either of them, he is capable of fixing strange machinery like Gunda- oops, I mean \'Para-Mail\'. He is not only capable of being beaten up, but is also capable of living despite having a magnet embedded to his face which attracts him to Ange\'s crotch.I have nothing much to say about Ange, other than the fact that she seems too good for the show. She\'s a very likable person for me, but she does seem to suffer from a chronic case of \'falls-in-love-with-king-of-NTR\'. At one point, I even worried that he\'d steal her position as main character. Luckily, he\'s as useless as any other harem protagonist. Not in an endearing way though.I\'ve been ranting too long, so I\'ll  be brief about my main complaint. The plot. The plot started off simple, and I even considered it pretty decent at one point in time, but it breaks records in my book as the biggest piece of \'what the hell is this? I dont even...\'. The plot jumps around so much that it seems to suffers from DID in trying to be so many things a la Samurai Flamenco.Not only that, I even question what the hell went through the staff of Sunrise\'s minds when they decided on the premise of Dragons from the Nth dimension fighting robots piloted by the girls of Freezing. Whoever they were, I commend them for absolutely ruining what little remains of my good faith in Sunrise. I\'m sure all two of them had fun self-inserting themselves in Tusk\'s place as he smothered himself in Ange\'s panties to death.So in conclusion; if I\'m asked (not that anybody would ask me) if this anime is worth watching.I\'d tell them \'sure, go ahead if you\'re a fan of kinky stuff\'If you ask whether it\'s dark.Sadly the only thing dark here in this anime are the minds of its director, the lighting and the girls panties (in that case, it\'s be white censorship).Fret not though, since Sunrise will always find a way to shine the morning light of their company on all that darkness through the entity of BD, and Ange\'s glare-inducing coloured hair.Good job Sunrise!Don\'t give up Sunrise!Goodwork Sunrise!Learn to CG Sunrise! (Computer Graphics, not Code Geass)Farewell Sunrise.May you never produce anything better than Code Geass.Curse you Sunrise!Note that I\'m making fun of them not out of spite, but because they\'re dear to me.It\'s also for the sake of their own betterment. See, I\'m not rude. I\'m just Tsundere!Aren\'t I just a great person? (I know I\'m not, but just let me revel in my fantasies)I\'ll rewrite or edit this review when I have the time.I have a lot more to say, but I\'ll do that another time if need be.Note that I haven\'t finished the series yet, so I may change my opinion.', 'Simply put, Cross Ange is a masterpiece in my eyes. Many will say ""But Ruggarell, just HOW? CROSS ANGE? MASTERPIECE? WHAT?"". Let me explain.Before Cross Ange aired last year, I saw it on the upcoming list of Anime that was coming out in the fall and being a fan of Ecchi it seemed like it would have a decent amount, so I gave it a go. I thought that I would have most likely would have dropped it anyway if the Ecchi segments weren\'t strong, but boy I got something entirely different. From the first 15 minutes of the Anime, it was blowing my mind....The world that Cross Ange was set in was not indeed an equal or fair one.The 1st episode of Cross Ange made or broke the entire show for a lot of people but I was one of the few ones who kept going because of how exciting it was. Ange, the Main character, was the daughter of a very wealthy family and pretty much lived a comfortable lifestyle you see. Most of the world used magic as an everyday thing. Those who couldn\'t were seen as outsiders and thus rejected from society in very unpleasant ways that you will have to watch to find out. Ange, the MC was accused of being an outsider for not being able to use magic(Called normas), and thus sent to a prison.The 1st episode of Cross Ange was so well executed and so well made that I never missed a single week of the Anime. Each week had me on the edge of my seat waiting for something insane to happen and oh boy it did each and every week. You will have to watch for yourself. The character personalities are just so good and diverse that you will end up loving(or hating) many characters. The story is just so well paced that I couldn\'t possibly find anything wrong at all.If I were to write a list of every Anime that aired in 2014-2015 and someone asked me which one I loved the most, it would be Cross Ange. It\'s an Anime I will love forever because of how each episode was so well made. The story never let up at all. The director and writers always wanted you to be scared of what will happen next. It also had some dark humor in between as well that reminded you of the world that Ange lived in. Along the way she meets very crazy characters as well.I honestly wish that I could watch Cross Ange all over again for the first time because of how insane it is.  You might possibly cry and become depressed because there aren\'t anymore episodes to enjoy. I know I did. I loved the characters that much.Thank you Sunrise thank you so so much for yet another masterpiece. Here is hoping for a Cross Ange 2.

Here is hoping for a Cross Ange 2.', 'I wrote this (as a joke) when I was on 500mg of caffeine during a study session break. Oh yeah, it spoils the whole thing but that doesn\'t really matter with this show. This is for those who are rewatching and want a deeper understanding of this masterpiece.Fan service in Cross Ange is integral part of the plot. (for those who don’t know, fan service means naked girls, and the plot of the show is that Princess Ange is sent to prison because she can’t use magic and is viewed as hated by God) Yes, there is a graphic rape scene in the first...episode. Yes, there is prison lesbianism. Yes, there is a beach episode where the characters have to use their breasts to transport eggs (which break) to win credits for food. Yes, there is a sports episode between the rival main characters where they bet the fate of the world on who is better at golf, tennis and baseball. Yes, the main male character repeatedly trips over and ends up with his mouth on Angie\'s crotch. Yes, there is a flying submarine. Yes, the villain, who is literally God, spanks his lieutenants for disobedience. Yes, the dragons use the main male character\'s semen (Tusk) to breed more dragons. Yes, God makes Angie strip naked and uses his powers to make her orgasm involuntarily. Nevertheless, if you can get past all of that, you will see that Cross Ange is a scathing critique of the Old Testament and Trinitarianism on the level of ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"", ""Candide, Ou L\'Optimisme"" and ""Le Myth de Sisyphe"".The anime can be divided into two parts, the first concerns the inherent corruption of man, no matter his situation in life. In the futuristic paradise, religious beliefs and non-conformity are used to justify barbarism, while in the hellish prison, the inmates who have internalized these beliefs, torment each other because of hunger, loneliness and their constant fear of death. What you think of as ""fan service"" is intended to emphasize Angie\'s loss of status. The rape scene is the culmination of her fall from grace and expulsion from Eden. Her skimpy outfit is symbolic of the spiritual death that she has experienced. While in prison, Angie and her ""co-workers"" who are tasked with killing dragons for as of yet unexplained reasons, do not get along, to put it lightly. Angie\'s refusal to accept her loss of privilege results in the death of a 12-year old loli. She and the other inmates experience rejection, grief, jealousy, unrequited love, vindictiveness and ultimately vindication. Over time, Angie comes to accept her new station in life, and literally ""creates her own Garden"" (see, Candide). She convinces the other inmates to stop hunting dragons. This troubles the humans of the world, as their leaders understand that the dragons\' life force is necessary to allow their paradise to function. They decide to destroy the false paradise the ""normies"" have created to ensure their own will survive. God is forced to intervene to prevent the collapse of the world.At this point, the anime becomes concerned with the inherent corruption of God and the question of the necessity of Christ. The paradise He creates (and has created many times before), is always flawed. In this iteration, Angie, a ""normie"" who cannot use ""magic"", is seen as an error in His creation by its inhabitants. Despite being ""omnipotent"", every paradise He creates cannot escape the existence of a hell. Generally, the Christian God is thought to have three properties that make him different than man. Omnipotence, omniscience and omnibenevolence. God cannot be omnipotent if every world he creates is flawed, he cannot be omniscient if he has to use experimentation to create a perfect world and he cannot be omnibenevolent if he is willing to create worlds in which suffering and Hell exist (""Is this the best of all worlds?"" (see, Candide, Voltaire and Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, Leibnitz). Cross Ange answers the problem of the existence of evil by placing it squarely on God\'s shoulders. Angie, aware of the impending invasion, initially refuses to accept her fate and escapes to another Eden populated by a lone man, Tusk. She lives there for a while but remains clothed and ashamed of her sexuality (cf. Genesis 1:25). Ultimately, understanding the necessity of her sacrifice (see, The Last Temptation of Christ, Kazantakis, 1955), she accepts her role and returns to the mainland to be executed. Here she faces the hatred of the mob, including her former friends who throw mud at her (cf. Matthew 27: 29-31) and she is scourged (John, 19:1). Unlike Christ however, Angie decides not to sacrifice herself for the sake of such a corrupt world and escapes by means of a divine song. While this may sound strange, music and song have been considered magical by humanity as long as religion has existed (see The Cultural Functions of Music, David, Hans, U. Penn Press). The robot suits used to fight the dragons can only reach their full potential when specific songs are sung. Even God must sing to either create or destroy the world, indicating that either music predates Him or is co-eternal with him (cf. John 1: 1-2).At the height of her Nihilism, Ange contemplates suicide and the meaning of her existence. She is only stopped when Tusk appears, and she becomes aware of the depths of her love for him and her fellow inmates. She accepts that there is no intrinsic meaning in the universe but by embracing those close to her she can create her own meaning in the world, however absurd it may be. Unlike Adam and Eve who are cast out of the Garden into the wilderness. Ange and Tusk go willingly and defiantly.During the climax, God overpowers Ange and attempts to rape her, but is prevented when she begins to sing a song which the entire world can hear. Her allies are able to locate her and come to her aid. During the final swordfight God is handily defeating Tusk, until he reveals that Ange is no longer a virgin. God, shocked that he has been cucked lets his guard down (see, Galatians 5:20) and is killed by a magic sword (cf. The Spear of Destiny).After killing God, the heroes find their own meaning in life and open a coffee shop in the land of the dragons and the remaining humans struggle to exist in their former paradise.The true brilliance of Cross Ange is finally revealed when you realize that it has a trilinear plot. First, there is the narrative, which is entertaining enough as it is, who doesn\'t love lesbians piloting giant robots fighting dragons. Second, as explained earlier, is its allegorical message derived from a pastiche of biblical and literary references that only the Japanese could come up with. And lastly by combining those references with tits and polyamory, it transcends being an allegorical commentary on the relationship between God and man and the eternal search for meaning and offers a contemporary critique of the current state of the anime industry, mocking those who praise NGE and FMA as brilliant works of art just because they contain inscrutable references whiles also lamenting that modern anime requires fan service, without which no merchandise could be sold.Take note that this anime was produced by Sunrise which made Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass and Gundam. This is not an amateur work, they know exactly what they are doing. Cross Ange is the combination of their rage against modern fan service and their contempt for byzantine plotlines.I hope this changes your opinion of Cross Ange and that you see that fan service can be used to elevate anime into true existential art on par with Crime and Punishment, L\'étranger or even the greatest book of all time, the God Delusion.(As an aside, even fan service such as the spanking of Salia by God and the ever present lesbianism are references to Proverbs 13:24 (He that spareth the rod hateth his son) and Ezekiel 16:22,58, Ezekiel 22:11, Ezekiel 33:26 (illicit sex is an abomination), but in the interest of concision and brevity I will leave a further exploration of this work for another time. ) episode.

Development was overall fantastic."", 'This show is so horrible I am visibly impressed. Every other reviewer will have commented on the synopsis (or you may have wondered here due to the debate surrounding this show), so I\'ll skip straight to judgement.Sex, Nudity and the like.Unlike most other reviewers who rated this show horribly, I do not have (many) problems with the portrayal of nudity, yuri elements and rape in this show. The first episode isn\'t the problem, it is the structure, backbone and texture of the show which got to me. Also, blatant nudity and/or rape scenes do NOT make a show edgy. Read Punpun if you want...a realistic portrayal of the consequences of abuse. The show sits firmly in the harem/yuri/man-child fantasy genre, and while this does not excuse its portrayal of women, it is reality in anime.Character Development.Tl:dr for everything below: don\'t bother watching this anime for character development, unless you think Guilty Crown was deep. In which case, watch, and ignore this review. You would miss the point I am trying to make and then flame me anyway.Ange as a character is often praised for having mature and realistic plot development. Her character is viewed as a strong female protagonist, and therein lies the problem. Firstly, I find issue with her character growth. Ange changes from a bigoted, ignorant princess to a tough, independent warrior in the space of six episodes. Throughout the rest of the series, she remains said tough, independent warrior. How in the world is this mature character development? Realistic character development occurs when a character changes so slowly you do not realize the character changed at all. Realistic development is when (spoiler alert for HxH) Gon snaps, and you suddenly realize that Gon\'s fearlessness and conviction is horrible, not heroic. You will then scroll back to the first episodes of Hunter X Hunter, wondering how this cheerful boy snapped, and you see that the author has been building up Gon\'s view of the world as black and white since the first episodes. You see the ways Gon ignores advice and is constantly convinced he\'s right. He\'s so charismatic that you (and Killua) forgets that Gon is a naive 10 year old boy who will be wrong at some point. Then the understanding dawns on you that Gon (and you) have been taught a lesson in how to behave in the world. (End spoiler for HxH). This does not happen in Cross Ange. How has Ange\'s character deepened throughout the series? She learns humility. She learns that the world is a horrible place. She learns to make decisions for herself. These messages are explicitly thrown at us, with characters saying them outright, repeating themselves over and over. Ange is shallow enough of a character that you can\'t portray depth in her, hence the need for the show hammering ""Look! Ange is now developing (insert moral strength here)!"" repeatedly into our brains. So Ange learns humility. Now what? What does she do with it? How is this newly found humility reconciled with her previous arrogance? ( hint: she\'s still arrogant, only now her arrogance is directed toward the \'evil royal sibling\', so it is all okay). So she realizes that the world she knew and had control over is an illusion, easily shattered by a few words and a mana shield cast the the right time. How did she address her helplessness? She became a cold badass warrior (whines in pain as golden opportunity for complex development vanishes). Does she admit that the world is ultimately out of her control? No. Is the world out of her control? No, because she is the protagonist and has the power to change the \'system\'. It\'s certainly a fun trope to watch (remember Lelouch from Code Geass?), but it is hardly realistic.Secondly, the claim that she is a strong female protagonist irritates me. Why must a strong female protagonist be a gun-toting, independent sexy female? Why does her fighting her own battles makes her a stronger female character? This is coming from a feminist, so it will be hard to swallow. Skip on to the next paragraph for non-feminist criticism if you don\'t want to read this. Female protagonists are complicated. Make them into male protagonists with a female body and you have Ange. Make them too weak, and you have a non-existent character. Ange goes too far on the macho route. She is physically superior to most other characters in the show, despite being raised a princess. She is a textbook-tsundere, insulting people while (deep deep deep deep inside) sometimes caring for them. Remember Asuka from Neon Genesis? Ange is Asuka. But with more piloting skill and without the beautiful disintegration of the character near the end. She is the kind of female protagonist that makes me cringe whenever people name her as an example of a strong female character. As much as I wish female characters can be badass and invincible, having a strong female protagonist is more than toughness. It is understanding female limitations. It is realizing that we are fundamentally different from men, and embracing those differences. It is about portraying us as people, rather than as a sexualized, \'I will never cry\' masculine female. We see none of this in Ange.So Bad It\'s Good:I honestly think the author is making a parody with this. The humor and self depreciation that runs through the show makes it better than shows like Guilty Crown, which are inherently horrible AND take themselves altogether too seriously. The author frequently injects moments that keeps me watching until the end because I am half convinced that he/she is making fun of the audience. Take the last episode, for example. (spoiler alert) What self respecting show will have the female lead shout "" I won\'t let you have me, you lecherous man!"" while slicing apart the main villain? Also, the villain\'s main goal being \'I want beautiful independent women\' is so ridiculous I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout the second arc of the show. How about the younger sister going around with a whip? What the hell is happening? (End spoilers). If the anime had wanted edgy, they would have gone the Elfen Lied route, also known as \'killing puppies\' induced feels. It feels like the writers started writing this god awful script, and some drunk guy at a party decided to challenge the writers to put the most ridiculous things they could get away with into the script without alerting the audience to the game. Honestly, it is entertaining. But so are many many other anime without the horrible eechi and yuri elements.Complex Themes ( 1/10 i.e.: What themes? There were themes?!)Rather than rant about the complete lack of ""complex themes"" within this anime, I\'ll provide examples of other anime where they were executed properly, and you can judge for yourself how well this anime deals with themes.Rape to break the character\'s will: I\'ll give this one to Cross Ange, although honestly, the shock value trumps the emotional reward its resolution brings. I\'ve already elaborated on how horribly Ange grows as a character, and this scene is mainly so we feel sorry for the main character. Also you cannot bring in ""realism"" and then have crazy things happening. It does not work that way. The prefect way to communicate dread and agony through abuse is perfectly done in Punpun, not in this anime.Manipulation by powers that be/Discrimination: Watch Shinsekai Yori. That show does not need to use a well loved princess to prove that a certain race can be bred to hate another. You will viscerally feel the hate, I promise. Bonus: yuri scenes in Shinsekai, yay! Psycho pass can be another, though Shinsekai pulls it off better.Clear communication/need for understanding: This. Good lord. Neon Genesis Evangelion dedicates about 99% of the show to demonstrate that clear communication between actual human beings is impossible. Clear communication is impossible. That is a fact we have to work around, not emphasize that \' if we could all just talk to one another properly, it will be fine!\'. That is why relationships are messy and friends end up killing one another. Talking to one another will not solve the problem. Talking to one another while wielding giant robots definitely will not solve the problem. Stop telling me it would, baka anime!Conclusion:Warning, do not watch. You will waste about 13 hours of your life watching while clutching your head, and a further four hours typing up a review so you can forever expel the anime from your head. a realistic portrayal of the consequences of abuse. The show sits firmly in the harem/yuri/man-child fantasy genre, and while this does not excuse its portrayal of women, it is reality in anime.Character Development.Tl:dr for everything below: don\'t bother watching this anime for character development, unless you think Guilty Crown was deep.

How is this newly found humility reconciled with her previous arrogance? ( hint: she\'s still arrogant, only now her arrogance is directed toward the \'evil royal sibling\', so it is all okay). So she realizes that the world she knew and had control over is an illusion, easily shattered by a few words and a mana shield cast the the right time. How did she address her helplessness? She became a cold badass warrior (whines in pain as golden opportunity for complex development vanishes). Does she admit that the world is ultimately out of her control? No. Is the world out of her control? No, because she is the protagonist and has the power to change the \'system\'. It\'s certainly a fun trope to watch (remember Lelouch from Code Geass?), but it is hardly realistic.Secondly, the claim that she is a strong female protagonist irritates me. Why must a strong female protagonist be a gun-toting, independent sexy female? Why does her fighting her own battles makes her a stronger female character? This is coming from a feminist, so it will be hard to swallow. Skip on to the next paragraph for non-feminist criticism if you don\'t want to read this. Female protagonists are complicated. Make them into male protagonists with a female body and you have Ange. Make them too weak, and you have a non-existent character. Ange goes too far on the macho route. She is physically superior to most other characters in the show, despite being raised a princess. She is a textbook-tsundere, insulting people while (deep deep deep deep inside) sometimes caring for them. Remember Asuka from Neon Genesis? Ange is Asuka. But with more piloting skill and without the beautiful disintegration of the character near the end. She is the kind of female protagonist that makes me cringe whenever people name her as an example of a strong female character. As much as I wish female characters can be badass and invincible, having a strong female protagonist is more than toughness. It is understanding female limitations. It is realizing that we are fundamentally different from men, and embracing those differences. It is about portraying us as people, rather than as a sexualized, \'I will never cry\' masculine female. We see none of this in Ange.So Bad It\'s Good:I honestly think the author is making a parody with this. The humor and self depreciation that runs through the show makes it better than shows like Guilty Crown, which are inherently horrible AND take themselves altogether too seriously. The author frequently injects moments that keeps me watching until the end because I am half convinced that he/she is making fun of the audience. Take the last episode, for example. (spoiler alert) What self respecting show will have the female lead shout "" I won\'t let you have me, you lecherous man!"" while slicing apart the main villain? Also, the villain\'s main goal being \'I want beautiful independent women\' is so ridiculous I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout the second arc of the show. How about the younger sister going around with a whip? What the hell is happening? (End spoilers). If the anime had wanted edgy, they would have gone the Elfen Lied route, also known as \'killing puppies\' induced feels. It feels like the writers started writing this god awful script, and some drunk guy at a party decided to challenge the writers to put the most ridiculous things they could get away with into the script without alerting the audience to the game. Honestly, it is entertaining. But so are many many other anime without the horrible eechi and yuri elements.Complex Themes ( 1/10 i.e.: What themes? There were themes?!)Rather than rant about the complete lack of ""complex themes"" within this anime, I\'ll provide examples of other anime where they were executed properly, and you can judge for yourself how well this anime deals with themes.Rape to break the character\'s will: I\'ll give this one to Cross Ange, although honestly, the shock value trumps the emotional reward its resolution brings. I\'ve already elaborated on how horribly Ange grows as a character, and this scene is mainly so we feel sorry for the main character. Also you cannot bring in ""realism"" and then have crazy things happening. It does not work that way. The prefect way to communicate dread and agony through abuse is perfectly done in Punpun, not in this anime.Manipulation by powers that be/Discrimination: Watch Shinsekai Yori. That show does not need to use a well loved princess to prove that a certain race can be bred to hate another. You will viscerally feel the hate, I promise. Bonus: yuri scenes in Shinsekai, yay! Psycho pass can be another, though Shinsekai pulls it off better.Clear communication/need for understanding: This. Good lord. Neon Genesis Evangelion dedicates about 99% of the show to demonstrate that clear communication between actual human beings is impossible. Clear communication is impossible. That is a fact we have to work around, not emphasize that \' if we could all just talk to one another properly, it will be fine!\'. That is why relationships are messy and friends end up killing one another. Talking to one another will not solve the problem. Talking to one another while wielding giant robots definitely will not solve the problem. Stop telling me it would, baka anime!Conclusion:Warning, do not watch. You will waste about 13 hours of your life watching while clutching your head, and a further four hours typing up a review so you can forever expel the anime from your head.', 'I initially got into Cross Ange because of the fanservice and Yuri themes, episode one took me by surprise. It had me hating the main character and enjoying some of the negative things happening to her. However that feeling blew over and soon I started feeling bad for her and enjoying watching her grow, become stronger, and overtake the many obstacles she\'s had thrown at her. The show also started getting into some of the other main characters, letting a little focus off of Ange, this was also fantastic as the other characters (some you may find yourself hating at first) turn out to be...just as broken as Ange is. This story leads you on some really big emotional rollercoasters, I found myself crying at some scenes before laughing at the next and enjoy the entire experience throughout. This anime can be pretty confusing if you don\'t pay close attention to detail, but I found myself completely immersed in the story and loving all of the main Characters by the end. Which brings me to my next point, the final episode is very well done and leaves you feeling good. Even though the characters have suffered loss, have been broken down emotionally and physically, and have no doubt been changed, this ending gives you the feeling of ""all is right"" in the world. I\'ve always dreaded endings of anime\'s because I typically dislike how many of them leave unanswered questions, I typically like to see a ""wrap up"" episode that goes after the ""final battle"" or what-have-you just to leave you on a more warm note as you wrap up the story, but this anime does not need it because it does such a good job on its own over the last few episodes.This anime will easily hold one of my top 10 anime\'s spots for quite a long time and the main character Ange is now easily one of my all time favorite characters. Please give this anime a chance, if you enjoy some fan service paired with an amazing story and characters you\'ll fall in love with then this is a great choice! just as broken as Ange is.

Il try to go into detail as to explain what are the pros and cons of this show and maybe dwell why so many people either hate it or dislike it.The series is either a hit or a miss…it is a hit because it focuses a lot of how society functions especially towards the discrimination of others which are different and...how they threaten the stability and comfort they already have, as well as what it means to find your own since of individuality and since of moral towards around you, especially of the main heroine who developed from a spoiled, rotten and naive individual into a strong, intelligent, wise and caring leader.But it can also be a miss cause of the highly controversial subjects and the extremities of certain scenes as well plot holes and plot armour some of the characters get.I don’t know what happened at the studio that produced it but u can practically speculate there was a lot of confusion and divided opinion as to how this show was developed especially towards the beginning of the series.As a matter of fact if u compare the first 5 or so episodes to the rest of the series, it is like watching two different shows altogether.The Animation was fantastic at times, especially in the fight scenes but in others the animation looked sloppy and messed up, the soundtrack on the other hand was probably the best thing the show had and the singing of the actors was superb for the most part.The characters were the second best thing that the series had, as their development throughout the show was something good to see, especially the main heroine as well as few of the side characters, but they are not perfect as there were a few character flaws that were really obvious or just to cliché that sometimes it makes u want to cringe and while the main characters and a few of the side characters did get proper development others were not so lucky in that some of them just simply hid in the background and never got much to say or do at all.The Sec jokes and fan-service might appeal to those who like it and not so much for those who don’t especially since some of the fanservice and jokes were used were so overused and repetitive that it makes u sick to watch after a while.thankfully these things dropped as the series went on and were not as much frequent as they were in the beginning.At the end I would say this show is either a hit or a miss depending on what a person is actually expecting from this show. There is also that old saying that a show is so bad that it is good and this series would defiantly be a perfect example for that.Bottom line: as an enjoyment I would rate it an 8,,, however as a whole series taken into account actually story writing, plot development, animation and characters, flaws and derps I would rate this a 6.75… as this show really could have been done better…what made it enjoyable despite this was mostly that by the middle of the series the series actually starts to thrive and use it flaws to make it more fun to watch. how they threaten the stability and comfort they already have, as well as what it means to find your own since of individuality and since of moral towards around you, especially of the main heroine who developed from a spoiled, rotten and naive individual into a strong, intelligent, wise and caring leader.But it can also be a miss cause of the highly controversial subjects and the extremities of certain scenes as well plot holes and plot armour some of the characters get.I don’t know what happened at the studio that produced it but u can practically speculate there was a lot of confusion and divided opinion as to how this show was developed especially towards the beginning of the series.As a matter of fact if u compare the first 5 or so episodes to the rest of the series, it is like watching two different shows altogether.The Animation was fantastic at times, especially in the fight scenes but in others the animation looked sloppy and messed up, the soundtrack on the other hand was probably the best thing the show had and the singing of the actors was superb for the most part.The characters were the second best thing that the series had, as their development throughout the show was something good to see, especially the main heroine as well as few of the side characters, but they are not perfect as there were a few character flaws that were really obvious or just to cliché that sometimes it makes u want to cringe and while the main characters and a few of the side characters did get proper development others were not so lucky in that some of them just simply hid in the background and never got much to say or do at all.The Sec jokes and fan-service might appeal to those who like it and not so much for those who don’t especially since some of the fanservice and jokes were used were so overused and repetitive that it makes u sick to watch after a while.thankfully these things dropped as the series went on and were not as much frequent as they were in the beginning.At the end I would say this show is either a hit or a miss depending on what a person is actually expecting from this show.

That was a big mistake because every single episode was outstanding and always i wanted to see the next one. If i could watch the whole series in a day i would definitely do it. This anime is the absolute ecchi,mecha, sci-fi experience which every fan of this genres would enjoy it the most but let\'s be more specificStory: well the main character of this anime is a teenage girl named Angelise. She lives in a world that lives by using ""mana""Everything is only controlable by this kind of magic. But some girls can\'t use...it and they are known by society as ""Norma"". They are hated by everyone and all calls them monsters. (Anyway it\'s not bad to be different but it\'s something extra ordinary) The police which caught these girls sent them to a secret location known to the 5% of the humaniy as Arzenal. These girls are sentenced to spent their life there and fight the D.R.A.G.O.N.s as they called in some kind of planes-spaceships-unifomsArt: The art i can say that it\'s absolutely stunning. Everything is well animated and fascinatingCharacters: hmm the characters are at a 98% girls and each of her has her own interesting storySound: the sound is the best part of this series with Nana Mizuki singing the opening will keep your ears pleased in every single secondEnjoyment : well I\'m not a mecha-science-fiction anime fan but i can say that i really enjoyed this anime series. Do not let the ecchi scenes take you away from the main plot. Of course it will have ecchi scenes cause it\'s based to a group of girls. If you are interested to something new and awesome you will definitely love this anime and i believe it deserves a 1000+ ranking (but that\'s only my opinion it and they are known by society as ""Norma"".

This is my very first review so I hope it being long doesn\'t bother you guys too much but I\'ll try my best to explain each category and why I absoutely loved this show. I\'m not really into mecha, but ironically Code Geass is one of my favorite shows of all time. A few days ago, I stumbled upon Cross Ange and the first thing that caught me was the female lead, no not in a sexual way, what I meant was it\'s refreshing to see a main female lead, especially in action shows. So I decided to watch (binge watched the whole...day for maximum experience) without really expecting anything, and by the time the show was finished, I just had to write a review.Now onto the review...Story: Not the most original concept of stories but the way the plot revolved around its own universe was really thrilling. The world revolved around magic called ""Mana"" and people who can\'t use it are discriminated. That\'s story revolves around Ange, our blonde main female lead, who is the First Princess of her own country and how she copes with the world they are in.Art: Well, nothing is really special about the art, but it does look great although the quality of the animation isn\'t very consistent. One thing that\'s very obivous is the CGI for this show, especially the mecha animations which honestly isn\'t the best looking, but then it\'s not just about the mechas, it\'s more on the story that drove me to look past it.Sound: Why an 8? The OP is amazing, it\'s upbeat and thrilling to hear, fitting for an action anime  and is sung by Nana Mizuki, also the VA for Ange. Cross Ange has a lot of quality VAs, and I\'m not gonna list each and everyone of them, but what captivated me the most are the songs sung by our quality VAs like Yui Horie and Nana Mizuki. The show DOES use singing during the action scenes but you\'ll understand if you watch why. The EDs were pretty forgettable though.Character: Oh boy, I don\'t know whether to hate or love the characters but, mainly Ange\'s  team or ""harem"" as people like to call it. Ange, the main character, has one of the most amazing developments in any anime I have ever seen and her character was consistent to the very end. She starts out as a bitchy, arrogant princess but she slowly turns into one very fitting of a \'hero\'. The supporting charscters are what baffled me because some of them do have great development, like Hilda, I swear she is easily  one of the best characters out of the show or any anime at least. However the other characters pretty much zigzagged throughout the show. Like their traits, motives are unexplained and such. But still that\'s just a minor problem that does not really bother the show unless you like nitpicking.Enjoyment: Not gonna lie here, this show is one of my favorite shows of all time, and one of the reasons why I enjoyed it is the fanservice. Yes, this show has fanservice dating back even to the very first one. I know this show isn\'t very well received and a lot have dropped it in 2 episodes only since they saw how shameless the fanservice was or what a ""trainwreck"" this will be, however, I was not deterred by the early fanservice, and I loved the yuri antics throughout, yes YURI. So, why is fanservice a good factor for the enjoyment? Because it\'s shameless! It doesn\'t hide this or that and isn\'t afraid to show scenes happening and we all know half-assed fanservice is very annoying. But the fanservice alone isn\'t the only thing that captivated me, the way the story presented all throughout, the hardships of Ange and her team to the very end is what made this show memorable and lovable.Overall: Every show has its flaws and Cross Ange is no different, but of course nothing is perfect. This show easily gets a 9 because it knows what it is and it doesn\'t hide that fact. If you enjoy a good story with great character interaction with fanservice thrown here and there, then you\'re in for a thrilling ride. If you are one of those people that tend to nitpick each and every small detail of flaws or mistake and expect a lot, then don\'t bother.

However, I do highly suggest you give this show a chance.', 'This is my second review, after I\'ve watched the last episode, I will say everything fairly with reasons for my views. Cross Ange is one of those anime that \'HAD\' potential to be a mind-breaker but the staff didn\'t realize that and ruined it with ecchi moments, unnecessary romance,etc.. Here\'s why:Plot/Story (10): The plot is the best part of the series. Once you\'ve passed through the first 6-7 episodes, the show starts revealing the history. I know you might feel that the first few episodes were disappointing, but \'I\' think they just meant to make you understand each character properly. For example, Hilda\'s character is...meant to be that bully that shows you how the \'New-comer\' isn\'t accepted by all. Every episode revealed bits and pieces of story, You never find out anything until just the perfect moment and you\'re left amazed. In other words, it adopted a great way of presenting the story. Yes, the first 6 episodes or so, are a bit disappointing but trust me, it gets better and better until your mind explodes. I can take in whatever the first 6 episodes offer without much problem.Characters (9): Voice Acting is an important factor for any character. The Voice Acting is here, is as beautiful as needed, you can feel their emotions just like other great anime. The characters are represented nicely, for example ""Hilda"" being the bully at first who turns her friend. Chris is the \'left-out\' type, Jill is the smart commander that always know what to do. Salia feels herself left out too while Vivian is simply ""I\'m cool no matter what"" type. You may find Ange to be a bit aggressive, but that is no legit reason to rate it badly, it\'s part of the story and the anime shouldn\'t be rated bad considering the behavior of a character. Now for the bad part: The lesbian content in the anime is too high, some people find it unbearable. Of course, I have no problem \'ignoring\' it, but that isn\'t the case with everyone. So this is the point where I deduct a point from my rating.  I did find that ecchi scenes completely unnecessary. If you take out those parts you are left with a perfect masterpiece that deserves 10/10, but unfortunately as the staff tried to push that \'stuff\' into the show, it damaged the anime badly. Ange, the main character, was a princess once. She treated Norma like they\'re not humans. In other words, she hated them just like every other \'human\'. I find this great that in a SINGLE day, she is converted from a pampered Princess into her worst nightmare, it happens all of a sudden. Everything was normal in the morning and at the same night, she had lost her mother, father, her identity, her freedom and everything else. Ange finds herself in despair, not accepting the fact that she\'s a Norma, the same \'creatures\' that she found pathetic once, and always disobeys her orders. As time passes by, she starts accepting the fact and loses herself completely, knowing that it\'s all blood shedding in her life until she dies. Then she meets Tusk, who gives her hope of \'humanity\' among Normas, however, she still wants to escape. When she escapes, she finds out that every \'human\' including her remaining family members want her dead. She realized that the humans are not actually humans, she then develops a friendly relation with other Normas, determined to destroy the Human world. He then develops a deep relation with Tusk and there you go, till you reach the final episodes, Ange is transformed from a Princess to a Killing tool and then to a caring and daring, bold girl.Artwork (9): To me, the artwork looks at its best. It\'s not perfect of course, but it\'s as good as required. I never saw any flaw in the main characters, I can allow a little relaxation in the background or supporting characters. The mechas(robots) are nicely polished (Pun not intended), and the colors are also beautiful. Yes, the dressing and the uniforms may be somewhat pushing the show towards sexual stuff, but overall, they\'re not always pushing you into that.Soundtrack (10): I wouldn\'t be surprised to see great soundtrack supporting the great plot. The music is amazing. As a vital part of the story, they have inserted those ""Endless songs""(It has alternate names) that provoke a sense of excitement every time you hear one. The Opening and Ending songs are nothing below amazing. Trust me when I say this, you have to get the OST for this.Enjoyment (10): There was too much hype, at least for me when I was just near the end of an episode. They always left you on a cliff-hanger and that made the next episode even more interesting. I do like many other anime, but this anime, for some reason gave me the most excitement and enjoyment. You just couldn\'t wait a whole week for the next episode.Conclusion (10/10): There\'s something I\'d like to mention here: I think I\'m not the only one who rates many shows 8+. I think the reason behind it is that we bring all our emotions into it. When I hear the ending song of Cross Ange and all those characters pass by, I can\'t help but think about their dark past and their hard times. I think everyone needs to bring some feelings into such anime. Please, don\'t always expect action. Try to connect the personality of each character with your emotions. I\'m sure it will help you a lot to love all that you\'ve ever hated. Overall, the ONLY thing that I found ""BAD"" in the anime was the insertion of ecchi scenes/ lesbian romance or whatever you call it, into a mecha based anime. It left a bad impact on people otherwise I\'m ready to bet on the fact that if the haters ignore these facts, they will rate the series 8+ for everything else it has to offers. Even the show itself, after it comes out of the \'6\' episodes, makes you realize that while there will still be a few ecchi moments, that isn\'t the sole thing it has to offer. Otherwise, Everything else is great. I rate it 9/10 for such an amazing work. I expect another season if they can manage without more nudity and lesbian scenes... Thank you for reading this far! meant to be that bully that shows you how the \'New-comer\' isn\'t accepted by all.

You just couldn\'t wait a whole week for the next episode.Conclusion (10/10): There\'s something I\'d like to mention here: I think I\'m not the only one who rates many shows 8+. I think the reason behind it is that we bring all our emotions into it. When I hear the ending song of Cross Ange and all those characters pass by, I can\'t help but think about their dark past and their hard times. I think everyone needs to bring some feelings into such anime. Please, don\'t always expect action. Try to connect the personality of each character with your emotions. I\'m sure it will help you a lot to love all that you\'ve ever hated. Overall, the ONLY thing that I found ""BAD"" in the anime was the insertion of ecchi scenes/ lesbian romance or whatever you call it, into a mecha based anime. It left a bad impact on people otherwise I\'m ready to bet on the fact that if the haters ignore these facts, they will rate the series 8+ for everything else it has to offers. Even the show itself, after it comes out of the \'6\' episodes, makes you realize that while there will still be a few ecchi moments, that isn\'t the sole thing it has to offer. Otherwise, Everything else is great. I rate it 9/10 for such an amazing work. I expect another season if they can manage without more nudity and lesbian scenes... Thank you for reading this far!', ""It’s hard to describe shows like Cross Ange. A serious show you shouldn’t take too serious, an emotional comedy, or an action filled drama. Whatever genre you want to put it in, it can most likely fit; however, it will also contain elements of exactly the opposite genre. This is to say that I can’t pin Cross Ange down with a spoiler free summary other than hot girls fly mecha’s to fight dragons. Now yes, that is an appealing description in my eyes, but the show has much more to offer.There’s a lot I liked about this series, and a few minor things I didn’t....The story wasn’t always coherent but it was consistently entertaining. Characters were unique and have personalities that are easy to sympathize with. The design never felt off or cheap, and though I’m sure cgi was used, it was never extremely apparent...that is to say, the animation was done well. And last is the music. The soundtrack was one of my favorite aspects of the series, it really brought the scenes together…I just wish it had an available OST.What makes this series unique is its take on society. Going in, Cross Ange looked similar to Evangelion or Darling in the Franxx, but with scantily clad women. They are alike in how they approach different characters of various status’ in society (aka Norma’s vs Humans), but that's about it. In this world, there are 3 groups in which the population is separated (as referenced by the dragon folk): true humans, Norma’s, and fake humans - True humans are from the dragon world, Humans are people that can use mana, and Norma's cannot use mana. For some reason, Norma’s aren’t looked at as actual human beings in the eyes of the Mana Users of normal society, but they literally are one in the same aside from their abilities. This divide is where the backstory begins and is the start of the series’ general plot, I’ll take a deeper look into Ange’s journey later since she is the main focus. The story is basically about a Princess (turned commoner), living in a corrupt society that persecutes Norma's. There's also some dragon warfare and time/space theory sprinkled in. It’s the rift between the privileged and the Normas that created the current regime of Misurugi, the city that is the series' starting location. Eventually, we are taken to an island where Norma’s are sent to live out the rest of their lives in obscurity and are forced into fighting dragons.The reason this series is able to convey it's story so well is the wonderful cast of characters. Most of them bring depth, making every event feel more real and personable. To be honest, I didn't expect a series like this to have much to say, but after finishing it I couldn't have been more wrong. Most of the protagonists are like-able to a degree, but the best character in my opinion is none other than our star… Lady Angelise (or Ange), Princess of Misurugi. Ange is not an easy character to describe with a single personality trait, mostly because of the endless trials she's forced to endure. When faced with the challenges and loss that Ange eventually goes through, it's easier to understand why she behaves the way she does. Fortunately her good nature remains whether it's apparent or not. Right at the start, we see Ange's underlying kind soul and noble intentions, with how graceful she handles her loss at, what appears to be, lacrosse but with hover vehicles. It's not 5 minutes after though that we're exposed to her villainous side, as she talks down to an innocent child just for being a Norma, which again is just a human without mana abilities. The child is eventually taken away from the mother to presumably be eradicated, and of course there is no empathy from Princess Ange during all of this (quite the opposite in fact). I struggled to understand what the problem was with Norma’s, considering their only flaw is not being able to manipulate mana. This is the point though. The show makes it clear that this society's beliefs are meant to sound ridiculous, especially applied to an innocent child.In a poetic twist of fate, Ange is soon after exposed as a Norma herself and gets shipped off to live out her days on an island to fight dragons.\xa0It’s at the island of misfit Norma’s that Ange’s true personality comes forth. At the start, she’s grieving for her father, mother, and siblings that she lost. The shift from castle to isolated military reserve has also been especially hard on her. But above everything else, it seems she’s having the hardest time accepting the fact that she’s a Norma, which is understandable considering she vilified other Norma’s her entire life. It takes several episodes for her to grasp her new reality, which was drawn out a little long, but I suppose it does show her as having more conviction than hypocrisy. It’s not until later in the series, where we see how the regular humans respond to Norma’s that we fully understand why Ange struggled so much accepting this fact. Ange has such a varied and unpredictable arc. At times it may seem the show is going one way, but ends up veering into something else entirely. Even though Ange has her moments where we think she’s opening up to her teammates and maid that eventually shows up, she never fully parts with her aggressive nature. Even with Tusk, the man she eventually falls in love with, she’s still slightly closed off, but that’s what makes her vulnerable moments so much more endearing. I don’t want to speak too much on just Ange, but the show is named after her after all, and for good reason considering the range of qualities and capabilities she has. As a fighter, she’s brash and quick to act. As a friend, she can be selfish but inevitably will risk it all to protect them. As an opponent, good luck getting any sympathy...just ask the dragons. And as a lover, she lets go of her inhibitions to let her thoughts be known, and it’s her relationship with Tusk that makes the romance side of the series so great. Overall, during her arc, Ange learns the value of life and treasures the ones closest to her. She also learns to let go, which seemed to be her biggest hurdle considering the airtime given to her lack of self-awareness. All of this enables her to move forward without looking back at her old life.As the story progresses, much is revealed as to the inner workings of society and the true nature of Mana, the energy used by Misurugians to harness telekinesis like abilities. I won’t go through all of the plot here considering each episode has a new revelation of sorts, it would take much too long to go through individually. When Ange is advised that her sister is captured and will be executed by her brother, she of course escapes the island and breaks into the castle to try and rescue her. During this, we see Hildegard Schlievogt (Ange’s longtime enemy of sorts that fights in Group 1/A with her) find her mom that she was taken from. It’s a powerful moment that is the first instance in which we see just how deep the prejudice toward Norma’s are, and how heavy a burden it is to be one. It was heartbreaking to see “Hilde” not only get shut out of her previous life completely by her family, but also get battered by the local police.The episode moves back to focus on Ange, where it’s revealed her sister entrapped her at her brother’s behest, and tries to kill her with a knife! The scene cuts to the gallows where Ange will soon be hanged for the crime of not having mana abilities…but first she’s publicly whipped by her sister as punishment. I absolutely abhor Ange’s previous friends and family from this scene on, as if I already didn’t hate them. So many crimes are falsely attributed to Ange by said “friends and family”, I suppose because they are too blind to see their own misdeeds.  Ange is stripped to a single cloth and forced to face a seething crowd eager to put all of their frustrations on her. It’s almost comical how wrong and evil the citizens of Misurugi are. I thought the show would present at least one redeeming moment for the time spent in the capital, but it was just one evil person after another. I can’t describe just how despicable these people are, the series definitely does a good job of getting us to hate the entire nation and current Earth. It’s just as good though since Ange leaves her Earth to join the dragons, leaving the current leaderless Earth and Empire without mana in a state of war/hostility. It was that much more gratifying seeing the evil sister struggle for survival in the short clip at the end.Once the character Embryo is revealed to us, the story takes on a much darker setting, and more is revealed about the mechs that most the main characters pilot/drive. I’m not sure what Embryo’s technical role is other than a his false guidance of society, but it’s clear his powers are otherworldly and his mission is not a simple one. Embryo is another example of how drastically the story and plot can change. We go from an action mech battle to a psychological thriller in a matter of minutes. He eventually gains an obsession with Ange and kidnaps her in order to convert her. Her time with him are the darkest moments of the series, although it almost seems like the torture scenes were put in for fan service...assuming you’re into that sort of thing. It was tragic for me though. Embryo uses a mind control ability to make Ange cave to his will. One technique being the power of pleasure, pain, and any other human feeling. The scene where he sits watching as she endures the forced pleasure/pain was intense and is one of the most sinister abilities I’ve ever seen in an anime, but it succeeded in raising the stakes of the series and providing an element of anxiety. As dark as these scenes were, they most certainly raise the bar of quality in how well it pulls you in, out of concern for Ange’s well being. When Embryo is about to sexually assault her, I couldn’t help feel anxious and was on the edge of my seat yelling at the tv, telling Tusk to bang bang skeet skeet and save Ange.One thing Ange, Embryo, and Salamandinay(the dragon general) all share, is an ability to control a mecha by singing an ancient song to increase it’s power. Villkiss, Ange’s ship, is “alive” in a sense and responds to both her ring and voice. The songs that these pilots sing enable their mecha’s to transform into golden powerhouses built with ancient technology, and make for some pretty fun fight scenes. Much of the story revolves around this premise, putting forth another reason why Cross Ange isn’t your average Mech show. It’s also how Ange is able to gain her freedom and pick a path for her future, since Villkiss is the catalyst that inevitably brings us to the conclusion of the series and the conclusion to Ange and Tusk’s story.By the end, Ange comes to realize that she is no longer a princess and thus cannot claim to be the savior for humanity. Because of this, she and Tusk decide to leave for the future dragon dimension with her friends in tow. I really appreciate the direction this ending goes. One thing in particular I actually appreciated was how Ange and Tusk’s relationship is addressed. Cross Ange is one of the few shows that actually conclude how the relationship will turn out and make clear what is happening exactly in the moment rather than forcing the audience to assume. Ange reveals, toward the end of the series, that she wants to be more physical with Tusk, which ends up not only increasing their love for one another but giving us, the audience, a clear message of their current relationship status. The episodes following her admission are much more meaningful because of the shows decision to address this. I can honestly say that their relationship ends up so heartwarming, even though there wasn’t a drastic amount of time dedicated to exploring it. The final scenes where Ange is about to be assaulted carries much more meaning because it’s not just her that will be affected, and it also makes his rescue that much more romantic.I could continue with my analysis of Cross Ange, delving deeper into the possible concepts that might be present. An example of the shows hidden ideology would be metaphors such as the similarity between the treatment of Norma’s to that of WWII prisoners. Considering how long this review already is though, it might be best to observe items like that yourself. It’s not easy putting into words the emotion a show can give you and describe the moments in detail that meant most, but I still enjoy trying. Ange is truly a multifaceted character with a lot to offer. She definitely had me frustrated at times with her behavior, but more often than not I was thrilled by her actions, enthralled in her choices, bereaved by her despair, and intrigued by her romance. She has such a unique look and personality that I don’t believe it can ever be copied. I’m so glad the series had 25 episodes, because I don’t think the story could have been told any other way, especially if it had to be condensed down. I can easily say this was a blast to watch, with many emotional ups and downs. Yes at times, characters behave without logic, but it’s never boring. The ending alone makes up for any potential frustrations you may have had. I love happy endings and like to give credit to shows that allow for their characters to be together and go on living happy lives. Cross Ange definitely falls into this category and deserves recogniton for how the entire story was executed. Although I assume anyone reading to this point has already finished the series, If you haven’t then check it out asap!. If you have but had a different experience, I recommend you give it another shot because, to me, it’s worth it. The story wasn’t always coherent but it was consistently entertaining. Characters were unique and have personalities that are easy to sympathize with.

I mean people may think it is just a yuri fest of ecchiness but here is why you should watch it.Cross Ange is filled with unpredictable plot twists, and I do mean unpredictable, great character progression, a unique story, and quite possibly one of the most interesting anime that pushes the borders of the status quo of anime that I have ever seen.Story - 10The story is a huge round-up of modern day societal problems...or matters of debate such as discrimination, corrupt governmental system, along with pushing the bounds of how human relationships and sexuality are defined.  Taking the ecchi, mecha, supernatural along with other tags and mashing them up into one middle finger to everything you know series is amazing.  Plus how the story follows a spoiled princess who loses everything and rises from her nature through experiencing loss and hatred and evolving into pretty much the strongest anti-heroine I've ever seen is awesome.Art - 10Obviously the artists from Code Geass had a strong influence over this series, I do believe it is the same company; have to double check but yeah anyways, the art is a plus, the CG is damn near unnoticeable because it blends so well.  The color is vibrant and appealed but of course you ecchi fans will hate the blurred bits.Sound - 10I downloaded the soundtracks and I love every minute of them.  Seriously, it's like Hiroyuki Sawano had sex with Yasaharu Takanashi and gave birth to the Cross Ange soundtrack.Character - 10FINALLY a series that is a limited thing in which shows character growth even for the background characters or non-MCs.  Everyone changes over time except Tusk but Tusk is a badass so who cares.Enjoyment - 10The moment this series gets its BD release, I plan on downloading it or buying it because I loved every minute of it.Overall - 10Don't let the tags fool you.  Yes there is fan service, yes there is a lot of yuri moments but when you consider the shit that is going on in this series and the obvious mental toll it takes, you'll quickly learn to ignore it and just enjoy this show.  For you pervs out there, you'll love the little sex scenes when it comes out uncensored but yeah watch this series.  Total plus.  It beats that shit Aldnoah tried to pull but failed. or matters of debate such as discrimination, corrupt governmental system, along with pushing the bounds of how human relationships and sexuality are defined.

You can read the synopsis on it for the plot of the story, but without spoiling i will say its a journey to say the least. Mecha is a big part in this anime along with the sci-fi aspect alot of fanservice and gruesome scenes, singing is also a big part of the anime its not like its everywhere but its because it has to do story and fits in but it seems kinda dumb to be really honest but that aside a very good story.Art- it's good but theres times when you can see that the animations seem kinda laggy like it had frame issues but its really rare the first episode has an audio issue idk if its where im watching from but other sites had the same issue with cross anges first episode. Another thing i didnt like about the art style was the delayed speaking animations what i mean is i mentioned singing is a big part already but some of the scenes while there singing the character's mouth isnt moving at the proper time so it looks off but it sounds great. Other than that No complaints. Mecha looks very well done as well. Other then few inconsistencies i thought the art and animation looked goodSound- Great i liked the first half of the series op and ending not so much the second half but the battle themes are great sometimes. There are moments when a random song doesnt fit into the fight scene like imagine a crazy battle mecha style and then hearing i sad song in the heat of the fight when nothing bad has happend thats what some scenes felt like in cross ange and i wish they removed it while editing the show if they did. Character songs are good some sound angelic honestly why i was so attracted to alot of the scenes and had to rewind if i just wanted to hear it again its that good.Character- Variety of characters although many dont get through by the end of the series they are likeable for what they are as you get deeper into the anime theres a few characters that will grow on you the main character grew on me and a few side characters and 2 other main characters. But im here to tell you cross ange is one of the best ive seen in its 2014-2015 run to me and anime when it comes to main character development i mean it was like you really noticed it and thats what i really loved a minor spoiler ima throw your way not really about the characters themselves but the main character has about 3 character changes in personality and attitude from beginning to end and a few other characters also had more than 1 character change. Although not all the characters are all that loveable the development you get is an easy 9/10 it was really well done even with the anime cliches with hero and villains.Enjoyment- 10/10 i dont really watch all that mecha anime to be brutally honest ive seen about 5 and aside from code geass. Cross ange slips into my number two and onto my all time favourite anime list when i look back. Character development is top notch, Good story although the fanservice was overkill sometimes im an ecchi lover so it didnt bother me but its not in the ecchi genre yet it had a ton of fanservice moments, visually looked good not great, Great battle songs & character songs as well as the op and end from the 1-12 ep mark and i really just liked it. It goes 24 episodes nothing really seems rushed besides the last episode i guess.....other than that the pacing is well done it was really great i wish more people would give it a chance.Overall- 9/10 id say more so an 8.5 but lets not muddy things up here.Likes/Dislikes-  Likes: Music, Art, Story, some of the fanservice, main character and few side characters,Dislikes- Short pure fight scene, Too much fanservice, Random events, delayed animations (barely any), Petty highschool girl bullying stuff, Disturbing yuri/ecchi  fanservice scenes and disturbing sexual fanservice scenes.Thank you for reading a reuploaded final copy review of my thoughts on the series. see her die but she grows on you overtime and you eventually take a liking to her well i did at least. You can read the synopsis on it for the plot of the story, but without spoiling i will say its a journey to say the least. Mecha is a big part in this anime along with the sci-fi aspect alot of fanservice and gruesome scenes, singing is also a big part of the anime its not like its everywhere but its because it has to do story and fits in but it seems kinda dumb to be really honest but that aside a very good story.Art- it's good but theres times when you can see that the animations seem kinda laggy like it had frame issues but its really rare the first episode has an audio issue idk if its where im watching from but other sites had the same issue with cross anges first episode. Another thing i didnt like about the art style was the delayed speaking animations what i mean is i mentioned singing is a big part already but some of the scenes while there singing the character's mouth isnt moving at the proper time so it looks off but it sounds great. Other than that No complaints. Mecha looks very well done as well. Other then few inconsistencies i thought the art and animation looked goodSound- Great i liked the first half of the series op and ending not so much the second half but the battle themes are great sometimes. There are moments when a random song doesnt fit into the fight scene like imagine a crazy battle mecha style and then hearing i sad song in the heat of the fight when nothing bad has happend thats what some scenes felt like in cross ange and i wish they removed it while editing the show if they did. Character songs are good some sound angelic honestly why i was so attracted to alot of the scenes and had to rewind if i just wanted to hear it again its that good.Character- Variety of characters although many dont get through by the end of the series they are likeable for what they are as you get deeper into the anime theres a few characters that will grow on you the main character grew on me and a few side characters and 2 other main characters.

I can honestly say that it is a pretty good show throughout. Aside from plenty of Yuri and dragon girls, we have a pretty great cast to add.The show progresses through the 25 episodes to a great...conclusion that is very satisfying. It gives the good people and those who sought redemption their reward and those side characters that acted horribly an actual fate that is not just forgiveness. This is unusual and I loved it.The art of the show has aged superbly for 2014/2015. It is a show that in 20 years time or so will still be easily watchable. Graphically speaking the show is very crisp unless like all anime you pause between frames.The OP and ED of course changes and are very fun. The ED is the better side of the music. Generally sounds throughout are a great SFX and strong throughout. You do get a few scenes of people needlessly talking but it doesn't go on for too long.Characters are wide and varied.Fake humans are generally awful people and get justice.Normas the people who are outcast by the fake humans are treated abysmally but do develop amazingly.The real humans are awesome, the girls are extremely cute I love how they look and act. What a dream.Characters would take too long to go into each of the main cast since many supporting is very much main.My top girls would be:1.Vivian2. Salia3. Salamandinay4. ChrisI tend not always to love the actions of the main character like Ange since she is ruthlessly violent towards men whereas the others have more reasons for their brash actions. She is a good girl though. Her sister Sylvia is very easy to dislike but hard when she gets better at times to then like. She does, however, grow throughout the show into a nicer aspect of being.In terms of enjoyment, I can say I loved it from start to finish. The ecchi side is very much there but doesn't ruin the plot. The show is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a solid 9.I would suggest everyone who likes a great story and some mecha to watch this. It is truly a hidden gem.

HOWEVER, if you\'re uncomfortable being seen watching a highly-fanservice show... you might need to watch by yourself.For those not as comfortable of needless fanservice shots, tho, rest assured that practically in spite of it, it\'s actually so little the focus that it can be overlooked without much effort. Some cheesy effects to cover nudity is a lot more irksome.Oh, and for the overall theme of the story, it\'s undeniably forcing viewers to acknowledge that humanity cannot be sugarcoated regardless what you try to do.--.:STORY:....(8)There was a cop-out I hate towards the end without any logic or reasoning offered, so I had to deduct a point. Would be a 9 otherwise.However, the writing overall is rather consistent. And instead of the series being long hurting this, the pacing is truly well-done to where any tonal shifts for the sake of moving the story along or giving a backstory doesn\'t disrupt the grand scheme of things. At best you\'ll simply be disinterested in it or know the general idea going ahead so you get impatient.Despite that, I can\'t promise that you won\'t be able to see some things coming. While there are no red herrings at play, I wouldn\'t be surprised if that\'s only because they actually took the story seriously and didn\'t want to risk what all original series normally succumb to (massively ignored plot holes made worse). I appreciate that for a series amongst an increasingly saturated animated market for cheap capitalistic gains as it means I have the chance to actually enjoy it.And fanservice or not, this is the kind of writing that should be the bare min for ANY series worth animating with the goal of it being worth more than simple feel-good moments. Not everyone will agree, but for me to actually enjoy the series through-out without feeling disappointed by the end... this is proof that it\'s possible to actually write a dang story.--.:ART:. (8)Unfortunately, as with any long series, the art quality becomes questionable around the middle. Despite that, character models aside from Ange\'s hair sees little-to-no failure; her hair does actually grow some to show time moving, but there\'s very little consistency and so it becomes much shorter in some scenes. The style itself is quite old-fashioned so it gives the illusion it\'s a far older series, and the CG they employ is a tad too noticeable even if it\'s done well (texture differences). Another issue would be the decision to simply ignore animating and have a fairly still image, but that was rare even during the lull in quality, so it shouldn\'t affect viewers\' opinion much.I\'m also put-off by the cheesy light effect to mask any nudity. I much prefer they conveniently cover through other means, such as a better placed arm or more interesting angles to give focus to either other characters or the actual setting. This is mostly just a note of my preference.--.:SOUND:. (10)When composing songs that may or may not have another vibe to them... it\'s vital they work as such. It\'s also vital that, if it\'s supposed to be a magical or truly special, it\'s actually memorable. I\'ve encountered far too many series where this fails, and I\'m glad that this series did that quality justice.As for the OST, nothing seemed amiss overall and sfx and music selection worked well through-out. The VAs did very well, minus a few basic ""we need you for a scene or three"" roles where they were either newbs or just for background noise. I\'m glad that most of the voices actually sounded genuinely human as opposed to the generic animu voice - not that you\'d think they\'re merely normal folk reading lines, but where the VAs actually brought life to their characters.--.:CHARACTER:. (9)I think I have only two criticisms, and that relies solely upon Ange.First, she pulled a 180 in personality after deciding she\'ll live. Against the rest of the series, this development had no logic behind it because there was no show that she was actually working on it. She simply changed without proof.Second, there was a short-lived spurt where she felt sexual pleasure by doing something specific (explaining further would be an outright spoiler). That literally stopped after the most blatant moment of it. Never happened again, was never hinted at again. I pretty much forgot about it until trying to remember any major issue with the characters.So while I might not care for some characters, they at least moved in a direction that made sense for their purpose or were realistic within the setting.

While it\'s far from a revolutionary story in itself, it\'s a literal gem amongst the usual ""meh"" quality of shows that are still being produced.', 'I haven\'t written a review in a long while. Mainly due to the fact that MAL got rid of the ""Not Helpful"" option for reviews, but I digress. Watching this fucking show enraged me so much that I couldn\'t hold back from throwing all of my pure, unadulterated hatred at it by writing a review. So sit back and enjoy my review of this shitty Sunrise show from 2014 called Cross Ange.Hope I\'m not too rusty.[There\'s spoilers all over this review]I went into this with whatever can be considered less than no expectations. Really I can\'t even remember why I wanted to watch it...in the first place. Maybe it was that I heard the main character was kind of a bitch (she is), or that I wanted to get my monthly dose of bad fanservice mecha series, fuck if I know. Now despite all that, I watched the first 3 episodes, and was pleasantly surprised. It set up this princess girl Angelise as an idealistic prim and proper dunce who would kill a child if it wasn\'t like the rest of them, only to tear down everything she believed in, and make her change her ways. Violently forced away from her utopian world, and taken to the unfriendly Arzenal. She was beaten, harassed, defiled, and left with nothing but her self left in the world. With nothing left to believe in, she decided that she indeed would change. She cut her hair and turned into Ange, a straight up bitch who takes no shit from nobody. Now whether you believe that to be good character development or not, it\'s something at the very least. And it\'s more than I\'d seen in a long while from a protagonist. There was actual change there, and I respected it for happening.Continuing on now, there\'s a bunch of lesbian sex scenes, ass shots in the mechs, censored tits and whatnot, blah blah blah, and then Ange wants to go back home. Because her bratty bitch of an Imouto calls for help. She doesn\'t go back alone though, along with her comes Hilda, fiery redheaded twin tails girl. Another bitch who takes no shit from nobody, but has a goal of her own. She wants to get back home to see her mom who she was separated from years before. They both set their differences aside and set out together, then go their separate ways. When both of them realize that they were fools for even thinking of going back, they get captured, beaten, mocked, nearly die, and then go back to Arzenal. I don\'t know whether or not that whole sequence was like some kind of social commentary on how society becomes moronic and conforms to whatever they\'re told to no matter how stupid it is, or like how we insult and degrade those who aren\'t the same as us, I don\'t know. I feel like the show was accidentally making sense. Anyway, Hilda and Ange are thrown in a jail cell for a week together for deserting Arzenal. Now, these two really hated each other. But being confined in this tight space together for a long period of time would make them have to connect with each other to make sense of all that has happened. They had both gone home, and befell similar  consequences, and they were able to flesh themselves out with each other in that jail cell. I\'ll sit here and say that was the best scene in the entire show. Then, they go and make a promise to each other that they\'ll destroy this awful world, this world that has wronged them for so long. And then episode 11 ends. And so ends everything good about this series.I\'ll be honest. I loved the first 11 episodes. I really did. Sure there were tons of things that were just all over the place, but I found a way to really like it. Every character put on screen had some kind of genuine motivation to them, and they felt like real characters for once. They all developed in some ways, no matter how subtly, and it was very interesting to watch. They even began touching upon a possible relationship between Hilda and Ange, which would\'ve been very very interesting, due to how they originally acted towards one another, and how they\'re lives had intertwined since. But alas, everything I could\'ve wanted to happen, just, well...didn\'t. And there\'s one man to blame for it.Tusk.Tusk, I wanted him dead the entire show. This guy, this fucking guy. He comes in early on and helps Ange out of a jam, and I\'d hoped I\'d seen the last of him, but knew that couldn\'t be the case because he was so prominent in the Opening. I knew that he would drag this show down. There was no doubt in my mind. And low and behold, he did. The basis of his character can be summed up in few words. He\'s a guy (there\'s only really 2 in the whole fucking show), he falls in love with Ange after meeting her once, he inexplicably falls on her crotch 1534289069 times, and...nevermind that\'s it. He comes in as this living, breathing, infectious pile of generic blandness that single handedly destroys everything good in this show. Ange had new found morals, a new found goal, and was bound to turn into a regular ol anti hero we could all get on board with. But no, Tusk comes in and ruins everything. If you remove him from the show entirely, it wouldn\'t make a single difference. If you just replace everything he did, with Hilda doing the same, or Ange just being alone, it would\'ve made the show much better. Rather than delve deeper into this budding relationship between Hilda and Ange, they throw Hilda away for a while in order to ""strengthen the bond"" between Tusk and Ange. Every time he was on screen I was filled with anger. He could not be more generic, and I\'ve grown to absolutely disdain generic male characters in anime. There was no effort made towards making him into a decent character. If he wasn\'t so generic I probably wouldn\'t mind as much.My main issue with him is the relationship between he and Ange. See, Ange comes off as this strong, independent, fearless girl who can do anything she wants and get anything done. But once she meets Tusk, all of that is thrown out the window. She completely changes her goal, and completely forgets about everything that\'s happened to her along the way. ""Oh I\'ve been beaten and spit on and psychologically damaged and possibly raped and nearly died at the hands of all humans, but I met this one guy so everything is okay now"". It shouldn\'t have gone this way. It could\'ve been something special, but no. Leave it to anime to add generic bullshit to something that was getting interesting only to ruin everything they set up. Fuck. Anyway, later HE DIES. He fucking blows himself up (or at least that\'s what was implied). All of my prayers were answered. But then, of course, for no explainable reason, he comes back, without even a scratch. Doesn\'t even tell us how he got back to his house, he must\'ve just teleported there or something I don\'t fucking know.And then they have 12 hours of intercourse.Tusk ruined this show. And, while I may be overstating how good I think the first half was, it still was really captivating, even if for all the wrong reasons. If this had just stayed true and turned into a yuri fanservice mecha series throughout, with Hilda as best girl, than this would\'ve been something I\'d hold near and dear. But no. Fucking Tusk. Not only the worst character in this show, but I\'d argue one of the worst in anime period. Never have I seen one man bring down an entire show just from his mere existence. Just tragic. I don\'t know if I\'m the only one who feels this, but, whenever a romance happens on screen that I really don\'t like, it like, genuinely hurts to watch it unfold. Like, you know it\'s going to happen, and you know you can\'t do anything to stop it. I don\'t know man, it was painful. Shows that need no romance and yet have romance thrown into them just to appeal to more of a dumbass audience that appreciates these contrived relationships really irk me. I really wish romance could\'ve just stayed out of it completely to tell you the truth. This originally felt like Akatsuki no Yona without Hak for a while (they both cut their hair too). Though I liked it even more when they isolated Ange as opposed to giving Yona a shoulder to cry on. Ange was left alone, and had she stayed alone, it could\'ve made for better storytelling.Oh well.If you made it this far, thanks for reading my review (If this can even be called a review). I was more so venting my steam ranting than trying to make a compelling argument but I hope you had fun reading nonetheless. This felt like by far the most elitist I\'ve sounded in a review, I guess I\'m evolving. I\'m becoming more and more aware of how bad the anime coming out are, and am starting to lose my faith in the industry as a whole. This show did not help with that. I never drop anime, which leads to me torturing myself with bad shit a lot. And this show just teased me, made me think it was good for a while, only to crumble under itself later. If I ever quit watching anime, I\'ll look to Cross Ange as the show that really did me in. If that is ever reason enough to tell you not to watch a show, well, then I don\'t know what is.Goodnight everybody. in the first place.

Doesn\'t even tell us how he got back to his house, he must\'ve just teleported there or something I don\'t fucking know.And then they have 12 hours of intercourse.Tusk ruined this show. And, while I may be overstating how good I think the first half was, it still was really captivating, even if for all the wrong reasons. If this had just stayed true and turned into a yuri fanservice mecha series throughout, with Hilda as best girl, than this would\'ve been something I\'d hold near and dear. But no. Fucking Tusk. Not only the worst character in this show, but I\'d argue one of the worst in anime period. Never have I seen one man bring down an entire show just from his mere existence. Just tragic. I don\'t know if I\'m the only one who feels this, but, whenever a romance happens on screen that I really don\'t like, it like, genuinely hurts to watch it unfold. Like, you know it\'s going to happen, and you know you can\'t do anything to stop it. I don\'t know man, it was painful. Shows that need no romance and yet have romance thrown into them just to appeal to more of a dumbass audience that appreciates these contrived relationships really irk me. I really wish romance could\'ve just stayed out of it completely to tell you the truth. This originally felt like Akatsuki no Yona without Hak for a while (they both cut their hair too). Though I liked it even more when they isolated Ange as opposed to giving Yona a shoulder to cry on. Ange was left alone, and had she stayed alone, it could\'ve made for better storytelling.Oh well.If you made it this far, thanks for reading my review (If this can even be called a review). I was more so venting my steam ranting than trying to make a compelling argument but I hope you had fun reading nonetheless. This felt like by far the most elitist I\'ve sounded in a review, I guess I\'m evolving. I\'m becoming more and more aware of how bad the anime coming out are, and am starting to lose my faith in the industry as a whole. This show did not help with that. I never drop anime, which leads to me torturing myself with bad shit a lot. And this show just teased me, made me think it was good for a while, only to crumble under itself later. If I ever quit watching anime, I\'ll look to Cross Ange as the show that really did me in. If that is ever reason enough to tell you not to watch a show, well, then I don\'t know what is.Goodnight everybody.', 'Right well let\'s get to it, Cross Ange was a trainwreck from a start, it starts off happy like ""Oh yay i\'m the next heir to the throne of a massive futuristic city!"" To ""Holy shit I am the most hated human being in the entire city."" in just one mere episode. I only decided to watch it because the the site I watch said anime on had tagged it with comedy.The first few episodes were a little weird, some being filler and some having blatant lesbians fucking but I honestly can\'t say it\'s bad the art is pretty decent, the soundtrack is pretty amazing...and though the story line was a little weird at first it actually slowly got better as time progresses and you learn that some of the characters who were mean to Ange weren\'t actually half bad in the end.Embryo is still an asshole though. and though the story line was a little weird at first it actually slowly got better as time progresses and you learn that some of the characters who were mean to Ange weren\'t actually half bad in the end.Embryo is still an asshole though.', 'Summary: Giving the caveat that I could not get into the Gundam series... this is the best mech anime series I have ever seen. It is absolutely brilliant and I recommend it to anyone, mech fan or not.Story: 10/10The story is absolutely amazing. Ange starts off as a sheltered Princess and her evolution is ridiculous. This story covers her complete transformation into a badass, has tons of side arcs and character development, covering SO many deep emotional and philosophical topics. Everything you know about the universe changes... at least 3 times! The whole concept of the world and everyone\'s motivations are spun on their heads...several times, I assure you that this story will suck you in and keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The pace starts off slow and ramps up and keeps on going until the very last minute. If you want a deep story that isn\'t afraid to get deep and emotional but also lighthearted and funny you will LOVE this. Also, if you want a story with a concrete and satisfying ending this will definitely give it to you.Art: 10/10It\'s fantastic. The mechs look amazing, the characters are diverse and done well. The color pallet is bright and full of life. Everything is unique and well thought through. As it was made fairly recently it has all of the polish you would expect from something this recent. One thing to keep in mind is it has some ecchi tendencies and shows women topless but without nipples... it is a bit weird but you get used to it.Sound: 9/10The sound is great. The fight scenes sound intense, the Endless Song is catchy and there are some nice duets in there. The OST is diverse and wonderful and you will find yourself humming along during some moments.Character: 9/10This is where the story truly shines. Ange transforms from a sheltered Princess into an absolute badass character. You find out so much about each character and their motivations evolve over time. The villain is logical and the good members of the cast who turn bad are all logical as well. Basically, every character has deep development and you understand their motivations. Also, the romance plots are not shallow... you truly feel for the characters and this anime isn\'t afraid to give characters logical romance scenes (if you\'re wondering why a romance anime can go a whole season without a kiss because of contrived ""someone walks into the room"" type scenarios this will be VERY refreshing).Enjoyment: 10/10This one is a blast. I enjoyed every episode and thought the pacing was excellent. Every aspect of this anime was above and beyond expectations and there isn\'t much more I would want from it.Overall: 10/10You should watch this. It has excellent mech scenes, gritty and dark moments and lighthearted and fun moments. It is deep, philosophical. The dialogue is well done and the characters are excellent. I can\'t think of anyone who wouldn\'t like this. Enjoy! several times, I assure you that this story will suck you in and keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time.

It's not that it's bad because it knows what it is pandering to and that's the lowest common denominator (hell, even in the finale, Ange just had to jump naked, crotch first into Tusk's face), but so many of the motivations are contrived and the villain does not work for me. Most of these characters don't really work for me. It had some decent action and graphics when it wanted to, and some aspects of it were fun enough that I give them some credit, but this was a pretty frustrating watch for...me.

The entire anime is almost composed by Akiko Shikata, who honestly should have equal credit with the director considering how much of this anime...is influenced by her music. The tone, the story, the fight scenes, the mise-en-scene are all dictated by and almost conducted by Akiko Shikata\'s music. The best way to describe this is watching an Orchestra performance, or an Opera.Which is appropriate, considering how closely this comes to the latter.Angelise, a princess within the Misurugi Empire lives within a society in which people known as Norma [notably all women] are sidelined and discriminated against. When it is discovered that she herself is a Norma, she is quickly captured, detained and forced to discover a world which she had been oblivious to as a princess - a world in which day and night, she is forced to fight Dragons for people who care very little for her well-being.Cross Ange, at it\'s core, is above being an anime about race and intolerance. It\'s an anime about a woman\'s sexuality, and her awakening to the realities to the treatment of others of her kind. It should be noted that there\'s a pretty graphic sequence at the beginning of this anime that signals at sexual assault, and the main character\'s refusal to be subdued and held down by this. Then, she discovers men, women and faces against a man who would do everything to turn her into a sexual object.Perhaps one aspect of this which was a missed opportunity was the connection between Vivian and Ange. That one psychedelic scene in Episode 11 [which i consider the best half an hour of anime of the past 6 years] hinted at something deeper between the two. I had imagined that the story would go on from there to explore a deep connection of sorts between the two characters and explore an incredible character arc, but it seems like we didn\'t have time for those characters. Perhaps this is a way to sell Blu-Rays, by teasing at a second season.Correction: The ""psychedelic"" scene referred to above is episode 11, ""Dragon Song"", not episode 12. is influenced by her music.

I want to get one thing out of the way before we continue, and that\'s that I don\'t think the characters themselves are horrible, but that all the effort that did go into this series was clearly from the VA\'s and nobody else. How does one sit by and watch a trainwreck? Well, aren\'t you in for a ride.Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo is what you get when you mix Gundam with the magical girl genre and toss in some bad writing and worse animation. The series...kicks off with Angelise (A princess of some kind) telling the mother of a ""Norma"" (the people who can\'t perform magic) that her kid is a freak and to stop giving birth. The next day, the pampered princess is revealed to be a Norma herself (and because her maid did everything magic-related for her, she didn\'t need to do it herself) and gets sent off to prison. After being bitch-slapped, near-raped, told she\'s trash, and essentially kicked into the mud, she grows a pair and becomes the equivalent of Buffy cosplaying sailor moon and piloting a gundam.The problems with the series isn\'t the characters; I quite enjoyed myself some lesbian relationships. The issues stem from the production standpoint, where the studio seemed unsure of how strong their ""strong, female protagonist"" should be. This lead to Ange often forgetting how to be strong for her own sake and instead laying down and crying herself silly until someone came by and told her to grow a pair. The other characters often range from silly to endearing and, with the last handful of episodes, just obnoxious. I would suggest first-timers go as far as Arzenal getting wrecked and stop there. You\'ll thank me later.The animation is also pretty subpar, and that\'s complimenting the series. A lack of effort went into the mecha fights (where it should have really shined) and at times you wonder what you\'re watching. The character designs are, for the most part, your usual fair. The settings and backdrops are unfortunately ""okay"" despite the attempt at some interesting designs. Also, a lot of the fights take place over an ocean because.What can I say about the music? It\'s personal taste, but only the song the protagonist sings is memorable at best.The issues with this series unfortunately overshadow the pluses. The main gundam of the series, Vilkiss, only exists to move the plot forwards and, perhaps self-aware of this fact it picks and chooses when to do so. The villain is hilariously-bad and suffers from being a horny fuck who has gone a thousand years without. Yes, that\'s the reason he sucks at his job so bad; he hasn\'t had any in a thousand years. The protagonist earns her applause by telling him so and to go fuck himself right before doing the deed for him.In fact, the entire series is an allegory for having sex. The lesson? Sunrise is full of horny, old farts.

I also enjoyed Cross Ange.Most of this show falls clearly into the realm of self-parody. The fanservice in particular made me laugh almost every time, and by itself would make Cross Ange the best new anime I\'ve found in a long time. Further, when an episode ended, I actually cared what happened next. Usually I stop watching for a while and do something that feels like work before resuming a show, because nothing holds my...interest anymore. The show even uses a swimsuit episode, but instead of going wild with how stupid swimsuit episodes are, it takes a more prudent path, relegating it to the B story line behind an important section of the main story line. (Maybe its creators found that one too lame to do much with.) Of course, it still finds time for humor. I loved the ""it\'s a tradition"" explanation after Ange\'s quizzical response to the sudden, inexplicable swimsuit party.That said, you’ll find nothing revolutionarily new in the story. I’d call it fun, but not groundbreaking. Even the big reveal midway through had me saying, “yeah, I knew that from the moment I laid eyes on those things.” Of course, I seem to predict all kinds of things that people around me find mind-blowing, so maybe it’s not so obvious to everyone else. Either way, I found the characters a refreshing change from the usual cardboard cutouts. The show explores a surprising number of them, expanding its world in the process. (more on that subject later…)Cross Ange is certainly not for everyone. Plenty of people find fanservice (humorous and otherwise) terribly offensive. The show also explores hatred, prejudice, violence, and general mean-spiritedness in ways that may scar the timid.Many people in our own world will never understand that any other point of view besides their own could possibly exist. When they encounter someone who thinks differently, they can only see something wrong with the other party. They can only view the world through their own value system, as they utterly lack the ability for introspection required to recognize that anything they believe could potentially be less than perfect in some way. They can’t place themselves in another’s shoes even for an instant. Angelize faces these problems, and some people hate the show for it.In the beginning, Angelize (thinks she) lives in a perfect ordered world. Violence, hatred, etc. etc. do not exist because she lives in an age of reason at the pinnacle of human evolution, but oh, wait… something called norma threatens that order. Obviously this aberration must disappear. Human happiness depends on it.She sees a norma for the first time, and stops to talk sense into the child’s mother. Clearly it’s time to try for another child. The police will remove this one, letting everyone’s happiness continue. I laughed out loud, and even took a screenshot of the baby in a cage. Humans of our society may find this absurdity repulsive, but only because we judge it as outsiders. Angelize views these events through her own values: the values her society indoctrinated her with all her life.Naturally when the world finds out Angelize can’t use mana, she can’t accept it. She can’t possibly be a savage norma. She finds out firsthand how “humans” treat norma, but even when she arrives at a norma facility, she antagonizes everyone around her by treating them as inferiors. How dare they treat a “human” (and royalty at that) like a norma?Ange needs a lot of time to accept herself, those around her, and the world as it really is. That last one gets particularly difficult. How the world really is changes every time she meets someone new, because she keeps learning new things and considering things she hadn’t before. By the end of the show, she forms an entirely new value system. She also learns to see things from others’ points of view, even when she disagrees with them.

The appalling score not is only because the entire show´s elements (average animation, not memorable music, over twisted and repetitive story, typical end, plain characters, etc) are poor or average; if not that the messege of the show is totally awful! Entire cast are autodenominated women, but they are being controlled, humilliated and concern, over top, about the only two autodenominated men in the show.  And definitly Embryo is the representation of the extreme misoginity and patriarchalism essence...but also  ""fanservice"" or  better called standard  objectualism of woman and fetishistic lesbianism, are proofs of misogyny behind...the series...I don´t do reviews very often, but without a doubt this program is extreme about the misoginity that still exists in Japanese society and I feel as responsability expose it, and not take it only as a ""freedom of expression"" or ""creativity fiction"", instead as the representation of a deep social problem in Japan. the series...I don´t do reviews very often, but without a doubt this program is extreme about the misoginity that still exists in Japanese society and I feel as responsability expose it, and not take it only as a ""freedom of expression"" or ""creativity fiction"", instead as the representation of a deep social problem in Japan.', ""You have to keep an open mind when you watch this anime, and what the director did, was perfect.

This truly deserve to be one of the best for 2014.They kept all the side characters involve, and we get to...see how they change as we go further in the episodes.The Story was also very creative and unique, you don't see many anime that's unique. I understand that its not in everyone taste, but to me it was epic. I also like the realism, you gotta understand the yuri aren't there for show, its an all girl prison, with no males, so of course there gonna have to be some desperate people for lust.Overall, it was very good and pleasing for me, but some parts were left unexplained, so its not exactly perfect but definitely one of the best for me. see how they change as we go further in the episodes.The Story was also very creative and unique, you don't see many anime that's unique.

That just because the story may not be to your liking mostly cause of plot it dose not mean it didn\'t  try it\'s best to give the message that it was made to convey to you.For Example most people don\'t like SAO , Fairy tail or Bleach for numerous reasons but let be clear that these animes may have it\'s moments when you say things like ""why"", ""this is stupid"" or worst ""i hated that"". Truth be told there are animes i didn\'t enjoy because it didn\'t...send a message but just something random.Now where i\'m going with this is that sometimes no matter the reason you hated the anime is in fact irreverent to the fact did you learn anything from the anime that the creator wanted you to learn.Now if you say you hate something you have freedom to say but one day when your bored try watching animes you hated to see if you change your opinion of them.Also before i\'m done let me add that this  anime has similarities to many mecha animes so if you did not enjoy them try looking up there related ones to find a anime that who knows you might likes.For Example When i finished Strain: Strategic Armored Infantry i was so emotional so then i looked for similar anime like it.

However after watching Cross Ange, I came to a realization that not all mecha anime are just MECHA only. Some of them had real drama in it, and Cross Ange is one of them.Story -We get a rich-ass and spoiled princess who finds out that she doesn't have any powers, and is therefore brandished as a monster. After realizing that her family doesn't love her anymore, she abandons her old princess identity and takes on the...role of a serious soldier.

They are the veterans at making these types of shows. From the original Mobile Suit Gundam, they are BACK! I did see Buddy Complex as well, which was also made by Sunrise, and that I liked.Sound -No score because I don't normally care about music.Character -Ange is a former princess who was exiled from her kingdom because of her lack of powers and sent to a military operation to fight DRAGONS. Realizing her former kingdom wasn't her home anymore, she abandons the princess and becomes the soldier. This is quite the development, from a spoiled brat to an independent person. Who can argue with that haha!When we first see Hilda, we see her as a typical bully who picks on the new one, Ange. Her revenge grows when Ange's disabordination causes Zola to get killed. Later on, as Ange is able to steal a ship to try to return home, she clashes with Hilda for it, only for Hilda to lose. She reveals her intent to return home, and Ange supports her, as they both were returning to their families.

Realizing her former kingdom wasn't her home anymore, she abandons the princess and becomes the soldier. This is quite the development, from a spoiled brat to an independent person. Who can argue with that haha!When we first see Hilda, we see her as a typical bully who picks on the new one, Ange. Her revenge grows when Ange's disabordination causes Zola to get killed. Later on, as Ange is able to steal a ship to try to return home, she clashes with Hilda for it, only for Hilda to lose. She reveals her intent to return home, and Ange supports her, as they both were returning to their families.

It\'s with full honesty tied for my number one spot of my favorite anime of all time list. It was great as a drama, mecha, harem, romance, and action packed adventure. The plot was solid, it\'s characters and lead complex, and was just dripping with atmosphere. I found the story and setting just so emotionally intriguing and interesting. I found all the characters to be surpurbly developed by the series end which is why I was so into it. It showed a complete story arc for almost every character in the...series both supporting and Main. That\'s something I\'m sure is seen in anime but it just felt so well done for me personally. I know it\'s definitely over the top and cheesy at times, but that just makes me kinda enjoy it more, it knew what it wanted to be and I say it did it right.It\'s various twists and turns had me on the edge and totally invested the whole time, in fact it\'s one of the few animes I\'ve rewatched more than three times and will definitely rewatch in the future to relive the whole thing for years to come.My only complaint is that there isn\'t more of the series to watch, like an ova. Honestly that\'s the sign of a true classic, the fact it left me still wanting more even to this day. So if your looking for a anime with solid story, strong female leads, and just all around original epicness, I definitely recommend you check out cross ange. It\'s defenatley worth the watch.So yeah, I know might see this as over praise, but I\'m sure we all have something like this in anime and this one is will as always be mine. By the way is my first review, I wanted to keep it short and sweet to hit the high points with no plot spoilers.

I honestly never knew these things could elicit such strong emotions, both to characters and the general plot, but now I finally realize what all this is about. For 25 episodes I went on a ride that included great joy, extreme sadness, fantastic music, cool mecha designs, and pretty cartoon women. The entire range of my emotional capacity was tested, and for that reason alone I think Cross Ange is a masterpiece. I only wish there was more!My only major complaint lies in the character of God, whose real...motives I never fully grasped. For the first two-thirds of Cross Ange I truly thought he was a neutral observer, only interfering when necessary to steer things on a better path (much like alleged irl gods); but then, his character rapidly changed to a harem-wanting sociopath. The transition was poorly executed in my opinion, without really presenting ""his side"" of the shift. And for a minor complaint, I was ultimately confused about how both women and men weren\'t...ah...anatomically presented with everything intact. I suppose it\'s because I\'m such a newcomer and I don\'t understand what is allowed and what isn\'t, but the lack of certain features was terribly odd.The main character of Ange, however, is tremendous. While her arch certainly follows the traditional fall then rise again, it was explored completely and left no doubt as to the why and how. Most Hollywood films don\'t have this quality of exploration into a character\'s motives, and it unironically blew me away.Obviously I\'m not a season veteran of anime, but I have seen thousands of traditional films and television shows, so at least I have exposure to storytelling: and by that metric, I\'m comparing this to the best those fields have to offer. motives I never fully grasped.

When I watched the first chapters, I tought this anime had potential to develop into a good story, and that\'s what it did. Do not let the high amounts of fanservice to keep you away from this show...It\'s a roller coaster of emotions and actual trama untill the last episode.Story: 8So, this starts in a future utopian world where wars are over and people live in peace, but this Utopia has it\'s flaws, as it condemns those who don\'t have the ""Mana Light"" power, and forces them...to fight Alien Beings known as ""DRAGON"". A curious subversion of the sunrise mecha trope where the MC and it\'s allies have special talents and powers, as the main characters are actually the only people in the world without the ""Mana"" powers, alsot the adversaries in this anime are incredibly overpowered (specially for the main antagonist). Another thing to add, is the gradual darkening of the story, revelations about the true nature of the enemies and the setting make it for the weak beginnng, later episodes have been awesome, and with a nice story rythm. Be warned: This anime stats as a Real Robot, but eventualy becomes a super robot.Art: 7Colorful and lively, the Character design feels very vibrant, as with Sunrise most recent mecha series, Ange and the girls are pretty, Backgrounds have nothing in special most of the time, panoramic views are good, the mecha design is actually pretty good. However, the animation quality falls off hard in some scenes.Sound: 10From Nana\'s Opening theme, to the OST and Theme Songs, this anime shines in good audio, surely Ange\'s being voiced by Nana Mizuki adds a point to this, surely BGM is superb at key scenes, the second opening and ending are good in the sound aspect, perhaps the sound is one of the best things in this anime.Character: 8While being a Mecha Anime, we finally see that Main Character is a Girl, while that hyped the train before this anime\'s relase, soon it came a little disapointing for too many people. the reason is simple: Ange doesn\'t start rocking hard, in fact, she starts as a very weak and arrogant person, but that\'s the key to this series! Ange\'s development is actually good and interesting, her path from being a little selfish girl to a badass soldier was superb, It didn\'t feel rushed or incoherent, but the development on Ange is arguably the best thing in the show. Other Characters also become relevant and developed later in the anime, but, the main plot revolves around few relevant characters. But, we don\'t see a mecha with a ton of bishoujo as badass pilots everyday. At least cross ange went out of the square and tried something a bit different.Special to point out Hilda, that girl went from despicable to lovable in a few chapters.Enjoyment: 9As a fan of mecha series, I can say Cross Ange feels like fresh air for the recent times, as most mecha anime in the last times felt very generic. And, personally, I actually enjoy the ecchi stuff packed with Cross Ange, and I guess more people will enjoy that, perhaps not the old bone mecha fans, but the more casual viewer. That apart, the action, emotionals roller coasters and rythm of the show make the enjoyment rise.And the main antagonist, Is ....simply superb, a Mix between an Utopian God, and a complete Sociopath.Overall: 9I waited for so long for a Female MC in a mecha, and I got just what I wished for.

After I watched this I was like holy shit, this mech anime is better than fucking Code Geass. Now I may be mistaken since it's been about two years since I last seen Code Geass, but from memory this has to blow it out of the water. First of all the art style is fucking miles ahead of Code Geass, I actually enjoyed the story better than the fighting in Code Geass. However in Cross Ange I enjoyed both. In the first few episodes I expected this anime...to be just like some other 12 episode whatever mech anime with over the top fan service. However there was a turning point in the anime and it kept sucking me in. We thought dragons were the enemy all this time but no, now we got some mech from another world. Then wait, they arent the enemy nor the dragons. There is plot twists upon plot twists and it leave you to believe we really don't know who the enemy is until pretty late in the show. I like how it has some romance in it, and their relationship develops nicely and there is no sad ending with their lovers dying off, however it did give me a scare there in the middle. Speaking of which they never explained how they survived dying, Tusk or her maid, I feel like they brought them back just because they would of got soo much shit for them dying like family guy did with Brian. Overall I would recommend this anime to everyone, but keep this in mind - It takes some time for the story to suck you in, it will appear to be a normal everyday whatever anime in the beginning. to be just like some other 12 episode whatever mech anime with over the top fan service.

I wanted to write this review because of how much underrated this show is...Some people might argue it has some Evangelion or whatsoever Mecha anime cliche, it might has the general concept or idea, but the delivery and the uniqueness of the story is what captivated me.There might be small spoilers down the line so, bear with me.Story: 9/10We get a very unique about that amazing princess who seeks peace and everyone looks up to, she has everything a girl could dream of. Yet all of the sudden all is gone. This might some...cliche to many weebs, and it is, however the anime holds a very beautiful concept of Utopia, like there is that perfect world without violence or crime and everybody almost equal and happy, yet this world is revealed to be shallow, emotionless, just a bunch of heartless people, living to satisfy their own desires, and prejudicing other people (Norma). Regardless of the world created there will be always discrimination and injustice, the beautiful theme that the anime tries to deliver is that everybody should in harmony with each other, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or even species (lol because there are other species other than humans).The story events are really unpredictable and that what made it awesome, however the ending was a little bit cliche and somewhat predicable, but still overall the story is amazing.Art: 9/10I dont want to talk about art, since i am not an artist myself nor that i have that good taste in arts, but the arts and graphics were really good and battle scenes were great.Sound: 100/10I know this illogical rating, but please accept my childish behavior, since the songs and the music were really amazing.Character: 10/10The only character that caught my attention is ANGE, I fell in love with her character, her character development was one of the best of all animes that i have seen, the transition from an asshole to a lovable amazing badass character was captivating.Enjoyment: 10/10I did enjoy ever bit of the anime except the scenes of Embryo with Ange, those scenes made furious Lol.Overall: 9/10Its a show that all anime and non anime fans should see as it has a very strong message, beautiful characters, nice story, and AMAZING Music And SONGS... cliche to many weebs, and it is, however the anime holds a very beautiful concept of Utopia, like there is that perfect world without violence or crime and everybody almost equal and happy, yet this world is revealed to be shallow, emotionless, just a bunch of heartless people, living to satisfy their own desires, and prejudicing other people (Norma).

Spoilers ahead!)Think about something that you did within the past few minutes. Maybe it was clicking a link to read this review or making a phone call to a friend of yours. Now, why did you perform this action? Was it a preordained happenstance that you had no control over? Or did you feel compelled in some way to act accordingly? The long and short of it is, did you make such a decision of your own free will? The idea of will, that you make the choices that govern your life, is something that has been...endlessly debated about for centuries. Cross Ange dabbles into this very topic. And while it might not be completely resonating, it has as much fun with the notion as it possibly can.STORYCross Ange begins in stunning fashion; Angelise, the princess of the Misurugi Empire, is discovered to be a Norma -- someone incapable of using the ""Light of Mana."" Thus, she is sent away to Arzenal, a prison for other Normas whose only goal in life is to kill the DRAGONS that threaten the non-Normas.Cross Ange is crazy. This isn\'t an exaggeration; this show is as wacky as they come. Not in the sense that what it is doing doesn\'t follow logic, but that its very nature is aimed at being as ridiculous as possible. On the surface, the anime deals with obscene fan-service, machine versus dragon battles, and insane plot developments. But on the inside, Cross Ange treads on very mature subjects, such as sexual molestation, racism, and philosophical questioning. In essence, the anime spans an incredible range of emotions. One instant it is having Ange\'s bare crotch shoved in Tusk\'s face while the next has her being the object of ridicule as a means to demonstrate the social disparity that exists in their world. This tonal dissonance isn\'t a detriment, though; rather, it is a boon for the show. Cross Ange revels in whatever it is currently doing, whether it is comedy or drama. And it knows this: it flits back and forth between the two constantly, never letting itself become too serious. In this way, Cross Ange manages to maintain its craziness and subsequently is able to always ""know"" itself.While the silliness that Cross Ange engages in is its ""home turf"" per se, the nonstop swinging in direction is not something that lends itself to an overall direction. In other words, much of what occurs within the show happens ""just because."" While there may be some obtuse reasoning as to why the narrative is going one way or there exists particular events that make sense in context, the plot points are isolated instances that never truly feel connected. Ange may be struggling with her new life, then whisked to an island getaway. Only to then be transported back to her birthplace which in turn leads her to an alternate dimension. And this says nothing of the more ""unfair"" ventures that take place. For example, the Vilkiss -- Ange\'s flying machine -- pretty much has features added to it as the plot deems necessary; characters miraculously survive after being killed off; and once certain happenings come to pass -- such as Zola\'s death, the ""Old Earth,"" and the betrayal of Salia and Alektra -- they are largely ignored, simply because Cross Ange needs to make room for its next ""big"" scene.Even when the show is juggling its absurdity and misdirection, it does manage to bring about some personal message. And this is what the introduction introduced: the idea of one\'s will. This isn\'t too far-fetched a notion; ""Mana"" is usually a term used in conjunction with magic, which is itself a word connected to a person\'s fortitude or will. And so that is what is seen through much of Cross Ange: the use of will or lack thereof. Those using Mana are slaves to the system whereas the Norma are free from the chains of constriction -- though ironically being slaves themselves to the aforementioned slaves. This is what the first half focuses on; the second half shifts to the manipulation of will. Alektra demonstrates when one\'s will is tarnished; Salamandinay represents someone who\'s will is guided by the very principles she grew up on; and Chris showcases how will can be used for both good and for evil. And that is the show\'s message: you are not subject to fate nor are you destined to follow some predetermined path. While people -- be it a close friend or a lover -- may be able to influence you, you ultimately have the final say in the actions you take.ANIMATIONCross Ange unfortunately suffers from quite the poor art style. The actual locations visited are not that exorbitant: Arzenal (the prison), the open world (lots of sea and sky shots), and Embryo\'s castle make up the majority of where the show takes place. More so than this, details are often nonexistent, with little attention given to the backgrounds, giving everything quite the boring look.The character designs are not that impressive either. Besides Ange\'s various transitions, Hilda\'s striking red hair, and the revealing outfits that all of the girls wear, the show often experiences terrible quality issues. There are numerous scenes where the designs of their faces or bodies fall below an acceptable level, distracting the audience from everything going on. Granted, one could argue that this simply adds to the charm of Cross Ange\'s crazy behavior, but this kind of drop in effort is nothing more than a lack of detail.Actual animation, like what has come before it, is below average. The show sticks closely to the use of CG for the machines, but even so, their available movements seem weirdly limited. Often times, the robots would perform the same up-and-down slash pattern or the same volley of rifle shots, with the machines twirling around in an indiscernible manner. And when Ange and the girls weren\'t flying around haphazardly, the show never had much motion, instead sticking to still shots of the girls\' various body parts -- namely their butt, breasts, and crotches.CHARACTERSInterestingly, there are only two important characters throughout the entirety of Cross Ange: Ange herself and Embryo. The rest of the cast have their small moments here and there, but their true worth is in supporting these two, characterizing them, and reinforcing the ideas that they represent.Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi is, as her name sounds, royalty. She\'s arguably the most famous person in the Empire of the same last name...at least, in the beginning. For within the very first episode, she falls from the height of popularity to the bottom of the barrel faster than is physically possible. Her arrogant attitude, lack of empathy, and inability to cope with her new surroundings painted her as an annoying little girl lost among a sea of women. As she acclimates, and like the flip-flop nature of the story, Ange goes to the complete opposite side; she\'s arrogant not because of status but because of prowess, she acts rudely selfish, and refuses to associate with anyone. But this, too, wasn\'t working. In both cases, her personality prevents her from being sociable. At first it was due to ignorance and later it was due to misplaced worth. Eventually she finds a balance by retaining her own identity while letting others in to her world. This emotional instability makes sense; the Mana-users cast her out, the Normas mistreated her, and the Dragon people wanted her aide. Nobody bothered to ask how Ange herself felt in these situations, and through her experiences with all of them, she comes to learn that valuable lesson about will. That you alone have the power to make your own life choices.While not as strong of a character, Embryo, or ""The Tuner,"" as he likes to call himself, is a literal manifestation of God. With the ability to teleport, make infinite copies of himself, and possessing the knowledge to alter genetic code, nobody within the millions of dimensions that exist holds as much power as he does. What\'s nice about Embryo is that he isn\'t a bad guy for evil\'s sake. He values beauty and power, while loathing boredom. His actions follow this philosophy; he surrounds himself with hot, ""strong"" women with an overall goal to recreate the world once more. And yet, despite his all-knowing wisdom, Ange wants nothing to do with him. After all of his parlor tricks to coerce her are used, she continues to despise him. The idea here is simple: where Embryo is the epitome of control, Ange is the epitome of freedom. Thus, this dichotomous relationship is always feuding: Embryo has an instinctual need to dominate whereas Ange places all value in choice. And since Embryo, for the first time, cannot have what he wants, he relentlessly pursues Ange to the point of demise. In the end, his death is symbolic: not even God can force you to do something against your will.SOUNDThe first OP starts off almost Scottish in tone, but then becomes more techno in its beat and instruments. It can be pretty catchy, with the vocalist doing nice work alongside the more triumphant sounds that the track gives off. If anything, it\'s a zany piece that perfectly fits with what Cross Ange set out to do.The second OP starts off slow, with powerful chanting taking up the background. The piece progressively gets more mysterious, with the continued chanting and instruments moving to a crescendo. After the break, the vocalist, still working with the male chanting, shows great range and strength, leading the piece to a resounding conclusion.The first ED initially goes against the fast-paced nature of the show, with soft singing and finger-snapping making up most of the piece. But, in true fashion, the track transitions back to quick lyrics and louder instruments. And still following the anime\'s nature, the song comes to a crawl by the end, filling the listener with an odd sense of hope.The second ED isn\'t as experimental as the others, following a simple beat with equally simple singing. The halfway point gets slightly faster, but the piece itself stays relatively the same from beginning to end and is easily the weakest of the four OPs and EDs.The rest of the soundtrack is very much forgettable. The pieces mostly consist of non-lyric vocals, piano-and-violin melodies, and even Hawaiian tracks that exist as nothing more than background filler.As far as voice-acting is concerned, it\'s generally around average. If anyone deserves some recognition, Nana Mizuki as Ange earns it for her wide range of personalities that she had to portray throughout the show\'s run.ENJOYMENTThis anime was probably the funniest ""comedy"" that the season had to offer. There was just so much ridiculousness going on at all times, that I couldn\'t help but laugh at both the ""drama"" and the actual comedy. The writing at times could be hilariously bad, but it worked in the show\'s favor. One of my favorite characters from the show was Ange\'s younger sister, Sylvia. Not only is her ""Angelise-onee-sama!"" something that I still jokingly say in her voice to myself, but also the revelation that her paralysis wasn\'t real for part of her life? Absolutely classic.The fan-service was rather nice, too. The lesbianism, bikini Twister, and butt-smacking were all nice to see at intermittent points during the anime, and were also the source of more smiles from time to time. Without them, the anime would not nearly be as enjoyable as it was.All in all, Cross Ange is quite the Ragna-Mail ride. While its characters are average in their execution, and its art can be shoddy at times, the crazy plot, unintentional comedy, and varying levels of fan-service make this an anime you may not have to will yourself to watch.SUMMARYStory: Good, knows itself, directionless plot, yet willfully thematicAnimation: Bad, boring art style, bad character designs, below average actual animationCharacters: Fine, Ange and Embryo are dichotomous, with the rest of the cast reinforcing their idealsSound: Fine, good first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, bad soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Great, ""Angelise-onee-sama!"", lesbians, and lots of laughsFinal Score: 6/10 endlessly debated about for centuries.

For example, the Vilkiss -- Ange\'s flying machine -- pretty much has features added to it as the plot deems necessary; characters miraculously survive after being killed off; and once certain happenings come to pass -- such as Zola\'s death, the ""Old Earth,"" and the betrayal of Salia and Alektra -- they are largely ignored, simply because Cross Ange needs to make room for its next ""big"" scene.Even when the show is juggling its absurdity and misdirection, it does manage to bring about some personal message. And this is what the introduction introduced: the idea of one\'s will. This isn\'t too far-fetched a notion; ""Mana"" is usually a term used in conjunction with magic, which is itself a word connected to a person\'s fortitude or will. And so that is what is seen through much of Cross Ange: the use of will or lack thereof. Those using Mana are slaves to the system whereas the Norma are free from the chains of constriction -- though ironically being slaves themselves to the aforementioned slaves. This is what the first half focuses on; the second half shifts to the manipulation of will. Alektra demonstrates when one\'s will is tarnished; Salamandinay represents someone who\'s will is guided by the very principles she grew up on; and Chris showcases how will can be used for both good and for evil. And that is the show\'s message: you are not subject to fate nor are you destined to follow some predetermined path. While people -- be it a close friend or a lover -- may be able to influence you, you ultimately have the final say in the actions you take.ANIMATIONCross Ange unfortunately suffers from quite the poor art style. The actual locations visited are not that exorbitant: Arzenal (the prison), the open world (lots of sea and sky shots), and Embryo\'s castle make up the majority of where the show takes place. More so than this, details are often nonexistent, with little attention given to the backgrounds, giving everything quite the boring look.The character designs are not that impressive either. Besides Ange\'s various transitions, Hilda\'s striking red hair, and the revealing outfits that all of the girls wear, the show often experiences terrible quality issues. There are numerous scenes where the designs of their faces or bodies fall below an acceptable level, distracting the audience from everything going on. Granted, one could argue that this simply adds to the charm of Cross Ange\'s crazy behavior, but this kind of drop in effort is nothing more than a lack of detail.Actual animation, like what has come before it, is below average. The show sticks closely to the use of CG for the machines, but even so, their available movements seem weirdly limited. Often times, the robots would perform the same up-and-down slash pattern or the same volley of rifle shots, with the machines twirling around in an indiscernible manner. And when Ange and the girls weren\'t flying around haphazardly, the show never had much motion, instead sticking to still shots of the girls\' various body parts -- namely their butt, breasts, and crotches.CHARACTERSInterestingly, there are only two important characters throughout the entirety of Cross Ange: Ange herself and Embryo. The rest of the cast have their small moments here and there, but their true worth is in supporting these two, characterizing them, and reinforcing the ideas that they represent.Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi is, as her name sounds, royalty. She\'s arguably the most famous person in the Empire of the same last name...at least, in the beginning. For within the very first episode, she falls from the height of popularity to the bottom of the barrel faster than is physically possible. Her arrogant attitude, lack of empathy, and inability to cope with her new surroundings painted her as an annoying little girl lost among a sea of women. As she acclimates, and like the flip-flop nature of the story, Ange goes to the complete opposite side; she\'s arrogant not because of status but because of prowess, she acts rudely selfish, and refuses to associate with anyone. But this, too, wasn\'t working. In both cases, her personality prevents her from being sociable. At first it was due to ignorance and later it was due to misplaced worth. Eventually she finds a balance by retaining her own identity while letting others in to her world. This emotional instability makes sense; the Mana-users cast her out, the Normas mistreated her, and the Dragon people wanted her aide. Nobody bothered to ask how Ange herself felt in these situations, and through her experiences with all of them, she comes to learn that valuable lesson about will. That you alone have the power to make your own life choices.While not as strong of a character, Embryo, or ""The Tuner,"" as he likes to call himself, is a literal manifestation of God. With the ability to teleport, make infinite copies of himself, and possessing the knowledge to alter genetic code, nobody within the millions of dimensions that exist holds as much power as he does. What\'s nice about Embryo is that he isn\'t a bad guy for evil\'s sake. He values beauty and power, while loathing boredom. His actions follow this philosophy; he surrounds himself with hot, ""strong"" women with an overall goal to recreate the world once more. And yet, despite his all-knowing wisdom, Ange wants nothing to do with him. After all of his parlor tricks to coerce her are used, she continues to despise him. The idea here is simple: where Embryo is the epitome of control, Ange is the epitome of freedom. Thus, this dichotomous relationship is always feuding: Embryo has an instinctual need to dominate whereas Ange places all value in choice. And since Embryo, for the first time, cannot have what he wants, he relentlessly pursues Ange to the point of demise. In the end, his death is symbolic: not even God can force you to do something against your will.SOUNDThe first OP starts off almost Scottish in tone, but then becomes more techno in its beat and instruments. It can be pretty catchy, with the vocalist doing nice work alongside the more triumphant sounds that the track gives off. If anything, it\'s a zany piece that perfectly fits with what Cross Ange set out to do.The second OP starts off slow, with powerful chanting taking up the background. The piece progressively gets more mysterious, with the continued chanting and instruments moving to a crescendo. After the break, the vocalist, still working with the male chanting, shows great range and strength, leading the piece to a resounding conclusion.The first ED initially goes against the fast-paced nature of the show, with soft singing and finger-snapping making up most of the piece. But, in true fashion, the track transitions back to quick lyrics and louder instruments. And still following the anime\'s nature, the song comes to a crawl by the end, filling the listener with an odd sense of hope.The second ED isn\'t as experimental as the others, following a simple beat with equally simple singing. The halfway point gets slightly faster, but the piece itself stays relatively the same from beginning to end and is easily the weakest of the four OPs and EDs.The rest of the soundtrack is very much forgettable. The pieces mostly consist of non-lyric vocals, piano-and-violin melodies, and even Hawaiian tracks that exist as nothing more than background filler.As far as voice-acting is concerned, it\'s generally around average. If anyone deserves some recognition, Nana Mizuki as Ange earns it for her wide range of personalities that she had to portray throughout the show\'s run.ENJOYMENTThis anime was probably the funniest ""comedy"" that the season had to offer. There was just so much ridiculousness going on at all times, that I couldn\'t help but laugh at both the ""drama"" and the actual comedy. The writing at times could be hilariously bad, but it worked in the show\'s favor. One of my favorite characters from the show was Ange\'s younger sister, Sylvia. Not only is her ""Angelise-onee-sama!"" something that I still jokingly say in her voice to myself, but also the revelation that her paralysis wasn\'t real for part of her life? Absolutely classic.The fan-service was rather nice, too. The lesbianism, bikini Twister, and butt-smacking were all nice to see at intermittent points during the anime, and were also the source of more smiles from time to time. Without them, the anime would not nearly be as enjoyable as it was.All in all, Cross Ange is quite the Ragna-Mail ride. While its characters are average in their execution, and its art can be shoddy at times, the crazy plot, unintentional comedy, and varying levels of fan-service make this an anime you may not have to will yourself to watch.SUMMARYStory: Good, knows itself, directionless plot, yet willfully thematicAnimation: Bad, boring art style, bad character designs, below average actual animationCharacters: Fine, Ange and Embryo are dichotomous, with the rest of the cast reinforcing their idealsSound: Fine, good first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, bad soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Great, ""Angelise-onee-sama!"", lesbians, and lots of laughsFinal Score: 6/10', ""Yes, yes. We all know Cross Ange totally SUCKED at the beginning and all of us had our jaws dropped at the ending of the first episode, but let me say this. When I thought this show wouldn't get better, it DID.8 - Story: Yes, when we first heard about Cross Ange, it seemed this show was going to be awesome, but did we get what we were expecting in the first episode? Heck no, that ending scene was jaw dropping, but as the story progressed, it became better and had very good plot twist. Some plot twist weren't even anything you would expect either....So, the story came around and did the show good.8 - Art: The art to Cross Ange is very good to me. I mean, the art and animation can look awkward in some scenes, but who points out and cares about that small stuff? *coughsailormooncrystalhaterscough*9 - Sound: The music is very good and likeable! I enjoyed all the music! The first opening and second ending are sung by Nana Mizuki, Ange's voice actor. While the first ending is sung by Eri Kitamura and the second opening is sung by Yoko Takahashi. The insert music is also enjoyable!7 - Character: This show had some great character development. The main character, Ange, was whiny and annoying at first, but then she learned how to become independent for herself and learned that the world she originally lived in was a cruel and unjustified world. The other main characters also had very good character development. The development won't disappoint you.9 - Enjoyment: I enjoyed this show very much! I was originally going to be one of the ones to drop it at episode 5, but I had faith in this show and kept going! It really did turn out to be something to enjoy.9 - Overall: Cross Ange was a great show. You have to ignore some of the Yuri themes in there, but the main character ends up with a guy (I'll tell you that). It had a bad and horrible start at first, but it came to where you wanted to know what happened after a cliffhanger, it had emotional episodes and scenes where you could get sad, and the little comedy that needed. All in All, Cross Ange is something I recommend if you need a new anime to watch! :)Also, the First Opening Single is totally worth the buy!

If you love the Amazon trope you'll love this show (and if you don't you might hate it).  I really like how the mechas are portrayed; it actually kind of makes sense how they transform between a kind of hoverbike and a giant humanoid robot.  Probably a lot more energy efficient.The characters are portrayed realistically, from the womanizing fighter jock lesbian captain to the main character to the rest.  It's awesome.  The villain is an intriguing take...on an evil immortal genius but is otherwise not super important to the story, except for as a villain.  In many ways this series is a slice of life military story (at least in its first half), in that sense I don't think the villain is all that important to the show.Anyway, give the series a chance if you like mecha shows. on an evil immortal genius but is otherwise not super important to the story, except for as a villain.

Fanservice, when done right, is like a harlot standing at the edge of the street. She whispers to you, waves to you with her silken handkerchief.  And, when she gets your attention, she puts forth a leg and begins drawing up her skirt. The skin of her glossy, smooth leg begins to reveal and she keeps pulling higher and higher, only to stop at the top of the thighs. Your imagination starts running wild as you imagine everything beneath it. Black, white, purple? Hairy, shaved, smooth?As your thoughts take over, you begin...making your way to her; unable to resist the seductive lure. And as you are about make contact with her you hear an ungainly shout, ""FANSERVICE"".You turn your attention to the voice only to see another harlot with a distorted, unattractive smile across her face, running down the street with her skirt held well at the chest, revealing everything.""FANSERVICE"", she yells again. She turns left and right, baring for all to see. People turn and stare, but not out of titillation, but out of its obnoxiousness. The ruse proves ineffective as people begin to turn away and continue on about their business. This woman is Cross Ange.So there I was, sitting on a nearby bench, watching this all unfold. I too would have left if it were not for the fact that I had little else to do at this point. The woman continued to twist her face into that unsavoury smile whilst baring her underwear for passer-bys to see. But no one pays her much attention, and, after a while, she gives up and slumps home. Curious, I follow her. She arrives at a dingy house and goes inside, I follow. Standing in the doorway, I see her silhouette in the dark room. She\'s crying as she holds her hand over a book. ""PLOT"" I think was the book\'s title. But the tears are short lived as she notices me in the doorway. She turns, and that unpleasant smile begins creeping across her face once more. She lifts her skirt and shrieks, ""FANSERVICE"". Instinctively, I bolt out of there and run. I lose her after crossing the street and blending myself with another harlot. When she gives up, I return home. But with little to do, I decided to grab a pair of binoculars and watch her from afar.I watch her for several weeks. And surprisingly, she\'s not your average lunatic, though I am not implying that she isn\'t just as deranged. But there was more to her than what was initially shown. There was a warrior side to her as she\'d often hunt dragons and bounties. There was a vulnerable side to her, as she would visit a select few graves where she would sit on her knees with tears streaming down her cheeks. And of course there was the obnoxious side of her, where she\'d run through the streets yelling and baring  for all to see. But alas, my observations come to an end as nothing further develops.Overall, this woman, Cross Ange, has shown herself to be quite erratic and oblivious as to how to present herself in an appealing manner. Though she appears like this in public, there is a more sensitive and deeper side to her. And whilst I wouldn\'t say that she\'s necessarily horrible... she is, after all however... a lunatic.Review - done short:Story 7:I\'m surprised I gave this a 7. The problem with the story is that it seems to want to mash together too many concepts. It wants to include dragons because, \'oooooo\' dragons. It wants to include mechs because, \'wow\' mechs. It wants to include a god-like character because, \'hunger games underdog style tension\'. The idea of having a sheltered protagonist go from weak to strong-willed is pretty nice, Ange just gets randomly saved one too many times for me to take her seriously, not to mention the random power buff that she gains which also plagues general shounen.However, the good part is that there actually was some sort of story overall, despite its flaws.Art 7:The character designs are somewhat bland and the girls tend to not be that attractive, the backgrounds are pretty average with the smudge, oil paint sort of style. The mechs however, were decent. The strikes had force behind it, giving it weight and I did like the transformations.Character 5:The characters were so run of the mill that I would often wonder if I\'m actually watching a poorer version of To Love Ru.The male character is the typical beta male character who doesn\'t really accomplish much except this time he lacks a harem.The female characters, except for the maid, are pretty much either in a love-hate relationship with Ange or they\'re just jealous of her.Enjoyment 6:When the ecchi moments came up, it just felt forced. Instead of something that you\'d want to rewind and watch again, it was more like something you\'d want to fast forward. The character interactions were so poorly written it was like reading a high schooler\'s essay when they\'re trying to hit the 1000 word mark by using a bunch of redundant filling words. The combat, however I did find quite appealing and enjoyed that quite a bit.Overall 5:It\'s nothing to recommend.

It is large amounts of Racism, Sexism, Sexual Assault, Lesbian, Bisexual, Fan Service and Orgies. It relies on the shock factor and is completely inappropriate in 2023 and I thought it was GREAT. If you're not offended easily and can just enjoy it for what it is, it's a highly entertaining show. The protagonist Ange starts out as insufferable, however, she undergoes considerable character development which ultimately leads to her becoming quite likable. If you enjoy edgy anime e.g. Redo Healer,...Mirrai Nikki, School days etc. then this anime is for you. This anime really should have a MAL rating of 7.8-8.1. It overall has a decent story and is unpredictable. The 7.4 rating is mainly because of the second sentence above in my review and how people can be easily offended thus giving it a rating of 1/10.

Honest to god, you have to be prepared to go all the way with this show, because it has more twists and turns than a highway intersection in Houston, and a main villain so obnoxious, you\'ll be tempted to fast forward episodes just to...see their nutsack be split open with tweezers so that you can have catharsis.Animation / Art / General Visuals - 9/10-----------------------------------------------The show looks great, the animation is pretty solid. The mech action deserves extra praise because it\'s full of beautiful looking battle mechs that spit out more rounds than all the hillbilly guns in the US combined.But it\'s more than just mechs, we get beautiful female bodies in every episode. Perfect breasts and thighs galore. You won\'t find this many sizzling hot chicks anywhere else. And they do more than just sit pretty, they get themselves some ecchi action to boot.Good stuff.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 9/10------------------------------------------On point across the board.

It all kinda makes sense in the end, but it\'s best not to dwell on the details too much or the plot holes start compounding way too hard.Still, it\'s coherent enough to be thoroughly enjoyable. The show is smart enough to divide itself into pretty distinct arcs with some breathing breaks in-between, so you can get your bearings a bit.It\'s not gonna win any awards, but plenty of fun to be had.Characters - 8/10---------------------Oh boy, where to even start. This show has a pretty hefty cast list, but they\'re all enjoyable.The main character might rub the most people in a weird way because she really does go all over the place through-out the story. Things got a little annoying at some points with her flip-flopping attitude, but at least the story does try to give her some justification as to why her mental state and personality can\'t find a balance point for a while.The supporting cast is pretty good too. We have some really straight shooters whose personality is locked in as hard as stone, and we have those who hide more than one secret and flip flop all over the place. It is arguably one point I\'d criticise that too many characters ""switch sides"" so to speak, way too many times. The cast really struggles with deciding whether to be friends or enemies. But I hear that\'s how women operate, so maybe that\'s accurate to life.The main villain has got to be one of the better villains in all of anime, not because they\'re particularly special in their machinations or grand plans - no, it\'s nothing particularly new on that front - however, they are so bloody obnoxious that I would consider it reasonable to grab a knife and stab some oranges as you watch the story unfold. Cause some venting is definitely needed.We have bits and pieces of romance and light erotica, but surprisingly, the show keeps the heavy fanservice pretty uncommon. We have titties out and about in pretty much every episode, but down and dirty stuff is rare, which keeps a nice balance.

It\'s definitely very unique in it\'s very liberal female sexuality portrayal. The cast is 99% women and most seem to be gay or bi, and don\'t shy away from showing it.

Perhaps the word ecstasy would describe the show more since probably the production team was super high when making this anime. The unimaginable combos of multiple genres cramped in a 25 episodes of sex and explosions was what made it special and stand out among the rest. The story was so bad it was a brilliant roller coaster shitfest that would leave you craving for more at the end of every episode.Cross Ange was a disaster of a storyline that combines action, sci-fi, mecha and ecchi all together in...one. Despite having only 25 episodes, the pacing was so well done that the director doesn\'t even let you use the toilet. But because of it\'s rapid story progression we are in for a good ride as Cross Ange doesn\'t just live in one world, or two... but multiple worlds. Oftentimes you will find watching Cross Ange is better than taking an LSD trip because most of the things doesn\'t even make sense but it all still comes together in the end. The world of Cross Ange constantly shoves new twists and turns down your throat leaving you craving for more and wondering what would happen next at the end of every episode. Follow our main girl Ange and her bunch of pariahs as they starts off as outcast to guardians of the galaxies before finally becoming the heroes of multiple timelines. The adventure of our female rights group will surely leave you thinking why the hell not give them their rights since you probably wouldn\'t even mind being dominated by one.The art...especially character designs, were brilliantly made as each character had their very own unique and distinctive style to it. Their beautiful designs made them easily remembered and creates lasting impression. Although the female casts were ""kinda"" sexualized but nothing near the point of having physic wrecking boobies that makes you turn away. Cross Ange also presents us with a somewhat average but kinda handsome main guy and lets not forget our sassy but fabulous villian man. If you ask me my favourite girl? It has to be Ange or that sassy as f**k Hilda. Overall, the animation quality was decent although sometimes its obvious the studio yells budget cut when you saw a few recycled scenes or choppyass cgi. Nevertheless, it doesn\'t affect much of the anime itself since its few and far between.Now the sound...no beating around the bush, its darn amazing. Be it combat sequences, emotional moments or even steamy bed scenes, Cross Ange bestows you a range of beautiful and irreplaceable soundtracks that accompanies you in your jerking sessions when watching this anime. Personally, my ears had great times getting penetrated by both OPs and EDs, i found them really fits the first and second half respectively.Now, the character development was really appreciable since all the casts did get their very well deserved screen time. The diverse cast of females, specifically...had more to uncover and they did it marvelously, their character developments were completely fleshed out be it on the robot, off the robot...or even on the bed. Viewers had plentiful of opportunities to observe our casts up close and get to know them better. The male casts? Who cares! Actually, i found our main guy likeable although sometimes it felt like he was there for the female empowerment theme. And our villian guy was as cliched as ever but, his clichedness befits exactly the whole deranged storyline.**I found Cross Ange really entertaining...really daring...everything was insane, the casts were beautiful, the great adventure through multiple worlds and the world building was simply fantastic...Cross Ange felt like it was written by an uber drunk madman who was really depressed and is ready to move on to the next world in order to find a place where he truly belongs.It has a completed storyline so...bonus score!My verdict : 10/10This work of art right here is truly what i would call...a craptastic masterpiece. one.

It was leagues above my initial expectations. The storyline started out a little slow  for the first 3 episodes or so but the succeeding episodes later on reveal a absorbing plot that is a refreshing change from a lot of boiler plate anime storylines that is common place nowadays. If you are into strong willed female protagonists then this anime is for you. Ange shows great resolve without being annoyingly pigheaded and her journey from pampered princess to kick-ass warrior! The character development for this anime is awesome,  the animation is great and the soundtrack is amazing. ', 'Cross Ange seems to be an anime, that is well accepted and liked by the community.

But it turn out there was more to it than meets the eye and its reason.The anime is one of those few that goes really intense on certain subject  and one of the biggest one you will...not immidiatly is racism. There are two races, the human and the Norma..... You might as well called them ""Normal "" because that what it really come lose. anymore would just be spoilers.ok time to hit the main review of each~~~Story~~~~The story was really enjoyable, not something too original but the way they tackle it was good to me. It had a very strong starting and fallow through but the ending might have been soft  and i guess i was expecting a little more to the ending. But it doesnt live you dissatify with it just that for my preference i would have rather it otherwise but for many other they will be very happy of how it ended. To put it simply it get an actual ending.There are some cliche moment but sometime they make jokes about it but doesnt hide the fact that others are very obvious. Some of you that watch alot of anime might notice a few scene that might have been taken from other anime. Of course the anime itself has its fair share of fan services. you will notice it during the OP Vid and....... well after episode 1 you will see alot of these and i meant it.Whiles all those i mentioned above is emplimented, the story still does very well to captivate you to desire to know more about the story adn to watch it right through.To me there was no funny moment in the anime, fan services were ok but nothing for me to laugh. You might get vey upset or annoyed though but for a good reason.~~Chracters~~~The characters were all enjoyable and lovable. I wont lie, their might be some that you wish to see dead or suffer but there are alse those that you will learn to care for envualtualy.Ange gets alot of story developement, she is a strong minded caring person who you might as well say was very spoiled at first but eventually grows to be a better person.~~Art~~The art was very nice and the mixture of 3D CGI in to the anime was a good mix. Pretty much all the mecha were all 3d models. and I was very impress on how well it work with the anime. You will not be dissapointed. But there are time when you will notice some characters were also made in 3d which didnt always work but not many notice unless you pay attention to the animation. The thing is that 3d work very well with hard surface objects like vehicles building etc, but things that has alot of movements our eye will perceive as strange.The color palette use in the anime might be in my opinion to bright but doesnt take away the dark feel to the anime.~~Sound~~I found myself self enjoying alot of the music scores of the anime, especially the one that you first hear in the episode 1 after a few second and the faster versions. There is nothign to complain  about any of the soundtrack. If i had to put it in this way, there are some that i will gladly listen on my ipod but not all.~~Overall~~I really did enjoy this anime and i really mean it. ive been watch anime for logn time so i develope a habit of not liking to wait for anime every week for it to be release and would rather wait till it was done. Well this one got me good and i really did wait every weel for it wanting more as the story progress.I would recommend this anime to any that love mecha fighting, survival and stupid humanPeece not immidiatly is racism.

Do you enjoy female fanservice? If you didn\'t answer yes to both of these questions, then don\'t watch this show.This anime is basically everything that your friend, parent, or significant other say that anime is in a demeaning way: overblown, oversexualized, and totally ridiculous. Usually, I could have a defense for all of those things, but for this show, there is no defense.Cross Ange seems very self-aware in the strangest and most demeaning way possible. Essentially, the show\'s premise is that a marginalized group of non-magic (Mana) wielding humans (all female) called Norma are...forced to fight gruesome(?) battles against DRAGONs who appear from holes in the sky in mechs. It has plot twists, crossing dimensions, crossing time, and overall something out of the mind of a 12 year old boy. That coming along with a narrative filled with plot holes and narrative choices which don\'t make much sense or are consistent. Every kind of ass-pull, anime trope, and cheap emotional effect are used. Sometimes these are used well. Sometimes, these can even be forgiven. But when they happens in practically every episode, then the story becomes a montage of weird.The only reason I watched this monstrosity through is the character writing. This show certainly is character driven, beginning with the main character. Initially a pampered princess, Ange transforms into a cold, distant person. Her personality is used as emotional armor against what is presented as a potentially deadly scenario for her as a Norma ""para-mail"" pilot. This change is actually dealt with fairly well, and that\'s only within 3 episodes. What\'s great about her character is that she consistently subverts the expectation that protagonist mecha pilots have to show mercy, compassion, or the like. The rest of the show gradually works her towards a more balanced direction. This made sense and seemed to be the central element of the show, and the show was at its best when developing her character.Most of the supporting characters get minimal backstory treatment, and many actions seem unmotivated at worst. Some of this is a matter of presentation and execution, but there\'s really no points for effort here. However, a couple of side characters have nice narrative moments and relatively sensible arcs: Tusk, Hilda, and Momoka among them. Furthermore, I sort of liked the cool psychological evil of Embryo as a villain, though he is the epitome of a lack of power ceiling.Now onto the most troubling part of this anime: the sex. The show, for the first few episodes, is obsessed with women using sex as a means of control against other women. It\'s kind of disgustingly presented as fanservice at most parts, and is slightly sickening. This kind of makes sense with the situation presented though, being an all-women\'s prison/military base. Fine, but then don\'t try and re-present these characters as morally just characters later in the series! Furthermore, later in the show, having male-female sex seems to be some point of ""purity/impurity""...which even more undermines the position the show originally takes. For a show supposedly presenting a vision of women as powerful figures, this show certainly has shotty decisions leading up to this point in that respect.The OP was originally fine, but then they decided when they were going to do a new OP that reusing animations from the first OP would go unnoticed...it didn\'t. Furthermore, the soundtrack was medicore at best. I didn\'t really think that the main ""song"" of the anime was particularly good or even used correctly. There are these laughable moments when the VA goes to sing this song and the recorded track, with no transition and full background music, plays as the character sings along. The idea was good, implementation was not.There\'s not much to say about the art. I thought it served the purpose fairly well without adding to or getting in the way of what was mainly a horrible story. There wasn\'t much about the animation which necessarily stood out, except for the bodies of questionably aged girls.Overall, this anime should not be watched by anyone who takes themselves seriously. I can\'t tell whether this was a serious project or a money grab for studio Sunrise. It seems as though there were some subtle nods here and there to the latter in the anime, but it\'s no roast. It\'s not even bad enough to be funny at most parts. If you want to watch blonde Lara Croft fight dragons in a Gundam and you absolutely don\'t care about anything else, this is your show. If not, stay away. forced to fight gruesome(?) battles against DRAGONs who appear from holes in the sky in mechs.

Eager because I've always loved Sunrise mecha anime that comes with a original storyline, Escaflowne and Code Geass being prime examples of greatness that was achieved in the past. Dreading it also due to negative comments from my friends who watched it and said it was full of fanservice, ecchi and only worthwhile to watch if your into Yuri. I have nothing against any of those things but in high dosage they can be off-putting, and so finally with lots of mixed feelings I began to watch...Cross Ange.-----LONG REVIEW BELOW------Cross Ange starts off as a very innocuous anime with no particular theme, focusing on a fantasy Earth where people use 'magic' and hates on Norma 'muggles' who don't have magic. The main character Angelise (Ange) is discovered to be a Norma and shipped off to an isolated island where the government keeps other Norma. Seems simple enough, on the island the girls (because only girls are born Norma) have plenty of time on their hands to indulge in Yuri sex and the anime is not afraid to showcase nudity. The premise of the anime seems set, viewers are treated to episodes of near naked girls with curves who grope and have sex with each other for fun. Definitely heaven for any (horny) guy. Battles and mecha fighting appears to be a natural addition to the fanservice and ecchi appeal of the anime because mecha suits are naturally skin tight and skimpy and leaves nothing to the imagination. The mecha also happens to transform into a motorbike thing and so the girls naturally fall into a hands&knees ass up position when controlling it, fantastic for any guy who have a thing for tough girls and motorcycle fantasy.Just when it seems things can't get any better for the men who are watching Cross Ange, it gets worse. A guy is introduced, named Tusk (note this anime has horrendous naming sense) to ruin the Yuri fantasy and to add a Het. element to the show slowly driving it toward a multi genre anime of Yuri and Het. Tusk to note has only one stand out quality, and that is the ability to face plant whenever chance happens into Ange's crotch. Ange and Tusk's interaction is the running gag of the anime, and appears at times to be satire due to the frequency of Tusk's face plants, and at others parody of famous het pairings in Sunrise's production most notably when Ange screams at Tusk 'Osuwari' to sit. You can also draw a similarity to Kira Yamoto who Tusk bare a strong resemblance to and naturally his relationship with a certain 'princess'. Thankfully Tusk is a minor character and only appears infrequently to ruin Yuri fantasy for men watching Cross Ange.If the first half of Cross Ange is about Yuri, ecchi, het, nudity and fantasy. The second half of Cross Ange is about harem, sci-fi, mecha, war and romance, think Code Geass crossed over with No Game No Life taking harem, romance, alternate reality, magic from No Game No Life and war, mecha, sci-fi from Code Geass. It feels like the writers were experimenting with the anime not knowing what theme to focus on yet wanting to have everything. Ideas were being tossed together into a blender and being thrown out worse than before and hopelessly tangled with other strands of ideas. Time became a constraint since the anime only started developing story and plot 1/3 of the way in. So in terms of pacing Cross Ange feels like it was running a marathon only to realize it was in fact a 500meter race and they have fallen hopelessly behind. Therefore the later half of the anime became a mad dash towards the finishing line disregarding any attempt at pacing, and with no attention to detail for the story which was full of holes and unanswered questions. The closer the anime got to the finishing line each episode felt more random and pieced together with no prior thought, as if the the writers were deciding on a whim 'the next episode will be a battle scene' and 'the one after will be sex on a beach'. Any attempt at rationalizing the anime was thrown out the window as characters seemingly died under circumstances that were impossible to escape yet ten minutes later emerges completely unharmed.The crux of the shoddy plot in large began with the emergence of the villain Embryo, who posses a god complex with a name to match that implies the opposite, as if only to exacerbate the running gag that is Cross Ange. Embryo's appearance spearheads the plot into a world wide, cross species, trans-reality war between three races; the Norma, true humans, and fake humans. Minor characters who before played no further role than being exploited as fan service and Yuri suddenly became important, both as chess pieces and as material for the developing harem revolving around Embryo and his fantasies. Ange who received the bulk of character development in the first half of the anime becomes reduced in the second half. Her determination, fighting spirit, and violence to do justice for the ones who wronged her was what made her an admirable character because viewers found sympathy and empowerment in her cause. However the second half of the anime turned her from a Jeanne D'Arc into a Damsel in Distress who is herself victimized at every turn by Embryo. Tusk thus establishes himself as a main character due to his vital role in rescuing the Damsel in Distress aka Ange from her tormentor and captor.In the end I didn't regret watching Cross Ange, somehow it fell exactly into my preference for spaceships, and grand battles with mecha blowing things up. The mecha designs were unique being less bulky than usual and compacted with thin limbs to fit a female pilot, and the action was exactly what i signed up for. The music was average in the opening and ending theme, but better during parts where the voice actors sang the verses themselves; the song of choice had a special meaning in the anime and was quite catchy.Finally one of the aspects of Cross Ange I personally enjoyed the most was the total lack of modesty and things like propriety was thrown out the window. Skin and lots of skinship was shown not always as fanservice but more as a natural part of being self. It's refreshing to watch behaviour wise the complete lack of conformity to social expectations the characters enacted. Freedom is not only in choices but also in the mind as characters like Ange and Hilde shows us. Cross Ange.-----LONG REVIEW BELOW------Cross Ange starts off as a very innocuous anime with no particular theme, focusing on a fantasy Earth where people use 'magic' and hates on Norma 'muggles' who don't have magic.

Thankfully Tusk is a minor character and only appears infrequently to ruin Yuri fantasy for men watching Cross Ange.If the first half of Cross Ange is about Yuri, ecchi, het, nudity and fantasy. The second half of Cross Ange is about harem, sci-fi, mecha, war and romance, think Code Geass crossed over with No Game No Life taking harem, romance, alternate reality, magic from No Game No Life and war, mecha, sci-fi from Code Geass. It feels like the writers were experimenting with the anime not knowing what theme to focus on yet wanting to have everything. Ideas were being tossed together into a blender and being thrown out worse than before and hopelessly tangled with other strands of ideas. Time became a constraint since the anime only started developing story and plot 1/3 of the way in. So in terms of pacing Cross Ange feels like it was running a marathon only to realize it was in fact a 500meter race and they have fallen hopelessly behind. Therefore the later half of the anime became a mad dash towards the finishing line disregarding any attempt at pacing, and with no attention to detail for the story which was full of holes and unanswered questions. The closer the anime got to the finishing line each episode felt more random and pieced together with no prior thought, as if the the writers were deciding on a whim 'the next episode will be a battle scene' and 'the one after will be sex on a beach'. Any attempt at rationalizing the anime was thrown out the window as characters seemingly died under circumstances that were impossible to escape yet ten minutes later emerges completely unharmed.The crux of the shoddy plot in large began with the emergence of the villain Embryo, who posses a god complex with a name to match that implies the opposite, as if only to exacerbate the running gag that is Cross Ange. Embryo's appearance spearheads the plot into a world wide, cross species, trans-reality war between three races; the Norma, true humans, and fake humans. Minor characters who before played no further role than being exploited as fan service and Yuri suddenly became important, both as chess pieces and as material for the developing harem revolving around Embryo and his fantasies. Ange who received the bulk of character development in the first half of the anime becomes reduced in the second half. Her determination, fighting spirit, and violence to do justice for the ones who wronged her was what made her an admirable character because viewers found sympathy and empowerment in her cause. However the second half of the anime turned her from a Jeanne D'Arc into a Damsel in Distress who is herself victimized at every turn by Embryo. Tusk thus establishes himself as a main character due to his vital role in rescuing the Damsel in Distress aka Ange from her tormentor and captor.In the end I didn't regret watching Cross Ange, somehow it fell exactly into my preference for spaceships, and grand battles with mecha blowing things up. The mecha designs were unique being less bulky than usual and compacted with thin limbs to fit a female pilot, and the action was exactly what i signed up for. The music was average in the opening and ending theme, but better during parts where the voice actors sang the verses themselves; the song of choice had a special meaning in the anime and was quite catchy.Finally one of the aspects of Cross Ange I personally enjoyed the most was the total lack of modesty and things like propriety was thrown out the window. Skin and lots of skinship was shown not always as fanservice but more as a natural part of being self. It's refreshing to watch behaviour wise the complete lack of conformity to social expectations the characters enacted. Freedom is not only in choices but also in the mind as characters like Ange and Hilde shows us."", 'Many Spoilers Below.I was told that ""Cross Ange is worse than Mirai Nikki."" I did not believe it. Let me assure you, Cross Ange is worse than Mirai Nikki. None of the characters here are interesting, nor do they have any semblance of rational thought. Tusk, in particular, drags the show down. He has got to be the least intelligent male lead in any show I have ever seen. He is constantly failing to do things, usually because he falls into Ange\'s crotch and gets beaten up by her. He survives an explosion based on the completely logical explanation : ""The knight of Ange is...invincible!"" Shortly after, in the episode preview, it is explained that in between detonating the explosives strapped to his chest and not-dying immediately, Tusk was able to become a ninja and switch to fire-proof clothing because, of course, that will save you from any explosion. Momoka survives falling off a cliff, and a separate explosion from the aforementioned. At least they explained that her gunshot wound was prevented by a conveniently placed object. My eyes were opened, what masterful turnarounds. Embryo-sama, one suave man, let me tell you. He is the embodiment of power, can alter space and time, yet he can\'t pop a stiffie. Jill and Salia are literally the same character. Vivian was surprisingly one of the less annoying characters, despite appearing like a trope initially. Hilda was probably my favorite. In the beginning she\'s mean, but she comes around. I also shipped her with Ange, and when Ange kissed her, that was pretty much the only time in the show when I was thinking, ""oh that\'d be good!"" and then it happens. Not saying I am a masterful storyteller and have professional analysis skills, just saying disappointment shouldn\'t be around EVERY CORNER. Bottom line, while these things are mostly my opinion, bottom line is the show is uninteresting, has bad twists, bad characters, below-par animation, and a decent OST. Now here\'s a fact: in episode 5, Ange tells Tusk her name, despite having previously written it on a posted bulletin in which she attached to the drapes separating her space in the cave from Tusk\'s, and it reads, ""Ange\'s Space.""

Sure, it was grimdark and dirty, with gratuitous fanservice and violence. But if that’s your cup of tea, the initial setup and writing was pretty good. Ange’s determination to be the best mercenary prisoner was engaging, her rivalries and battles with fellow pilots were interesting, and the underhanded prison setting was different with its bartering and infighting. It was by no means ever high art, but it was fun to watch and only seemed to be getting better. When Ange and Hilda bond, become a duo, and plan on destroying the rotten world,...I was thrilled.But…as a lot of stories do, Cross Ange tripped. Then stumbled again. Then fell flat on its face, drug anyone around down with it, and shoved its viewers faces into the dirt. Cross Ange became a disappointing, joyless, and uninspired show to watch, and the only thing that kept me going was the fact I used to enjoy it SO MUCH, surely there was SOMETHING good left in it? But no, Cross Ange only got worse and worse, and the latter half and finale almost feel like a personal and vigorous middle finger to anyone who enjoyed its first cour.While degenerations like this aren’t unheard of, it is rare for such a clear highlighting of what caused its downfall. But in this case, it seems to be Mitsuo Fukuda and every change he made. Fukuda created the massively popular Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny that reinvigorated a dying Gundam franchise in the early 2000’s and seemed to have been given complete – or at least way too much – control over this series. Despite being the producer, in interviews the director and writer seem to be mere yes men, and nod and smile as they watch Fukuda discuss mangling their original concept. Plotlines were dropped (like Ange/Hilda, Ange’s entire character development, and…whatever was supposed to happen with Salamandinay and didn’t) to make room for Fukuda’s self-insert Tusk, who according to interviews was initially supposed to be a minor character who died and left the story. Tusk takes away any character’s development, agency, and even sexual orientation and embodies everything wrong with the worst bland harem power fantasy leads…despite this not even being the genre for that? And any rewrite, character or plot, was only made worse, and then made worse again once holes came up, if they were addressed at all. (Remember when Salia was a character and not a literal joke?) Every character that was either good, passable, or had decent moments becomes hollow, cliché, and usually contradictory to the majority of the story. The ending feels like a completely different story, and not in a “look how far we’ve come way”, but a very obvious hijacking of artistic integrity that was rushed to with no coherent effort. The finale left me wishing I never wasted time on Cross Ange, but unable to hate it fully because while the ending is one of the worst things I’ve seen in recent anime, the initial cour, or at least first 8 episodes were so good, even on rewatch.

Cross Ange is a cautionary tale of giving too much power to producers who have no investment in the original product without drastically changing it to…whatever Fukada did with it.', 'Thirteen years ago, Fukuda Mitsuo was a name that became taboo across the lips of Gundam lovers far and wide for his hand in the creation of Gundam Seed Destiny and the much-maligned character of Shinn Asuka. Ten years on, he creates Cross Ange, a work with many underlying similarities to Destiny, however, infinitely superior due to certain tweaks and adjustments. Cross Ange centres around Ange, a royal princess who at her coming of age ceremony is uncovered to be a Norma, a term for those who cannot use magic and are treated as monsters by society. At its fundamental core, it explores the idea...of a character redefining their perception of humanity as well as following a girl whom has lost everything that she once had and has to rediscover her identity and purpose in the world.As an audience diving into the first episode of Cross Ange I can say I remained hopeful but unimpressed. The pacing was rushed, the animation quality inconsistent and the characters felt like a cheap ripoff from Code Geass with an unnecessary sprinkling of fanservice. So many fundamental principles of storytelling were broken in that first episode and the show looked destined to be a trainwreck. Glimpses of rough-cut quality were buried underneath a shockingly paced series of events and an obnoxious protagonist whom reflected the deep-cut nature of racism and bigotry within this dystopian society. However buoyed by the positive things I had heard about Cross Ange, I plowed on. The story writing did not improve. Ridiculous plot twists were tossed around and used at ten times the frequency of a typical Sunrise anime. Whenever there was downtime in the fighting, yuri action littered the story as if to forcefully entertain its audience. The plot went through all sorts of nonsensical ridiculousness from dragons to alternate dimeonsions and fighting an immortal god. In writing it is not possible to make the plot of Cross Ange sound palatable. However, this is an extremely rare example where the sum of the parts far exceeded my expectations.Firstly, I have to digress that not everything about the writing is a travesty. The willingness that Cross Ange expresses in killing of characters is extremely refreshing and provides a genuine sense of urgency and risk to every single scene. Contrasting this to the last mecha show I watched, Darling in the Franxx, is night and day since that anime collapsed under the weight of a lengthy cast that received neither sufficient character development to make a difference, nor suffered any casualties to fish for some cheap feels.In my opinion, a huge part of the reason why this anime succeeds is because of its self-awareness. The fourth wall is broken on a frequent basis and as the show continues, it becomes clear that the writers understand that the writing is atrocious to say the least. The show degenerates into self-mockery to the point where as a viewer, it is not possible to treat the story seriously any more. And once that point is understood, Cross Ange truly blooms into a marvellous form of entertainment.Whilst the writing of Cross Ange never truly improved, there is one thing that Cross Ange did better than any other anime I have ever watched. And that is the manner it was able to believably transform an arrogant pampered princess with a thoroughly condescending attitude into the greatest protagonist in animated history. People often say “no pain, no gain”. Ange is an amazing character like none other and the enormous amount of character development that she undergoes through the course of the entire show is what makes it so sweet. Her surrounding cast is similarly developed far beyond the simple cliched shells that they wore at the beginning of the show into multifaceted characters who evoke powerful emotions in the audience by themselves. On the other hand, the final villain feels like the director’s self-insert as an otaku fan and has truly laughably questionable motivations for wishing to destroy the world. However, the show understands its own farcical nature and makes plenty of self-aware jokes at the antagonist’s expense.At the end of the day, what truly makes Cross Ange great, is the manner in which the fundamental principles which underline the show are developed and expressed. Despite the mortifying storytelling and writing, Cross Ange expresses masterful control over the themes of racism and information control, prompting all of us to ask ourselves the age-old question of “what is human?”.Cross Ange is about accompanying Ange every step of the way as she seeks to answer this question herself in a brutal world filled with the most nonsensical of plot devices, and fighting against her own destiny. Ten years on from the completion of Gundam Seed Destiny, Fukuda has truly redeemed himself to the mecha genre with a protagonist as good as any in the business, resulting in the best show Sunrise has made since the turn of the decade. of a character redefining their perception of humanity as well as following a girl whom has lost everything that she once had and has to rediscover her identity and purpose in the world.As an audience diving into the first episode of Cross Ange I can say I remained hopeful but unimpressed.

Contrasting this to the last mecha show I watched, Darling in the Franxx, is night and day since that anime collapsed under the weight of a lengthy cast that received neither sufficient character development to make a difference, nor suffered any casualties to fish for some cheap feels.In my opinion, a huge part of the reason why this anime succeeds is because of its self-awareness. The fourth wall is broken on a frequent basis and as the show continues, it becomes clear that the writers understand that the writing is atrocious to say the least. The show degenerates into self-mockery to the point where as a viewer, it is not possible to treat the story seriously any more. And once that point is understood, Cross Ange truly blooms into a marvellous form of entertainment.Whilst the writing of Cross Ange never truly improved, there is one thing that Cross Ange did better than any other anime I have ever watched. And that is the manner it was able to believably transform an arrogant pampered princess with a thoroughly condescending attitude into the greatest protagonist in animated history. People often say “no pain, no gain”. Ange is an amazing character like none other and the enormous amount of character development that she undergoes through the course of the entire show is what makes it so sweet. Her surrounding cast is similarly developed far beyond the simple cliched shells that they wore at the beginning of the show into multifaceted characters who evoke powerful emotions in the audience by themselves. On the other hand, the final villain feels like the director’s self-insert as an otaku fan and has truly laughably questionable motivations for wishing to destroy the world. However, the show understands its own farcical nature and makes plenty of self-aware jokes at the antagonist’s expense.At the end of the day, what truly makes Cross Ange great, is the manner in which the fundamental principles which underline the show are developed and expressed. Despite the mortifying storytelling and writing, Cross Ange expresses masterful control over the themes of racism and information control, prompting all of us to ask ourselves the age-old question of “what is human?”.Cross Ange is about accompanying Ange every step of the way as she seeks to answer this question herself in a brutal world filled with the most nonsensical of plot devices, and fighting against her own destiny. Ten years on from the completion of Gundam Seed Destiny, Fukuda has truly redeemed himself to the mecha genre with a protagonist as good as any in the business, resulting in the best show Sunrise has made since the turn of the decade.', ""This is probably the most embarrassing review that I will ever write on this site. I am probably giving this show way too much credit (but I have watched so many mid shows over the last two months that I don’t care at this point).Cross Ange is flawed. There’s TONS of plot armour… and I mean TONS of IT, some plot holes too, inconsistent characterisation, overexaggerated characters, somewhat boring fights, and a few characters arcs which could’ve been executed better (e.g. Salia and Jill).But I will say this though. I was never bored watching it - I was pretty entertained all throughout. I can’t...even say that for some of the anime I have given 9s to and, for that, I respect it. I could even look past some of the plot holes because of it. It can be very well-written at times.I only checked this anime out on a whim, to be honest - I think someone on MAL had Ange in their favourites and I thought Ange’s design looked pretty cool. I only was planning to watch the first episode but I surprised myself with how much I was hooked by it. I think high watchability is one of the criteria for a better-than-average show for me. It is especially impressive since I am not at all keen on the fantasy genre.Yeah, it is a bit suggestive and fan-servicey (lots of scantily-clad, almost naked girls). It’s not really my cup of tea personally, but I guess it makes it somewhat stimulating??? I don’t know - my sexuality is a mess. It certainly not what I watched the show for (unlike most people who watched this, probably xD).I think they should have gone all out with some of the nudity (like Elfen Lied etc.). It got a bit silly after a while when there 'just happened' to be a bright flash of light that covered a character's nipples or something. It felt very Austin Powers-y, which I don't think a dark show like this one should be reminding me of haha.I think this show’s greatest triumph is what it explores thematically. It is a bit messy but, overall, I think they did a damn good job and it makes the show really interesting.It’s such a thematically-rich show full of interesting commentary on humanity (it especially captures the ugliness and hypocrisy of humanity) and the desire for a utopian society (is the pursuit for a utopian society really worth it?), through exploring and questioning privilege, exploitation, class, war and even capitalism. Moreover, more individual ideas like trust, the limits of forgiveness, and empathy are explored too. There are many more that I haven't listed.I like how dark and gritty this anime can be at times. In fact, I sort of wish it was a bit darker and more people were killed (I think that could've helped raise the stakes and boost the themes of the show even more). However, I think it also balances humour with the darkness of the show well - especially sassy humour, which you can easily get from characters like Ange. I didn't mind the more crude humour too (I guess for a show with a lot of fan service, it's a necessity). Even though it was a bit overplayed, that running gag with Tusk and Ange accidentally finding themselves in compromising situations got a laugh out of me.The characters are okay overall - some are written better than others, of course, with some tropey and basic writing. There are a lot of characters but it never feels too crowded - they all do their part. The voice acting is of great quality.I really like Ange. She’s a character you can really root for, despite her flaws. Her character growth - and the way she begins to see the world and life - is definitely something I got invested in. They really use that to the show's advantage. Tusk is very sweet and gentle too - I was actually quite surprised when I found out that Mamoru Miyano voices him. I tend to associate him with more flamboyant characters. Ange and Tusk compliment each other well.Some of the villains are a bit too maniacal and one-dimension though. I wish they were a bit more complex. Julio is a good example. It can feel a bit melodramatic, although I thought the main villain was actually quite menacing actually! He really creeped me out.As I mentioned before, the fight scenes were a bit boring (to me, at least)... but I like the last few fight scenes. The fight scenes definitely get more thrilling as the show goes on and the stakes are raised a bit more. I think there are generally well-animated.The music is okay, I guess; a bit repetitive. The main song that’s featured throughout the anime (that one Ange sings all the time) gets a bit tiresome after a while. It was a bit cheesy to have songs unlock powers, to be honest. But I liked the OPs and EDs though - they really got me pumped up for what was to come!Let me tell you, when I heard the first line of that second OP, I immediately smiled ear-to-ear at the realisation of who was singing. Even 19 years after doing the Evangelion OP, Yoko Takahashi still sounds great! I love that OP - it’s become one of my favourites.To sum up, had it been written more cohesively, 'Cross Ange' could have been something really special. Otherwise, they tried their best and it was a decent result. Thanks for the pleasant surprise.Strong 7. even say that for some of the anime I have given 9s to and, for that, I respect it.

The art is awesome, the music absolutely stunning, I really enjoyed the full extend of it.If I have to put a negative point is the male character, a bit weak, it remminded me the classic mc of a harem anime, really didn't like it and the stupid fan service with him of any harem character and the other but would be...the excesive fan service sometimes, luckly is not the whole time. the excesive fan service sometimes, luckly is not the whole time."", 'Unapologetic otaku bait. Mechs, fanservice, lesbian fanservice, and melodrama all around. I love it.I\'m glad I discovered this in 2020 having been really into Gundam Seed and Seed Destiny back in the day. It\'s basically Gundam Seed/Destiny but with neither the heavy-handed moralizing of the Gundam franchise nor the pretense that that the show should appeal to all demographics.Cross Ange doesn\'t reinvent the wheel, but boy does it take you for a fun spin. Characters are compelling (you rarely feel ""meh"" about them), fights were nothing to write home about, and the hormonal drama is so thick you could drink it.The show knows what...it\'s doing and does it well. 8/10 it\'s doing and does it well. 8/10', ""Surprisingly solid for an ecchi action-drama anime mix, Cross Ange explores our titular heroine, Ange, being exiled from her kingdom as a princess when it is discovered that she hasn't inherited the ability to use magic like the majority of humankind and is forced into serving as a mech pilot to combat enemy dragons that enter into her world. But as Ange fights on against said dragons, she comes to realize that the nature of the world is not as what as it would seem on the surface when she discovers some shocking truths concerning it.Before I get into what makes the series solid for...the most part, let us explore the rather obvious barrier that will keep many from considering watching this series in the form of its ecchi content. While not as hard with perverted content as titles like Seikon no Qwaser, Cross Ange still tosses in the typical elements of the genre that include scantily-clad attire for the female mech pilots, lingerie and bikini shots, lesbians, sexual humor that includes a running gag of Tusk falling into Ange's crotch, breast groping, bathing scenes, scenes of implied or full-on intercourse, and non-detailed nudity on prominent display. The first third of the series devotes a good deal of its time on its perverted shenanigans and has been known to turn-off first time viewers of the series. While some of these bits do carry over into later episodes, the series fortunately reduces its focus on them as the plot becomes more focused on exploring the truths that Ange comes to discover about her world.What allows Cross Ange to stick out from many of the typical mindless ecchi romps is the engaging storytelling and character exploration it offers up from the events affecting Ange and other non-magic folk. The world that Ange lives in considers non-magic folk to be societal outcasts and are isolated from society upon being discovered. Facing this prejudice upon having her non-magical origins discovered affects Ange's psyche a great deal throughout the span of the series as she becomes cold and detached from others due to the fear and mistrust she develops from being discriminated against and forced into fighting dragons. As she spends more time with the non-magic folk and learns of some shocking truths to how her world is ruled, this drives her to eventually defy the established world order of the series. This development also extends to other non-magic folk in the series as Cross Ange devotes time to exploring the pasts of several of the mech pilots that led them into their present predicaments and develops a number of the characters and their relationships with others. The later villain revealed in the series, Embryo, is also a rather cunning and manipulative one with his knowledge of the world's hostilities and technology, and taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of several characters to bring them to his side.Outside of the ecchi content, Cross Ange does have some shortcomings in regards to its plotting and characters. There are some unexplored plot elements and holes (Ange and Salamandinay's past connections and how Tusk survives a seemingly suicidal attack being notable ones), and some characters get little fleshing out to make them as irredeemably or over-the-top evil as possible.Still if you can tolerate the regular sights of ecchi to be found through Cross Ange, it still makes for one of the better quality offerings of the genre thanks to its solid exploration of the issues surrounding its world and how they affect Ange and other non-magic characters. the most part, let us explore the rather obvious barrier that will keep many from considering watching this series in the form of its ecchi content.

The main protagonist's(Ange) character development throughout the series flows nicely and is believable.After the first episode, I figured this would be just another ecchi anime, but I was thoroughly and enjoyably surprised.  I think the artwork and quality are top-notch and the music is wonderful and on-point in emphasizing emotion ion all the important scenes.The first episode is what I believe turns a lot of people off...from giving this anime a fair shake.  Watch the first 3 then decide for yourself. from giving this anime a fair shake.  Watch the first 3 then decide for yourself."", ""Despite the score this has on MAL, despite some of the reviews this is getting, this is undoubtable one of the GOATS of the industry.The story is is amazing. No real surprise from the studio behind Code Geass and other giants, but it needs to be said. The pace is almost perfect, there is never a dull moment, and new twists and developments are revealed in such a way to constantly keep the viewed engaged and entertained. Its not quite as grand in scale as Code Geass, but it also doesn't have nearly as many plot holes if you wanted to start nit picking.The...art is amazing. The mechs, the characters, the landscapes and the dragons are look very lovingly crafted. Nothing to complain about here. To follow up on this, the animation is also great. The use of 3d is done well and doesnt trigger uncanny valley.The sound is AMAZING. The first opening theme is an absolute banger, and the second opening theme, as well as the two credit songs, are also amazing. And the voice actresses absolutely kill it with the El Ragna song that is a key theme to the show. And all the voice actors and accesses did an amazing job with their characters.The Characters are the main reason im personally considering this a personal Greatest of All Time show. Every single main and side character has massive attention paid to having their character developed through the show. Some start out well liked and through their actions become someone you're rooting against. Some start off antagonistic, and you end up really enjoying where they take that character. Some are antagonistic, go through a redemption arc, and then become disliked again. I could go on. The point is that each main and side character was paid massive attention to.  Most importantly, each change the characters go through MAKES SENSE. They react and change appropriately to the actions and events going on in the show. Its awesome to see. The team that put this together did an absolutely wonderful job with the layers upon layers of character development in this showThe show is obviously enjoyable. Its funny. Its crass. It's sexy. Its edge of your seat action sequences while you sit there with a large grin on your face. There's appropriate angst. There is, despite all the nudity in the show, actually very little fanservice. Fanservice being, in my mind, nudity/sexual shit thrown in simply for the sake of it; to please the viewer. Cutesy, silly shit that while fun, isn't good storytelling.  But almost all of the nudity/sex scenes here are actually very important to developing the characters and their relationships to each other.An example would be the flight suits. Ange hates the idea of wearing it. She's a princess and it looks slutty and she doesnt want to wear it. Vice Captain says fuck it. You don't want to get in line and wear it? Naked into the hallway you go. Does Ange like that? Nope, so she falls in line and puts it on, and that is the beginning of the sometimes antagonistic relationship between those two characters during the show while also being the beginning on Ange toughening up. And that's just one example. The team clearly wanted to show off their characters, but also wanted to tell a serious story and do a good job of it, and they absolutely succeeded.I'll say it again. All in all, this is a GOAT of the industry. If you like Mecha genre, you need to give this a watch. If you don't like Mecha genre, you should probably still give this a watch.

Absolutely not, but despite it\'s one major flaw I took great enjoyment in watching it.I\'m going to get this out of the way right now though. This show uses fanservice as a means of buying your attention and at times it can be infuriatingly bad because of it. Despite this however, the show does attempt to use most of it for the sake of progressing the stories and the characters so to a point it can be forgiven. The fanservice is not as bad as some might lead you to...believing and it is at its worst towards the beginning and levels off fairly quickly. I\'m not a person who automatically loathes nor condones fanservice so long as sexualtiy is a theme in the story or characters and is at least used for building. Kill la Kill is a good example of a show that uses sexuality and fanservice to convey a message. Cross Ange however falls a bit short in this reguard. The fanservice most of the time is just that, fanservice. But to the show\'s credit once the ball gets rolling it focuses on the characters and the story first.With that out of the way, I will move on to what I enjoyed. The story was quite good. I never got to the point where I was bored with a setting or a situation because the plot stayed dynamic and the stakes kept rising. The world is interesting and you get a better understanding of things as the story progresses. That said it isn\'t quite perfect. It does use some conveniences and a couple of twists are a little hard to believe but these are minor problems.The Art and Sound I rated about the same. They were both fairly standard with nothing terribly eye-catching or ghastly. The DRAGONs have fairly unique designs though I wish they would have been fleshed out a little better with a little more distinct variety. Additionally the Para-mails and later the Ragna-mails could have used more variety, unlike a show like Code Geass where different models are distinct yet clearly from the same base, the Mails from Cross Ange are mostly generic with slight color changes just so you can tell who is who. Additionally the show makes use of some stock footage which I noticed more and more towards the end and of course CGI. Nothing spectacular but I didn\'t hate it. The First OP was by far my favorite while the second was a bit lack-luster to me, as were both primary ED songs.  The internal soundtrack doesn\'t include too much that was overtly interesting. The three character songs were interesting and I wish I had that Operatic vocal track on loop but oh well.The meat and potatoes of this show is the characters. Watching Ange evolve through the course of the story was a treat and was a pleasure in comparison to the rather stagnate female characters and archetypes of other shows in recent history. At her worst she is a bit of a typical tsundere but she makes up for it at her best. The supporting cast is also fairly enjoyable. Some could have been played up or been more involved but I forgive them as it is a fairly large cast and it is a fairly short run or episodes. The main support cast are all lively and like Ange all go through a metamorphosis as the show progresses. All of the characters have stakes that effect their decisions and none of the characters seem to make choices merely because ""the plot demanded it."" Friends become enemies, enemies become friends. It\'s a dynamic experience to be sure. My only complaint is with two characters, Julio and Sylvia. Anybody who has seen Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion will recognize these characters immediately as they seem to have been pulled straight from that anime, Sylvia in particular at first glance seems to be a Nunnaly clone (admittedly with some twists that I won\'t spoil) and Julio is a slightly more interesting Clovis Clone.*Since I have brought it up I also wish to bring up that this anime has taken some major inspirations from Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, which works for better or for worst. Both follow an anti-hero character who is an exiled royal who are fighting against the status quo with science and magic constantly getting involved.  Don\'t get me wrong, I like Code Geass and it was fun spotting the inspirations but I do wish they would have striven to be a little more subtle. But beyond that I don\'t think it ruins the integrity of Ange\'s story.I loved Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons. I binge watched it over the course of three days and I wouldn\'t mind owning it on my shelf at home. Despite its problems I was happily watching along and I couldn\'t wait to see what was coming next.Overall Cross Ange is a bit of an underrated gem. Yes it has problems but I think the good outweighs the bad in this scenario. Yes, it uses boobs and robots to attract a shonen audience, but so did Aim For The Top: Gunbuster, the anime that I hold as my all time favorite anime, and that show had visible nipples. Cross Ange despite its flaws and despite its fanservice is worth the watch. I highly recommend it.

But beyond that I don\'t think it ruins the integrity of Ange\'s story.I loved Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons. I binge watched it over the course of three days and I wouldn\'t mind owning it on my shelf at home. Despite its problems I was happily watching along and I couldn\'t wait to see what was coming next.Overall Cross Ange is a bit of an underrated gem. Yes it has problems but I think the good outweighs the bad in this scenario. Yes, it uses boobs and robots to attract a shonen audience, but so did Aim For The Top: Gunbuster, the anime that I hold as my all time favorite anime, and that show had visible nipples. Cross Ange despite its flaws and despite its fanservice is worth the watch. I highly recommend it. Just give it a shot.', ""Alright. So, first off, I agree with Nyron in all points.Cross Ange is a giant trainwreck. By watching it, you will likely experience some levels of self-hatred and you will most definitely question your sanity and self-respect, but.If you're the type of person who's in for that - you'll usually know after the first or first three episodes - you'll get a heckload of enjoyment out of it.If not, move on, call it a day. Simple as that.Story - 7. Now, don't get me wrong. I adore the plot. Especially the way it goes up to the end of Hilda's and Ange's arc (episode 11)....Nothing is bad about this. It's a solid story, it does an incredibly good job showcasing that racism sucks despite being a fanservice anime.The prison action is too edgy at times, but still, really good. The arc where they hang out in another world drags a bit, but establishes relationships we need later.Up 'til this point, I'd still rate it 8. But then the Embryo deal comes along and honestly, I did not need this. I'm glad that a bunch of lesbians and one heterosexual team up against a mad scientist misogynist otaku crossbreed but, we really didn't need this. I also didn't need Tusk becoming relevant and invoking boring normal fanservice anime tropes. I preferred the sketchy lesbian fanservice a lot. Yeah.Art - 7. The CGI is pretty; I like the chaser and mech designs a lot. Character designs are 'here's your fanservice cast', which, good enough for me tbh. One episode is really awful with off-model shots and since it's overall pretty average aside from the CGI... yeah, 7.Sound - 10. I'm a sucker for Akiko Shikata's ominous chorus-heavy compositions such as the Villkiss theme. It stood out a lot to me. Aside from that, some really good insert songs (El Ragna's one-hundred versions). It just met my aesthetic.Characters - 6. Alright here is where it gets awkward. It starts out really good on characterization; Salia in particular, desperate and frustrated as she might be, stays consistent until the very end.Ange is really good, too, with how she turns from 'awful pampered princess' to 'reckless loner jerk with a heart of gold'  to 'capable leader with some reckless tendencies'. It's good.But then there's Hilda. Hilda starts out really good. Competent, prone to friendly fire, generally an awful person, would do anything to achieve her goals. That's good. Her arc shattering her was to be expected, the aftermath in prison with Ange is /really/ good, too, but after that she's more of a tsundere archetype than... anything else, really. She was really promising though, so I'll cut her some slack.Salamandinay was... nice. Exactly what she should be, her dynamic with Ange was a good addition in this cast.Ersha and Vivian were consistent. Tusk was Generic Anime Dude, but with Ange around he was sort of bearable. Their relationship felt forced. Could've been worse.Then there's Chris, completely ruined by Embryo arc.Rosalie was meh. Expected for a non-focus character, though. And Embryo was as hateworthy as he should be. Sylvia, too.Enjoyment - 10. Yeah, you heard me. I don't mind sketchy lesbian fanservice, I don't mind cheap bait, this is fine for me. I admit I got creeped out by the spanking, but it's fine, y'know. I also sort of hate myself for enjoying but, oh well.Overall - 8. Welp. That's me being nice admittedly, but come on. Nothing is bad about this.

Its CG is generally bad, the characters can be very inconsistent, the story is all over the place, its pacing is a force of nature, and its ""fanservice"" ranges from questionable to disgusting. It uses overdone comedy gags. It has a male lead so uninteresting that you can\'t help but root for him. The main character is so flawed that you can\'t help but love her. The anime sometimes forgets what genre it is. It...can\'t decide what it wants its setting to be. And I loved it from start to finish.Cross Ange is kind of like a movie that so bad that it\'s good, with the difference being that this actually shows a semblance of a budget and can be entertaining without MST3K or Rifftrax. It tends to not make sense, it has a ton of scenes that don\'t need to be there, and it poops all over consistency like it was a Taco Bell toilet. However, despite (or because) all of its flaws, it is a very entertaining anime. I\'m not kidding. Aside from maybe Kill la Kill, this show is one of the fastest and easiest I\'ve ever binge watched.This anime is the ultimate ""having fun"" anime. It spits in the face of death. The clothing can barely be classified as clothing. You don\'t even need to be drunk or high to enjoy it. The lead character is a badass chick who takes shit from nobody, and it\'s great to see a pragmatic character who pisses on things like honor or friendship so that they can reach their goal. Be it freedom or beating the crap out of a megalomaniac, Ange will  do whatever it takes to get what she wants, and she does it in a way that makes you want to cheer her on.Obviously, it has flaws, and if you\'re looking for a serious anime, you\'ve taken a VERY wrong turn. This is an anime that can be compared to movies like The Expandables, Samurai Cop, or a rejected Quentin Tarantino movie that he drafted when he was thirteen.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryTo put it shortly. It is essentially mix of ""Code Geass"" and ""Kakumeiki Valvrave"" with rapist fetish direction.I start of the story extremely unpleasant to digest and the characters didn\'t make it any better. On the other hand progression was very pleasing, had lot of impactful moments and few emotional moments. I found the world somewhat interesting and had fair bit of surprises.I did really detest the heavy hand fetish/aspect of the storytelling, where rapists where everywhere. But by the...end of the day, it had rather ""good"" story to it with power of music that I really love in the Anime.Surprisingly there is also romance element to it that actually did take it\'s course.✦Art & SoundArt was great, with some nice designs and fun battles.Music was absolute bliss... especially the singing sequences. But soundtrack overall was superb.✦CharacterToo many rapists or rapey characters. Also i found female lead rather unpleasant and crude, whatever are the reasons. And very comical eccentric villain who by the end of the day is a disappointment.Other than that. Plenty of stereotypes, romance growth, character growth, character changes etc.. is rather good.✦Enjoyment & OverallRemove the rapey aspect and tweak the female lead a bit. I would had personally absolutely enjoyed this Anime then.Other than that.

Enough of that again. I'm saying is that the story the music the characters are amazing.

The creators are ambitious not just in terms of the art, animation and music, but also in story and characterizations. The show was not afraid to expose the darker sides of human nature, focusing heavily on displaying bigotry, selfishness, hatred, and jealousy of the majority of the characters including Ange herself, particularly  in the first few episodes. The overall feel of the show is just like the titular main character Ange: courageous, quick to be violent, often reckless, sometime cute, and full of exposed female skin (read: fanservice). But if you...are willing to go through these rough bumps in the middle, then you are in for one hell of a roller coaster adventure and character developments ever seen in a 25 episode anime. The show accomplished much in the end, transforming from a dark cynical human drama into a hopeful story of fighting for your own free will, camaraderie, acceptance, and forgiveness.I think this anime is great in a way that it excels in developing the world and its characters to its full potential. A character in this anime is rarely one-sided and rarely feel wasteful. If you are looking for an anime with plenty character development, then you should watch Cross Ange.P.S. The amount of frivolity and nudity can put you off, but if this is not your first Shounen or Seinen anime, then you'll be fine. are willing to go through these rough bumps in the middle, then you are in for one hell of a roller coaster adventure and character developments ever seen in a 25 episode anime.

Not that it\'s a bad start, but it started off with what we all hate to see in a ""happy"" plot and characters.It\'s dark, its ecchi, people don\'t have nipples, it\'s ridiculous, and it\'s fucking great. Each episodes ends with you wanting more, character development is great, like from what I said above, if you can endure the beginning, then it will be worthwhile.Music is by Akiko Shikata from Ar Tonelico, song power + mecha + girls. If you like those 3, you\'ll love this. ', ""The one thing I appreciate the most about this, what I think to be very underrated anime, is the fact that you start off by disliking/hating the protagonist, Ange.We are introduced when Ange is Princess of Misurugi, and right from the get-go we see how sheltered she is, when she witnesses a child being ripped away from its mother for being a Norma (a human incapable of using Mana). The mother is furious at her behaviour, about how she tells her to just let her daughter go and that it is the best for the country.The mother's hatred is immediately projected unto the...viewer, who recognizes how ignorant Ange is. She is the typical princess type that cannot do anything by herself.However, when it turns out that she herself is a Norma, Ange is thrust into the Hell that she previously defended. She now experiences cruel treatment from Jill and the other Normas, as well as the terror of fighting DRAGONs. She is first-hand confronted with death and pain, and comes to slowly realize just what she had been defending and turning a blind eye on in the past.It is then that we slowly start to warm up to her. Ange goes from a whimpy, helpless princess to a confident, strong woman who is able to hold her own in battle. We see how she realizes that this is now her life, and she decides that she will not simply be killed by a DRAGON, but will fight for her survival and that of her fellow Normas.That is what I love so much about Ange. She accepts that her past views were wrong, and at the end does everything she can to help the Normas and overthrow the policies in place that treat them as slaves. She goes against her own family because she realizes the horrors that they have allowed to happen.Concerning the romance plot, I guess it was pretty solid. Without infringing on the actual problems and battles of the show, the love story between Ange and Tusk is slowly build up, and makes for some quite comedic moments. It's good to see how, slowly, Ange starts to let Tusk in and they end up genuinely loving the other to the point where they are ready to sacrifice themselves for the other.The lesbian romance is, in my person opinion, unnecessary and really just pure fan service. However, it does make a lot of sense, given that Normas are solely women. It would be impossible for them to have a male lover since they are never in contact with any men. So, in a world where they can die any day, it would be normal for them to look for some form of intimacy.I also quite liked the development of the secondary characters like Hilda (whom I greatly disliked at first) and Jill, and even Momoka, who is a loyal friend to Ange. They all get time to be developed and change, going through their own little story as they follow Ange.I would recommend the anime to anyone who is looking for a solid plot with kickass characters. There is no shortage of death or even gore, as well as comedy and romance. All these things are balanced in a very good way to the point that no element outshines the other. They are simply part of life. viewer, who recognizes how ignorant Ange is.

I discovered it late myself and watched it through in one sitting and I found it very enjoyable. It is not without its flaws though.Summary: 8/10Cross Ange is a brutal emotional anime in many ways. You will not like the characters in the beginning, in fact I hated most of them, but this is because you are viewing broken characters that are trying to cope in the aftermath of being rejected by society. The beginning is intriguing and full of emotional lurches. It can be hard to stick with it but I\'d...say give it a chance. There are redeeming elements and it does go somewhere interesting.Story: 5/10TBH the story wasn\'t anything to write home about. The antagonist was opaque and not well-developed. A standard ""hate this guy"" sort of character. The anime is full of plot holes as well imho and I found myself wishing things were better developed. However, I still enjoyed it. As someone who loves science I found the technology and societies kind of interesting. You have multiple examples of attempts of ""utopia"" and get to see the flaws of each one. Including one without a currency at all. An underlying theme of the anime is that people are selfish and thus a perfect society is impossible. And that even in utopia people want to find racism and something to hate. Also that meeting people\'s needs does not make them better people or happy as the ""contented"" population soon shows its ugly colors in the face of something new or different. These themes though simple were interesting to me and thus I don\'t list the story as ""bad"" even though it had its issues.Characters: 8/10Damn these characters. xD I hated a lot of them for a long time. They are mean to each other, petty, and the heroine isn\'t any better for a long time. Some people felt they were 2D. Maybe many were, but to me they seemed to have a realistic depth absent in many other anime. And for a lot of them you got to learn more about their past, see what made them the way they were, and see a kind of hope and redemption begin to kindle in them. That said, they were frustratingly slow and dense at times. That doesn\'t necessary make them bad characters though, many real humans I know are just like this. In the end I found myself appreciating a lot of the characters and thinking of them as very real people which caused me to rate the characters highly. I also loved the main protagonist which is a pretty strong female lead as far as anime go. She\'s very stubborn and badass and even in the end when she learns to accept friendships and help she never leans heavily on others. This was pretty refreshing from the norm.That said, if you are looking for perfect realism and a diverse cast you won\'t find it. The story mainly centers around women that have been outcast from society and they are dealing with many issues, not always in a healthy way. There are maybe 2 important men and only one has any sort of development (and not a lot). That said the male character did show some nice development but it was mainly relational. He was extremely stereotypical in the beginning. As for the women: much better. Some break, some become badass, some actually grow a little bit of heart in the end. But the development of most of the characters is not happy or necessarily realistic nor are they completely finished healing in the end. They are just...broken people. Which I kind of liked and the anime certainly tried hard in this aspect. Most anime don\'t do nearly so well and the characters never emerge from their respective stereoptypes. Where it may be lacking is ""realistic development"" you get to learn a depth for many characters but not all of them change appreciably or realistically due the the adrenaline pace of the show. The changes, if they occur, are generally under stress and sudden and through use of emotional plot devices.Art: 6/10I didn\'t notice it until hindsight but many ppl said this was lazy animation. The CGI is pretty obvious and the motion animation can be a bit choppy. That said, I\'ve watched anime for a long time and I didn\'t find it too jarring. It was ok, but certainly nothing special. This is probably the place to mention the excessive fanservice. I get it, this is what makes anime sell, but it was kind of jarring in this show. To suddenly see common tropes like the one guy tripping and falling onto the MC\'s crotch like 10 times throughout the show. For a show that was staying emotional and dark for a lot of the duration the sudden comedic tropes seemed out of place and bad. Like a director ordered in more fanservice or something to make sure the thing would sell. The lesbian scenes are also not very realistic and more to show some skin then anything else. It could have been a lot better done.Sound: 10/10omg the soundtrack! This is really the best aspect of this show in my opinion. They picked nice music and paired it well with the animation and fight scenes. And the music was very beautiful, I found myself humming along. The voices, harmony, and string instruments were a nice touch to the general pop sounds in many anime.So, in summary, I liked this show a lot. Mainly for the unique mix of adrenaline action, good pairing of music, somewhat deeper characters then you often get full of flaws but developed and changing as it progresses, and a main female lead I really liked that stayed strong throughout and really grew as a character into someone the others respected and liked. You may or may not like what she becomes as she does have a brutal and arrogant streak but I liked her. All the characters were this way having good and bad aspects. It is part of what made me believe in them as characters.Things the show could have done better: Working on the plot more to make a more believable outside world, better coherency, developing the antagonist more as he was incredibly 2D and you learned very little about him, making the few male characters a bit less stereotypical with more development, removing the comedic fanservice tropes entirely (they could have had it but made it less stereotypical and it would have served a nice purpose rather then as a distraction), not relying so heavily on really emotional themes like rape and racism to push the plot along or control who the viewers dislike. Don\'t get me wrong, those themes added a nice darkness but there could have been better ways of accomplishing what they wanted that weren\'t so forced.In the end though, the show still left me with a great feeling. Flawed certainly, and certainly not close to ""the best"", but better then most of the anime I\'ve watched to date, and I\'ve watched hundreds. say give it a chance.

Including one without a currency at all. An underlying theme of the anime is that people are selfish and thus a perfect society is impossible. And that even in utopia people want to find racism and something to hate. Also that meeting people\'s needs does not make them better people or happy as the ""contented"" population soon shows its ugly colors in the face of something new or different. These themes though simple were interesting to me and thus I don\'t list the story as ""bad"" even though it had its issues.Characters: 8/10Damn these characters. xD I hated a lot of them for a long time. They are mean to each other, petty, and the heroine isn\'t any better for a long time. Some people felt they were 2D. Maybe many were, but to me they seemed to have a realistic depth absent in many other anime. And for a lot of them you got to learn more about their past, see what made them the way they were, and see a kind of hope and redemption begin to kindle in them. That said, they were frustratingly slow and dense at times. That doesn\'t necessary make them bad characters though, many real humans I know are just like this. In the end I found myself appreciating a lot of the characters and thinking of them as very real people which caused me to rate the characters highly. I also loved the main protagonist which is a pretty strong female lead as far as anime go. She\'s very stubborn and badass and even in the end when she learns to accept friendships and help she never leans heavily on others. This was pretty refreshing from the norm.That said, if you are looking for perfect realism and a diverse cast you won\'t find it. The story mainly centers around women that have been outcast from society and they are dealing with many issues, not always in a healthy way. There are maybe 2 important men and only one has any sort of development (and not a lot). That said the male character did show some nice development but it was mainly relational. He was extremely stereotypical in the beginning. As for the women: much better. Some break, some become badass, some actually grow a little bit of heart in the end. But the development of most of the characters is not happy or necessarily realistic nor are they completely finished healing in the end. They are just...broken people. Which I kind of liked and the anime certainly tried hard in this aspect. Most anime don\'t do nearly so well and the characters never emerge from their respective stereoptypes. Where it may be lacking is ""realistic development"" you get to learn a depth for many characters but not all of them change appreciably or realistically due the the adrenaline pace of the show. The changes, if they occur, are generally under stress and sudden and through use of emotional plot devices.Art: 6/10I didn\'t notice it until hindsight but many ppl said this was lazy animation. The CGI is pretty obvious and the motion animation can be a bit choppy. That said, I\'ve watched anime for a long time and I didn\'t find it too jarring. It was ok, but certainly nothing special. This is probably the place to mention the excessive fanservice. I get it, this is what makes anime sell, but it was kind of jarring in this show. To suddenly see common tropes like the one guy tripping and falling onto the MC\'s crotch like 10 times throughout the show. For a show that was staying emotional and dark for a lot of the duration the sudden comedic tropes seemed out of place and bad. Like a director ordered in more fanservice or something to make sure the thing would sell. The lesbian scenes are also not very realistic and more to show some skin then anything else. It could have been a lot better done.Sound: 10/10omg the soundtrack! This is really the best aspect of this show in my opinion. They picked nice music and paired it well with the animation and fight scenes. And the music was very beautiful, I found myself humming along. The voices, harmony, and string instruments were a nice touch to the general pop sounds in many anime.So, in summary, I liked this show a lot. Mainly for the unique mix of adrenaline action, good pairing of music, somewhat deeper characters then you often get full of flaws but developed and changing as it progresses, and a main female lead I really liked that stayed strong throughout and really grew as a character into someone the others respected and liked. You may or may not like what she becomes as she does have a brutal and arrogant streak but I liked her. All the characters were this way having good and bad aspects. It is part of what made me believe in them as characters.Things the show could have done better: Working on the plot more to make a more believable outside world, better coherency, developing the antagonist more as he was incredibly 2D and you learned very little about him, making the few male characters a bit less stereotypical with more development, removing the comedic fanservice tropes entirely (they could have had it but made it less stereotypical and it would have served a nice purpose rather then as a distraction), not relying so heavily on really emotional themes like rape and racism to push the plot along or control who the viewers dislike. Don\'t get me wrong, those themes added a nice darkness but there could have been better ways of accomplishing what they wanted that weren\'t so forced.In the end though, the show still left me with a great feeling. Flawed certainly, and certainly not close to ""the best"", but better then most of the anime I\'ve watched to date, and I\'ve watched hundreds.', ""Let's just get this out of the way: many elements of Cross Ange are garbage. The animation quality makes frequent, noticeable dips. The plot throws so many disparate things at the viewer, regardless of whether or not they make sense, until it eventually goes off the rails and straight into crazytown. Hardly a scene goes by without the show trying to shoehorn in copious amounts of fan service.And yet I loved every minute of it.This really is an example of the sum being greater than its parts, and I think one of the biggest reasons for this is the characters themselves. Most of the girls...are terrible people at the start of the show. They're petty, cruel, cowardly and pathetic... And yet, over time, you get to watch them grow, little by little. They screw up, learn from their mistakes, screw up again and eventually carve out their own places in the world and story.By the end of the show, I genuinely cared about Ange and her companions, and how they make it through the harsh situations they frequently find themselves in. It's one of those stories where, once I got to the end, I found myself wanting to stay in the world for even longer.It would be extremely easy to write this show off for its silly premise and admittedly problematic sexualization, but if you're okay with that, you might find a fun series that's equal parts over-the-top fantasy, mecha drama and romance. are terrible people at the start of the show.

If you answered Yes to everything, then welcome to my review!I have never written a review before, but damn, I really had to for this one. 2 words. Wasted Potential. Feels like they wanted to make this anime garbage on purpose, but somehow failed at that.I\'ll put spoiler-ish stuff and analysis after the grades, for those who just quickly read reviews...to see if an anime is worth the time or not.You\'ve propably read some of the other reviews, so I\'ll be quick with the general stuff. The first episodes are just... bad. It didn\'t feel that it had a story progressing. You could condense the first 7 episodes into 2 or 3, and it wouldn\'t even make a difference. Around ep 8 the anime actually starts to have a story. Around 11 it was decent to watch. And it seemed like it could develop into something better, so I continued watching. Side characters are a bit forgetable. Main characters have plot armor of course. The entire anime tries to be crazy ( the desired product was something like kill la kill, i guess?) but failed miserably. Tons of plot twists as well, to the point where I said ""ok, and now there will be another plot twis-.. oh there it is""Let\'s get some quick grades, for those who quick read reviews and avoid spoilersStory: 4Shit at the start, decent in the middle (even has 2 good episodes), kinda good towards the end.Characters: 3Should have I put this at 1?

After that, its propably a 6.Overall: no/10It wasn\'t worth it. If half the anime is bad, and the other half is just decent or slightly good, was it really worth it? No. Well, for an actual grade, propably like 3 or 4.Did I forget something? Oh yes, the nudity. You could remove all the sex/lewd scenes, and nothing would change (apart from the male lead, more info on him later). Pointless fanservice for the most part. Most scenes are forced, as if they shouldn\'t have existed. The writer also uses rape to basically force us to feel bad about some characters. It... really doesnt work that way. I could say it almost worked the opposite way. In general, you can\'t throw in random tragic events in fictional stories and expect people to feel bad. Anyways, the sex stuff get reduced after the first couple of episodes, but the lewd doesn\'t. People like fanservice I guess, gotta keep it that way. Let\'s grade it!Sex: 2/10, go watch kaifuku or something.Lewdness is a 5, i\'ve seen better.ALRIGHT, the basic review stops here, now ill get into in-depth spoiler-ish stuff, but nothing too great. If you are still unsure about watching this or not, or you are one of those guys who search random reviews in order to find people with similar opinions, then continue reading. No heavy spoilers.Might be a big wall of text, sryThis anime is just a mess at the start. They had no idea what to do with it propably. Then suddenely someone shouted in their workplace ""YO GUYS WTF ARE WE EVEN DOING???"" and everyone was like ""hmmm..... yes, what are we even doing right now?"" and they all started fixing it. Every character felt like they could have some depth to them. Any development at all would be ok. However, there was nothing. All the side characters were just there to be there. They also fall into 3 categories. The ones who hate the MC, the ones who mindlessly help the MC, and the ones who wanna bone her. All of em got fixed later on, at least. Don\'t mistake it as ""character growth"". Only 2 characters experience true character development. The rest got fixed. Oh, and the male lead got a free pass to the ""people who wanna bone the MC"" right from the start.Let\'s start with the main character, Ange. Every review says about how they liked the main character etc etc. So... Let\'s talk about the Ange that exists in the start. The strong, independent female lead. A princess that falls from grace, gets abused by pretty much everyone, then rises from the ashes with newfound willpower. Or thats how the writers had it in their heads. Her entire character is just unstable. No, not just for story purposes. It\'s like they had 2 people writing her for the first 10~15 eps, one good and one bad, and they both had different ideas about her, then they said ""WHATEVER LETS JUST PUT EVERYTHING"". At some point, the bad writer takes a 3-episode break, and Ange has some good moments now. Then he comes back and does more random stuff to her. Then randomly the bad writer dies, and the other guy picks up his work and makes Ange consistent. One specific scene that had me speechless was **SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD** Ange and Tusk( male lead) go to another uh... faction lets say. Ange says ""they are humans so we are able to communicate, lets try to get some info out of it"". They reach the faction, one of the leader tells them "" you aren\'t our prisoners, lets sit down and i\'ll answer all your questions"", then Ange randomly decides to ask nothing, get a random improvised weapon, and threaten the host\'s life. I was just like..... ????????????????????????????????...???. You might say, its cause her character is supposed to be unstable, but no, this was after she was becoming more and more like a normal human being in the story. Then there is the theme of FREEDOM (Aot is that you?). Ange wants to seek freedom and hates ""being used"" by others. Even if those others just propose an alliance or a simple give and take situation. If a good choice is in front of her, she will avoid it cause MUH FREEDOM, I CANT BE USED BY YOU. There are no downsides or repercussions(for her) to her mental retardation, everyone helps her anyways, even if they suffer for it. Her purpose and goals also change every 2 episodes. Every problem that she can\'t solve and noone rushes in to solve it for her, it\'s eventually solved by her big mech that also does weird magic, but only sometimes. But all is good I guess cause after failing at literally everything, she becomes a normal, functioning character, able to experience actual development. She is fine after that. A lot of people like her, but for me, the damage has already been done.Now let\'s get to the worst part of this series. The male lead (Tusk) is just... bad. Really bad. His entire existance for 20 episodes is sexualized comic relief. He feels like a generic harem protagonist, but without his harem. He comes in to help Ange, does 1 action, then Ange saves his ass and they leave. They should have removed him and made Ange a lesbian( every other girl is a lesbian in this anime btw, so why couldn\'t the main character be?). At least, even he has 2 good moments towards the end, but that couldn\'t save his character. He is unnecessary and unlikeable. There is not much more to say about him. His entire existance reduces any rating of this anime by 1. Did I mention he is 1 of the 3 existing male characters? And the only one ""in the good side"" at that.Next one, the maid. If she was a pokemon, then her name would be angelise-sama, cause thats 50% of her dialog. Way too annoying. Stays like that all the way till the end.I wont write for the rest of the crew. All of em were unlikeable garbage, turned into slightly likeable at the end. But there was no flow to that. Most just randomly gained a purpose( that should have existed from the start). Not a bad choice to fix them tbh, they really needed it.Then there is the main villain. Just a self proclaimed god. An unlikeable narcissist. He was created to be hated by us, the viewers. However, it was interesting to watch how he manipulates people to do his bidding. Then he was converted into the ""people who want to bone Ange"" category, so.... that\'s that.I pretty much trashed a lot of stuff so far, but what are the good ones? Honestly, I\'m not sure. While it was just decent at it\'s ""best moments"", for some reason I couldn\'t drop it. Was the world building and lore so interesting? It was. The entire concept of Cross Ange sounds so good on paper. It was ruined by nonsensical fanservice and bad writing. But something kept me watching. And it will propably keep you too.

Take that as you will. One thing for sure, you will have mixed feelings in the end.', 'Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo, or “Cross Ange: Rondo of Angel and Dragon” in the language of imperialism seems really similar to Soukou no Strain at first glance. Indeed, both of these anime feature a female protagonist coming from a privileged background who looses everything after being betrayed by her brother, and both involve piloting CGI mechas to fight against an enemy. However, while the latter has pretty decent story and characters, but is hindered by its very average production value, the former is like watching a catastrophic train crash in slow-motion, but with very good graphics, and also tons of sexual content....--- The premiseThe story takes place in a futuristic and technologically advanced civilization, with some sort of magic power called “the light of Mana” as the source of advanced technology. In this society, nearly everyone can use Mana, either for telekinesis or for making vehicles move. Mana allowed to create some sort of utopia where money doesn’t exist, but this is done at the expense of the few people who cannot use Mana, the “Normas” (all females) who are discriminated against and excluded from society. The story focuses on Angelize Ikaruga Misurugi, the first princess of the Misurugi empire. At her sixteenth birthday she is betrayed by her brother Julio, and revealed to be a Norma. Her parents who were hiding the truth are killed, and Julio takes over the Empire. Angelize looses her status and her name, which is shortened to Ange, and is sent to Arzenal, a military base on an island where Normas are forced to pilot mechas called “ParaMails” and fight against dragons coming from a parallel world. Did I say dragons? Ah no actually they’re called “DRAGONs”. Don’t ask me why.Of course, later in the story it is revealed that the situation is more complicated than it was presented at the start of the series, and that “DRAGONs” aren’t just evil monsters who want to exterminate humanity.--- The protagonistOverall, not a great character.In the first three episodes she is irritating as hell, as she is always crying and complaining with her annoying voice, acts dumb, and causes the death of three other Normas. She tries to kill herself by piloting the Villkiss, an old ParaMail that no one can pilot properly, but of course she is the only who can use it to its full strength. Then there’s a complete change of personality: crybaby and weak Ange turns into a tomboy-ish top warrior who tries very hard to be cool and bad-ass, is arrogant, selfish, and sees other people as inferior. Not a very believable personality shift, but at least that made her a less annoying character. Then, in another episode, her ParaMail is sabotaged and she ends up stuck on an island with a dude named Tusk, who later becomes her “knight” and boyfriend. The scenes on the island are very cheesy. They’re supposed to make Ange evolve as a character, but again, it’s not very believable. One thing that I learned with this episode is that, if a generic harem lead falls and ends up his face between your legs, your selfishness and arrogance disappear afterwards! Incredible, huh?--- Fan-service overloadThe first critical flaw of this anime is that it is plagued with excessive fan-service. It is not just an anime with a lot of fan-service, but rather a 25 episodes long shower scene with a plot. Seriously, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of bath, shower and locker scenes. Even scenes where important information is revealed are sometimes bath scenes. At some point you have Alektra, the Normas’ commander, revealing important things to Ange… in a hot springs. Why do people treated as subhumans get the luxury of having a hot springs in their military base, nobody knows. In this anime, there’s always a dumb excuse to make the female characters naked: if they’re thrown into jail they are undressed, if they’re about to be executed they are undressed, if they’re found guilty of treason they are undressed and whipped, et cetera. I don’t remember a single episode where you don’t see at least one of the female characters naked. They’re also naked in the opening, by the way. Then there’s also a lot of panty shots during mecha battles, the Normas’ skimpy clothing – what is even the point of such clothes? Mustn’t be very practical in winter! –  the fact that Tusk always ends up having his face in Ange’s pussy after a fall, as if he was a harem lead, Salia getting her ass slapped as a scolding, and Ange giving Tusk her panties as a lucky charm. There’s also a lot of sex scenes that are completely unnecessary for the plot, with a gang of lesbian Normas whose only purpose for a big chunk of the series is having lesbian sex. If that wasn’t enough, we also get to see anal rape and, at several occasions, sexual assault. And the beach episode… ugh. That one wasn’t needed, it’s not like there isn’t enough fan-service already! This is one of the most cringe-worthy episodes. There’s a dumb contest where the girls have to carry eggs with their chest. And then you have Ange disguising as a mascot to avoid an important woman. And then they talk while she is wearing a goddamn swimsuit. And then she and her friends escape from Arzenal, while still wearing swimsuits!--- Ange’s boyfriend is a generic harem protagonistThe second critical flaw of this anime is Ange’s boyfriend, Tusk. As I said earlier, he is basically just your average harem protagonist, except from the fact that he is not the protagonist. Tusk is, along with the antagonist, one of the worst characters of the series. He shouldn’t even be here. What is a harem lead doing in an anime about girls piloting mechas? Simple, he’s here to save the damsel in distress, for example by fixing Ange’s ParaMail, saving her multiple times, complimenting her, and having sex with her. Tusk is annoying. He has absolutely no charisma. He has an ugly and generic character design, and I swear I have seen his face dozens of times in other garbage series. He has an irritating voice. He isn’t likable. He is a white knight who sees females as weak beings who need his protection. His relationship with Ange is boring and predictable. Seriously, there were several other girls with a better personality and better looks in this series, so why did the plot-writers have to make Ange fall in love with this garbage character? It could have been with Hilda, after all their experience and personality are somewhat similar. It could have been with Salamandinay, since they seemed to get along so well after playing golf in a parallel world! Heck, it could even have been with Salia, or just anyone in Arzenal, really. But certainly not with this pathetic excuse of a white knight who just can’t avoid putting his face in Ange’s pussy every goddamn episode! Tusk shouldn’t be in this series. Without him, the show could have been much, much better.--- The antagonist is a rapist godThe third critical flaw of this anime is the antagonist, Embryo. He is the man who created this nearly Utopian society, but he thinks that it has become corrupted and wants to destroy it, killing the whole of humanity in the process, to create a new and supposedly better society. He is, more or less, a god, as he is nearly immortal and has overpowered abilities like time and space manipulation, controlling people who use mana, brainwashing, bringing people back to life, and… making females super horny. It seems to me that his goal of creating an ideal society is just an excuse for him to have his own harem of Normas. His only objective after he meets Ange is to have sexual intercourse with her, and for that reason he will abduct her several times, attempt to rape her, and torture her, but of course Tusk is always here to save the damsel in distress. As you can guess, he is a pretty garbage antagonist. He is also stupid. Towards the end of the series, he doesn’t even hide the fact that his goals are selfish anymore, and looses the support of his harem of Normas, making him loose the battle. And yes, despite the fact that he should be unbeatable, the good guys still find a way to beat him in the end!--- The plot is random and ridiculousThe fourth critical flaw (yes, that’s a lot of critical flaws) of this anime is that the plot is random and full of ridiculous elements that makes you want to jump out of the window. I have already mentioned some of them earlier, such as the fact that the antagonist is a rapist god and the revelations in a hot springs among others. But there is more, here are some examples:1) Characters like Ange, Salamandinay and Embryo have mecha battles where they sing like Disney princesses, because this apparently makes the mechas stronger. There is no proper explanation for this, and anyway, hearing girls sing stuff like “lulalalila” when they’re trying to save the world is just infuriating.2) Towards the end of the series, Momoka and Tusk sacrifice themselves to save Ange, and then you have half an episode where Ange remembers about them, and cries about the fact they’re dead, just for them to come back miraculously, so that she can finally have sex with her boyfriend.3) Normas get paid for their kills and buy their own things, including weapons, fancy clothes, ParaMail customization, etc. They even lose money if they take a break when they’re sick. This would make sense if Normas were mercenaries, but that’s not the case since they are considered as subhumans and are forced to fight.4) In the few early episodes, you have a scene where Ange’s outfit is teared apart by bullies, and she wears it anyway. I am pretty sure this scene is stolen from Soukou no Strain.5) Momoka cooks onigiris during a battle where the very existence of humanity is at stake. Doesn’t she have better things to do?6) While fighting, Tusk and Embryo talk about Ange, and Tusk says stuff like “I know her better than you do, because I know how many moles there are on her thighs” and something which translates to “I fucked with her and you didn’t, Ange accepted my d*ck”.7) Alektra has the Aurora, a huge submarine that can fly, hidden under Arzenal. How could she hide such a huge thing under a military base? And why the hell is it named the same as the Russian cruiser Aurora, a symbol of the October revolution?There are many other annoying elements and events but I will not talk about them because the review would be too long.--- The other charactersSo the antagonist is shit, the protagonist isn’t great, and the protagonist’s boyfriend is garbage. What the about the others characters, then? Well, they are pretty bad.First, we have Momoka, Ange’s former maid. If you’ve watched enough bad anime, you know that when there’s a master-servant relationship, it means that they’re actually friends. Unsurprisingly, this is also the case here. In ep.7, she comes to Arzenal to find Ange, as she still wants to serve her, but since Ange isn’t a princess anymore, she no longer needs a maid. Despite that Momoka harasses her until she accepts, and she continues acting as her maid and wearing her maid outfit… in a military base. Ridiculous.There are many annoying characters such as Vivian, the archetype of the energetic girl, who is made annoying by her high-pitched voice and her catchphrase. Ange’s sister, Sylvia, is also very annoying. Once Ange is revealed to be a Norma, she starts hating her and turns into a little bitch who enjoys torturing people. Ange’s brother, Julio, is also a bad character. He is just your average evil character who is easy to hate because he is a coward with a punch-able face, like Joffrey in Game of Thrones. And Rosalie? Her only personality is being dumb.Finally we have Chris, a girl with an exaggerated childhood trauma, which boils down to this: “when I was a child, my friends gave me a single hairband, and I had to cut one of my pigtails to put it on, waaaaah!!!”. That’s it. That’s the trauma. And she betrays her friends because of this. I’m not joking.--- There are a few characters that aren’t utter trashWhich doesn’t mean that they are good either.First we have Alektra, aka Jill (TL note: aka means “also known as”), the Normas’ commander. Since she is supposed to be a serious and bad-ass character, she smokes cigarettes, because you know, having lung cancer makes you cool. She does have a legitimate goal: to create a world where Normas aren’t discriminated against. But at the same time she isn’t a completely white character as she is ready to sacrifice others to achieve her goal.We have Hilda, who leads the lesbian gang whose only purpose for an important number of episodes is having lesbian sex and bullying Ange. She gets some character development around ep.9, but sadly her background is cheesy.Then we also have Salia and Salamandinay, who could have been decent characters if they weren’t made ridiculous by things like Salia role-playing a magical girl when she is alone or Salamandinay playing golf, tennis, baseball and other games with Ange… in a parallel world.--- Animation & sound: the only aspects of the show that aren’t a complete failureOverall, the animation looks good, though there are face inconsistencies in a few episodes. The mechas are in CGI, and the CGI is pretty good, but good CGI will always look uglier than good 2D animation. Tusk has a generic character design, with the face of an idiot you can find in dozens of harem anime, but apart from that the character designs are well done and easy to recognize. For example, Salamandinay has a pretty cool character design. They are very similar to the character designs in Code Geass, which is nothing surprising since both series are made by the same animation studio. The backgrounds look good. Most of them are a bit generic but they are well drawn. There are some buildings and landscapes that are original, such as the “Dawn Pillar” or the Arzenal base.Sound-wise, the background music can be bad at times, but not horrible. The main problem is the bad music placement. The two openings are pretty meh and forgettable, both in terms of music and graphics. Ange has an annoying voice in the few early episodes, but after that it’s alright. The other voices are mostly good, but there are two characters with irritating high-pitched voices, namely Tusk and Vivian.--- VerdictCross Ange is a very bad show overall. The plot is dumb and plagued with invasive fan-service and dumb elements. The characters are absolutely terrible. Without the good animation, watching it would feel like a chore. Either avoid this show or watch it to admire the train crash, since that’s the only way it can be remotely entertaining. --- The premiseThe story takes place in a futuristic and technologically advanced civilization, with some sort of magic power called “the light of Mana” as the source of advanced technology. In this society, nearly everyone can use Mana, either for telekinesis or for making vehicles move. Mana allowed to create some sort of utopia where money doesn’t exist, but this is done at the expense of the few people who cannot use Mana, the “Normas” (all females) who are discriminated against and excluded from society. The story focuses on Angelize Ikaruga Misurugi, the first princess of the Misurugi empire. At her sixteenth birthday she is betrayed by her brother Julio, and revealed to be a Norma. Her parents who were hiding the truth are killed, and Julio takes over the Empire. Angelize looses her status and her name, which is shortened to Ange, and is sent to Arzenal, a military base on an island where Normas are forced to pilot mechas called “ParaMails” and fight against dragons coming from a parallel world. Did I say dragons? Ah no actually they’re called “DRAGONs”. Don’t ask me why.Of course, later in the story it is revealed that the situation is more complicated than it was presented at the start of the series, and that “DRAGONs” aren’t just evil monsters who want to exterminate humanity.--- The protagonistOverall, not a great character.In the first three episodes she is irritating as hell, as she is always crying and complaining with her annoying voice, acts dumb, and causes the death of three other Normas. She tries to kill herself by piloting the Villkiss, an old ParaMail that no one can pilot properly, but of course she is the only who can use it to its full strength. Then there’s a complete change of personality: crybaby and weak Ange turns into a tomboy-ish top warrior who tries very hard to be cool and bad-ass, is arrogant, selfish, and sees other people as inferior. Not a very believable personality shift, but at least that made her a less annoying character. Then, in another episode, her ParaMail is sabotaged and she ends up stuck on an island with a dude named Tusk, who later becomes her “knight” and boyfriend. The scenes on the island are very cheesy. They’re supposed to make Ange evolve as a character, but again, it’s not very believable. One thing that I learned with this episode is that, if a generic harem lead falls and ends up his face between your legs, your selfishness and arrogance disappear afterwards! Incredible, huh?--- Fan-service overloadThe first critical flaw of this anime is that it is plagued with excessive fan-service. It is not just an anime with a lot of fan-service, but rather a 25 episodes long shower scene with a plot. Seriously, there are dozens, if not hundreds, of bath, shower and locker scenes. Even scenes where important information is revealed are sometimes bath scenes. At some point you have Alektra, the Normas’ commander, revealing important things to Ange… in a hot springs. Why do people treated as subhumans get the luxury of having a hot springs in their military base, nobody knows. In this anime, there’s always a dumb excuse to make the female characters naked: if they’re thrown into jail they are undressed, if they’re about to be executed they are undressed, if they’re found guilty of treason they are undressed and whipped, et cetera. I don’t remember a single episode where you don’t see at least one of the female characters naked. They’re also naked in the opening, by the way. Then there’s also a lot of panty shots during mecha battles, the Normas’ skimpy clothing – what is even the point of such clothes? Mustn’t be very practical in winter! –  the fact that Tusk always ends up having his face in Ange’s pussy after a fall, as if he was a harem lead, Salia getting her ass slapped as a scolding, and Ange giving Tusk her panties as a lucky charm. There’s also a lot of sex scenes that are completely unnecessary for the plot, with a gang of lesbian Normas whose only purpose for a big chunk of the series is having lesbian sex. If that wasn’t enough, we also get to see anal rape and, at several occasions, sexual assault. And the beach episode… ugh. That one wasn’t needed, it’s not like there isn’t enough fan-service already! This is one of the most cringe-worthy episodes. There’s a dumb contest where the girls have to carry eggs with their chest. And then you have Ange disguising as a mascot to avoid an important woman. And then they talk while she is wearing a goddamn swimsuit. And then she and her friends escape from Arzenal, while still wearing swimsuits!--- Ange’s boyfriend is a generic harem protagonistThe second critical flaw of this anime is Ange’s boyfriend, Tusk. As I said earlier, he is basically just your average harem protagonist, except from the fact that he is not the protagonist. Tusk is, along with the antagonist, one of the worst characters of the series. He shouldn’t even be here. What is a harem lead doing in an anime about girls piloting mechas? Simple, he’s here to save the damsel in distress, for example by fixing Ange’s ParaMail, saving her multiple times, complimenting her, and having sex with her. Tusk is annoying. He has absolutely no charisma. He has an ugly and generic character design, and I swear I have seen his face dozens of times in other garbage series. He has an irritating voice. He isn’t likable. He is a white knight who sees females as weak beings who need his protection. His relationship with Ange is boring and predictable. Seriously, there were several other girls with a better personality and better looks in this series, so why did the plot-writers have to make Ange fall in love with this garbage character? It could have been with Hilda, after all their experience and personality are somewhat similar. It could have been with Salamandinay, since they seemed to get along so well after playing golf in a parallel world! Heck, it could even have been with Salia, or just anyone in Arzenal, really. But certainly not with this pathetic excuse of a white knight who just can’t avoid putting his face in Ange’s pussy every goddamn episode! Tusk shouldn’t be in this series. Without him, the show could have been much, much better.--- The antagonist is a rapist godThe third critical flaw of this anime is the antagonist, Embryo. He is the man who created this nearly Utopian society, but he thinks that it has become corrupted and wants to destroy it, killing the whole of humanity in the process, to create a new and supposedly better society. He is, more or less, a god, as he is nearly immortal and has overpowered abilities like time and space manipulation, controlling people who use mana, brainwashing, bringing people back to life, and… making females super horny. It seems to me that his goal of creating an ideal society is just an excuse for him to have his own harem of Normas. His only objective after he meets Ange is to have sexual intercourse with her, and for that reason he will abduct her several times, attempt to rape her, and torture her, but of course Tusk is always here to save the damsel in distress. As you can guess, he is a pretty garbage antagonist. He is also stupid. Towards the end of the series, he doesn’t even hide the fact that his goals are selfish anymore, and looses the support of his harem of Normas, making him loose the battle. And yes, despite the fact that he should be unbeatable, the good guys still find a way to beat him in the end!--- The plot is random and ridiculousThe fourth critical flaw (yes, that’s a lot of critical flaws) of this anime is that the plot is random and full of ridiculous elements that makes you want to jump out of the window. I have already mentioned some of them earlier, such as the fact that the antagonist is a rapist god and the revelations in a hot springs among others. But there is more, here are some examples:1) Characters like Ange, Salamandinay and Embryo have mecha battles where they sing like Disney princesses, because this apparently makes the mechas stronger. There is no proper explanation for this, and anyway, hearing girls sing stuff like “lulalalila” when they’re trying to save the world is just infuriating.2) Towards the end of the series, Momoka and Tusk sacrifice themselves to save Ange, and then you have half an episode where Ange remembers about them, and cries about the fact they’re dead, just for them to come back miraculously, so that she can finally have sex with her boyfriend.3) Normas get paid for their kills and buy their own things, including weapons, fancy clothes, ParaMail customization, etc. They even lose money if they take a break when they’re sick. This would make sense if Normas were mercenaries, but that’s not the case since they are considered as subhumans and are forced to fight.4) In the few early episodes, you have a scene where Ange’s outfit is teared apart by bullies, and she wears it anyway. I am pretty sure this scene is stolen from Soukou no Strain.5) Momoka cooks onigiris during a battle where the very existence of humanity is at stake. Doesn’t she have better things to do?6) While fighting, Tusk and Embryo talk about Ange, and Tusk says stuff like “I know her better than you do, because I know how many moles there are on her thighs” and something which translates to “I fucked with her and you didn’t, Ange accepted my d*ck”.7) Alektra has the Aurora, a huge submarine that can fly, hidden under Arzenal. How could she hide such a huge thing under a military base? And why the hell is it named the same as the Russian cruiser Aurora, a symbol of the October revolution?There are many other annoying elements and events but I will not talk about them because the review would be too long.--- The other charactersSo the antagonist is shit, the protagonist isn’t great, and the protagonist’s boyfriend is garbage.

An Orange is the New Black/Gundam mashup? …with dragons? Yes.Okay.I think if I had to describe Cross Ange in one word, it would probably be ‘deranged’. There are plenty of anime that walk the tightrope of good taste, but Cross Ange spends most of its 25 episode spinning around the rope like a trapeze artist, simultaneously laughing and pissing liberally over the audience. I very nearly dropped this several times (particularly across the first two or three episodes), but somehow it still ended up at a very solid 8.…again, what did I just watch?So, normally I’d go into...the things I liked about a show before I get stuck into the issues I had with it, but in Cross Ange the major issue is so egregious that I really want to talk about it first, and that issue is fanservice.Now I’ve watched enough anime over the years that I have built up a significant tolerance to the ‘standard’ fanservice-ey tropes you’re likely to see in the average male-targeted seinen stuff. I’m also entirely prepared to make a spirited defence of the potentially sketchier scenes in shows like Kill la Kill and Monogatari, where sex, sexuality and nudity is used in very deliberate ways to make a point.The problem with Cross Ange is that there are several scenes at both the very beginning and the very end of the series that made me genuinely uncomfortable.I’m not easy to shock or disgust, but I really don’t want or need to see rape shot like porn.It’s particularly annoying in this case, because there’s not actually anything wrong with the script in principle. To put this into context, the early scenes I’m talking about are all to do with the naive and arrogant main character being unexpectedly thrown into what is essentially a particularly brutal women’s prison. She quickly makes enemies of the wrong people with predictable results, considering the setting. The problem is the direction, which definitely seems to think this is something we should be enjoying instead of appropriately conveying the horror of the situation. Without going into spoiler territory, this again becomes an issue in certain scenes towards the end of the show. The events laid out in the script are hideous, but the ‘cameraman’ is a drooling lech and it makes the whole thing come off as seriously warped.Cross Ange also has a lot of pointlessly revealing character designs. It’s the kind of thing I would usually start to tune out after a while if I’m getting into the show, but it ends up being compounded by the sketchy directorial decisions, and results in several action scenes featuring unfortunate combinations of sex and violence that again, made me kind of uncomfortable.In addition to the above, we’re also presented with a major character who seems to be there entirely to run the ‘oh no I tripped and fell on you in this compromising position’ joke so far into the ground that it’s annihilated in the molten core of the earth. I really hated Tusk by the end of the show; other than that one ‘joke’, all he ever seemed to do was undermine the competence and motivation of the considerably more interesting characters around him.So, if you’ve made it this far, you’re very likely wondering ‘So Starfish-san, why the hell should I watch this show and what were you smoking when you gave it an eight?’.My answer is that in spite of the many, many flaws, Cross Ange is a fantastically compelling show, with some unusually interesting character development and a hilariously kaleidoscopic mashup of old mecha-anime ideas.The central character Ange is definitely one of my all-time favourite protagonists. She begins the series as a completely generic stock ‘stuck up princess’, but goes through a really interesting and dynamic cycle of development that I’m really not used to from any character in an anime. There are several key moments where she shifts gears into a new persona, and you get to see three of them right in the first episode. The Princess is then broken by her harsh new reality, but (we know from the initial flash-forward) then hardened into an icy and arrogant ace pilot. This goes on through the show in distinct stages as events unfold, but each stage is deeply engraved with the lessons of those that came before, culminating in a flawed and densely layered character that I felt a real attachment to.Although I’ve complained at length about the fanservice, I’m going to double back on myself a little bit here. Outside of the scenes I mentioned earlier on, Cross Ange actually goes to some interesting and unusual places with sex and sexual dynamics, all centred around the relationships between a quartet of secondary characters. This is the group of the ‘Alpha’ of the prison; a strong and ruthless woman with a core gang/harem of sexually and socially subservient lackeys that she uses to maintain her status and dominance over the rest of the prison population. Although this is an old cliche that you see in pretty much every prison drama (‘Bogs’ in the Shawshank redemption for example), the way the power dynamic of the group changes over the course of the story and the blurring of lines between fear, loyalty, friendship and romance is really surprisingly subtle and well portrayed.Once again, Cross Ange makes my head spin; one of my favourite examples of an interesting use of sex in Anime is in the same goddamned show as one of my least favourite, most unpleasantly gratuitous.I haven’t really gone into the plot, but… …wow. I read discussions online after finishing the show that suggested the plot had been decided based on someone at Sunrise emptying the bag marked ‘ideas we all decided were too stupid and/or crazy to work’ and then hammering them all into one script. I’d say that’s pretty accurate, but somehow it all kind of  works? It’s like the plot equivalent of getting into a high-security building by turning up at the front desk with a suit and a clipboard and asking to see ‘Steve’; all the bizarre twists and disparate ideas are presented so matter-of-factly that I found I just kind of accepted them as part of the ride. I won’t spoil the surprise, there’s one utterly, utterly ludicrous thing in particular that happens towards the end of episode 21. Something that in any other show would have completely shattered my suspension of disbelief and yet… After a couple of minutes of stunned silence to appreciate that they just did that, I found myself thinking ‘Well, okay then!’ and moving on to the final few episodes.For me at least, there was no getting off Cross Ange’s wild ride once it started. the things I liked about a show before I get stuck into the issues I had with it, but in Cross Ange the major issue is so egregious that I really want to talk about it first, and that issue is fanservice.Now I’ve watched enough anime over the years that I have built up a significant tolerance to the ‘standard’ fanservice-ey tropes you’re likely to see in the average male-targeted seinen stuff. I’m also entirely prepared to make a spirited defence of the potentially sketchier scenes in shows like Kill la Kill and Monogatari, where sex, sexuality and nudity is used in very deliberate ways to make a point.The problem with Cross Ange is that there are several scenes at both the very beginning and the very end of the series that made me genuinely uncomfortable.I’m not easy to shock or disgust, but I really don’t want or need to see rape shot like porn.It’s particularly annoying in this case, because there’s not actually anything wrong with the script in principle. To put this into context, the early scenes I’m talking about are all to do with the naive and arrogant main character being unexpectedly thrown into what is essentially a particularly brutal women’s prison. She quickly makes enemies of the wrong people with predictable results, considering the setting. The problem is the direction, which definitely seems to think this is something we should be enjoying instead of appropriately conveying the horror of the situation. Without going into spoiler territory, this again becomes an issue in certain scenes towards the end of the show. The events laid out in the script are hideous, but the ‘cameraman’ is a drooling lech and it makes the whole thing come off as seriously warped.Cross Ange also has a lot of pointlessly revealing character designs. It’s the kind of thing I would usually start to tune out after a while if I’m getting into the show, but it ends up being compounded by the sketchy directorial decisions, and results in several action scenes featuring unfortunate combinations of sex and violence that again, made me kind of uncomfortable.In addition to the above, we’re also presented with a major character who seems to be there entirely to run the ‘oh no I tripped and fell on you in this compromising position’ joke so far into the ground that it’s annihilated in the molten core of the earth. I really hated Tusk by the end of the show; other than that one ‘joke’, all he ever seemed to do was undermine the competence and motivation of the considerably more interesting characters around him.So, if you’ve made it this far, you’re very likely wondering ‘So Starfish-san, why the hell should I watch this show and what were you smoking when you gave it an eight?’.My answer is that in spite of the many, many flaws, Cross Ange is a fantastically compelling show, with some unusually interesting character development and a hilariously kaleidoscopic mashup of old mecha-anime ideas.The central character Ange is definitely one of my all-time favourite protagonists. She begins the series as a completely generic stock ‘stuck up princess’, but goes through a really interesting and dynamic cycle of development that I’m really not used to from any character in an anime. There are several key moments where she shifts gears into a new persona, and you get to see three of them right in the first episode. The Princess is then broken by her harsh new reality, but (we know from the initial flash-forward) then hardened into an icy and arrogant ace pilot. This goes on through the show in distinct stages as events unfold, but each stage is deeply engraved with the lessons of those that came before, culminating in a flawed and densely layered character that I felt a real attachment to.Although I’ve complained at length about the fanservice, I’m going to double back on myself a little bit here. Outside of the scenes I mentioned earlier on, Cross Ange actually goes to some interesting and unusual places with sex and sexual dynamics, all centred around the relationships between a quartet of secondary characters. This is the group of the ‘Alpha’ of the prison; a strong and ruthless woman with a core gang/harem of sexually and socially subservient lackeys that she uses to maintain her status and dominance over the rest of the prison population. Although this is an old cliche that you see in pretty much every prison drama (‘Bogs’ in the Shawshank redemption for example), the way the power dynamic of the group changes over the course of the story and the blurring of lines between fear, loyalty, friendship and romance is really surprisingly subtle and well portrayed.Once again, Cross Ange makes my head spin; one of my favourite examples of an interesting use of sex in Anime is in the same goddamned show as one of my least favourite, most unpleasantly gratuitous.I haven’t really gone into the plot, but… …wow. I read discussions online after finishing the show that suggested the plot had been decided based on someone at Sunrise emptying the bag marked ‘ideas we all decided were too stupid and/or crazy to work’ and then hammering them all into one script.

My rating on it, as with all my ratings, is based on how much I enjoyed it despite it's flaws.But that's just it, Cross Ange sure has it's flaws. It's world building is messy and feels almost thrown together in the middle of the series as big plot twists that had absolutely zero hints leading up to them, are thrown in your face. Other plot twists and revelations do have a good bit...of build up however, so I can look past most of it. There are a few scenes that just make me cringe... The dragon singing one... Ugh. But for the most part, the scenes can be very entertaining, fun, sexy, and even at times very emotional.The characters have a way of making you hate/dislike them at first, before you start to get to know them and recognize how broken they are from the trauma of their fricked up world. Very dark themes are present within this story, themes that are all to familiar to the human race as we know it. The oppression that this show throws in your face is only a small taste of it. But there is a lot more to it than just that. The ending of this show brings closure to most of the sad stuff our characters go through, but not completely. But such is life.I'd highly suggest you give this a watch if you can actually find it. It was on HiDive for a time and I managed to snag the blu-ray before it shot up to over $200 for it on Amazon. Hopefully Sentai get's their stuff together soon because this show really deserves more attention. of build up however, so I can look past most of it.

As all the other reviewers mentioned, this show starts off excruciatingly slow, but it picks up well once you struggle your way through the first 6 or so episodes. Though I am watching this in 2022, the story holds up well despite its age, and the ecchi is sometimes overwhelming, but it is understandably the state of the world, and also a very specific ""lucky pervert"".Its not a power fantasy where the main character gets stronger and stronger with each conflict, but she already reaches her maximum combat potential within...the first arc. There is very little ""friendship is magic"", ""the power of flashbacks"" power spike in this anime. They have everything they need in the first 10 episodes, and the rest of the anime they learn how to use it, and learn how to fight together, learn how to get over each individual\'s trauma.The characters all grow and develop together, and yes theyre all idiots, but theyre loveable idiots that go through hardship and tough times. No character is infallible, they all have their pasts, their motivations, and their weaknesses. Do expect some plot armor though, but at least its not blatantly written, and the characters do learn, whether right or wrong, from their mistakes. The villain is well written despite breaking character at the end, but it feels satisfying to defeat such an overpowered character.All in all, great anime, but I wished that they used the song in the anime alot more often than they did, and sing the entire thing dammit. Its a great song, why not sing the entire thing?? :< the first arc. There is very little ""friendship is magic"", ""the power of flashbacks"" power spike in this anime.

Later after few episode its went intresting after she found the boy and i understood that anime gonna be good. Its maybe for older kids like 15+ or smth but i recommen it anyway because its intresting and good ending what i hoped good luck with watching. There is some echhi moments but its good because the anime will go down if there wouldn´t be this type story.I Hope that there gonna be second season.Good luck with watching and hope watchers enjoy it. ', 'Cross Ange is insane. Here is a quick recap of titular character Ange\'s journey, which spoils every plot point but the plot is so unhinged I\'m not sure if spoiling it matters:Princess falls out of favor with her people because she is a non-magical girl who portends doom for the magical utopia. She is sent to a women\'s prison, is raped there. Gets one of her rapists and two other chicks killed on a dragon hunt, becomes the best dragon hunter. Escapes the prison to go home, is sentenced to hang for being a non-magical girl by her brother and sister who lured her there...from prison because the dragons hadn\'t killed her yet and they were getting impatient. Is rescued at last second. Escapes, decides to go back to prison. Becomes friends with the dragons she\'s been hunting after playing various games like tennis and bowling against the dragon queen on the real earth which has been devastated by world war 7. Ah. Becomes the object of desire for a narcissistic god, boyfriend straps explosive vest on and attempts to kill said god by exploding next to him, fails but comes back to life, fucks ange for 12 hours of well animated sex on the beach, in front of her sub maid. Plan that should never work is enacted, lets go to heaven by singing magical hymns that activate the interdimensional travel capabilities of Ange\'s mecha so we can kill god in time to stop him from ending the world because he\'s bored of it.Ange is one hell of a main character and Tommy Wiseau\'s brilliant direction does not go unnoticed - kindly watch The Room to appreciate the similarities. This show was retarded in the most hilarious of ways, except for the guy writing Ange\'s character arc. The rest of studio went full autism, that one guy had the good kind.Story 7Ange\'s compelling journey begins with being sent to slave labour camp Arzenal by her brother where she is deflowered, beaten, bullied and marched into war as cannon fodder under the assumption she will be eaten by the dragons. Almost everyone she ever cared about turned on her when they discovered that she isn\'t a magical girl like she supposed to be. Ange is a ""norma"", revealed to all (including Ange herself... somehow...) at her coming of age party where Ange\'s brother sabotages their parents\' elaborate plot to trick the world into believing their daughter does indeed have magical powers. You see, magic is what powers the Utopia ruled over by Ange\'s parents and non-magical girls are quite a threat. They need only touch the magical energy fields that fly the cars and animate other infrastructure to shatter them. Ange\'s Mom, The Empress, was shot dead trying to protect her daughter. Ange\'s Dad, The Emperor, was deposed by his son for failing to dispose of his daughter at birth. Such is the hatred for the norma. Non-magical girls are to these people what the jews were to Hitler.Ange processes the fallout from all that in believable phases, eventually dismissing the cultural myth of haz-magics and haz-nots-magics. That arc is the primary reason to watch the show, its surprisingly good. Also there are dragons and an immortal fk boi scientist named fetus.Art 6If they had simply closed up the flight suits and dropped fanservice from the battle scenes, this would be better. Many aspects of the world are drawn and brought to life just fine, but the decent mechs and odd warsongs look so dumb with open cockpit cosplay thots piloting that anything drawn well can\'t make up the ground. The DRAGONs are alright, the secret dimension is alright, Arzenal is good. Many of the scenes that show Ange\'s homeland are good.Sound 8Seemed fine. Symphogear has better warsongs. The mechanism of karaoke battles feels at times like a way for the animators to avoid dealing with what outght to be a tense Gundam battle. Sucks that it\'s always the same songs, but they\'re pretty good to be fair. The dub was great work. I cannot recall being displeased with the ambience and background music. An 8/10 mostly for the dub, which I enjoyed.Character 9The fanservice in this show, man... detracts greatly from its greatness. Becomes more tolerable after a few episodes. Ange is great character. Her arc is a wild ride from self-righteous debutante that means well to nazi-simp in denial, to dragonslayer, to Theon Baejoy Damsel in Distress - and finally, a hardcore libertarian cafe manager. But it is not all about her.The character tier list goes:1. Ange2. The Arzenal Bitches3. Embryo (main villain\'s name, basically fetus)The not-magical girls of Arzenal are prisoners given the gtfo from the motherland as babies and small children, forced into a gladiatorial lifestyle hunting dragons in mechs. The DRAGONs that come from some dimension, for some reason, are a threat to the blissfully ignorant masses that exiled the norma to Arzenal. There is no hope of having a family, settling down, retiring - the assumption is that you will die in combat or ascend to a command post in old age. If you get someone killed, you pay for their tombstone and call it even stevens. Real prisons have economies based on stamps, cigarettes, barter and similar. In Arzenal they are paid in cash for getting killing blows or ""assists"" on the dragons, and they have the option to buy personal items and upgrades for their combat mechs with that money. Arzenal is just a fucking cool spot to be locked up if you\'d rather hunt dragons than be executed I guess. The characters live up to the setting instead of ruining it by crying all the time. Basically amazons, we learn very slowly just how deeply traumatized these desensitized assholes are and it creates some great feels for the audience especially contrasted with Ange who managed to have a not-traumatic childhood until 16 and manages to be just a bit tougher than everyone else in the end because of that. The way these are developed as the story progresses reflects the intoxication that being the top of the shitpile for a while can have on shitheads and people with nowhere else to turn, but as likely as that is to fuck you up its not impossible to overcome.Ange and the Arzenal crew are the crux of the story and Dr. Fetus is the most hilarious memelord, making the characters in Cross Ange a shocking carry for an indefensible show.Enjoyment 9If you\'re a desensitized neanderthal like me, you\'ll be into Cross Ange. But if you trigger easy...Cross Ange has gratuitous rape, sexual assault, and consensual sex that winds down after the first few episodes but remains present throughout, presumably servicing:1. The Fans... ?2. World Building3. Character DevelopmentBad because we modern monkeys who deter sexual violence at least since the #MeToo movement and excluding much of India, the Middle East, Africa, and the private Islands of wealthy white Americans... we are NOT OKAY with random rape in our Anime (lol, kiss your mother with that liehole you filthy hentai fuckweeb?). However, rape is prevalent throughout history and even today, and especially in prisons, and especially in womens prisons where not rape but rather lesbian relationships, and thus *probably* lesbian rape, appears vastly more common than it is in male prisons according to studies - so if you can look past the clearly vile intent of Sunrise to shock folks into talking about their stupid show by putting a brutal, not sexy lesbian rape scene in the first episode it isn\'t completely off base: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_rape_in_the_United_StatesWithout some realistic depiction of the abuse Ange goes through at Arzenal, the show just would not work. Of course, they turned it up to 11 for the rapey gross stuff and down to 7 for the rest of the fanservice which is passable, but incredibly stupid and jarring. The immortal date rapist trying to break Ange\'s resistance to his charms with the infamous ""you now feel 50X the pleasure! Muhahahaha!"" is either hilarious or ultra cringey depending on your mood. Our narcissistic villain gets completely thrown off towards the end by the CONCEPT that someone else has been inside the current apple of his eye before he got the chance to be. Nothing enrages a narcissist to the point of self-immolation quite like a rival beating them out, so I laughed really hard at the voice acting there. If this all sounds gross to you, I\'m not sure why you kept reading but trust me TAKE A HARD PASS on Cross Ange. from prison because the dragons hadn\'t killed her yet and they were getting impatient.

So, was it any good? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryCross Ange deals with some ugly realities like racism and discrimination in the form of norma, people who cannot wield the magical energy known as mana. The norma are used as soldiers by the mana-wielding people in order to protect their decadent lifestyles and, unfortunately, the protagonist Ange suffers that fate, as well. As Ange becomes aware of the brutalities, lies and hypocrisies that her empires uses in order to protect its stability, she...gathers a group of friends that can help her end this tyrannical reign and bring true peace to the world.This show has everything you could ever ask in a self-respecting anime: action, romance, comedy and good world-building. Every episode is an intense rollercoaster of emotions and you won't want to miss a single second of it. (8/10)CharactersAnge has to be one of the finest protagonists I've seen in an anime. In the beginning of the story, she is stripped of her privileges and forced to work as a soldier in order to survive and this new lifestyle causes her to become bitter and jaded; but after meeting good people, especially her love interest Tusk, she changes for the better. She originally wanted revenge against the people who wronged her but after finding love and saving humanity, Ange became something she never dreamed she'd be: a heroine. The Ange we see at the beginning of the story isn't the same Ange we see at the at the end and that deserves no shortage of praise.Speaking of Tusk, I think he's a very good foil to Ange. He's always providing a humanizing presence to the constantly bitter and angry female lead. Tusk and Ange have one of the best romance stories I've seen in anime and I want to believe that, throughout the show, they brought out the best in one another.The supporting characters are strong as well, especially the characters of Salia, Momoka and Hilda. Their different personalities constantly interacting and bouncing off each other is one of the best things of this show. (9/10)ArtA huge portion of the show's budget definitely went into the animation, especially the fight scenes with the robots. The character designs and movements are also beautiful and they further help you dig deep into the story. If nothing else, you can enjoy Cross Ange for its visual accomplishments.

The first episode broke free of so many clichés I thought I had found greatest gem in the dirt. ""Well it was made by the Sunrise, makes sense"" I thought. It\'s fitting that they would spearhead anime into new territories.Then Tusk appears, the most generic lucky sukebe shonen protagonist to ever shonen. And the anime turns into an epic tale of his quest to conquer some princess *****, while netorin her from the villain who is so laughable he needs to be seen to be believed. Tusk is really the ultimate of self-insert wish fulfillment fantasy for...your average Otaku. Impenetrable plot armor and all the women of the land are willingly lining up to be penetrated by him because he is just such irresistible hunk of a male specimen.

First things first. This ain\'t an anime for the faint hearted nor for the...people who think sex themes, violence and abuse should not be addressed in any way and all anime should be fluffy cream pies with a cherry on top. So basically my kind of anime...Sort off. Lemme explain guys and girls.It starts with our protagonist Angelina(later Ange cause it sounds more like a psychotic truck driver murdering prostitutes...Oh wait that has actually happened in real life..Oops.)who plays some kind of lacrosse with machines that use mana to fly..Now mana is the fuel that runs basically the whole world..Here comes the twist, a brilliant one i might add. The racism theme..There people who can\'t use mana and are called Normas..Well yeah the name bussiness was given to a 3yr old .Normas are the outcasts of society, treated like unwanted trash, believed to be the plague or something..So they round them up and send them to a camp...Remind you of something? Then another twist..Our princess protagonist is also a Norma..Fuck yeah? Yeah..So she is sent to the camp to play with some other prisoner girls. Things get rough, we have some girl on girl action..More like commander Yuri punishes blonde prisoner and things start to take off.I have to admit that the premise is great for me at least..And as the series progresses it intertwines more themes like rape, sodomy ,s&m, some mecha, dragons and shit..It\'s a dream come true.....Or is it? You see i like the thought behind the whole thing, it sounds unbelievably interesting..But writers screwed it up in many many areas. They had a story that great all those themes that should excite you in the most primeval way and travel your mind to the darkest of areas, that provokes your very being...And they flash it down the toilet with sooooooo much nudity, unnecessary nudity and face to crotch action and a dude that controls minds of girls so they can orgasm to sweet sweet heaven..It all goes horribly wrong very fast. It\'s like a rollercoaster, full of ups and downs.Mostly downs...It takes some real patience and strong will to take it seriously sometimes especially when the one moment it\'s like ""oh my giddy aunt WTF was that"" and the exact next sec it\'s like ""holy shit why the stupid ecchi crap""..But in the end no matter what, it wasn\'t boring in the least. Every ep had some twist, some new plot thrown in there..And again the screw ups keep on coming..The cohesion between every ep was terrible to say the least. I really had some trouble following the writer\'s train of thought. The thing that fucked it up greatly was the last eps. It ended in the most idiotic way possible..At this point i have to get all spoiley so skip the next paragraph if you want.Our main antagonist who also plays god with people wants Ange as his wife but the day was saved cause.....She wasn\'t a virgin..Or so she said...NOW COME ON..This should have won awards, the writers and the studio should be showered with lap dancers rubbing them with pig fat...Nah just fucking with you..It\'s cancerous for god\'s sake. It\'s like binge drinking vodka with snake blood in it. Why in the name of all that\'s holy did they do that? Bored? Stoned? What the hell were they thinking? Compared to the Bible yeah it\'s much better where our female protagonist was a virgin and got knocked up by a damn flower....All in all our villain went from an intelligent, all mighty god to a whiny, sex crazed molester.The animation was horrible..The CGI mecha and the CGI dragons were so bad i thought i was tripping on acid. It\'s not Berserk bad but it\'s close.Soundtracks were meh, voice acting was meh..Nothing worthy of mentioning really.Characters..If the story can\'t back them up you can\'t honestly give a flying fuck, can you? They do get development, a lot of it..Take Ange for example..She went from pampered spoiled bitch to badass female Bruce Willis..And the way she gets there is well written. Come to think of it every character(except for the dead ones who got some marble stones)gets nicely developed. The hardships, the death, the psycholical war every single thing adds to the greater picture. Granted the writers do screw things up on that front too with relentless fan service getting in the way.Overall i enjoyed the first half..No i didn\'t..Maybe i did,i don\'t know..No,it isn\'t me being schizophrenic..For some ""big"" part it was quite enjoyable. For the most part it was like watching some hardcore porn. It\'s something to help young, full of testosterone lads get the blood flowing to their private parts. But if i wanted a boner, i have Pornhub for that.Ultimately this killed it for me. It should have been an absolute masterpiece..Now as to why they went to masturbation valey, only the writers know that. They had the perfect formula, a story that could revive dead brain cells.It had some freakin great potential and it failed so miserably, i can\'t find the words to describe it. As something to fap to it\'s second to none..As something that will change your world view? No,not even slightly. Might as well watch some Salieri films for their depth. people who think sex themes, violence and abuse should not be addressed in any way and all anime should be fluffy cream pies with a cherry on top.

Horny Gundam. 7/10Cross-Ange... Oh boy. Horny Gundam. 7/10.So I imagine the production committee meeting went something like this.Sunrise: We want something new that'll be a hit with the young adult males!Mitsuo: I got just the thing! It’ll be like Gundam, but they fight dragons and the mechs are like motor bikes.Sunrise: That sounds great!Mitsuo: And the mechs are all piloted by horny lesbians, and the dragons are actually hot girls so they want to fuck.Sunrise: Wait, what? NO!But by the time sunrise had found Mitsuo at the water cooler later that day he had already found a director and Cross...Ange was out of pre-production.Cross-Ange feels like it was being written as it aired live on Japanese television. Like holy fucking shit balls.This show couldn't decide whether it wanted to introduce characters or kill them off. So logically it chooses the best option. It would Introduce characters and kill them in the same episode. This approach is very concise and I like it quite much since I get to see characters die and dieing is cool, but ange is pretty so she never dies expect when she almost does which is scary and I don’t like that but then tusk saves her and I feel really happy because if I was tusk I would save ange because shes pretty.This is what your brain does while watching this show. At the beginning of every episode you’re sober, and when something stupid happens you think “what the fuck?”Then 30 seconds later the characters say some incomprehensible stupid fucking bullshit, and before you can even make a critical observat an ass, I like ass, oh theres 2 asses now, the lesbians are jerking each other off! ooooh god! I just busted. What was I thinking about again?On and on this goes down and down digging itself into deeper and deeper plot holes, but don’t worry this isn’t the writers first rodeo. Every plot hole is equipped with its own ladder which the writers use to climb out of when they get bored of whatever clusterfuck they’ve contrived.Ahhh I don’t know oppressed lesbians fighting dragons is kinda lame now.What if the dragons where also hot lesbians?That sounds amazing, and what if they were actually ideologically aligned with the oppressed lesbians?OH OH OH AND THEN THEY PLAY BASEBALL!DUDE! Wouldn’t it be cool if there was an interdimensional 4chan moderator whose dick is so big he can fuck the free will out of the lesbians?Narrative perfection.It’s like gundam except I can bust. The worst part of this show is the lack of porn. How does this only have like 15 doujins on Nhentai, the fuck are those Nihongos smoking. Anyways.Memes aside this show is like watching a train crash, and then watching it again in reverse. There are so many decisions that are flabbergasting in there stupidity, and 10 seconds later there’s an ass in my face and the music swells as half naked lesbians are ripped apart by dragons, in the same episode theres a soap opera subplot which climaxes with lesbian tribbing.Even the art is just fucked. The character designs are incredible, but the characters are forced to stand in front of backgrounds with the color design of a lovecraftian nightmare. Wild.I was going to give this a 5. Not because it was bad. But because it wasn’t bad enough. I just seemed like it couldn’t commit. This show at one point un-kills major characters. It kills them, one guy suicide bombs himself. IN THE SAME EPISODE HE SHOWS BACK UP.When the other characters are like “hey aren’t you dead?”He’s like “No. I’m invincible.”And it’s never brought up again… he’s just invincible now I guess.But then the final episode happens and all the incompressible bullshit that the show has told you suddenly comes together in the final climax.It doesn’t actually make sense. But the show said that was the way it works so I guess this mech can travel through space and time now. Suddenly these lesbians are singing as they battle since the director liked macross I guess. None of it made sense but man I was hyped as fuck.I think everyone missed the point of this show. I think this could be appreciated as an exercise in sadism. Right up until the climax the only reason characters were given any hope it was so that hope could be crushed. As soon as a new character showed up I was stoked since I knew in 5 minutes I would get to see them be brutally murdered. Then all the lesbians would start crying over the death of this girl they didn’t know and I busted.7/10 Horny Gundam.

If you are into 25 ep long of tons of FANSERVICES and fascinating journey into new world, then this is for you.While it has tons of fanservices, this anime has a GREAT STORY, plot, and character development. A really enjoyable anime. There are many interesting females, each has her own strength and weakness. It is rare to see anime that has both H and great story at the same time. Usually ecchi animes are bad in story/plot and just throw a lots of nudity and jokes. Don\'t be mislead...with ""Gore"" Theme listed here, actually the gore is just soft gore, typical blood and cut/dismemberment that you often see in action/battle anime. There is no visible internal organ or disgusting stuffs. There is also no sadistic/gore torture. It is safe to watch for R17+.[CHARACTERS, spoiler-free]------------------------------------ Angelise ""Always Naked"" Ikaruga Misurugi: The MC of this anime. She is selfish, emotional and stubborn, often her personality leads to more chaos and can cause you to hate her. But actually if you compare to most MCs out there, she is a unique MC. Usually MC has tendency to protect everyone and has good personality, but this MC doesn\'t have that. So, it is definitely interesting to watch this unique MC progress through the story. Her suffering & scar in addition with the support from her friends cause her to progressively change her personality, making her having a deep and complex character development. FYI you will see her naked in almost every episode, very good for H-lovers.- Salamandiné BEST GIRL: she is among the best girl in anime-world. Beautiful, charming, polite and has mature personality. She is the stark opposite of MC. A perfect waifu. Unfortunately her show is just mainly on half-end of the anime. I wish there is an 6-ep OVA that focuses on her as MC. She is voiced by that famous Yui Horie VA.- Oginome, Momoka: MC\'s personal maid that chases the MC everywhere and has personality to serve and protect MC to the core (even Ange cannot override this) to the point of being annoying. We already have stubborn MC and here we also have this stubborn MC\'s Maid.- Schlievogt, Hildegard: beautiful and interesting female char that develops better later on. She hates Ange.- Salia: Beautiful but vulnerable, envious and fragile girl. I like her appearance, her story and personality development. She envies Ange.- Ersha: Beautiful motherly type girl. She is your typical MILF type that loves peace and harmony with everyone.- Chris: Cute white and short-haired girl. She is your typical kuudere girl. Also has an interesting development.- Tusk: The only supporting male character that has significant impact on Ange development. He is just pathetic, a typical ""virgin"" character that is scared with sex but still doing perverted stuff accidentally (remember Yuki Rito in To Love Ru?). He has that ""Lucky Pervert"" skill. He is generic char that wants to protect Ange like a Knight. I hate him. Fortunately he is not the MC.- Embryo: The main antagonist character that is handsome and charming. Female audiences can savor his attractiveness as motivation to keep on watching.[STORY & SET]-----------------------The story is GREAT (9/10). Very good development and has many tense and dramatic moment. There are ups and downs that Ange experienced with lots of suffering. The story and the world is among the most interesting of my 6 years into Anime. The enemy is balanced. Nobody is OP. Lots of intrigue and thick plots. Fascinating world and journey.[MUSIC]-------------The music is just right AMAZING, I score it 10/10. If you want to hear some, just search ""Cross Ange OST"" in Google. The composer is just great, making almost every song/music there very enjoyable. Actually some of the music & song in this anime are not just for background but rather as a weapon (remember senki zesshou symphogear?). Some of the characters can sing a song that will unleash devastating beam of energy, destroying everything in its path.[CONS]-----------------Unfortunately as fanservice anime it does missing nipples. I will give it perfect 10 score if the staff added nipples such as Mahou Shoujo ni Akogarete where the manga doesn\'t draw but the anime does. So adding nipples will make this anime fanservice/ecchi level comparable to Queen\'s Blade. Yeah unfortunately the ecchi/fanservice level is actually toned down when compared with its manga. If only the fanservice is boosted up and added nipples then this will surely beat Queen\'s Blade H-level.This anime has perfect example of ""Fanservice ruining the show"" that is because the time when it is going dramatic/tragedy where you should be in tear suddenly fanservice came out of nowhere (seems forced) that changed the feeling into this weird mix of ecchi and sad. I don\'t blame on anime staffs because I saw it was originated from manga, the author put there (either purposely or not) to jolt the feeling of the audience to the other side.It is better for this anime to choose either to make this anime more fanservice H-focused (ex. Dokyuu HXeros) and reducing the drama or to reduce H level significantly and focus on story / drama (ex. Guilty Crown).But don\'t get disappointed by the bad side. Overall this is a near-perfect anime: 9/10 with ""Gore"" Theme listed here, actually the gore is just soft gore, typical blood and cut/dismemberment that you often see in action/battle anime.

Hokuto no Ken: Toki-den,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4312/Hokuto_no_Ken__Toki-den,"[""Compared to Yuria's OVA, Toki's is far better, both in terms of additions to the original story and the overall presentation. It is a beautiful experience for the fans of this series. Sara's character fits nicely in the narrative and the more detailed fight with raoh is alright, although it definitely lacks the style of the original.Again, I don't like Raoh's voice actor and I'm not completely sold on the art style, but overall, if you really like the series, this is not a bad watch. Just don't expect it to be better than the original and don't expect it to change your opinion on...the franchise. 7.5/10! the franchise. 7.5/10!""]"

In terms of quality its pretty much on-par with the original, although it does surpass it in a few areas. I personally found this one a bit funnier than some of the original episodes, but that could just be me. It still has the cultural references that the original had, but I think this episode had less than the ones in the original season (unless there are like 50 I just couldn't tell were referencing anything).

Gunslinger Girl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/134/Gunslinger_Girl,"['&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried turning you into someone stronger,but lately, I feel uneasy whenever I look at you.&rdquo;Content:Simply put, Gunslinger Girl is about hopeless children who are granted another shot at life at the cost of their freedom and innocence. They are given cybernetic implants which enhance their combat capabilities and drugs which impose upon them unquestioning loyalty to their respective masters. Paired with their handlers, they are known as &ldquo;fratello&rdquo;, and they must face not only terrorists but the tragedies of the past and the uncertainty of the future as well.Admittedly, the question &ldquo;Does the end justify the means?&rdquo; has been asked implicitly in...many other anime and manga. However, GSG is more realistic in its delivery and, some might argue, more socially relevant in the light of the so-called &ldquo;war against terrorism.&rdquo; The series shows people on both sides often pursuing honorable goals through questionable means, and the viewers are left to resolve the ethical dilemma on their own.Nonetheless, the battles against terrorists, corrupt officials, and the mafia serve only as plot devices in most cases. The series focuses instead on the intertwining personal stories and the effects of the conditioning on the girls.If analyzed individually, the characters themselves are relatively plain. However, it is their complex web of relationships which makes the series shine. The bonds between fratello cover a wide range of roles such as those of parent and child, elder and younger siblings, mentor and student, master and tool, superiors and subordinates, colleagues, and accomplices; and each pair shows varying degrees of compassion and indifference.

However, GSG is more realistic in its delivery and, some might argue, more socially relevant in the light of the so-called &ldquo;war against terrorism.&rdquo; The series shows people on both sides often pursuing honorable goals through questionable means, and the viewers are left to resolve the ethical dilemma on their own.Nonetheless, the battles against terrorists, corrupt officials, and the mafia serve only as plot devices in most cases. The series focuses instead on the intertwining personal stories and the effects of the conditioning on the girls.If analyzed individually, the characters themselves are relatively plain. However, it is their complex web of relationships which makes the series shine. The bonds between fratello cover a wide range of roles such as those of parent and child, elder and younger siblings, mentor and student, master and tool, superiors and subordinates, colleagues, and accomplices; and each pair shows varying degrees of compassion and indifference.

Part of it is action, most of the story is drama, some sci-fi, and a dash of comedy make this a blend of many different genres. However, Gunslinger Girl nails the mark on every level, making this one of the most compelling anime shows I have ever seen.The content of this show is ultimately the highlight, and also the whole reason for the controversy: young girls that have had their lives torn apart are given a second chance by having their memories wiped and insides replaced with mechanical parts, and are then trained to do...the governments dirty work. What further adds to the controversy are that the young girls have to have supervison by their guardian/superviser called the ""handler"". Now this may sound kind of wrong, but the story never veers into that perverted/pedofilic territory, which is a bit of good news, for those who were worried.Now the story is the highlight of the show, and in turn, makes this a bit of a slow moving show. Don\'t get me wrong, it definetly has action scattered throught, and it is top notch when it takes place, but its nowhere as heavy as the story, however, I like that aspect. And what a good story it is. Henrietta, Rico, Triella, Angelica, and Clyce are all loveable, and their handlers even have a bit of backstory, including Jose and Marco, however the real stars are the girls.The animation, even for being a 2004 show, is superb. The characters, the environments, and even the guns have a very real look, even though this is still an anime. When shown, the guns are rendered in painstakingly realistic detail. In the first episode, you can see how Henrietta layed out all the parts of her pistol on the table, yes all the parts. Even the reloading details are superb, and add to the realism. Lighting is also very well done, especially on the last episode with the fireworks, so this was the cherry on top of the ice cream for the animation/lighting.Sound was another flawless piece. All the voices, and even the English dub, were fantastic. When you have the Japanese and English dub on the same level, you know you have a hit. To compliment the animation and detail on the guns, the sound is perfect. I have seen countless movies, and played many video games, and the sounds in this were perfect, and on key with the actual sounds of the guns of their real life counterparts. Test this, especially in the second episode where Rico is using the Dragunov sniper rifle. Awesome. Surround sound setups will definetly get their workout here.Overall, Gunslinger Girl is a deep, thought provocing show, that really shouldn\'t be missed. The characters, the guns, and overall, the story, make this one to have on your must see list. Because of all the above, this is my all time favorite anime. the governments dirty work.

Since the last century, almost all the well-regarded films have implemented controversial social commentary and brought about heavy subject matter that involves sex, violence, and political corruption. These days we don’t often see anime take advantage of showing people the profound impact our world has within the dark deception of our own universal culture. Gunslinger Girl will leave some people with a sour taste in their mouths; whether they were expecting action-packed girls with guns show,...as the title Gunslinger Girl represents just by saying it aloud, or because of the disturbing nature of the characters. However, the actual argument is how it handles developing those themes and characters mentioned beforehand.It would be fitting to compare this to Stand Alone Complex in how every episode has its plot, yet every one of them is connected to the development of its characters. Execution should be the key to establishing an overall impression of how we view each character through fresh and innocent eyes before removing our innocence and making us experience the disturbing nature underneath the foreground of the show. Gunslinger Girl has one of the most heart-wrenching and almost beautiful representations of showing the development of each girl in question.One scenario, in particular, involves one of the girls named Rico, who is now put into a position where she has to eliminate any emotion regarding the job she is given. Now she is thrust into a situation where she finds interest in someone who makes her question her existence concerning why she’s a part of the organization. What makes the execution written so well is just how subtle you see her ponder the questions coming out of her mind after the job is done in a harrowing and profound atmosphere. Typically, dealing with robotic characters who ponder about love and how they question has been done to death in some instances and can be seen as silly or laughable. But seeing how the atmosphere is so dark and hardly has any inclination of humor in the characters makes it believable. It's debatable whether there should have been a more convincing or less clichéd way of bringing up melodrama, but that shouldn’t necessarily be a massive draw on the writer’s part.With this in mind, however, one begs whether the writers only wanted to develop the girls fully and hardly bothered trying to give the same amount of development for the “Fratello” or the girls’ master that is given to them. Some people could argue that the show's point was mainly focusing on the girls instead of their masters. Even with that said, they try to give a smidgen of development from how they question their organization. The problem is that they don’t ever go far enough, it’s as if they had an idea of how the adults would grow into a different mindset than before, but they decided that it wasn’t as important. There’s nothing for me to feel about them, whether I should pity or sympathize with them other than the girls.Narratively speaking, the plot doesn’t gain any weight as how it’s structured since there’s hardly a plot to follow other than the fact it’s supported mainly by character interaction. There are some episodes where the story of one particular mission didn’t feel like it was written with any focus on how it was structured. They didn’t have a goal in mind when they wanted to establish any conflict or a stable plot arc. Not to say all of them did, but on occasion, it does.The fact that the show is slow-paced does help in some cases to help us figure out what the world of Gunslinger Girl is like. The political climate and corruption are put into context, how it impacts the characters, their struggles with coping, and whether they like it. There is an issue regarding how the show hardly gives any context to the actual political office in question. Suppose you asked me now what the people in the government were like or what their motivations were. In that case, I couldn’t tell you because of how so little explanation is given to their reasons, and therein lies how narrow the political landscape is like, unlike how Stand Alone Complex did it correctly in its political realm.While it is argued that this is entirely different from your typical girls with guns show, that isn’t to say there aren’t tropes that can be associated with the genre. How they handle the violence and action is very intelligent and almost strategic in how the characters feel in any given action scenario. While there are some questionable scenes, such as Henrietta pretending to be an innocent child to a group of terrorists inside a building where it’s evident that no one else but them is inside. How it is directed and choreographed is intense and realistic to its very core. It doesn’t glorify the violence to the point where it’s severely distracting; when you see a person get shot, you feel that he’s been shot right in your gut.Direction-wise, the show is stellar in its animation and pacing, even if, at times, it goes a little too slow in parts where it didn’t need to be. While it isn’t impressive compared to others, the animation is still done well from how the action scenes are played out in the end, and the art designs of the characters are crisp and clear to the eyes. The one thing that typically wouldn’t be needed in discussing animations is the actual gun designs themselves that are almost on Angel Beat’s level of precision and detail in how they are portrayed as an embodiment of the girls. Almost like a subtle metaphor in how you see a gun next to a girl in nearly every scene they are on-screen, whether they are carrying it with them on a mission or if they are cleaning them.The music in Gunslinger Girl is pretty to listen to, implementing excellent orchestration to capture the disturbing nature of the show’s framework. The sound design is one aspect of the show that I wholeheartedly admire and commend with open arms. It’s extraordinary how authentic it is from how the guns sound like actual firearms and not just cookie-cutter weapons on any other anime or movie and the subtle ambiance of the show’s natural landscape. There was a moment where I almost wanted to cry from just how beautiful and sad the people who worked on the front put forward to crafting this realistic atmosphere that gives Gunslinger Girl its unique look and feels from other anime.From its dark subject matter to its beautiful nature, this is a show that might rub some people off the wrong way. That can be understandable, but at the same time, that should not sway people who are nevertheless intrigued in giving Gunslinger Girl a watch to see how anime can go to unfamiliar territory by using familiar tropes and pull it off in a serious fashion. It may not be perfect in how they didn’t go far enough as it needed to be in establishing a well-rounded world that deals with political corruption. But as time goes on, we have to appreciate at least the effort put into writing a gripping character drama with excellent development from our main characters, minus the supporting cast. We sometimes have to embrace the darkness of the natural world to cope with our insecurities, and Gunslinger Girl lives up to its credit as one of the most underrated that has these qualities to deal with.Grade: A- as the title Gunslinger Girl represents just by saying it aloud, or because of the disturbing nature of the characters.

I was afraid it&rsquo;s going to end up too serious and too difficult to comprehend. I was wrong on both counts. The girls made the anime more suited to my taste (not like I&rsquo;m a pedophile or a dirty guy or anything like that). It gets serious and hard to understand sometimes, but for most of the time, I actually enjoyed myself.I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed that it&rsquo;s not as violent as I thought it would be. Sure there are bloody parts but they come at a minimum and...they&rsquo;re not really that brutal. However, those parts were done tastefully so it&rsquo;s all good.It&rsquo;s a nice plot, but I&rsquo;m too afraid it&rsquo;ll attract too many lolicons and pedophiles. I mean, preteen girls wearing nice, cutesy clothes and wielding weapons at the same time. Feeling that I&rsquo;m watching an anime that attracts people like that kind of bothers me.On the other hand, what I really like about it is the setting. Anything that has something to do with Europe, especially Italy, instantly captures my heart. I even picked up a few Italian lessons from the episode titles and the ending song.Anyway, the illustrations are nicely done, but I found that the faces were too pudgy for my taste. For the girls, it&rsquo;s acceptable, since they&rsquo;re supposed to have baby faces, but even the adult women have huge faces and small eyes. Because of that, I got a feeling that the illustrations were influenced by the western style. The backgrounds were nice too. The colors of the background were more subdued compared to the characters&rsquo; so the complimented each other really well. Speaking of the colors, I noticed that the colors were mostly in cool tones, which fits the anime&rsquo;s feel, which is also somewhat cold and indifferent.However, the girls make the anime much more likable. They use guns (really kick ass ones too), they&rsquo;re part mechanical, and of course, they kill people but I just find them all sweet. My favorite is Angelica, she&rsquo;s the loveliest and gentlest of them, but I also like Rico. I feel sorry for her because she&rsquo;s stuck with someone like Jean. I also like Elsa, despite her bitchiness &ndash; she seems interesting to me.Voice acting is another aspect of this anime that I find favorable. Although I find it weird that they&rsquo;re speaking Japanese fluently while in Italy, It&rsquo;s not that bad. When they mentioned Italian terms/names, they had the correct pronunciation. Besides, this is not the first time it happened. Most of the seiyus are actually quite young, like Hitomi Terakado, Angelica&rsquo;s VA. I think she&rsquo;s only 19, but she did a good job. What surprised me is that Ami Koshimizu, Claes&rsquo; Seiyu, also did Tenma Tsukamoto from School Rumble and Anemone from Eureka 7. Those are three different characters, and I&rsquo;m definitely impressed by her ability.Music is actually quite impressive, and that&rsquo;s thanks to Toshihiko Sahashi, who&rsquo;s also responsible for Akazukin Cha Cha, Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny, Cutey Honey and Hunter X Hunter. I love the Delgados opening theme &ndash; it&rsquo;s a touching song that&rsquo;s also well made. The ending song, which was in Italian, was also nice to listen to. The background music was also nice, although most of them are a bit dreary &ndash; I like them nonetheless.It&rsquo;s not one of my favorites, but I thought it was very good and interesting to watch. It had the ingredients of a really good series, but I&rsquo;m not too impressed by it. Although, I kinda want a second season just so I know what happens. The last few episodes were implying that something big was about to begin, and I&rsquo;m curious as to what that thing is. they&rsquo;re not really that brutal.

It stands at nine collected volumes in Japan.  ADV licensed the manga Stateside, and the last volume released was the sixth, back on November 30th of 2007.  As of May 2008, ADV said that the rest of the manga would be forthcoming, but with the company's recent financial issues and its relicensing of several shows, it is unclear if the manga will continue to be released Stateside.Gunslinger Girl is a thirteen episode anime that was produced by Madhouse...(famous for their work on Paranoia Agent and Death Note), and directed by Morio Asaka (famous for his work on Chobits and Cardcaptor Sakura).  It ran on Japanese TV from October 8th, 2003 to February 19th, 2004.  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, and the Viridian Collection Box Set was released on November 11th, 2007.Story: The Social Welfare Agency of Italy supposedly is a government sponsored corporation involved in saving lives -- however, in reality, it is an agency that takes girls in terminal condition, gives them cybernetic implants, and uses &quot;conditioning&quot; to turn them into deadly assassins for the government with utter loyalty to their handlers, called &quot;fratello&quot;.  &quot;Henrietta&quot;, who survived the brutal slaughter of her family and assault, is the agency's newest girl, and works along with four other girls doing the government's black-ops work.This story is a study in duality; one moment, you see these preadolescent girls generally being preadolescent girls - giggling, talking with each other about things, being cute in general - and the next, they're gunning down or beating the shit out of terrorists with submachine guns or their bare fists.  And the show doesn't let you forget that these sides exist within the same girls - the girls might be discussing plans for the night as they're in the middle of an operation, or they might be out to dinner and a threatening gesture makes them leap to protect their handlers.  And it can be utterly unnerving to watch at times.But besides this duality, each of the girls' backstories is at the very least hinted at, if not explored, and their personalities are developed quite well through the show, along with showing the darker side of what's been done to the girls.  It's hard to watch at times, but it makes the story that much richer.  And the general how and why of the agency and the process of making these girls into what they are is incredibly well fleshed out.This would be all good and well if it weren't for how the story plays out.  Most of the story is development of each of the girls, along with some more minor characters that show up throughout the series, and it's all done quite well, as I said before this.  But in the last five episodes or so, there's an attempt at an overarching plot involving other agencies, and it kind of works, but the show leaves off with several threads still hanging.  It's almost like this was the first half or so of a longer series, and the production team just never got the notice that it was only thirteen episodes.Admittedly, there is a second season entitled Gunslinger Girl -Il Teatrino-, but I don't know if it picks up where this season leaves off; I will probably end up watching it at some point in the near future.Art: Madhouse did an excellent job with this production.Their typical emphasis on realism makes the show that much more heartwrenching, because these girls act and are animated like your kid sister and given their own mannerisms, and that realism, combined with absolutely amazingly choreographed action scenes with mostly realistic moves, makes for amazing episodes, and plays into the duality of things.  The girls themselves have very good character designs, and there's at least minor changes in their outfits from episode to episode, which is always good.  Even better is that the scenery looks almost exactly like Italy; I can take pictures from friends who are in Italy, and put it side by side with stills from the series, and, besides the fact that it's animated, there is no discernable difference between the two.Music: The background music itself is mainly orchestral and well-scored; it's not anything that particularly stands out or anything, but it's still quite well done.  The OP and ED, however, are absolutely spectacular; the OP is a slower song with some excellent harmonies and is just a neat song in general, while the ED is a mix of techno and either Catholic mass-esque or operatic aria-esque, just an absolutely beautiful effect.Seiyuu: There aren't any particular voices that I recognize, though I particularly like Triela's seiyuu, Eri Sendai.  Otherwise, good job on the casting here, as always.Voice Actors: I did watch one episode of this in English, as I bought the Viridian DVD set.  All in all, the voice actors did a pretty passable job on here; some places where the voices are far too wispy where they shouldn't be, but otherwise, it's not half bad.  The only real issue I have is that Triela's VA blatantly sounds like an older, adult woman, where the other girls are clearly younger-sounding voices; now, admittedly, Triela is the oldest of all the girls, and my all-around favorite, but she is not quite to the stage where she would sound like an adult woman.Dub: Funimation did a pretty passable job with this.  I have a few issues with them in how they chose to translate things, as the sub says one thing while the English lines say something entirely different; consistency matters, here, and yes, we do notice this.  Oh, and speaking of consistency, on the subject of Henrietta's handler's name: PLEASE decide whether is Jose, Giuse, or Giuseppe - I saw all three variants of this name in the subs, and you seemed to switch between the names every two episodes or so, and it makes things incredibly confusing.Length: As I said earlier, Gunslinger Girl feels like the first half of a much longer series; whether or not Il Teatrino is a continuation of where episode thirteen or not remains to be seen, but either way, there probably could have been better planning to give a bit more of a definitive ending, or a clear notice of continuation.Overall: Gunslinger Girl is a series with beautifully developed characters, a well-fleshed-out world, excellently choreographed actions scenes, a great sense of duality, solid music and realistically detailed animation, great seiyuu and an atypically passable VA cast and dub.  There are some issues with consistency in the dub and some VA casting choices, along with a story that only seems to be the beginnings of something bigger; however, Il Teatrino can probably rectify the story issues.Story: 8/10Art: 8/10Music: 8/10Seiyuu: 8/10Voice Actors: 7/10Dub: 7/10Length: 8/10Overall: 54/70; 77% (B-) (famous for their work on Paranoia Agent and Death Note), and directed by Morio Asaka (famous for his work on Chobits and Cardcaptor Sakura).  It ran on Japanese TV from October 8th, 2003 to February 19th, 2004.  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, and the Viridian Collection Box Set was released on November 11th, 2007.Story: The Social Welfare Agency of Italy supposedly is a government sponsored corporation involved in saving lives -- however, in reality, it is an agency that takes girls in terminal condition, gives them cybernetic implants, and uses &quot;conditioning&quot; to turn them into deadly assassins for the government with utter loyalty to their handlers, called &quot;fratello&quot;.  &quot;Henrietta&quot;, who survived the brutal slaughter of her family and assault, is the agency's newest girl, and works along with four other girls doing the government's black-ops work.This story is a study in duality; one moment, you see these preadolescent girls generally being preadolescent girls - giggling, talking with each other about things, being cute in general - and the next, they're gunning down or beating the shit out of terrorists with submachine guns or their bare fists.  And the show doesn't let you forget that these sides exist within the same girls - the girls might be discussing plans for the night as they're in the middle of an operation, or they might be out to dinner and a threatening gesture makes them leap to protect their handlers.  And it can be utterly unnerving to watch at times.But besides this duality, each of the girls' backstories is at the very least hinted at, if not explored, and their personalities are developed quite well through the show, along with showing the darker side of what's been done to the girls.  It's hard to watch at times, but it makes the story that much richer.  And the general how and why of the agency and the process of making these girls into what they are is incredibly well fleshed out.This would be all good and well if it weren't for how the story plays out.  Most of the story is development of each of the girls, along with some more minor characters that show up throughout the series, and it's all done quite well, as I said before this.  But in the last five episodes or so, there's an attempt at an overarching plot involving other agencies, and it kind of works, but the show leaves off with several threads still hanging.  It's almost like this was the first half or so of a longer series, and the production team just never got the notice that it was only thirteen episodes.Admittedly, there is a second season entitled Gunslinger Girl -Il Teatrino-, but I don't know if it picks up where this season leaves off; I will probably end up watching it at some point in the near future.Art: Madhouse did an excellent job with this production.Their typical emphasis on realism makes the show that much more heartwrenching, because these girls act and are animated like your kid sister and given their own mannerisms, and that realism, combined with absolutely amazingly choreographed action scenes with mostly realistic moves, makes for amazing episodes, and plays into the duality of things.

Imagine an alien from outer space watched those movies and knew that nearly all humans liked them. However, the alien can\'t comprehend why people liked those movies and what exactly it was that made them so good. The alien also has no understanding of human emotion or logic. Now imagine that the alien decided to steal various plot elements from those movies and paste them together into something he thinks the humans would enjoy. The result is Gunslinger girl. This fails as an enjoyable action, an emotional drama, and literally...everything in between. The Italian government is paying tens of millions into a program to turn little girls into cyborg killing machines and extensively train them into assassins. Little girls with no training are chosen over already trained soldiers because the girls are supposedly easier to brainwash into emotionless killers. Apparently the Italian Army is completely lacking in sociopaths who already are incapable of feeling empathy or remorse and don\'t need expensive brainwashing therapy. Also, this plan turns out not to work anyway because the girls can feel emotion after all. Hilariously, the cyborg surgery gives these new assassins an extremely short life span, which is mostly spent having to train them. They are good for only a few missions before they die. The Italian government is probably paying 100 million dollars per hit with this cost inefficient program. They could have used that money to buy MQ9 Reaper drones which will last far longer, perform far more hits, and are much deadlier tools of assassination that don\'t actually cause any more collateral damage than the average member of the ""gunslinger girls"" brigade. If Gunslinger Girls was an accurate assessment of how the Italian Government conducts business, it would at least explain the massive debt and pathetic war record. everything in between.

I liked the premise, although it wasn\'t very original.  This is a very character-centric piece, and any trace of an overall story that may be present merely serves as a means to develop the characters, which is fine.  I\'m still scratching my head as to why the assassins they use have to be young girls.  They say that they use young ones because the brainwashing process is easier,...but why can\'t they be boys?  I can only venture a guess:  Nobody would suspect a cute little moe-blob holding a violin case to actually be a lethal cyborg, and nobody would suspect that the violin case actually holds a P90.Art: 10.  The animation is YEARS ahead of its time--a DECADE, I\'d even venture to say.  Compare it to other anime of 2003-2004 and... well, there\'s no comparison.  It\'s even better than a lot of CURRENT anime out there right now.  The style is extremely unique and interesting; I\'ve never seen anything like it before.  There is *huge* attention to detail, including but not limited to: the guns, the characters, the scenery, the art, and even lighting and shadows.  Everything is clear, crisp, and fresh-looking.  I\'m amazed that even with current anime, many of them STILL seem to have trouble with animating simple movements like walking, and Gunslinger Girl suffers absolutely no problems in this regard.  All in all:  The visuals/animation are so good I had a hard time believing it was really from 2003.Sound: 7.  The OP and ED are very *different*.  I don\'t care much for them; they\'re not my cup of tea, but they may appeal to other people.  There\'s actually a shocking lack of general music to alleviate dead air or create a mood, but equally shocking is that it seems to work just fine without it.  The tracks that we DO get, though, don\'t stick out at all.  However, the voice acting (English) is pretty awesome--especially the ones playing the girls, and helps up the score in this regard here.  The sound effects are also pretty good; they\'re well-synchronized with the visuals, and are also very detailed, down to the last bullet casing hitting the ground.Character: 8.  As I mentioned, this series is really all about the characters; namely, the girls and their interactions with their handlers.  The girls all have their own tragic backstory that led them to get this lot in life (although not all are revealed), and each has her own colorful personality.  It\'s interesting to see the massive variance in relationships between girl and handler:  You have the handler that willfully spoils his girl and cares a lot about her; you have the handler who cares a lot about his girl but has a ""weird"" way of showing it; you have the handler who doesn\'t give a f*** about his girl and views her solely as a tool.  Regardless of how the handler treats the girl, she\'s always devoted to him no matter what, because that\'s how the brainwashing makes them.  Speaking of brainwashing, there is quite a prominent psychological element.  It focuses a lot about how, in spite of said brainwashing, the girls are still very much affected by their past life, and how their past is still buried deep within somewhere--guiding their actions.  Their conditioning also causes them to lose their memories and shortens their life span, and it\'s quite heart-wrenching to see.  Equally as heart-wrenching is how the girls don\'t mind their lives as cold-blooded assassins, and their mindless devotion for their handlers--for better or for worse (although the latter can be pretty heartwarming at times as well).  The handlers themselves are defined entirely by their interactions with their respective girls.  The girls are moe without letting that quality define who they are as characters.Enjoyment: 6.  I liked watching it, but I didn\'t enjoy it much.  Does that even make sense?  Well, let\'s see...  There was significantly less action than it seemed there should be.  The action sequences were few and far between, which is a big shame, considering how incredibly well-done they are.  The style of story telling is kind of a hassle:  It jumps around randomly quite a bit chronologically, so it can take a while to piece all of what\'s happening at a given time together.  Some people like this style of story telling, but I don\'t--especially with how random it is.  To help illustrate, say that event 1 is the initial event chronologically, and event 10 is the final.  Some stories go straight from 1-10.  Some start at 10, then go back to 1-9.  Some go 10, 1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6, 5, where 5 is a key piece of information that fits the entire sequence together.  But here, there are times when it looks like 9, 3, 7, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 10, 8, and it\'s a pain to keep up with.Overall: 7.  I wish I could\'ve scored this better.  I definitely liked it, though.  If you like character-centric anime with good art and some action and psychological involvement, definitely give this a try.  If you want a unique/driving story, tons of action, or an outstanding soundtrack, you may want to pass this up.And now, the decision rests with you~ but why can\'t they be boys?

Cybernetically enhanced adolescent girls? Modern military grade small arms and light weaponry? Terrorists? Ah... I know! Girls with guns. Girls on guns. Plying with them. Playing with them. Toying with them. Touching them. Kicking ass. Showing some as well. Skirts so short flipped up from the gusts of grenades. Breasts scantily clad baring through the air as the rest of their curvaceous figures hit ground. Bodies, barrels, bullets highlighted to the finest set of orgasmic ecstasy. If these were your first impressions, slap yourself and get real. Or leave and never look back.An anime adaptation of a manga of...the same name by Yu Aida, Gunslinger Girl was directed by Morio Asaka and produced by Madhouse, the same studio responsible for animating such shows as Death Note, Chihayafuru, Casshern Sins, and Death Billiards. We enter Aida's fictional universe, an officially united, yet undoubtedly divided Italy under siege by extremist groups based off the real world discontent of a prosperous North having to provide for the indigent South. To combat the violent dissent, the Italian government established a secret armed group. Officially, it conducts medical research and provides prosthetic assistance to the public as the Social Welfare Agency. Its primary objective, however, is the eradication of terrorism via the use of cybernetically enhanced assassins. Studies conclude that adolescent female are the most pliable to being “conditioned” for the role, yet how does one find a supply of them without drawing unwanted publicity? Simple: take the poor ones, the broken ones, the ones dealt so cruel and wretched a fate that no one would notice or care if they disappeared. Victims of massacres, mutilations, poverty, and paralysis... of desperation, depravity, indifference, and avarice, they are fixed up, made to forget everything, and are soon after sent off to and for the slaughter. Yet, there's a bug to the brainwash. Mechanical as they are, these assassins aren't unthinking or unfeeling. They aren't devils.One common criticism of this show revolves around the implementation of its action segments. Whenever action occurs, it ends too quickly to really savor. To this, I say it's unwarranted: it would be dumb for any professional assassin to take his or her sweet time when a confrontation gets hot. Success in that line of work is parts preparation and decisiveness. Realistically, the actual moment of take down is brief compared to the long periods of wait to make it happen. But there are many regardless who prefer the majority of their armed external conflicts consist glorified death matches, to which I say once more: This probably isn't the show for you. In fact, be glad most of the tedium of preparation is omitted. In their conflictual place is the show's gem: introspective dissonance at what's been done. When we see characters enter and leave a shootout, the viewer isn't meant to feel a sense of adrenaline pumping elation over the fact you killed a bunch of generic baddies. Rather, you feel sobriety for the consequences and implications behind killing these baddies, who may not, in fact, be just baddies. And then there's the act of killing in general, especially how frighteningly desensitized these girls are behind their barrels. If you haven't realized from the synopsis in the last paragraph, there's no definitive camp of good or evil. Both the separatists and the government fight for the causes they believe in are just, for reasons that are both consider legitimate and sympathetic. Both use dubious means to see them through, in particular, the Social Welfare Agency's use of what effectively are child soldiers. The handlers of each have own approaches to dealing with the specific one under their care, and their own misgivings (or lack thereof) toward the government's foremost stance on them as killing machines. Each of the child soldiers in turn have their own personal dynamic toward their specific handler, though common denominator between them is a form of love. Whether that love is artificial or natural, something genuine or an obsession, varies with each pairing, or fratello, as the show takes its sweet time meticulously mapping them. The slow and steady pacing is just right to cover this facet among others, when the girls are on the job and when they are off it in between. In a sense, it makes the atmosphere all the more melancholic, in a resplendent, yet somber sort of way.What else contributes to this atmosphere? One is the cinematography. Every background and object, every sequence of animation is beautifully and fluidly rendered, respectively. Though look closely. The somewhat faded colors, off-color lighting, and carefully placed shadows... it all plays off wonderfully to the maturity of the character designs and the show's general tone.Two is the immersion. An indicator of excellently executed immersion happens when one can honestly watch a show and feel that its universe can trump on in time regardless of whether or not there happens to be an audience watching. Combined with the fact that many of the tensions explored throughout the series are very real issues in real life and the meticulous attention to detail, not excluding the accurate design of each gun and the mention of each gun's specs, every plot-essential element, every plot-shot character, and every plot-important motivation is so seamlessly integrated, that if were one were to momentarily disregard that cyborgs exist in the capacity that is presented in the show and that separatist movement never historically became as terribly tumultuous as the show presents it as, the show can, in turn, become something of a real experience.Three is the music. The OP “The Light Before We Land” is an English number sung by the Delgados. Combined with the crash of the drum set, the strum of the electric guitar, and the embellishments of the chorus, the female singer, complemented by a male vocalist in the background, has this harrowing air, reverberating with power yet, at the same time, calm. The ED “Dopo il Sogno ~ Yume no Ato ni” by Opus has as its title a mixture of Italian and Japanese: “After the Dream: There is no Dream After All.” Featuring the vocals of a female, complemented by the pipes of the organ, the reverberations of the marimba, the plucks of guitar strings, and brushes on cymbals, crooning Italian in an expressive, operatic style, the crooning broken into two parts by what sounds like some form of prose. It overshadows the OP's and ED's rather lackluster visuals, the former consisting of a rather plain set of introductions of the main girls, the latter simply an image of a spent handgun and casings laying about in the rain. The OSTs of worthy note throughout the show, at one time given its own seconds to cry out, come in various in different versions, I, an orchestra, II, a lone violin, III, a lone piano, IV, a piano, a choir, a string section, a wind section, yet carry a similar melody, a similar truth, a similar pain. A similar tone. TEMAThere's a couple of things about this show that I have to take from the show. A good portion of Episode 2 was more or less a differently angled retelling of the events of Episode 1, and while Episode 9 introduced some excellent characterization, it took some of the edge off what was supposed to be a bombshell revelation in Episode 10. Nitpicking aside, Gunslinger Girl's semi-major problem isn't what it has. It's what it doesn't. The show spends quite a bit of time towards the fleshing out the characters in how they fit with the universe. It's all well and good, but little goes out toward the development of these characters overtime, and what development occurs gives more credence what's going on in the background versus what's going on with them. This isn't to say each character doesn't feel whole and distinct, but I wished there was a little more to them that I could work with. But then again, I'd rather have the current product, pacing and all, over something rushed.FN P90, Winchester Model 1897, SVD Dragonov, Steyer AUG A2, H&K VP70M. Henrietta, Triela, Rico, Angelica, Claes. In the end, they aren't quite just weapons themselves. In the end, they are still people, still children. In the end, and if you has the patience to see this show as it is through to the end, you may realize, in both your mind and your heart, your brain and your bowels, that they are still adolescent girls.I give Gunslinger Girl a 9 out of 10. the same name by Yu Aida, Gunslinger Girl was directed by Morio Asaka and produced by Madhouse, the same studio responsible for animating such shows as Death Note, Chihayafuru, Casshern Sins, and Death Billiards.

Each of the child soldiers in turn have their own personal dynamic toward their specific handler, though common denominator between them is a form of love. Whether that love is artificial or natural, something genuine or an obsession, varies with each pairing, or fratello, as the show takes its sweet time meticulously mapping them. The slow and steady pacing is just right to cover this facet among others, when the girls are on the job and when they are off it in between. In a sense, it makes the atmosphere all the more melancholic, in a resplendent, yet somber sort of way.What else contributes to this atmosphere? One is the cinematography. Every background and object, every sequence of animation is beautifully and fluidly rendered, respectively. Though look closely. The somewhat faded colors, off-color lighting, and carefully placed shadows... it all plays off wonderfully to the maturity of the character designs and the show's general tone.Two is the immersion. An indicator of excellently executed immersion happens when one can honestly watch a show and feel that its universe can trump on in time regardless of whether or not there happens to be an audience watching. Combined with the fact that many of the tensions explored throughout the series are very real issues in real life and the meticulous attention to detail, not excluding the accurate design of each gun and the mention of each gun's specs, every plot-essential element, every plot-shot character, and every plot-important motivation is so seamlessly integrated, that if were one were to momentarily disregard that cyborgs exist in the capacity that is presented in the show and that separatist movement never historically became as terribly tumultuous as the show presents it as, the show can, in turn, become something of a real experience.Three is the music. The OP “The Light Before We Land” is an English number sung by the Delgados. Combined with the crash of the drum set, the strum of the electric guitar, and the embellishments of the chorus, the female singer, complemented by a male vocalist in the background, has this harrowing air, reverberating with power yet, at the same time, calm. The ED “Dopo il Sogno ~ Yume no Ato ni” by Opus has as its title a mixture of Italian and Japanese: “After the Dream: There is no Dream After All.” Featuring the vocals of a female, complemented by the pipes of the organ, the reverberations of the marimba, the plucks of guitar strings, and brushes on cymbals, crooning Italian in an expressive, operatic style, the crooning broken into two parts by what sounds like some form of prose. It overshadows the OP's and ED's rather lackluster visuals, the former consisting of a rather plain set of introductions of the main girls, the latter simply an image of a spent handgun and casings laying about in the rain. The OSTs of worthy note throughout the show, at one time given its own seconds to cry out, come in various in different versions, I, an orchestra, II, a lone violin, III, a lone piano, IV, a piano, a choir, a string section, a wind section, yet carry a similar melody, a similar truth, a similar pain. A similar tone. TEMAThere's a couple of things about this show that I have to take from the show. A good portion of Episode 2 was more or less a differently angled retelling of the events of Episode 1, and while Episode 9 introduced some excellent characterization, it took some of the edge off what was supposed to be a bombshell revelation in Episode 10. Nitpicking aside, Gunslinger Girl's semi-major problem isn't what it has. It's what it doesn't. The show spends quite a bit of time towards the fleshing out the characters in how they fit with the universe. It's all well and good, but little goes out toward the development of these characters overtime, and what development occurs gives more credence what's going on in the background versus what's going on with them. This isn't to say each character doesn't feel whole and distinct, but I wished there was a little more to them that I could work with. But then again, I'd rather have the current product, pacing and all, over something rushed.FN P90, Winchester Model 1897, SVD Dragonov, Steyer AUG A2, H&K VP70M. Henrietta, Triela, Rico, Angelica, Claes. In the end, they aren't quite just weapons themselves. In the end, they are still people, still children. In the end, and if you has the patience to see this show as it is through to the end, you may realize, in both your mind and your heart, your brain and your bowels, that they are still adolescent girls.I give Gunslinger Girl a 9 out of 10."", ""Themes: Girls with Guns, Sci-Fi, ActionAge Rating: TV 14+Availability: CommonPublisher: FUNimation--Story -  The story is one that hasn't probably ever been done before, because of the sheer edginess of the topic it deals with. The story was rather original, although it does take it's basis from a rather widespread genre. The story was well executed, and left you happy at the end. You actually felt a connection with the characters, and felt their emotions.Art - Some of the best art I have seen in awhile. Everything is detailed, I mean everything. The bullets shine when they are coming out of the gun. The...girl's hair flows. The blood is well done, but not overdone, and I think that that was a very good take on the producers part. The blood is realistic amount, when somebody gets shot, they bleed, like they would in real life -- their head doesn't explode and gush blood for the next twenty seconds as the camera pans around their corpse, like in many other series. Realistic art, and great character designs. All the girls, although around the age of twelve, were dealt with in a good way with their designs, and no fan service was given.Sound - Great sound. I watched this series subbed, and the Japanese Vocal Soundtrack is great. All the voices fit the characters, and are believable. The guns sound effects are what really bowled me over though. The noises that the guns make are unbelievably crisp and realistic. You hear each individual shell fall to the ground after they shoot. Also, at the end, the girls sing along to Beethoven's Ode to Joy, which was a nice touch, it being the best song ever written. (Not opinion -- FACT)Characters - I felt that the characters, who are all young girls and their masters were done outstandingly. All the girls were designed not as much cute as they were with womanly charm. The characters are great - you feel their emotions, you get attached to them - everything. There is also quite a bit of character development in this anime, which is great.Enjoyment - I enjoyed this so much that it was literally hard for me to stop watching. Time flew as I watched this anime, and before I knew it, I had watched the entire thing in a day. Fans of Girls with Gun-type shows or NOIR will absolutely love this series.Overall -  A rare gem.

That girl must be the beloved daughter of a wealthy family.""This quote, whose subject is nobody else than Henrietta and the speaker a bomb-making terrorist, is probably the best representation of this series. Its irony is not only painful but extremely clever.As one who\'ve read the synopsis would guess, Henrietta is not the daughter of a wealthy family, but a trained child assassin that carries her P90 automatic PDW on a violin case. The perfume is a ""reward"" she received from her Agency ""guardian"" for the successfully termination of an 8-members terrorist group.She doesn\'t have a true family, and...whenever she\'d be truly loved and cherished if she ever failed on her duties is unknown.Still, if they\'ve met 2-3 years ago, that bomb-maker would be right on the spot. Henrietta used to be, and have, all of those things, until the day violence struck her life and killed her family. She was supposed to be dead with them, if it wasn\'t the Social Warfare Agency, that saved her, healed her and gave her a new reality.A reality that protects others from the fate she had, smells like gunpowder and tastes like blood.Should she be thankful? Regretful? Comply or rebel?She know it not.She can not know.When the Agency took her in and made of her a weapon, she received ""conditioning"" -letter soup for brainwashing-.So, ultimately, the question will inevitably be: Is this ethically acceptable? Isn\'t this fight terrorism with terror?And still, why little girls? Couldn\'t they do it with grown man? Wouldn\'t it be more socially acceptable to do so?Well, conditioning (brainwashing) works better with little kids.Also, it sells more figures and merchandise.Oh.Gunslinger Girl is a heavy and exhaustive drama, that constantly shifts through cruelty, social criticism and glimpses of hope for a better world. All in form of TV animation, and you watch it... for entertainment.It\'s not something you will easily forget on the day after, and comedy lovers might stop reading right here because there\'s none of it.It\'s filled with angst, suffering, and violence. But not graphic violence like similar titles with little assassin girls.Wisely enough, this series\' strength, instead, lies on the reflexive dialogues and the great character design provided by Madhouse.This doesn\'t mean, though, that there is no beauty on it. Love, empathy and hope sprouts even on the most unlikable of the situations, and this story surely proves it.The content of the script  is close in mood of the paragraphs above. It does not have many action sequences (a shame, as they are still gorgeously animated) but rather shows the common daily life of the characters, that, on the surface won\'t portrait the sadness it actually carries.It\'s a master of immersion, and that\'s what hits most of us the most. As you start to sympathize with a character and his/her actions, comes something that makes you doubt him and his morals. But this is no easy thing because as the series constantly makes you judge characters\' decisions, it brings to the table whether you\'d not do the same thing were you on their position.This strongly contributes to the deep character agency, but unfortunately not so much to their development.While these are complex characters with marvelously written personalities and the most convoluted pasts orienting their actions, Gunslinger Girl fails at delivering an actual development (alike the manga, which only focused on it after 5+ volumes). This doesn\'t affect much of the overall job, but leaves a huge gap on expectations.Perhaps, though, this was intentional, as a result of the discussed bellow:The story is organized in a floating time-line.It does not make clear at the start of an episode if that happened after or prior to what you just watched and you\'d only get such information by hints thru it. It\'s imaginable that some situations would be easy to set on a straight time-line but one will notice as he watches that such thing is not necessarily true for Gunslinger Girl and the reason itself is part of the story.I understand this might sound confusing but here\'s the gist of it:Director Morio Asaka\'s intention was to show that all of that could be happening right now/at any moment, but ultimately, it evokes a strong melancholy as it shows that no matter what happens or is done, things are prone to stay the same. It\'s eerie and depressing and that\'s exactly their goal.Enough of story, Madhouse did used to spoil us when it came down to soundtrack and animation. This came out in 2003, had a poor budget and still got better in-betweens than currently airing stuff.The OST fits perfectly the Italian scenario, and the ED runs smoothly with every episode. OP is fine, but also a puzzle on itself: It\'s a song by a Scottish indie rock band, with lyrics in English, for an anime set in Italy.One of the reasons this series makes so much emotional impact is surely attributed to character\'s facial expressions and body language.The void look on the girls\' eyes, the horror of their butchered foes, Giuse\'s struggling looks, Henrietta unsteadiness while in public, all of it along extremely detailed weaponry, with clear mechanics, and no ""anime magical bullets"" that makes curves or doesn\'t have shells.It\'s no surprise that many of us, myself included, shall never acknowledge the existence of a ""second season"" as the studio in charge of that couldn\'t even dream of matching the quality of this work and just fucked things up.Finally, I don\'t have a TL;DR for this.The motivation for writing this review was that, after 5 years I finally finished reading it, and felt the need to spread the word.Gunslinger Girl (manga) is definitely not for everyone and will only be fully appreciated by tragedy theater fans.The anime, however, shines with all its moral debate but also shades a soft light on... hope.Yes, it manages to balance heartbreak with heart-warm and show the beauty even in the most twisted situations.Who else did that on the history of this industry?Gunslinger Girl is a one-in-a-lifetime watch, and a must for any drama anime appreciator. whenever she\'d be truly loved and cherished if she ever failed on her duties is unknown.Still, if they\'ve met 2-3 years ago, that bomb-maker would be right on the spot.

The scene basks in the omnipresent light.  It is an important setting: beautiful, honestly and truly, with no reservation.  What transpires is another matter, but this first impression should be remembered.A man and girl walk into the scene.  The man\'s gaze is inscrutable, but it is not one of appreciation for the beauty.  Turning to look at the girl behind him he muses on their relationship.  ""She\'s my sister...""  Her stare back is a mixture of doll-like emptiness and ready anticipation....It isn’t unhappy, but it isn’t happy either.  Simply…attentive.  There is the sense she was wearing this visage before he looked at her.The man begins to walk again without saying a word.  His ward\'s face lifts ever so slightly and she scampers after him eagerly.  Like a dog following its master, or a duckling instinctively falling into line.  The automaticity with which she stopped and started seems completely natural to her.  The narration continues as they move offscreen.  “Brother and sister.  People joke about it, but what are you going to do?  It’s pretty much the truth.”There is something disconcerting about this situation.  The opening scene presents the viewer with a conundrum: what is the relationship between these two?  The man\'s tired explanation is clearly insufficient, and the offhanded way it is offered suggests he hardly believes it himself.  He certainly finds the joke in poor taste.  The girl is uncanny, her focus never leaving him for a moment.  A brittle rationale coupled with an eeriness of behavior sets the stage for the series.-----------------------------------------------Gunslinger Girl is a peculiar and profound anime.  Its description, that of a clandestine government organization modifying young girls for use as assassins, is unimpressive.  The anticipation is an action series that mixes the usual glorification of force with a heavy-handed bid to garner sympathy using children in distress.  Just another emotional joyride, one which ends promptly and safely with the final episode.  Rate on MAL, post which girl was best, and then move on.Gunslinger Girl is not this series.  A closer investigation will reveal that the violence is not heroic, the anguish not contrived, and the suffering not a spectacle.  It is a sincere depiction aiming to inform rather than entertain.This series is not for everyone.  It is both muted and slow, focusing on the psychological interactions between the characters.  However, it is the opposite of dramatic; many of the strongest feelings, the most painful and joyous moments, are marked with little more than a slight adjustment of the eyes or mouth.  The characters must be watched to be understood, and the significance of events only coming to light after some reflection.Seething beneath the interplay lies something...wrong.  This situation is demented, the usage of innocence in this fashion grotesque.  It is a horror that rarely comes to the surface, but continually darkens the atmosphere and deepens the melancholy.  I have seen Gunslinger Girl critiqued as a moral quandary concerning the of use of children as weapons.  This is incorrect: it is a refutation of using the girls this way, of everything the Social Welfare Agency stands for.  The magnitude of the depravity cannot be properly expressed, if for no other reason than that of decency: this suffering is not so cheap as to be worth only our voyeurism.The result is a deeply haunting series, for there is universality in the setting.  An identification of loss and pain, of impending mortality, of a sense that things are not quite right with the world.  While Gunslinger Girl is substantiated by its well-crafted details, they should not obscure this point.  What happens is less important than why it does, or that it is possible to happen at all.  Its lack of plot and antagonists is a fundamental reflection of this emphasis: it isn\'t about resolving their story, for there is no resolution to be found.If this were the full extent of Gunslinger Girl, it would be worthy of praise for its expert and tasteful handling of the subject matter.  A grim tragedy of expendable innocence.  However, there exists yet one more layer to the series, for which all of the above serves as a backdrop.  What is this core ethos, then?  I do not mean to sound cryptic, but as best a summary that can be given is that it is a meditation, a reflection on the unmitigated suffering and an affirmation of something beyond it.  I will expand on this no more here, as I would inevitably fail.-----------------------------------------------Story: 9/10Despite appearances, there is a story underneath the series\' episodic appearance.  It is a story of Henrietta, and is twined closely with the allegory in a way that unites her psychology and dynamic with a greater meaning.  It is not, however, particularly dramatic and expectations otherwise should be trimmed to avoid disappointment.That said, this is as good a place as any to remark on the uneven quality of the episodes.  While most are very high, a few of the middle episodes feel notably inferior to the surrounding ones.  The series is not ruined for this, but given my devotion I like to offer full disclosure.Art: 9/10The series is beautifully animated.  There is a remarkable attention to detail which aids the verisimilitude.  Inherited from its source, the weapons and firing technique are given unsurpassed effort.  The major locales (Rome, Florence, Siena, and others) are all identifiable from their depictions alone.  Finally given the importance of psychological states, the facial expressions are exceedingly subtle.  All of this is drawn in a muted pastel which perfectly reflects the beautiful-but-melancholy atmosphere.With this said, the series certainly has its failing moments.  There are a few scenes which reuse animation (not the first two episodes, but later events which are intended to be separate).  There are also some scenes which have poor overall quality, but these are never the crucial ones.  The series put its budget in the right place.Sound: 9/10The sound work is good.  I am no expert, but given that the weapons all sound different I presume just as much attention was given to their audio as their visuals.  But what really stands out is the sound track, a composition in the classical Western style that matches the Italian setting.  If you want to know Gunslinger Girl, just go to YouTube and listen to ""Tema I,"" ""Silenzio Prima Della Lotta,"" or ""Tristezza.""  The series also secured the use of, ""The Light Before We Land"" by the Delgados for the OP, and is half the reason I never skipped it while watching.Like the art above, there are a few quibbles here and there.  In particular there is a ""punch"" sound in episode one which sounds comically out of place.  But nothing that could be considered a significant failing.Character: 9/10The characters are in some ways unremarkable, but in others very real.  There are no standout personalities that define the series.  Yet that does not matter, for the genius is in their reality and depth, both as individuals and in the unique relationships they share with their handlers.The series constructions these skillfully with minimal exposition.  It does not tell us what the characters are thinking and feeling, but instead demonstrates them through the actions they take and the expressions they wear.Enjoyment: -/10I cannot offer a rating here, for it is my earnest belief that to completely get Gunslinger Girl is to recognize that it is not entertainment.  It isn\'t unpleasant to experience, but neither is it pleasant.  I have never cried while watching it, but have been reduced to tears when contemplating it later.  It fails all normal metrics of enjoyment: it does not seek to evoke emotional extremes but muffle them.  The action is infrequent and brief.  Sexual titillation is entirely absent.  It exists for another purpose.Overall: 10/10Gunslinger Girl is more than the sum of its parts.  In execution it is superb, in message sublime.  I find it to be deeply resonant, subtle, tragic, and beautiful.  It is my heartfelt recommendation that every thoughtful person take the time to view it. It isn’t unhappy, but it isn’t happy either.  Simply…attentive.  There is the sense she was wearing this visage before he looked at her.The man begins to walk again without saying a word.

I do not mean to sound cryptic, but as best a summary that can be given is that it is a meditation, a reflection on the unmitigated suffering and an affirmation of something beyond it.  I will expand on this no more here, as I would inevitably fail.-----------------------------------------------Story: 9/10Despite appearances, there is a story underneath the series\' episodic appearance.  It is a story of Henrietta, and is twined closely with the allegory in a way that unites her psychology and dynamic with a greater meaning.  It is not, however, particularly dramatic and expectations otherwise should be trimmed to avoid disappointment.That said, this is as good a place as any to remark on the uneven quality of the episodes.  While most are very high, a few of the middle episodes feel notably inferior to the surrounding ones.  The series is not ruined for this, but given my devotion I like to offer full disclosure.Art: 9/10The series is beautifully animated.  There is a remarkable attention to detail which aids the verisimilitude.  Inherited from its source, the weapons and firing technique are given unsurpassed effort.  The major locales (Rome, Florence, Siena, and others) are all identifiable from their depictions alone.  Finally given the importance of psychological states, the facial expressions are exceedingly subtle.  All of this is drawn in a muted pastel which perfectly reflects the beautiful-but-melancholy atmosphere.With this said, the series certainly has its failing moments.  There are a few scenes which reuse animation (not the first two episodes, but later events which are intended to be separate).  There are also some scenes which have poor overall quality, but these are never the crucial ones.  The series put its budget in the right place.Sound: 9/10The sound work is good.  I am no expert, but given that the weapons all sound different I presume just as much attention was given to their audio as their visuals.  But what really stands out is the sound track, a composition in the classical Western style that matches the Italian setting.  If you want to know Gunslinger Girl, just go to YouTube and listen to ""Tema I,"" ""Silenzio Prima Della Lotta,"" or ""Tristezza.""  The series also secured the use of, ""The Light Before We Land"" by the Delgados for the OP, and is half the reason I never skipped it while watching.Like the art above, there are a few quibbles here and there.  In particular there is a ""punch"" sound in episode one which sounds comically out of place.  But nothing that could be considered a significant failing.Character: 9/10The characters are in some ways unremarkable, but in others very real.  There are no standout personalities that define the series.  Yet that does not matter, for the genius is in their reality and depth, both as individuals and in the unique relationships they share with their handlers.The series constructions these skillfully with minimal exposition.  It does not tell us what the characters are thinking and feeling, but instead demonstrates them through the actions they take and the expressions they wear.Enjoyment: -/10I cannot offer a rating here, for it is my earnest belief that to completely get Gunslinger Girl is to recognize that it is not entertainment.  It isn\'t unpleasant to experience, but neither is it pleasant.  I have never cried while watching it, but have been reduced to tears when contemplating it later.  It fails all normal metrics of enjoyment: it does not seek to evoke emotional extremes but muffle them.  The action is infrequent and brief.  Sexual titillation is entirely absent.  It exists for another purpose.Overall: 10/10Gunslinger Girl is more than the sum of its parts.  In execution it is superb, in message sublime.  I find it to be deeply resonant, subtle, tragic, and beautiful.  It is my heartfelt recommendation that every thoughtful person take the time to view it.', 'Gunslinger Girl is an ongoing manga written by Aida Yu. The manga has been going for close to a decade so it\'s only natural that it has some adaptations. Including a series of PS2 games, an OVA and two anime series. Let\'s take a look at the first anime which originally ran from late 2003 to early 2004.Gunslinger Girl doesn\'t have an over-arching story. It\'s a series of episodes, mostly stand alone, which are connected by the overall scenario and the characters. The premise is that you have a government agency that enhances young girls with cybernetic parts and conditioning and then sends them on...missions, mostly involving counter-terrorism. The episodes are really interesting and they cover a lot of material focusing primarily on the girls. The action scenes are intense and the series has a lot of spectacular moments. It forces the viewer to think about the morality of the situation since, in many ways, the girls are better off now that they\'re part of the agency. The only real story issue is that a few episodes reuse parts of earlier episodes for no real reason and it feels like needless filler. This is especially true for the second episode.The characters are especially important in Gunslinger Girl, since the story revolves around them. Fortunately, the characters are very well done. They have a lot of complexity, they interact well with each other, they have interesting back stories and the major characters have to be the most adorable killing machines ever, especially Claes. The only real issue with the characters is that Henrietta\'s crush on Jose gets annoying really quickly. There\'s one other girl with that kind of dynamic with her handler, but they only appear in a few episodes so it doesn\'t have much time to start getting on your nerves.The art is excellent. The background and characters are all very well down. The guns, stars and other various objects are very realistically detailed. The whole things catches the viewer\'s attention. The art is very carefully used to draw your focus to specific points for important scenes and the effect is spectacular.The voice acting is very good, most of the time. Unfortunately, there are several foreign words and names that are used in the series, since it\'s set in Italy, and a lot of them aren\'t pronounced properly. I know, they\'re not using their native language, but you\'d still think that the director would learn how to pronounce these words and pass that on to the actors. The most distracting of these, because it\'s mentioned the most frequently, is ""Jose"", which is said all the time, since he\'s an important character, and never gets said properly.The yuri factor is a 2/10. There are roughly three scenes that are slightly homoerotic, but there are very few of these scenes. The girls are all friendly towards each other, but it never goes beyond that.My final rating for Gunslinger girl is a 9/10. It\'s masterfully put together. As a character study, it really works. I only have a few complaints and they\'re pretty minor. If you\'re a fan of high-paced action and complex characters, I would definitely check it out. missions, mostly involving counter-terrorism.

While I\'m about to bring up many things that I felt were bad with the show, and I\'m going to bring up a lot in a concise manner (as I may do an in depth video review in the future) I feel the need to quote my bio on MAL. ""Please note that while I intend to be as critical as possible, everyone views a work differently. All my reviews, at heart, are nothing more than personal opinions.""Story:Gunslinger Girl is an abstract way of telling stories about different platonic relationships men have with young girls. By abstract, I...mean very loosely using the plot point that the girls are revived from near death by implementing bio-mechanical android capabilities a la Deus Ex (The amount of, ""I never asked for this!"" is unreal in this anime). I say \'loosely used plot point\' because the whole premise isn\'t really used all that well to infer it\'s necessary inclusion. As you watch, it\'s never explicitly mentioned who the girls are fighting against or for, what their end goal is, what\'s beyond that goal, what makes them important in the world they\'re in, etc. Now, anyone could say I\'m missing the point, because the show isn\'t about the world so much as it is the girls and how they perceive it, but it\'s hard to sympathize with any of them when the world isn\'t shown in any fashion to me as a viewer.For instance, the show goes from one character to the next in an episodic fashion and gives us different settings, characters, and motives for everyone. This would be fine if there was an underlying goal that each character was working towards. If the company they worked for was trying to get a certain target and these missions where to get said target to reveal themselves, then that\'s enough of a foundation for me to keep interest. However, each episode opened up with new EVERYTHING, so not only did I have to learn new motives, but the setting these girls were interacting with, and then I had to interpret how they interpreted the events, making me wonder what the hell the creators were attempting to interpret.Just a mess. A real big mess. There\'s an event that takes place near the end of the show that seems to have some semblance of a goal that could have made for a great mystery throughout the show, but it showed up far too late in the series to redeem anything, and at that point it was already so miserable and boring to watch I just couldn\'t care who or what the characters (who, at that point, I knew well) wanted or worried about.Not only that, some of the conflicts aren\'t relatable to begin with. Now, the power of storytelling is you can make any fantastical situation believable and relatable through the power of strong characters and circumstance. The key thing here is that Gunslinger Girl is just a tad too unbelievable to get behind. There isn\'t really an effort to make sense of why young girls are chosen other than the writer wanted to satiate some sort of disgusting fetish of his or he just wanted to be a little edgy with his world building. ""Oh, we could have random people be revived and become android people. Better yet, why don\'t I pick LITTLE GIRLS? That\'ll tug on the heart strings! And if not, at least it\'ll make my loins tingle seeing girls shoot people dead!""I\'m hyperbolizing, no doubt about it, but when the show spends little-to-no time giving any depth to the world it\'s set in, poorly writes reasons for reasons, and attempts to discuss somewhat mature discussion themes, you have to wonder what\'s going on in the minds of those behind the screen.Credit where credits do. As an episodic show, there were 2 that I found enjoyable and fairly tight. Again, the little arc at the end of the show was somewhat engaging and I really do wish it was prolonged from the beginning to end to give me some kind of hook. Anime can be short but when I commit to a show I hate to think I\'m stuck spending 4 hours being miserable and bored the whole time.Art:I didn\'t find the animation all that engaging and the washed out filter every color had was so grimy and disgusting. The show wasn\'t pretty (not that it had to be) but the gritty feel didn\'t seem to fit, either. Is it so impossible to add a bit of warmth to your series without it seeming like a film of dust coated the lens?Similar to the story, the artwork is forgettable. Character designs are enough to tell everyone apart but I\'ve already forgotten what they look like. Perhaps that\'s because, thankfully, everyone looks close to realistic in this show, but when I think about other shows with realistic character designs (Texhnolyze, for intance) I can picture a character in my head and their design immediately. Perhaps that goes to show the importance in characterization when it comes to design, but also, it\'s possible that this is a FAULT of poor characterization. I don\'t know. I just know what I know, and I know the artwork is quite tasteless. It\'s not like eating wet bread, but more like toast without cinnamon. Just crusty sustenance to get you through the day.Sound:Things sound alright and the OST is functional at best but there wasn\'t anything spectacular. There\'s a them of classical music used throughout the show but it feels really pretentious considering the show itself failed to exceed any value beyond ""boring and ridiculous."" I don\'t know what could have been used in place of it, but I do know that it\'s laughable and snooze worthy.Also, the best part about the OST is that one of the low toned tracks sounds just like a song used in Disney\'s Haunted Mansion ride. Better yet, it\'s not even the song USED on the ride, it\'s a song that plays in line as you go into the mansion. Holy cow, I couldn\'t take any scene seriously when that song came on.Character:I don\'t know what else I can say about the characters. I\'ve said so much in the story section and I even had a part discussing them in the art segment. What else can I say? They\'re not just underdeveloped, they then treated like important and relatable characters at all times.Enjoyment:Miserable. Miserable. Absolutely miserable. I was so bored. I couldn\'t wait to be over with this anime. It was so uninteresting and everything about it was a complete turn off to me. I enjoy introspective narratives, I like tactical espionage with a splash of science fiction, but I mean, come on, the second episode nearly repeated the first half of the first episode, and then later in the series the same scenes are shown AGAIN. Do you know how CONFUSING that is when your SECOND EPISODE seems so similar to the first? I thought my Netflix messed up replayed the first episode.

It’s a nice and fuzzy feeling. You have to watch both seasons and read the manga to see where that feeling leads though. I promise everything’s great though, even the low budget season 2.I think huge time lapses in publication and the different mediums are why Gunslinger Girl reviews are so polarizing. The story was conceptualized in the late 1990s. Season...one aired 2003-2004. Season two aired 2008. The manga ran 2002-2012. This franchise has some pretty interesting generation gaps especially when you think of the audience.  Probably very few of the old reviewers have experienced the whole thing. I could write miles and miles about Gunslinger Girl but I’ll just bullet point some interesting things about the franchise. I’ll be a bit forgiving and write about the franchise in general since it all ties together anyhow.-Yu Aida is a savant and does excellent background research-He apparently completed the main plotline of Gunslinger Girl shortly after the manga began serializing, so plot inconsistencies are kept to a minimum or are at least somewhat believable. Very respectable, many mangakas just make stuff up as they go along.-Season 1 is super bizarre because it started airing when only 11 chapters of the manga were out. Morio Asaka took some creative liberties spinning the story for the 13 episode format and I think it turned our great.-Yu Aida mentions liking Madhouse’s adaptation in a Gunslinger Girl exhibit available at meiji.ac.jp. I recommend taking a look at it when you’re done with the franchise, it’s very nice but it does contain spoilers.-So many ideas are based on things that actually exist or actually happened. The Italian “years of lead” did actually happen, and the government actually utilized a policy called “strategy of tension” where they encouraged fighting to blow off steam. There are fringe story elements that are seemingly based on minor successes with the U.S MKUltra experiments. A bit later in publication you get ideas related to the war on terror that many readers/watchers can probably relate to.-The Italian government portrayed in the story has a lot of similarities with the CIA-Look at the genres for GSG: “Action, Psychological, Military, Drama, Sci-Fi”. These genres are hard to combine without feeling corny. One way the author makes up for this is by sprinkling heaps of historical context into the story to make it easier to believe. The story for GSG is actually sane and totally believable in comparison to some other things.-I love how you can research something about the story and find out it’s based on something real-You will see a lot of terrorists and they’ll generally have somewhat plausible motives. I highly encourage reading up about the “Years of Lead” to fully appreciate some of the crazy stuff that actually happened.-People fling ideologies around and try to enforce them with violence. I love the moral ambiguity.-There is definitely a cohesive storyline but you’re never forced to agree with what’s being shown to you. If I had to draw a parallel the delivery’s like Raiden’s story in Platinum Games’ Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.-The setting is mostly Italy in the early 2000s. Somewhat detailed in both anime seasons, super detailed in the manga. Lots of pretty architecture to look at.-Conceptual-wise some of the characters are based on mythos and they either play their roles or subvert them. Triela is Snow White for example. Personally I think Rico’s a Hecate.-I tend to love most of the character designs-Cypress trees mean “long life” in Japanese culture yet “eternal grief” in antiquity-Where’s Tiberius?-Triela was named after the town of Trier.-If you’re into militaria you’re going to like this story a lot. Weapon depictions are mostly accurate, well-researched and sufficiently detailed. Madhouse did a great job animating weapon handling and gunfights in season 1. They faithfully adapted banal details like a brass catcher. This falls apart a bit in season 2 though, the lack of budget didn’t allow much detail to go to the guns and that banal detail would constantly appear and disappear.-A certain character’s shotgun is basically a character in its own right with the amount of implied backstory it has. If you tally up some weapons you’ll notice it’s a double entendre about Germany complaining about trench guns in WWI. That was super amusing so I just wanted to put this in somewhere.-Some characters are SUPER memorable but I didn’t feel like any of them were underdeveloped-The story does a terrific job conveying “feelings” and providing subtle commentary about them without being cheesy-Please think about the idea of parenting when you read/watch this. There are nice parts and bad parts and they’re all eye-opening. I can understand if this story makes people uncomfortable.-The action in season 1 is low budget but it’s generally nice to watch-Season 2 is even lower budget and it’s just passable most of the time-Season 2 looks weird because Yu Aida played a big role in directing it. The season’s art style reflects a new style he tried late in the manga’s publication and it only lasted a few volumes. Unfortunately it didn’t look that good and by the time he reverted his manga’s changes it was already solidified into season 2. That doesn’t excuse how weird it looks, just know that it was somewhat intentional and the apparent lack of budget didn’t help.-OST is really, really good. Especially the miscellaneous music CDs, they often foreshadow plot events or tell stories by themselves if you bother to translate the lyrics. Check out “La ragazza col fucile” and “La ragazza col fucile e poca felicita”-The ending of the story is in volume 15 of the manga and it’s really good, highly recommend reading the manga.-Triela is obviously best girlThat still ended up being a mile of non-specific text but anyways, Gunslinger Girl 10/10 seriously underrated.

Many people complained that they wish the story would focus a little more on violence, but thats not what the story is about; the violence and guns is just what bonds the girls together.In general, I simply loved this anime. Everything about it. I loved the art for it, looks very high quality no matter where you watch the show, if streaming or non streaming. The opening and ending songs with any melodies in between were in fact music to my ears.  I was drawn in by...the story line the most, however, for it is like one I would have never imagined in my life. This is always how I compare things, to if I would have ever been able to come up with the story. Sure the main points of the story seem familiar: assassins, training school, young girls fighting, etc. But the characters and elements that develop a long with the tale is something that exceeds what I ever could have created. If you were an innocent little girl, dying for one tragic case or another, and there was no other cure other then to become inhuman, what would you do? The government finds you somehow randomly from the hospital you\'re at and gives you the option: stay alive, get a new chance at life, but with you\'re memory erased of the past and at the cost of becoming an assassin for the remainder of that life killing so called ""bad guys""? Or, would you say no and die?The story unwinds with 5 little girls who had made the choice to live; each assigned an ""older brother"" (their partner). You slowly learn the past of each girl, their struggles, and their skills during missions. But theres a twist; you also learn the partners past story and skills. At first I didn\'t understand why that was even needed, the anime story itself was already so good! But then it dawned on me: what type of person would it take to sell their life into secrecy and devote yourself to training a stranger, a random little girl? Each partner chooses which little girl to save and become partners with. Some are harsher then others and how they treat the little girls, as the girls newly developed personality starts to reveal this. The ""older brothers"" themselves have dark pasts that are portrayed slower than the girls. This is because at first you think you understand the partner and therefore understand the little girl, but then all of the sudden you learn even more about the partner; realizing that you\'re theories of why a older brother treats the younger sister a certain way is in every way wrong.The anime not only has action, adventure, drama, suspenseful, and with comedy every now and then; but also a proper portion of romance. Though these girls are some of the best assassins in Italy, they are still little girls struggling to deal with growing up. Struggling with how to gain attention, first time crushes, and love. Soon, you start to experience their adolescence with them and feel yourself maturing with each new knowledge the character gains as well. Causing you to relate deeper to each character then you had planned, making their situation that more real.Note: My friend read the manga, so if you plan on watching the anime (both seasons, like I did) then theres no disappointments or anything, but the manga continues with different girls stories at the company while the anime stops after the second season. Just a note if you start to love this anime and can\'t believe its about to end or did end. the story line the most, however, for it is like one I would have never imagined in my life.

The creators have done a really good job on getting the audience attached to the girls and then exploiting that emotion.ACTION: The action in this anime is very well done, it is paced just right and very fluent. There are no outrageous punches thrown or slow motion punches every 5 seconds.ART: The art work is very well done and very professional. You can deferentially see that the creators spent time and dedication with the art work.SOUND: The audio is very well done too....The voices don't make me cringe and I really enjoy watching the dubbed version. The only complaint I have about the dubbed version vs the subbed version is that there are a few times where someone will say something completely different in the dubbed than in the subbed and it changes the episode a bit. Other than that the audio is great.CHARACTER: The characters are very well designed and each have a different type of personality. None of the girls are over the top happy, but are instead just the right amount. As I watched the series i begin to have an attachment with the girls and really start to feel for them and the life they have. The creators of this series did not leave one blemish within the girls personality and all are very unique and amazing.ENJOYMENT: This anime really had me wanting to watch more. This is one of those few shows that have the right mix between action and drama. I consider this the most enjoyable anime i have ever seen.OVERALL: Between the action, drama and characters, there is no reason why I would rate it any lower than a 10. The show performs perfect mixtures of elements(Where most shows fail at), and has outstanding characters and artwork. I could watch this show a thousand times and still would want to re-watch it.

There was plenty of shooting, but not as much as I have hoped for, then again I might as well be asking for a series based solely on shooting and action with no actual plot. I had no problem with the animation and sound, the opening song popped up in that it was the first anime I\\'ve seen with an English opening song. As for characters, there are many \\&quot;fratello\\&quot;s (teams consisting of a GSG and a \\&quot;handler\\&quot;) and their...GSG\\'s character is all based on the handler. In the end, it\\'s a little less shoot-em up than I had initially hoped for, but if you\\'re into this sort of thing, then you shall not be disappointed.

Gunslinger Girl is one of those places.Legit, just look at the concept of this show on paper; it’s a fucking high concept blockbuster plot, a plot that can be surmised in a single sentence, and is easily pitched:“Loli orphans become brainwashed and highly skilled assassins.”Boom.Easily something that can be turned into schlock, just another seasonal Elfen Lied or Aria: The Scarlet Ammo....But wow, if you’re really coming into this anime expecting nothing but lolis with guns, you’re gonna be in for a shock.Because this show is a goddamn MASTER of subtlety. It’s not a show that paints the picture of schoolgirl assasssins as a pretty one; it’s treating the subject matter as if it was something that is happening in real life. It’s treating these girl assassins as real.Hearbreakingly so.To that end, Gunslinger Girl is not a show about lolis with guns.It’s a show about children who only know how to kill.Everything about every girl in this show revolves around their job. Their validation, their sense of self worth, their blossoming into adolescence, their concept of love, all of it, is deeply rooted and drenched in the blood of the faceless men they’ve killed and will kill.Murder is not a sin, nor just a job. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a gauge for these children to measure their worth, their meaning.That theme, that aspect is constantly and unrelentingly placed on the forefront of this show. Not just in one approach, either; every single main character, every child, is not a brainwashed robot. They’re real, little girls, with real individual personalities. The way those personalities clash and highlight the personalities of their fratellos, their handlers, sheds light on how the minds of these girls operate, further highlighting that theme of killing as a lifestyle and using that as a tool to create deep and compelling characters.It makes these characters’ actions and dialogue and interactions have more weight, have a more tense urgency to them, ultimately making them feel more REAL.This show’s subtlety goes beyond the writing of the characters. As aforementioned, the world is painted as one that is realistic, gritty. Not tryhard gritty, but realistically seedy. It doesn’t go full on edge, amping up the blood and the darkness of the lives of these girls to heavy-handedly make us feel sorry for them, which would have been an EASY thing to do.Instead, the heartbreak is found in just the very REALITY of their lives. Every time we see a girl pick up a gun as if it were a common everyday tool, it’s heartbreaking. When we see them discover new little joys in life by comparing it to the job of assassinating, it’s grim. It’s sad and horrible without persuading us to feel that way. It shows us how these girls live, lets us soak in their everyday life, lettingthe audience just wallow in their darkness.But the most beautiful part of this show isn’t the phenomenal character writing, the world building, the sense of dread and heartbreak of this atmosphere, instead, it’s the smallest, littlest light that shines through; it’s the little moments and gestures that shows these girls, no matter how shitty and cold their lives are, have hope.Even after killing an entire mafia sect, the girls have time to read, to bond with each other over tea, play with toys. Even if they know their fratellos see them as nothing more than tools, as nothing more than weapons, they still feel an emotional connection, a bond that goes deeper than conditioning and brainwashing.They look forward to every tomorrow, to every next moment of respite, even when they FULLY KNOW, that it might be their last due to their limited lifespans. The girls don’t wallow in their misery, in the fact that they are just weapons made of flesh and blood, they rise above it.They keep moving forward, they try to enjoy life and each other as best they could, they have hope.That’s something that even us, as normal people, normal viewers looking in, can take home with us.In no other sequence is this more overtly shown than in the final seven or so minutes of the last episode.What easily could have been a bigass gunfight with blood and explosions, or even a teary-eyed monologue on the nature of life, is instead a sequence of these girls outside in the cold night air, literally singing an ode to joy.Knowing full well that their lives are commodities, knowing full well that their shelf life is a short one, knowing full well that love is a luxury they can seldom experience.And yet, they still sing out in the cold, holding hands, eyes bright.Acceptance of a fate nobody should ever endure.Hope in the face of hopelessness.Succinct, bittersweet, and altogether beautiful, this was Gunslinger Girl.

Gunslinger Girl alone changed the way I view anime I\'ll admit I used to only want to watch anime I was told had great fight scenes cause I really only liked it for the fighting but after watching gunslinger girl I now view it in a totally different way and am now in it for the story and character development.Gunslinger Girl starts off with an awesome opening immediately leading you to believe your in for an action packed ride but this is not the case, although the anime...does have action scenes where these cyborg girls really show you what they can do (kicking ass and assassinating people) where the story really shines is these cyborg girls and their love for their handlers or ""Fratello"" each girl and their Fratello counterpart have a unique relationship and you find yourself equally interested in each one and wanting to see more and more as the story progresses, The things these girls will go through just to please their Fratello and do the best they possibly can and the affection shown from girl to handler really shows you how much these girls love their Fratello and will go to extreme lengths even giving their own lives if needed to ensure the protection of their Fratello.As you get deeper into the story you find you no longer care about seeing flashy fight scenes, you now only care about the story and seeing these girls characters develop into some of the most interesting characters I\'ve ever seen.While the girls seem sweet and innocent (Which they are) the thought of knowing they could snap anyone\'s neck in a heart beat just adds to the enjoyment as you watch them and their Fratello go on missions together and in their everyday lives you cant help but wish someone would piss one of these girls off so you can see them do what they\'ve been trained to do, although there aren\'t a whole lot of action scenes the ones they do show are tastefully done and leave you feeling satisfied. Keep in mind there are only 13 episodes and for the 13 episodes they had they did very well and with only those 13 this series made it into my top 5 favorite anime if that gives you any idea as to how good this series is you will not be disappointed after watching this anime. does have action scenes where these cyborg girls really show you what they can do (kicking ass and assassinating people) where the story really shines is these cyborg girls and their love for their handlers or ""Fratello"" each girl and their Fratello counterpart have a unique relationship and you find yourself equally interested in each one and wanting to see more and more as the story progresses, The things these girls will go through just to please their Fratello and do the best they possibly can and the affection shown from girl to handler really shows you how much these girls love their Fratello and will go to extreme lengths even giving their own lives if needed to ensure the protection of their Fratello.As you get deeper into the story you find you no longer care about seeing flashy fight scenes, you now only care about the story and seeing these girls characters develop into some of the most interesting characters I\'ve ever seen.While the girls seem sweet and innocent (Which they are) the thought of knowing they could snap anyone\'s neck in a heart beat just adds to the enjoyment as you watch them and their Fratello go on missions together and in their everyday lives you cant help but wish someone would piss one of these girls off so you can see them do what they\'ve been trained to do, although there aren\'t a whole lot of action scenes the ones they do show are tastefully done and leave you feeling satisfied.

On the contrary, it is actually a drama that focuses on character relationships. While it does contain action, it is far from the main focus as there are only a handful of action scenes throughout the 13 episode series.The show focuses on the Social Welfare Agency which, on the surface, is an Italian government sponsored charity organization. However, this is a front for the real purpose of the agency, a sort of anti-terror/anti-crime organization. A branch of this organization that directly handles these problems employs not only well trained gunmen, but also cyborgs that...happen to also be young children. The reason for this is simple, the mechanical modifications would be difficult for an adult to bear, but a younger human is able to adapt to these changes much more easily. Along with training they are paired up with a handler (the team is called a fratello, or sibling), and undergo a brainwashing process called conditioning. Conditioning is a process that allows the cyborgs to be more efficient and loyal in battle, but also shortens the life of the cyborgs.As was said, the show is a drama, not an action title. The majority of the season is spent introducing and developing the relationships between the handler and cyborgs in each fratello. Some handlers are stricter with their cyborgs, while others are more coddling and there are those in between. The show explores the moral, psychological and social consequences of not only the fact that young girls are being used to fight terrorism, but also the entire concept of conditioning.This is almost to the show’s weakness, though. The show is indefinitely slow paced to a fault and there isn’t any sort of overlying plot. The show spends the first nine episodes giving us character introductions and developing the concept, but the final four episodes are spent with two separate incidents. While this is treated as the ending to the show, it lacks any sort of proper climax. That being said, the show does a decent job with the characters and development. The show as a whole manages to tug at the heartstrings, though it never manages to really pull at them.The animation is good, working best in the few action scenes given, though the action is usually one sided almost never inspiring much danger towards the protagonists. The music is wonderful, using a variety of orchestral pieces to slightly upbeat jazz for a few dire scenes. The soundtrack is beautiful and is the key in helping the atmosphere of the show.In the end, Gunslinger Girl is definitely not for everyone. The show is slow, and fails to have build tension when needed. However, it is above average and should be watched by a viewer who is in the mood for a short drama. happen to also be young children.

I stumbled upon the series enticed by the premise of young girls working as assassins, but I found so much more. I laughed, cried and grew along with each girl as the story progressed.The show might not be so well received by viewers looking for a different approach. See, although at first glance GG appears to be an action series, once you get two or three episodes in you begin to understand it's really a character driven drama. So if you go in expecting over-the-top gunfights ever other scene, you're going to be disappointed. But...this hardly takes away from the show's weight; once you find yourself relating to one of the five main characters, you'll be hooked until the all too soon end.That's one of the show's biggest strengths and weaknesses at the same time - it's very short, only about 4 hours, 20 minutes in all. With such a big cast to support, this means a few very intriguing characters really only get one or two scenes to shine in. But boy do they shine. Each episode is filled with very heavy overtones about mortality, unrequited love and loss of innocence, despite whatever plot happens to be going on. Not to say that the plot is poorly written or that the action is bad - on the contrary, several fights keep you on the edge of your seat, and a few specific villains were set up quite well to perhaps return later on (I haven't yet seen the sequel or read the manga). And this also means that it's quite easy to do what I did and power through the 13 episodes in a day or two.There's one warning I have to issue above any other; GG doesn't just pull at your heartstrings, it rips them right out. I was left in tears at the end of the series, and I doubt I was the only one. Each girl's story is shown to be tragic, some even more so than others. Anyone who's ever questioned their own mortality, had a hard life growing up or ever been disillusioned about love will find themselves wrapped up in each girl's story. It's absolutely worth it, just don't go in expecting all happy endings.What really sold me at the end of the day was the art style. Madhouse did a superb job adapting what was already a great story into a true artistic masterpiece. The animation, symbolism, dialogue (I watched the sub, but from the one episode of the dub I watched it's not much worse), music and characters come together perfectly. One thing about the music - the mostly classical soundtrack fits wonderfully, but it eventually gets a bit overused, and the strange fight music isn't as great. But overall, Gunslinger Girl is a work of art that I'll be watching several more times and that I sincerely recommend anyone looking for a emotional piece of literature give a try. this hardly takes away from the show's weight; once you find yourself relating to one of the five main characters, you'll be hooked until the all too soon end.That's one of the show's biggest strengths and weaknesses at the same time - it's very short, only about 4 hours, 20 minutes in all.

In C.S. Lewis\' words, it is the better kind of ""romanticism"", inspiring you to desire a more holistic salvation/grace from beyond this world.Baseline quality: 9.8/10.Pros:+ Heartbreakingly melancholic, but not overtly sensational or flatulent.+ Solid story arcs that handles heavy thematic matters with respect, maturity and refrain.+ Well-grounded narrative. Most of the characters are easy to resonate with. It effectively uses its historic setting rooted in real conflicts and cultural legacy of Italy. Almost every element...has a realistic weight to them. You\'d expect the sci-fi cyborg factors add some power fantasy into the mix, but no they don\'t, and that\'s a good thing.+ Endearing characters.+ That finale and so many different emotions it can stir inside you.+ Outstanding audio-visual presentation enhanced by one of the best anime soundtrack ever.+ For me, the whole of GSG is significantly greater than the sum of its parts.Cons:- Depends on your interpretation, certain elements might be off-putting (but the subdued character arts and overall tone overcame that aspect in the anime, in my opinion).Long review: (minor spoilers for both the manga and the anime)Gunslinger Girl, for the most part, reminds me of a conversation between Dr. Tenma and an old and retired assassin (sniper expert) from Naoki Urasawa\'s Monster: ""On my last mission, as I aimed my gun on my target, he started adding sugar to his coffee, one spoon, two spoons, three spoons, and the sweetness manifests in my mouth as I watched him enjoying this simple process. Then I found myself unable to pull the trigger anymore. So, dear Doctor, if you find yourself unable to pull the trigger, just try to forget the taste of sugar.""A few months ago, someone on a gaming website randomly recommended this show from 2003, and the premise sounds slightly disturbing and repulsive. A few days ago I tried watching the first episode out of curiosity, and I finished the entire 1st Season in 2 sittings. Before I watched the S1 finale, a fellow anime fan warned me that the ending ""was too much for him"". So I was warned.The show is brutal not because of any explicit gore or blood, but rather because how human it is. You\'d expect a Nikita ripoff with cute anime girls, but the show put the audience mostly in the shoes of parents of dying, dehumanized daughters, and ask interesting questions. For example, who are the bad guys that should be punished for creating tragedy for these little angels-turned killing machines? The impulsive answer would be ""bureaucratic drones in the Social Welfare Agency"" or ""the girls\' scum parents"" or even ""the bad guys who killed Henrietta\'s family"".But as the story progresses, you would learn that there are no easy answers to the heavy questions like that. For example, most if not all of the handlers/supervisors are rather caring. Take Angelica and her handlers for example, as the first ever cyborg girl, she was literally the treasured little angel for these stoic military men and women for quite a while. Marco and co-workers truly treated her like their own daughter, and this heartwarming love even drove these trained killers to write their own fairy tale for this adopted daughter. But as Angelica\'s health and memory deteriorated due to the side-effects of cyborg augmentation/conditioning, Marco could not bear to witness her gradual decline, therefore distancing her and treating her harshly. Is Marco a coward? Bad father figure? A bad agent who mixed up private life with impersonal public duty? There is no simple answer. Just like everyone in Section 2 who cannot help but humanize these poor cyborg girls, even though they were never supposed to do so for the benefit of bureaucracy. From the perspective of Rico, you cannot even fault the Agency, since the Agency practically extended her natural life, granting her a short, bloody life that slightly better resembles ""the image of a happy girl"" than her previous life.Among the handlers, Jose is the ideal big brother/potential love interest, caring for and humanizing Henrietta with all his heart. Elsa\'s handler Lauro is Jose\'s polar opposite, treating Elsa in a completely cold and pragmatic way.

But for me, that\'s exactly what the show is about: treasuring and loving your family even though none of us can escape death.The show can be so understated and refrained in its handling of emotions, that certain types of audiences would even find it too slow or boring (e.g. the review with most views on Youtube said so). But the show worked for me, entirely exceeding my expectations. If anything, it makes me want to value every minute with my family/friends more. It is a hidden gem, as long as you don\'t go too far into fan fiction or other potentially uncomfortable interpretations.10/10. A masterclass in understatement and subtle resonance. has a realistic weight to them. You\'d expect the sci-fi cyborg factors add some power fantasy into the mix, but no they don\'t, and that\'s a good thing.+ Endearing characters.+ That finale and so many different emotions it can stir inside you.+ Outstanding audio-visual presentation enhanced by one of the best anime soundtrack ever.+ For me, the whole of GSG is significantly greater than the sum of its parts.Cons:- Depends on your interpretation, certain elements might be off-putting (but the subdued character arts and overall tone overcame that aspect in the anime, in my opinion).Long review: (minor spoilers for both the manga and the anime)Gunslinger Girl, for the most part, reminds me of a conversation between Dr. Tenma and an old and retired assassin (sniper expert) from Naoki Urasawa\'s Monster: ""On my last mission, as I aimed my gun on my target, he started adding sugar to his coffee, one spoon, two spoons, three spoons, and the sweetness manifests in my mouth as I watched him enjoying this simple process. Then I found myself unable to pull the trigger anymore. So, dear Doctor, if you find yourself unable to pull the trigger, just try to forget the taste of sugar.""A few months ago, someone on a gaming website randomly recommended this show from 2003, and the premise sounds slightly disturbing and repulsive. A few days ago I tried watching the first episode out of curiosity, and I finished the entire 1st Season in 2 sittings. Before I watched the S1 finale, a fellow anime fan warned me that the ending ""was too much for him"". So I was warned.The show is brutal not because of any explicit gore or blood, but rather because how human it is. You\'d expect a Nikita ripoff with cute anime girls, but the show put the audience mostly in the shoes of parents of dying, dehumanized daughters, and ask interesting questions. For example, who are the bad guys that should be punished for creating tragedy for these little angels-turned killing machines? The impulsive answer would be ""bureaucratic drones in the Social Welfare Agency"" or ""the girls\' scum parents"" or even ""the bad guys who killed Henrietta\'s family"".But as the story progresses, you would learn that there are no easy answers to the heavy questions like that. For example, most if not all of the handlers/supervisors are rather caring. Take Angelica and her handlers for example, as the first ever cyborg girl, she was literally the treasured little angel for these stoic military men and women for quite a while. Marco and co-workers truly treated her like their own daughter, and this heartwarming love even drove these trained killers to write their own fairy tale for this adopted daughter. But as Angelica\'s health and memory deteriorated due to the side-effects of cyborg augmentation/conditioning, Marco could not bear to witness her gradual decline, therefore distancing her and treating her harshly. Is Marco a coward? Bad father figure? A bad agent who mixed up private life with impersonal public duty? There is no simple answer. Just like everyone in Section 2 who cannot help but humanize these poor cyborg girls, even though they were never supposed to do so for the benefit of bureaucracy. From the perspective of Rico, you cannot even fault the Agency, since the Agency practically extended her natural life, granting her a short, bloody life that slightly better resembles ""the image of a happy girl"" than her previous life.Among the handlers, Jose is the ideal big brother/potential love interest, caring for and humanizing Henrietta with all his heart.

It is a hidden gem, as long as you don\'t go too far into fan fiction or other potentially uncomfortable interpretations.10/10. A masterclass in understatement and subtle resonance.', 'This series has all of the premises of being just another anime, whether one views it as action, drama, or slice of life:1. Young troubled girls in short skirts.2. A secret government agency that goes after terrorist groups.3. Cyborgs and guns.Yet the series is nothing that I have seen before. It tugs at your heartstrings. It raises personal questions and dilemmas. It seems almost real. If I had to compare Gunslinger Girl to other shows, I\'d say that it raises the philosophical questions of Mushishi, the artwork of a Ghibli drama such as Grave of the Fireflies and Whisper of the Heart, and the complex...relationships that one finds between Holo and Lawrence in Spice and Wolf, all without bordering on the artificial female innocence as found in the characters of Clannad. Yet in the combination and execution of these various aspects, this series surpasses them all and is one of only two that I rate 10/10. You can look at my profile pic to guess the other one. But to the series itself:Story:Admittedly, the plot, taken by itself, is nothing special. A government agency creates cyborgs and conditions them to obey the organization and kill terrorists. Although personally I\'m a sucker for government conspiracy plots, this plot adds nothing new to the genre. It has no sudden twists and turns – in fact, I correctly reasoned almost all of the ""shocker"" events. It\'s predictable. At times, it might even seem a bit repetitive. Nevertheless, the action scenes are well executed. There are some interesting subplots. There are no gaping holes in logic. That\'s really all that a plot requires in its basics. 7/10To address the pacing of the series, it matters how to look at the series itself. Going into the series, I never expected it to be only action. By the end of the second episode, I saw it as a drama. By the end of the third, it became a slice of life. Most of the series is not set to advance a certain overarching plot, but instead examines the personal lives of the girls. The story is their lives and who they are. Each episode became a psychological exploration, and to do this right, a slower pace is necessary. However, at no point was I not completely hooked onto the series, for reasons I will state below.Art:The series shines in its art and animation, and is one of the first in its class. Most surprising of all, it was made in 2003! Ten years later, its artwork is still better than most series. The animation is fluid and seamless. Bullets stream through the air and shells rain onto the ground. Although I\'m not a gun expert, I have heard that the guns are rendered in great detail to their originals, and it certainly seems like that. The characters are very appealing in their design: they were drawn before the present moe age and thus do not have the gigantic quivering eyes, the rainbow colored hair in various unnatural arrangements, and the wholly disproportional body that characterizes the genre. They are realistic, unique, and, well cute, without once raising the thought of sexuality. The girls naturally melt into the scenery of the series, which is perhaps its strongest aspect. The series takes place in several modern Italian cities including Rome, Florence, Sienna, Naples, and Messina. I can actually list the cities from the details that the scenery provides. We see the Tiber, the Cathedral of Florence, the Uffizi Gallery, the narrow alleyways of Naples, and the sea from Messina, rendered in lifelike detail. The trees, buildings, and the landscape are all presented as they are in Italy. No details are overlooked – even the stars in the night sky are correctly placed in their positions. The dull color hues that are used also bring out the characters and the landscape, providing a beautiful softness that just adds to the enjoyment. It’s as if some of the scenes were painted in watercolor. 10/10Sound:As a story located in Italy,\xa0one would expect great music, which the series delivers. The opening sequence is perhaps my most favorite ever: a song (in English surprisingly) dark in its undertones, yet promising. It explores the ideas of feeling, loneliness, and the future, promising to “fix what is wrong” and “buy a little time”, exactly what the series does. The animation of the opening is also well executed, showing the darkness that surrounds the characters, and their desire to create something good of it. The opening is also good, with an emotional Italian song rolling with a gun and scattered shells being rained on in the background. Throughout the series, we also hear a violin, piano, and even the choral symphony to Beethoven’s Ninth being sung by the girls. One of the sounds that you will remember from the series is the sound of a gun shooting and shells clanking against each other as they fall on the ground. Superb. 9/10Characters:The most important part of any story, I believe, are the characters. The story should be about them, exploring who they are, what they believe in, their relationships with others, and how they change as they realize more about the world. The girls of Gunslinger Girl deliver. Although horribly traumatized, they seem innocent and cute. Not the girlfriend or damsel in distress cuteness overused in today’s moe world, but the young daughter cuteness, which although similar in its emotion connections, is an absolutely different approach to creating lovable characters. After seeing them, you wish you had a daughter to buy ice cream for and watch the night sky with. Yet, they are not weak. They are killing machines! They know what they need to do in difficult moral circumstances. They stand up for what they believe in. They have desires and beliefs, and are willing to go after them, which is more than many female characters have in anime. They have different facets to their lives which makes them real, and we get the opportunity to explore these different sides to them. No character is the same, and we don’t have many stereotypes that fit them well. Their emotions and relationships with others, from Rico to Emilio, Henrietta to Giuse, and Elsa to her handler (I don’t remember his name), seem real to us. They’re not overdone, yet they have the edge that pulls us in. The question remains, do they change as the story progresses? Change is always a slow process and shouldn’t be too noticeable. I personally hate it when the main character meets a girl and they instantaneously fall in love and want to get married, or when the main character suddenly realizes what they need to do and does it to win the battle. The path to change is littered with self-doubts and confusion, wanderings and pain, all of which the series accurately represents. The girls certainly do grow within the series as they gain new memories and the desire to be “a normal girl”. 10/10Themes:The quality that distinguishes a great series from a good one is that at the end one can say that they actually learned something from the series. Many reviewers cite the question of means vs ends as being the main theme of the series, and it certainly is one. Is the trauma suffered by the girls worth continuing their lives and serving as killing machines? As Rico lays in her bed, she tells herself that having a body is great. The sacrifices that she has to make, including murder, are worth it to her. However, I think other questions are raised as well. First is, how do we treat others who we see as “broken”? Giuse does it by buying gifts and treating Henrietta to vacations, taking on the role of a father in raising her as a regular girl. Does he do so because he knows that she is no longer completely human? Does he do it out of sympathy, love, affection, or some other reason? Is Henrietta “weak” because of this? We also see a relationship between Claes and her handler, who got her to go fishing and read books because as he says, it’s important to be able to spend time leisurely. He compares him taking her fishing to his father taking him fishing – is that an acknowledgement of her still being human? Ultimately, should we treat those who are “damaged” from a desire to “fix” them, to provide pleasure for ourselves, or some other reason.I’ve written enough already, so it’s time to stop.A masterpiece, 10/10 relationships that one finds between Holo and Lawrence in Spice and Wolf, all without bordering on the artificial female innocence as found in the characters of Clannad.

We\'re all going to die, and we\'ll die cold and lonely, not knowing anything!"" - AngelicaGunslinger Girl is an underrated gem. It definitely has some rough edges here and there, but overall the anime is quite layered and well-executed. If you\'re looking for a simple action plot with fight scenes to entertain you I would look elsewhere. This is because Gunslinger Girl shines where most other action shows don\'t. This anime takes a psychological approach to an otherwise simple action plot. If you give yourself time to understand the characters, and the ways in which the anime chooses to flesh...them out, then you\'ll find yourself watching a compelling story that dissects human nature eloquently.One of the show\'s most successful story-telling techniques is the juxtaposition between the Handlers and the girls (who are referred to as \'cyborgs\'). Each Handler forms a two-man team with a particular girl/cyborg to form a \'fratello\' (meaning brotherhood/siblings). However, at the beginning of the story the Handlers and the girls could not be more different to a pair of siblings, to the point that the title is almost ironic. We watch each pair develop throughout the course of the series with a particular focus on the girls and their interactions with each other as well as their Handlers. In every episode, the juxtaposition between the Handlers\' cold demeanor and the girls\' deep-rooted devotion to them (that was brought about through conditioning) is clear. Incidentally, despite the severe conditioning that the girls underwent, when contrasted with their Handlers they seem so much more emotionally intelligent. It\'s tragic how long it takes most of the Handlers to realize that these \'cyborgs\' aren\'t any less human than the average girl their age. But when you\'re conditioned to be a cold killing machine, and you\'re treated as such by the people around you, it would be surprising if the girls didn\'t struggle navigating their humanity. I thought Henrietta\'s character development in this respect was quite excellent. By the end of the show, she\'s self-aware of the artificial nature her devotion for Jose has (due to her conditioning).All the girls navigate their identities differently, some better than others which usually depends on how their Handler treats and views them. As the girls try to manage their intense devotion to their Handlers as well as their identities as young women, we see how the Handlers maintain a cold and restrained demeanor. At first, this is slightly infuriating. Watching these men hold the girls to their strict standards while providing no type of personal/emotional support frustrated me. It seemed like they were going out of their way to be dry and cold. However, as the show progresses you realize that the Handlers are also expected to treat the girls in this manner. This is why even though Jose and Henrietta have the most humane relationship out of the bunch, their dynamic is viewed bizarrely by the other agents.  At first, the show\'s narrative seemed to favor the Handlers and their systematic approach which is why I felt a little frustrated. However, as Jose and Henrietta\'s relationship develops a clear contrast is drawn between them and the other fratellos. We eventually see that the Handlers that are the most distant/cold end up failing (quite miserably in some cases). Meanwhile, Jose and Henrietta who started out as the agency\'s \'troubled\' pair ends up becoming their most efficient team. The difference is obvious: Jose recognizes Henrietta\'s humanity and shows her the respect and kindness she deserves. On the other hand, the majority of the other Handlers can\'t even begin to fathom that these girls are anything other than cyborgs.My takeaway from all this is that success isn\'t attained by ignoring or suppressing your humanity in order to increase your efficiency at achieving a particular goal. Only by embracing your humanity can you achieve your potential. For these girls, cyborg & human aren\'t mutually exclusive terms. This is what the Social Welfare Agency fails to comprehend. In this regard, the agency is its own worst enemy. It\'s not until the second half of the show when the Handlers begin to recognize the humanity in the girls that their results improve or become more consistent. Ultimately, the Social Welfare Agency\'s ethical practices remain questionable, but this first season leaves hope for the future of the fratello in Gunslinger Girl\'s second season.Story: 7The story has a lot of potential. I think the show could\'ve easily been a masterpiece if some of the story-telling was better. Despite the depth of the anime and the great juxtaposition I mentioned earlier, some moments fell a little bit flat for me. The show spends a good deal of time setting things up; whether it\'s creating an atmosphere or building up to a particular scene, the show remains quite contextual. While this helps flesh out the subtleties in characterization, I think sometimes they choose to spend a little too much time doing this which slows the story-telling.Art/Animation: 8I thought the animation and the art style were good. The character designs were a tad bit bland but true to nature. For an anime made in 2003 there were actually some very well-animated moments. I loveddd Henrietta\'s chase scene after the man steals her bag.They tried their best to go for that ~Italian/European vibe~ with the city\'s design which was somewhat successful? I don\'t think the city\'s art style screamed Italian but it wasn\'t far off either. I\'m giving it an 8/10 instead of a 7 because I feel like there weren\'t really any major issues or disappointing scenes.Sound: 9The sound is definitely one of the show\'s highlights, especially towards the end. The opening and ending set the tone perfectly, they never felt out of place within the rhythm of the story. Overall, the soundtrack was great.Character: 8It might seem like the story has a pretty straightforward narrative, but the way it\'s portrayed in the anime is very subtle. From the quick glances to the small talk, Gunslinger Girl relies on subtleties to flesh out complex characters. Due to this, it\'s easy to miss certain elements if you\'re not paying attention. The characters can seem dull if you don\'t give them their due. Essentially, the show relies on the audience to put in some effort in understanding the characters properly. Nonetheless, the characters are pretty well written, especially Henrietta and Triela. I think the Handlers could\'ve been developed more, but perhaps the second season will work on that.Enjoyment: 8I really enjoyed watching Gunslinger Girl! It\'s definitely more of a slow-paced action anime (which might seem counter-intuitive) but the way the characters and the story is developed is pretty good.Overall: 8I highly recommend this show to fans of psychological anime! them out, then you\'ll find yourself watching a compelling story that dissects human nature eloquently.One of the show\'s most successful story-telling techniques is the juxtaposition between the Handlers and the girls (who are referred to as \'cyborgs\').

Instead of the assumptions that it is purely surrounding wars and fighting, try to watch it. Though not as emotional as Clannad or Kanon, this anime focuses on unfortunate girls in life that are given a second chance, though under extremely unfavorable circumstances.Story 9/10Original, but lacking development at the beginning. Basically, the government takes girls (who had unfortunate, unrepairable damage done to them mentally or physically) and gives them a second chance at life to help them kill rebellious forces.

The animation was fluid and there was hardly a still frame during the cation scenes. I like how they even added a few bits with Italian text to give the sense they are actually in Italy (Buon Natale)Sound is magnificant in this show, the opening is a wonderful slow song that often gets described as melencholic and really fits the feeling of the show, the background music had a variety of orchestra classical music, some lovely work on the piano and some pieces with a violin, and each gives a nice feel and adds to drama/action. The ending is nice song with almost opera like vocals. Each voice actor did a perfect performance in the English dub and really made the girls seem cute.Each girl gets an episode that focuses on them and we get to explore how each girls relationship with her handler differs from the others, there are cases like Henrietta and Jose who are close and treat her like a little girl, and then theres Rico and Jean who can be distant and treats her like the weapon she is, each girl is also portrayed with very different personalities, Triela get looked up to, Claes is the smart one. One thing i would of liked to see was the bomb makers more as they seemed like their story could have been expanded upon.Overall Gunslinger Girl is a magnificant show that portrays is characters well. The show blends multiple genres together, it uses some action and shows what the girls are capable of, then throws some drama in and we get to see how they feel about everything and even some sci-fi but it never delves into it. one thing that differed them slightly, there is a little CG but it was barely noticable.

Each girl has a male handler and is very attached to him.This is not a typical cute girls doing cute things show, but these girls are really cute and likable.Story mostly revolves around agency work, who are something like Italian FBI or special forces. They fight organized crime and terrorism and use...these cybernetically enhanced girls at soldiers. It is mostly bi-episodic (one story two episodes long)A lot attention is placed on relationships between a girl and her handler. They are different in each pair. Sometimes dynamics in these relationships lead to unusual plot twists.Overall I really like the kind of relationships girls have with their handlers. I very much would want a relationship just like that. Guise and Henrietta as well as Jean and Rico are better examples of these dynamics. Others are not so much.Overall this show has an unusual combination of gritty fights with mostly nice and warm relationships between girls and their handlers.I will readily recommend this show to anyone, unless you are feminist who opposes objectification of women.

Instead, this agency deals with terrorists, the mob, and other such criminal organizations, by assassinating their leaders.Now meet Harrietta, possibly the cutest little girl in the world, trained by the government to be the perfect killing machine, a weapon of war and destruction, a tool and nothing more. She is the perfect weapon, skilled in her trade, unquestionably devoted to her handler, Josay, able to go unnoticed because...of her innocent and harmless appearance. After her parents were brutally murdered she was taken in by the Agency, her memory wiped clean, her organic body replaced with cyborg parts making her very much like Darth Vader from &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; or the Major from &ldquo;Ghost in the Shell&rdquo;. She is a tool to be used and disposed of when her usefulness is done, but at the same time she is still the little girls she once was.Gunslinger Girl is a show that I&rsquo;ve been meaning to see for some time now. I&rsquo;ve known about it since I started watching anime two years ago, but not until now have I had a chance to actually sit down and watch it. I thought I&rsquo;d like it, after all sad and depressing anime&rsquo;s like &ldquo;Now and Then, Here&rdquo; and There&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grave of the Fireflies&rdquo; are among my all time favorites, but I had no idea how completely amazed I&rsquo;d be with it.Let&rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way; this is one shockingly grotesque show. Think about it, it&rsquo;s about little girls, some maybe as young as ten, being transformed from cute little school children into coldly efficient killing machines. Is there anything more disturbing then seeing a little pre adolescent girl wielding a machine gun and killing at will dozens of people? Is there anything sadder then said girl pleading to be allowed to do so again?&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve only killed six people this month, but last month I killed at least twenty, so can&rsquo;t I come back to work?&rdquo;Although this show relies on its action and disturbing content early on to draw the viewer into the story, it doesn&rsquo;t dwell on it throughout the shows entirety. It isn&rsquo;t about the gun slinging at all, it&rsquo;s about the gunslingers and their handlers. None of the characters are wasted, especially the cyborg girls, each of whom received adequate detail to their characters and plenty of history. Herrietta, Triela, Ricko, Clide, Angelica, even the reclusive and barley mentioned Elsa (who looks a lot like Sara from &ldquo;Now and Then, Here and There&rdquo;) were treated with just enough love and care to make their characters more then killing machines and into confused, emotional, and caring little girls simply doing their best to please those they love and feel needed. Their stories are the real meaning for this shows existence. One was born paralyzed; another was nearly killed by her parents who needed the insurance money. One by one their stories unfold. Each character has at least one episode devoted to them with Harrietta acting as the sometimes silent, sometimes active observer. Unlike other shows which try this approach, such as &ldquo;Air TV&rdquo;, these characters aren&rsquo;t dropped once they&rsquo;ve produced the desired emotional effect. They all have a part to play in this story; each one relies on the others in order for the show to move forward. They need each other. But despite the attention to detail put into each character, in the end its Harrietta&rsquo;s story. She is the common denominator which glues the characters and events to one another.Where the emotional stories lie exclusively with the cyborg girls, the moral, ethical, and philosophical dilemmas are for the &ldquo;handlers,&rdquo; the men whose job it is to raise, train, supervise, and care for the girls, to deal with, and they are as different from one another as the girls they train. Josay, Harrietta&rsquo;s handler, feels guilty about the dehumanizing conditioning the girls are forced to go though and tries his best to alleviate that guilt by trading Harrietta as a little sister. He takes her on vacations to the Italian countryside, buys her expensive gifts, and tries his best to have her act as if she were a normal little girl. But deep down he knows that he, and the agency he serves, is merely using her as a tool; a means to an end. He deals with this guilt more and more as Herrietta&rsquo;s affection and emotional attachment to him grow stronger. He is a man torn between his duty and his love and affection for her.Other handlers deal with their girls very differently. Some act cold and menacing towards their girls in order to instill fear and discipline, others simply treat then as if they were machines.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re cool and all; they can get you a soda if you ask them to, but it doesn&rsquo;t go beyond that to me.&rdquo;No matter what the approach they take, the girls always develop a strong emotional attachment to their handlers and desire their affection above all else, with devastating consequences sometimes.The animation in this show may not be flashy, but it&rsquo;s more then adequate for a show of this nature. The battle scenes are done extremely well, as one would expect, as well as the stunning scenery of Italy. The characters are drawn as cute as possible to make their actions all the more shocking. The music isn&rsquo;t worth making a big deal out of. Although the background music serves its purpose and sets the mood very effectively, it isn&rsquo;t something to listen to by itself. It&rsquo;s rather simplistic. The opening and closing songs are likewise less then noteworthy.Gunslinger Girl is not a show to be missed. Although it is very much like Ghost in the Shell in regards to the philosophical questions it raises, the depth of its characters and the attention to detail the creators put into making them is well worth the time, energy, and money. It may not be the best anime ever made, but it certainly is one of them. Good to see a depressing anime that doesn&rsquo;t drop the ball at the end.Questions to ponder while watching.1. Is Josay, Harrietta&rsquo;s handler, a moral person? Is his using Harrietta as a tool negated by the fact that he tries to make her happy? If he makes Harrietta happy, is he still acting immorally by using her, as the agencies pawn, as a tool?2. Are the girls really human? If so, then why? What is it that makes them still human beings?3. Do the ends justify the means? Does the fact that the agency uses these girls to foil potential terrorist plots which could kill innocent people make it right to use these girls as tools and weapons?Replay value; High. of her innocent and harmless appearance.

The series revolves around the relationships between the Fratellos. It is truly awe-inspiring how much development happens in every shot of the anime. Every scene is depicted with such grace and conviction for what it's trying to show us, even though the pacing of the show is deliberately slow. It develops characters and relationships with long walking scenes and scenes of them...doing regular “work” stuff like training and doing missions. It tells us about the girl's relationships through subtle dialogue between the girls, through moments of solitary reflection after an event. It's difficult to try to explain the amount of work the imagery and directing do. Every detail told in the anime is done so subtly and delicately that it demands your attention. If you're not used to, or able to, put in as much attention to detail as the series demands, it will seem slow and boring. It is not an action series. It's a psychological drama that drives into the psyche and personalities of its characters by showing us what they're like, not by telling us. If it shows you a long scene of simply two characters walking is because how they walk with relation to each other and the mannerisms in which they do so is important for building the characters and their relationship. If it shows you a long scene of a girl simply reading a book it's because it demands that you think about why she's doing that, what are the implications and ramifications of her doing so when everyone else is somewhere else and with what expression she is doing it with. This anime is brilliant in a way that is hard to describe, and hard to see. Hopefully, I made my point. This anime is not for everyone. It requires work to appreciate. It's extremely serious and contains very serious themes. Doing so requires it to be somber and dark for the entirety of the run. The tension set by the plot is always present and the pacing serves to reaffirm that. The series is not perfect, or if it is I missed it, but the way that it does its character development is very special. It has my highest recommendation. doing regular “work” stuff like training and doing missions.

It has my highest recommendation."", 'Set in modern-day Italy, Gunslinger Girl follows the exploits of the Social Welfare Agency (often referred to as simply ""the Agency""), ostensibly a charitable institution sponsored by the Italian government. While the Agency professes to aid the rehabilitation of the physically injured, it is actually a military organization specializing in counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism. It comprises two independent branches, Public Safety (公安部 ,kōan-bu?) and Special Ops (作戦部 ,sakusen-bu?), with Public Safety being its surveillance and intelligence-gathering arm and Special Ops its anti-terrorist division.[1] Special Ops is itself divided into Sections 1 and 2,[2] the latter of which employs young girls fitted with cybernetic implants as agents....The implants, which consist of synthesized muscles and carbon fiber frames, result in heightened strength and reflexes as well as high resilience to damage and pain. Each girl is paired with a male trainer, or ""handler"", and together they are referred to as a fratello (Italian for ""brother""). The handler is responsible for the training, welfare and field performance of his charge, and is free to use whatever methods he considers suitable. While these methods vary according to the handler, a common part of each girl\'s regimen is brainwashing called ""conditioning"", which produces a deadly assassin with unquestioning loyalty to her handler.♥♥ALL ABOUT  THE CHARACTERS♥♥The core characters of Gunslinger Girl are the fratelli. To date, all of the fratelli shown are male handlers (usually in their 30\'s or 40\'s) with female cyborgs (usually in their early to mid-teens). The relationship between a handler and a cyborg can be a complex one and each fratello exhibits a unique dynamic. Most of the handlers have police or military backgrounds and were recruited directly into Section 2. Most handlers also chose their own cyborgs, though there is evidence that some had specific cyborgs assigned to them. Supporting the fratelli is the rest of Special Operations, Section 2. This includes the medical staff who both created the cyborgs and maintain them, other human operatives, and administrative and support staff. Arrayed against the fratelli are the members of the Five Republics Faction—also known as the Padania Republic Faction or PRF. These people and their backers seek an independent northern Italy through acts of terrorism and bribery and operate throughout Italy, though they are strongest in the northern regions.♥♥ALL ABOUT MANGA♥♥Gunslinger Girl, written and illustrated by Yu Aida, first premiered in Japan in the November 2002 issue of the monthly Dengeki Daioh magazine.

Today\'s series is a fascinating one, as though it might be titled ""Gunslinger Girl"" the crux of the story does not revolve around gunplay. Yes there is some shootouts, but it\'s not an action packed fest. This, however, enhances the viewing experience from my point of view. As always, we\'re looking at the dubbed version here. Let\'s tear this gun down and see what we have.Story: 8The girls in the show are all recruited through some terrible means. They are all near death when the government agency steps in and takes over. Having the parents...sign over all the their rights, the government proceeds to make them top secret projects: innocent appearing young girls who are remorseless killers. This causes problem, one for the fact the \'conditioning (brainwashing)\' process is far from completed and the girls struggle with memories and feeling cropping up at inopportune times.There is also the problem that by removing them from society and putting them in a dorm, they have no one to look up to. The befriend each other, but each as an adult male handler, and they project all their confusing \'daddy issues\' on them. Some handlers treat their girls like nothing but weapons, meant to be used, and discarded when broken. Others, as our main guy believes, that the girls are still inherently human regardless of their cybernetic upgrade. He goes out of his way to show affect to his little girl partner, often earning the scorn of his fellow handlers.But because the girls are limited to the only adult interactions with their handlers exclusively, they develop over dependency on them, making the meaner handlers that much worse. These girl know they have been given a second chance at life and are pretty wholly committed to do whatever they can to please the most important person in their lives: their handlers. Combine that with lethal training, and if the handler says killing five people would make them happy, the little girl is going to drop five bodies in quick succession.This of course leads to a moral quandary Should little girl be used in such a matter? Would it had been better off for them to have died of whatever was killing them in the first place? I understand the dichotomy of the situation, who ever thinks that the little girl with a violin case is carrying a P-90 or other assault rifle before it\'s too late? There is also the problem that in the cybernetic parts of the girls meant to facilitate longer life, is in fact killing them. They were dead without them, and with them they are only given a small mount of borrowed time. Is it better to have died as a \'normal\' child, or is it better to gain months or years if that time must be spent killing others?The backdrop to the killing is that the show takes place in Italy and there is a violent back of terrorists called the Republican Faction trying to use force and terror to achieve their aims. Since suppressing dissidence with violent force, the government hands the problem off to the \'black book off the charts\' Second 2 where they girls operate from to handle the \'issues\'.The meat of the story, for me at least, was the dynamics of the girls both with their handlers and with each other. Cyborg or no, they are still just little girl with little girl dreams and aspirations. While they can and do maintain friendships among themselves, some have a strained relationship with their handlers. I know I\'m making the handlers sound like a bunch of pricks, but that\'s not always the case. The main guy I believe loves his girl dearly, and shows her kindness often. Others have reasons for their own motivations, through personal trauma and the like. In fact one of the grumpiest handlers has a damn good reason for feeling the way he does about his girl. The interactions and developments of these relationships are far more interesting than the occasional gunfight.Okay, yes, the story is slower, and more deliberately paced, but to pull off the remarkable story they did, it had to be that way. Come in expecting John Wayne level shootouts and you will be highly disappointed. This is far more the thinking man shooter show, and not the run and gun type.Art: 8This is an an older title and it shows. The appearance is just what was standard for the turn of the century and there\'s nothing wrong with that. It\'s just not quite as overly-busy like is in vogue now. The visuals get it down and that\'s what counts. The girls all look like sheltered (even if assassins) girl with little \'normal\' contact withe the outside world. The drawing is clean and the lines simple and never once did I see something that really stuck out as being out of place.Sound: 8Of course the question here is: do the guns sound right? I\'m no marksman at all but the firearms all made what I would deem appropriate \'thump\' depending on size and use. The pistol doesn\'t sound like a machine gun, and the machine gun doesn\'t sound like a rocket launcher.The voice cast is pretty well done. There\'s no truly ear screeching voice, not even among the girls. The \'main\' girl does sound a bit young and naive but that\'s dismiss able and not a deal breaker at all. The is one girl that sounds very much older than she appears, but it works for her character\'s actions. The male handlers are all well done. The caring guy seems to genuinely inflect his warm feelings for not only his girls, but all the girls in the organization. The mean one sounds like an ass, and the middle of the road guys don\'t really stand out (as they aren\'t meant to do anyways).The must is awesome. The opener and closer are both really great, and the background music is fitting for each scene.Character: 9This is where the show shines. We see a lot of the girls earlier on alone or with just their handlers. As the series goes on, we seem them interact between each other more and more. With these interactions we see how \'normal\' these poor girls are. The quiet one learns to speak up, and the funny one keeps everything light. The true conflict of the story is how we can see a girl waste a room full of terrorists and be back home by tea time chatting and laughing with their friends. This black and white existence is truly fascinating.We see the same through the handlers, some being caring, others feeling the girls are nothing more than tools to be used to even traded away. As time goes, however, we see for some of the handlers things are not what they seem. This particular revelation with one handler and girl actually brought tears to my eyes, even though I didn\'t get sad at any other point.Enjoyment: 9I found the slower, more contemplative pace to set this title apart from a million run-and-gun shows out there. There\'s an aspect of introspection that is not often seen, and it kept me glued to my chair for the entire season, rooting for the girls, wishing better for the trainers. Overall it was a very good time.Best Girl: Treila. She\'s a bit more independent (read not as brainwashed) as the others, and while she\'s a demon with a pistol she is also devoted to serving her handler and of course bringing the girls all together. Badass babe with a gun? Count me in!This was a charming little first season, asking the tough questions and not always having an answer. Where is the line drawn? Who are we to play God and save a soul only to damn it to being an assassin?

Thoughts like this played through my head, and I couldn\'t help but think if I have another daughter, maybe I should train her as an assassin! Just kidding people!', 'I hate the ""secret killer organization with brainwashed young people"" trope. Wait. Do I? I don\'t particularly hate this trope, it\'s just that almost every single one of the shows/series I read and watch execute them poorly, to say the least. Notable terrible ones are Jormungand and Phantom requiem. Pet\'s probably the only good one that focuses on this trope in particular, but that one\'s also a special case since it\'s a lot more supernatural oriented than any other type of show like it.Anyways, what I really want to say is that this ""secret killer organization with brainwashed young people"" trope is so basic and...bland that it\'s hard to get it right. After all, am I supposed to care about a brainwashed kid with assassin-like capabilities? Am I supposed to find the contradictory life they lead, where they cold-heartedly kill and then act like a girl in love and pre-adolescent interesting to see? What I see is truly, a gimmick that is a bait for people who like ""gap"" moe and I guess, and the way of how an inconsistent life of an assassin girl leads. It\'s really hard to empathize with these girls when there\'s not much personality that I care. It\'s more of a pity than anything else. It\'s especially so damning that these handlers feel like they have some sort of moral compass when in reality, they\'re just pumping pre-adolescent girls with life threatening medicine and forcing them to kill people for the rest of their short life. Yeah ok,  there\'s the argument that some of the girls that they convert to assassins are just orphans or girls with suicidal tendencies already, and that their current life as an assassin is actually better for them. Well, this prolonging of their life might just equivalent to a person being spared because they\'re going to get tortured for the next 3-4 years before they pathetically die. Are the handlers really that much of a savior if the medicine that they have to take to become assassins kills them anyway? There\'s a whole lot of mental gymnastics these handlers do to make themselves feel better about themselves, but let\'s be honest, these handlers are not doing these kids much of a favor.I think there could have been a chance for this show to not be awful if the main focus of the show was a runaway assassin being chased down by other assassins, and in the story, there\'s focus on that single person learning to emphasize because they\'re no longer being conditioned with medicine. Yet, I took a peak at the later chapters of the manga: this never happens. You\'re forced to watch these girls suffer, try to maintain normalcy, all the while being assigned missions to kill others. I guess the entire point of the story is the melancholic tone and tragedy that forces these girls to be brainwashed and fighting machines, but I really don\'t care. I think anyone can make a story about someone getting tortured in unfortunate circumstances, but it\'s not going to magically make me think a show is good because of it.This is just the plot, but the rest of the show is also awful. Let\'s talk about animation and art. This show was released in 2003, and it sure as hell looks the age. The pacing is downright trash. There\'s still frames of people talking for 10 seconds or more, multiple times, every single episode. It\'s either that they\'re in a room, in a car, or just walking, but there is so much filler content in which there\'s no movement, and not even any meaningful dialogue just to drag out time. The anime episodes are so slow. They managed to drag 2 chapters of the manga into 3 episodes, when they didn\'t even adapt all of the manga material. I actually switched to manga because at least the manga had much better pacing, and I\'m not looking at 6-12 minutes of content being dragged out to 24 minutes of content.I definitely think that if the art wasn\'t terrible, and this plot of girls being part of an assassin organization was only a prelude to a resistance, and I hate to say it, but if the plot was more like Phantom Reqiuem in how these conditioned assassins betrayed their organization, anything to move the circumstances of these girls around, the series would have caught my interest. Perhaps that\'s just not the goal of the story, and instead the goal of the story is for the reader to lament of the girls\' misfortunes. If that\'s the case, then I\'ve got nothing else to say. It\'s incompatible with my expectations. bland that it\'s hard to get it right. After all, am I supposed to care about a brainwashed kid with assassin-like capabilities?

It\'s incompatible with my expectations.', 'using guns to create a moral wall with characters can be really hard. and it can especially be difficult to create a story where a young cute girl is competent with a gun or relies on a gun to stay safe. or at least it is hard to do it right. which is why nine times out of ten we get a gungale online or something like that. it\'s not always like this but for the most part it is.this show is not however. this show is the complete opposite. and it is one of the best shows i have ever seen for it....when a show bases all of the main characters on little girls who have no hope for the world other than being able to clear out a room full of Russian (or Italian or whatever) cretins with nothing but pin point accuracy and the sass of a P90. it sets a very unorthodox premise that also breaths life into the show.this show has a weird thing where the characters have very little from the beginning and by the end they still don\'t have much. but this works because the characters are pretty much fucked in the brain from the beginning.the entire identity and asteteic of this show is purely melancholy. even the positive characters never really have anything positive about them. there are no overwhelmingly positive characters which does not cheapen the experience because it feels like the show is not fully placing all it\'s eggs in the ""wish fulfilment"" basket. if a character is left with questions that go unanswered then it is not because of bad story writing and is more because some things don\'t need an endingthis is one of the most genuine anime i have seen so far and i have yet to see another on the same level. also that first opening is amazing. when a show bases all of the main characters on little girls who have no hope for the world other than being able to clear out a room full of Russian (or Italian or whatever) cretins with nothing but pin point accuracy and the sass of a P90. it sets a very unorthodox premise that also breaths life into the show.this show has a weird thing where the characters have very little from the beginning and by the end they still don\'t have much. but this works because the characters are pretty much fucked in the brain from the beginning.the entire identity and asteteic of this show is purely melancholy. even the positive characters never really have anything positive about them. there are no overwhelmingly positive characters which does not cheapen the experience because it feels like the show is not fully placing all it\'s eggs in the ""wish fulfilment"" basket. if a character is left with questions that go unanswered then it is not because of bad story writing and is more because some things don\'t need an endingthis is one of the most genuine anime i have seen so far and i have yet to see another on the same level. also that first opening is amazing.', ""So this anime is very unique to me due to it's nature. For one, it was one of the first anime I have ever watched. Second, the art style in it is very different from most anime I have seen (Which I am talking about how the girls are animated.) With that last statement being stated, if you get into this anime, do not expect the same art style to be used in the second addition to the Gunslinger Girl anime. With that part out of the way, the story line for me, is very complex. Of course when I first seen it, I was...a little kid and only like guns, anime girls, and killing. However, the second time I have seen this anime, I got more involved in the story line. I understood the start of this anime and what exactly was going on, but towards the end (but not completely at the end) it took on another form that made me question the first part of the story line. Doesn't mean it's bad but it did make me kind of relate to the characters and their feelings. And of course, after every good anime I watch, I always have those tears. But for the ending of this anime, it wasn't just tears because it was ending, it was tears because of how it ended. a little kid and only like guns, anime girls, and killing.

Even the opening title song and sequence is so telling, it fits the series perfectly. It's rare that I listen to an Opening song every time, but I did with this one. The score is wonderful accompaniment to the carnage, but is non-intrusive throughout. This series bravely underplays scenes, letting the ambient sound be the music. The foley work is sublime.Some would say that it's slow going, but I personally think the pacing is well done. Once you get passed the first two episodes, things pick up and become well worth the wait. Each episode is about...23 minutes long, including opening and closing title, so you can really blast through them quickly (Took me a day and a few hours).The thing I found most disappointing was the ending, as the subject matter and title would lead you to believe there is a huge mission and a shootout with some angst and going insane, but there's none of that at all. If I had to put it into any genre, I would say that this is a drama, looking into the lives of these characters punctuated by some scenes of shooting. The title 'Gunslinger Girl' is extremely misleading.And maybe it was just me, but I thought with the jumping around story line, that they were following one girl, when in fact the younger version I thought was the older one further down the line, were actually two separate people (not a spoiler, simply my own mistake). I only realised this in the last two episodes, so most of my brain power was aching from trying to retrace the individual backstories mentally. I'm sure that was just a personal problem of mine not paying enough attention.The last episode itself was moving and touching, but it didn't have a 'THE END'. There isn't a well-defined story arc (Exposition, Climax, Resolution) across the whole series, which adds to the unfinished feel to the end.Overall, if you're the type of person who is more invested in the characters and stories, but who also likes a bit of action and slight gore, then this is a good anime to watch. It's absolutely beautiful, introspective, smartly written, and the sound work is sublime. It has its pitfalls, mainly due to what the name of the anime sets you up for. If it had been named 'Gunslinger Girl Academy', that might have given a better idea of what the series would entail: A poignant drama. 23 minutes long, including opening and closing title, so you can really blast through them quickly (Took me a day and a few hours).The thing I found most disappointing was the ending, as the subject matter and title would lead you to believe there is a huge mission and a shootout with some angst and going insane, but there's none of that at all.

If it had been named 'Gunslinger Girl Academy', that might have given a better idea of what the series would entail: A poignant drama."", ""Gunslinger Girl is yet another example of an anime that could have been great had it not focused on all the wrong aspects.When series have 12-14 episodes they don't have much time to thoroughly introduce more than 1 or 2 characters; Gunslinger Girl gives 5 characters their own episodes to show you their back story and their relationship with their handlers. When a series dedicates half of its episodes to introductions, that doesn't leave the plot (or lack there of) in good condition. To be frankly honest there was no actual plot. There's no antagonist, protagonist, climax, nothing. This show's plot is strictly the character...development of these little girls, but if that's the case they didn't need to use half the series to introduce them when they could have easily knocked all of them out in one or two episodes and leave the rest to the character development. After the character introduction's the series basically consists of the girls talking to each other and their handlers. There are far too few action scenes in this series, and none of them last longer than 2-3 minutes, which is a shame because the action could have been the best part of the series.The story and pacing might be poorly executed but pretty much everything else shines.

There are far too few action scenes in this series, and none of them last longer than 2-3 minutes, which is a shame because the action could have been the best part of the series.The story and pacing might be poorly executed but pretty much everything else shines.

During the story you learn a little bit about each character and the organization they belong to along with the handlers perspective of life. Its hard to tell if these girls are being used considering they arent even considered human by some of the handlers. GG was a bit disappointing in the fact I wish the anime would have shown more of the lives the girls lived before they were turned into assasins. I did enjoy the...fact the the plot wasnt to strong letting the characters point of veiw get soaked in but a bit sad that there wasnt much of an ending.

I was ready to witness the inspiration for powerhouses like Code Geass and Death Note, the beautiful story of morality in politics. Instead I get this... convoluted mess. I was so set on enjoying this show that after every single episode I would make excuses for the show. Whether it was the episodic beginning of the show or the fact that there was literally no underlying story behind the show, I would constantly try to reason it away. But now, after finishing all 28 episodes, I have nothing else to hope for except that...the manga will be better. Lets do the categories.Story: 0 or 3I want to give the story a 0 cause it didn\'t have one... but I went with a 3 to be fair. The first season starts off episodic and then each episode basically deals with its own event even after the show stops being so episodic. After a while, the characters start to work together but there is still no true story to the season. Which is absolutely stupid considering the girls are fighting terrorism. Hell, the RF in season 1 could have been the big ""boss"", but instead they just fall apart and you dont even know why. And thats not even a spoiler. Im not even kidding. Its such a waste of potential.Characters: 8Despite giving this an 8, its STILL a freaking let down. This show should have been a perfect 10. I mean, you have your 5/6 fratella who each operate in their own way. Thats brilliant. And to some extent this part is done quite well. You get to see how the handlers cope with the stress of treating girls like tools. You get to see how the girls choose to think about their lives, how they mature, how they interact. My issue with this show is the complete lack of characterization for the terrorist groups (Outside of Pinocchio in season 2). By making the welfare agency ""right"" in this conflict (Which is what happens when you dont show us the terrorist perspective) the show completely loses all nuance. Even the moral question of what the agency is doing to the girls loses nuance. Its a complete waste.There is nothing else I want to say honestly. I think this show suffers because it does not introduce the ""enemy"" perspective.

This series is a beautiful one from beginning to end, with many cute, gun toting girlys. You can't help but fall in love with them at first glance, especially my personal favorite Henrietta (incredibly adorable). That is until the cuteness atmosphere is broken by her violin case being opened, only to reveal a machine gun, of which she (Henrietta) wields quite nicely I might add! This series has many emotional moments, plenty of action, and a strong storyline to boot, but I...feel it is lacking in this department just slightly.

The opening and ending music in the series is excellent as well, which isn't always notable in anime.One negative thing I can comment on is the length of the series itself, being only thirteen episodes long.

It may have minor spoilers too.I was attracted to Gunslinger Girl by my interest in guns. I really like animes that display good action and some ""gunporn"". While Gunslinger Girl provided this, it was not the prominent focus. In fact i could highlight other nice characteristics it brought, like the care in reproducing Italy, the controversial plot and the beautifully produced ost.I give the Art Direction at 3/3. Aside from some ""cookie faces"" and distance broken models, you can notice a good effort being put into the scenery,...clothing, characterization, OST etc. Speaking of OST, its vast and beautiful, mostly made of classical themes. Again, the details for clothing, scenery representation and general animation are above good for a 2003 anime.The writing is a 2/3. The central plot sets up a dreary mood to the series, however the cast is rarely upset about it, and when they are, they are not willing to do something to show they really care about little girls being used as murdering cyborgs. It lacks explanation on technologies being used to transform these girls, and very little information is given regarding its functionalities, but honestly it isn\'t a bad thing. I feel like less focus on these details gave more importance to other factors.I could say that it\'s a non-linear plot and the character backgrounding is ok, nothing too deep. The only character i could feel some noticeable development was Henrietta. Aside from that, the stories are enjoyable and bring some ethical questions to the table. The penultimate story is thrilling, bringing an investigation with different perspectives from opposite sides and gives a good idea of what the second season could be about.For uniqueness and enjoyability i would give a 3/4. Gunslinger girl is a good anime based on it genres, made with noticeable effort for 2003. it is more drawn to the psychological side and the setting representation. Totally my fault to expect fast paced action while its themes differs from it. Of course there is a little, but its not this series focus.I don\'t know anything technical about photography or cinema, but i dare to say that someone with a background on it would really like these factor in the anime.

While the written review is for both, the score is just for the first season. ""Il Teatrino"" gets an 8.5, rounded up to 9, from me. The first season just gets a solid 9.No spoilers here, but there will be some detailed explanation of the premise. Also, I\'m long winded, and I really liked this series, so I have a lot to say. If you can appreciate a detailed, analytical review, read on. If you lack in patience for such things, you might want to skip this one.The plot of this series...revolves around an Italian government organization known as the “Social Welfare Agency”. This agency helps crippled and terminal patients recover with cybernetic technology. They apparently actually do this, according to the character Patricia, who is investigating them around the middle of season 2, in addition to their more secretive operations. While the public sees an organization for, well, social welfare, their main activities involve covert government operations and anti-terrorism.They take young girls, I would guess around the ages of 11-15 (judging by the fact that they are described as “adolescent” and that one is on her period in an early episode of season 1) who are beaten and broken both physically and mentally, and have no surviving family, and retrofit them with combat grade cybernetics, making them faster, stronger, and more reactive than the average human. They then “condition” them, a vague, relatively unexplained brainwashing process that makes them unquestionably loyal to the agency and their “handler” (guardian and combat instructor, and in combat situations, commander) but also erases past memories and tragically shortens their life expectancy. By how much, it is not stated, but it is likely that they will not see adulthood. The effects of conditioning are said to possibly be reversible with more research, but this research does not see fruition during the anime (perhaps it does in subsequent manga volumes not covered by the anime?). Each is paired with a handler, an adult male with previous experience in espionage, law enforcement, or military (a previous job with the military police is common).Now let me pause here and highlight something that bothered me a bit. The fact that the cyborgs must be children is explained away by saying that the cybernetic augmentations would not work as well, if at all, on adults. This is fine, I can buy that, children do have incredible neroplasticity, after all. But...why only females? Every single cyborg is a girl, and this is never explained in-universe, which is irritating. Furthermore, why no female handlers? Again, every single handler is an adult male. The “adult” part makes perfect sense, as does the job requirement of having previous relevant experience. But why only men? I realize men still hold the majority of jobs in such areas, but the agency does have female members, Fero, Priscilla, and Olga just to name a few. It is really so hard to believe that a woman could be a handler? I realize this probably has something to do with the somewhat annoying Japanese obsession with the “moe” phenomenon, but it would have been nice to break up the homogeneity with a male handler-male cyborg, female handler-male cyborg or female handler-female cyborg pair.And about that whole “moe” thing. I\'m not completely familiar with the concept, but I know the basic idea is a fascination with the relationship between an adult man and a young girl. Now, before you go and label it as a perversion, although sometimes it is, this “relationship” is often a father-daughter/big brother-little sister type of relationship, and not a pedophilic sexual one. However, sometimes the moe relationship can seem a bit strange and perverted. Many people say that “Gunslinger Girl” subverts the moe phenomenon, because it casts the whole situation in a morally questionable light, others claim it is shameless pandering to it, but I peronally thing the truth is somewhere in between. However, where the whole “moe thing” does exist, it seems to be the innocent, pure kind that involves father-daughter or big brother-little sister type relationships between the handlers and their cyborgs, so it doesn\'t really bother me. That said, more than once a cyborg will admit to having a “crush” on their handlers, but the romantic feeling is (thankfully) never mutual, and always initiated by the arguably more innocent cyborg. What sentiment that certain handlers (though not all) will admit to towards their cyborgs is a loving, guardian-like feeling (although ironically, it\'s the cyborgs that guard them most of the time), and, I am happy to say, never a romantic feeling (because that would be, well...inappropriate to say the least, given the age of the girls in the show). Personally, I was actually moved by some of the sentiments expressed by handlers and cyborgs in this show, in a weird way it kind of made me long to be be a “father figure” to one or more of the girls. They are fearsome fighters, but also vulnerable and needy, and they inspire a protective attitude from adults. I couldn\'t help but want to protect/help them in certain scenes. If I were a “handler” in this universe, I would definitely be like Jose or Hillshire, the thought of treating human beings like “tools of the trade” is unquestionably reprehensible, in my opinion.Now, with that out of the way, let\'s get into what this series is all about: the characters, and their sentiments toward each other. At least as far as the first season is concerned, the action, while present, and good, is not the focus. The series explores the relationships between all the characters, but especially between handlers and cyborgs. Season one focuses mostly on Jose (handler-not pronounced like the Spanish name, the “J” sounds like we would say it in English) and Henrietta (cyborg), while giving other characters a decent amount of screen time as well. Each handler-cyborg pair has a different relationship, and they range from completely nonexistent to professional and detached to fatherly or big-brother like. Note that these descriptions mostly refer to the attitudes of the handlers toward their charges, The cyborgs tend to be unquestionably loyal to their masters, even when treated poorly, although their emotional state is affected by how their handler treats them.I know some action fans might be thinking that this sounds boring, but I personally loved it. If you can stand relatively slow pacing and infrequent, but very good and well animated action interspersed with a great deal of character development, and quite a bit of moral grey-area exploration (the girls\' lives seems tragic from our point of view...but they tend to be happy with their lot in life), then you\'ll probably like this show.It\'s also great to see how the relationships develop over the course of the show. With one tragic exception, most of them improve, even when it comes to handlers like Jean, who treats his cyborg Rico like a mere tool of the trade (he actually refers to the cyborgs as “hunting dogs” at one point in the show...first episode I believe), scolding her harshly when she performs poorly, and seeing little need to praise her when she does well. Although he would probably never admit it, he seems to treat her a bit better as time goes on. He never shows love toward her like Jose or Hillshire, but he\'s actually somewhat nice, is even seen praising her for good shooting, and in general starts treating her like she might actually be a human being. Because...no matter how many reinforced bones or artificial muscle fibers you pack into a person\'s body, even brainwashed, they still have the thought processes and emotions of humans so...yeah, I\'d say there\'s really no question as to their humanity (although some handlers inexplicably disagree).As to the difference in sesons so often commented on....well, there\'s definitely a big difference. As far as animation, the first season, produced by madhouse, was superb. Dark, muted color schemes and heavily detailed character designs and backgrounds coupled with stunningly executed action, where it existed, was a joy to watch. The somber, introspective musical score was superb, and provoked deep thought into the nature of everything that was going on. Every time the girls engaged in violence against faceless terrorists, one part of my mind wanted to think it was awesome, the other was just deeply disturbed (again, this feeling was helped greatly by the music) and, call me crazy, but I liked it. I don\'t usually enjoy tragedies, but there was something about this one...to me it was sort of a “gray tragedy” where overly terrible things don\'t happen, and in fact there\'s some pretty joyous and cool moments, but the whole premise is sort of called into question and seems a bit sad. If you\'re looking for a story with clear cut good and bad sides, where good prevails unquestionably, keep looking, but for a mildly confusing (in a sort of good way) morally gray adventure where the “good” guys usually do win in the end, but it\'s just not that clear-cut, then you might like this show...or the first season, anyway.Now, for the second “season”, which is technically a sequel series by a different studio (artland) called “Il Teatrino”. For what it is, it\'s not “bad”, but it was quite difficult for me to get used to, having liked madhouse\'s rendition so much. That said, once I got over the initial shock (which took 2-3 episodes of perseverance) I liked it quite a bit. Not as much as the original, but still enough to keep me watching throughout (thus the 8.5 point rating for the second, and 9 for the first season). I think the most helpful way to review the second season to help you determine if you want to keep watching once you finish with the first would be a “pros and cons” analysis of the second through the lens of the first.Pro: More focused storyline compared to the first season. Enemies no longer “faceless” There is a more conclusive ending than in the first season.Pro: Character cast expands, character development from multiple characters, even enemies.Neutral point: Focus shifts somewhat from Henrietta and Jose so Hillshire and Triela, the “senior” members of the organization, presumably.Neutral point: Somber music is swapped for arguably cheesy action music (this was a con for me, it almost seems to glorify, rather than question, the girls\' violence, which I did not like)Neutral point: The art direction is more brightly colored. Personally, I liked the muted colors of the first season, not because I always like muted colors, but because it was fitting.Con: Animation, while not bad, is sub-par when it comes to attention to detail compared to season 1.Con: Action scenes practically scream “low budget”. If you can get past this, though, they can be pretty cool.This concludes my review of Gunslinger Girl. I will close by saying that, while not for everyone, this show definitely merits attention, and was, all in all, excellent. Although many of the main characters are children, be warned: the violence is bloody and gory, so if you don\'t let your child(ren) view violent or bloody shows, this one may not be for them. However, if the violence isn\'t a problem for you, I personally feel this show, especially the first season, is a poignant exploration of such topics as the nature of humanity, “necessary evils” done for the greater good, violence and children, and the relativity of happiness (again, the story seems tragic to most viewers, myself included, but the girls themselves seem to be honestly happy) that could be enjoyable for a wide variety of ages, and both genders (and not just girls that are into supposed “guy things”). If this anime seems even a little bit intriguing to you, do yourself a favor and check it out.As for me, I liked it so much, I\'ll probably pick up the manga from amazon to find out what happens next. revolves around an Italian government organization known as the “Social Welfare Agency”.

Now, before you go and label it as a perversion, although sometimes it is, this “relationship” is often a father-daughter/big brother-little sister type of relationship, and not a pedophilic sexual one. However, sometimes the moe relationship can seem a bit strange and perverted. Many people say that “Gunslinger Girl” subverts the moe phenomenon, because it casts the whole situation in a morally questionable light, others claim it is shameless pandering to it, but I peronally thing the truth is somewhere in between. However, where the whole “moe thing” does exist, it seems to be the innocent, pure kind that involves father-daughter or big brother-little sister type relationships between the handlers and their cyborgs, so it doesn\'t really bother me. That said, more than once a cyborg will admit to having a “crush” on their handlers, but the romantic feeling is (thankfully) never mutual, and always initiated by the arguably more innocent cyborg. What sentiment that certain handlers (though not all) will admit to towards their cyborgs is a loving, guardian-like feeling (although ironically, it\'s the cyborgs that guard them most of the time), and, I am happy to say, never a romantic feeling (because that would be, well...inappropriate to say the least, given the age of the girls in the show). Personally, I was actually moved by some of the sentiments expressed by handlers and cyborgs in this show, in a weird way it kind of made me long to be be a “father figure” to one or more of the girls. They are fearsome fighters, but also vulnerable and needy, and they inspire a protective attitude from adults. I couldn\'t help but want to protect/help them in certain scenes. If I were a “handler” in this universe, I would definitely be like Jose or Hillshire, the thought of treating human beings like “tools of the trade” is unquestionably reprehensible, in my opinion.Now, with that out of the way, let\'s get into what this series is all about: the characters, and their sentiments toward each other. At least as far as the first season is concerned, the action, while present, and good, is not the focus. The series explores the relationships between all the characters, but especially between handlers and cyborgs. Season one focuses mostly on Jose (handler-not pronounced like the Spanish name, the “J” sounds like we would say it in English) and Henrietta (cyborg), while giving other characters a decent amount of screen time as well. Each handler-cyborg pair has a different relationship, and they range from completely nonexistent to professional and detached to fatherly or big-brother like. Note that these descriptions mostly refer to the attitudes of the handlers toward their charges, The cyborgs tend to be unquestionably loyal to their masters, even when treated poorly, although their emotional state is affected by how their handler treats them.I know some action fans might be thinking that this sounds boring, but I personally loved it. If you can stand relatively slow pacing and infrequent, but very good and well animated action interspersed with a great deal of character development, and quite a bit of moral grey-area exploration (the girls\' lives seems tragic from our point of view...but they tend to be happy with their lot in life), then you\'ll probably like this show.It\'s also great to see how the relationships develop over the course of the show. With one tragic exception, most of them improve, even when it comes to handlers like Jean, who treats his cyborg Rico like a mere tool of the trade (he actually refers to the cyborgs as “hunting dogs” at one point in the show...first episode I believe), scolding her harshly when she performs poorly, and seeing little need to praise her when she does well. Although he would probably never admit it, he seems to treat her a bit better as time goes on. He never shows love toward her like Jose or Hillshire, but he\'s actually somewhat nice, is even seen praising her for good shooting, and in general starts treating her like she might actually be a human being. Because...no matter how many reinforced bones or artificial muscle fibers you pack into a person\'s body, even brainwashed, they still have the thought processes and emotions of humans so...yeah, I\'d say there\'s really no question as to their humanity (although some handlers inexplicably disagree).As to the difference in sesons so often commented on....well, there\'s definitely a big difference. As far as animation, the first season, produced by madhouse, was superb. Dark, muted color schemes and heavily detailed character designs and backgrounds coupled with stunningly executed action, where it existed, was a joy to watch. The somber, introspective musical score was superb, and provoked deep thought into the nature of everything that was going on. Every time the girls engaged in violence against faceless terrorists, one part of my mind wanted to think it was awesome, the other was just deeply disturbed (again, this feeling was helped greatly by the music) and, call me crazy, but I liked it. I don\'t usually enjoy tragedies, but there was something about this one...to me it was sort of a “gray tragedy” where overly terrible things don\'t happen, and in fact there\'s some pretty joyous and cool moments, but the whole premise is sort of called into question and seems a bit sad. If you\'re looking for a story with clear cut good and bad sides, where good prevails unquestionably, keep looking, but for a mildly confusing (in a sort of good way) morally gray adventure where the “good” guys usually do win in the end, but it\'s just not that clear-cut, then you might like this show...or the first season, anyway.Now, for the second “season”, which is technically a sequel series by a different studio (artland) called “Il Teatrino”. For what it is, it\'s not “bad”, but it was quite difficult for me to get used to, having liked madhouse\'s rendition so much. That said, once I got over the initial shock (which took 2-3 episodes of perseverance) I liked it quite a bit. Not as much as the original, but still enough to keep me watching throughout (thus the 8.5 point rating for the second, and 9 for the first season). I think the most helpful way to review the second season to help you determine if you want to keep watching once you finish with the first would be a “pros and cons” analysis of the second through the lens of the first.Pro: More focused storyline compared to the first season. Enemies no longer “faceless” There is a more conclusive ending than in the first season.Pro: Character cast expands, character development from multiple characters, even enemies.Neutral point: Focus shifts somewhat from Henrietta and Jose so Hillshire and Triela, the “senior” members of the organization, presumably.Neutral point: Somber music is swapped for arguably cheesy action music (this was a con for me, it almost seems to glorify, rather than question, the girls\' violence, which I did not like)Neutral point: The art direction is more brightly colored. Personally, I liked the muted colors of the first season, not because I always like muted colors, but because it was fitting.Con: Animation, while not bad, is sub-par when it comes to attention to detail compared to season 1.Con: Action scenes practically scream “low budget”. If you can get past this, though, they can be pretty cool.This concludes my review of Gunslinger Girl. I will close by saying that, while not for everyone, this show definitely merits attention, and was, all in all, excellent. Although many of the main characters are children, be warned: the violence is bloody and gory, so if you don\'t let your child(ren) view violent or bloody shows, this one may not be for them. However, if the violence isn\'t a problem for you, I personally feel this show, especially the first season, is a poignant exploration of such topics as the nature of humanity, “necessary evils” done for the greater good, violence and children, and the relativity of happiness (again, the story seems tragic to most viewers, myself included, but the girls themselves seem to be honestly happy) that could be enjoyable for a wide variety of ages, and both genders (and not just girls that are into supposed “guy things”). If this anime seems even a little bit intriguing to you, do yourself a favor and check it out.As for me, I liked it so much, I\'ll probably pick up the manga from amazon to find out what happens next.', 'Transitioning from a child to an adult I find myself reflecting on my childhood and what it means to be a child. Is it your age, your mentality, being dependent on an adult? What about your childlike innocence. Well take that innocence and replace that with cybernetic parts and machine guns and sprinkle in some brainwashing you get Gunslinger girl. Gunslinger girl is a 2003 anime produced by madhouse entertainment. It is based on the manga of the same name created by Yu Aida. Directed by Morio Asaka, also known for Chobits and Cardcaptor Sakura.The plot of Gunslinger girl revolves around the social welfare agency...in Italy. Although appearing to be a charity organization that looks after orphaned girls who have survived near death experiences, however the social welfare agency (also called the agency) takes these girls and turns them into the ultimate assassins through the use of cybernetic implants and brain washing referred to as “condisisoning”. Each one of the girls are given a “handler” a man tasked with overseeing training, performance and wellbeing of the girl, each handler goes about his responsibilities in a different manner, some choosing to use the girls as tools and others being a father like figure to his girl. The social welfare agency uses the girl and her handler, called “fatello” for anti-terrorism missions.Audio wise the show is very enjoyable. The show’s opening is amazing, the title song “the light before we land” almost brings me to tears, normally I skip anime intros but I watched it nearly every time. The rest of the music in the show was good as well, all of the other songs on the sound track comprised of classical instrumentals that helps establish the somber mood of the show and fit the European setting. The soundtrack is so good that I would recommend listening to it outside of the show overall Gunslinger girl has an amazing score. The voice acting is pretty good both is sub and dub, I watched it in dub because it’s how I prefer to watch anime unless the dubbing is just flat out terrible (* cough cough Akira.)The show looks good. Not bad not amazing. The whole show uses light pastel colors and the characters are detailed. The handlers and girls look different enough so that you can tell them apart (barley). The guns look awesome, the way they fire, the way they reload their weapons is just outstanding. However most of the show isn’t in motion, there’s not many missions or combat scenes and when the combat pops up it’s a bit underwhelming for a show with such a premise of 12 year-old cyborg assassin girls. But the show isn’t really about cyborg assassin girls, it’s about cyborg assassins that are still 12 year old girls.See Gunslinger girl really isn’t about the girls fighting terrorist, although they do fight terrorist. The show is about the relationships that the girls have with their handlers. There isn’t a main goal to reach the girls just strive to please their handlers in any ways that they can, not only are the handlers responsible for their girls performance and training they are also the girl’s only source of affection. This dynamic to love the girl or to treat them like a tool is the main focus of gunslinger girl, and it reminds me how different trainers chose to train their Pokémon in the anime. Some trainers chose to love and care for the happiness of their given Pokémon, while others (normally the main rival) value the battle performance among all. The same is true with gunslinger girl. This focus of the emotional and mental wellbeing of the girls is why I can’t recommend this show to just everyone for any situation. The show can be a bit of a drag and the whole show rest on its own ability to make you care about the characters if you don’t care about the characters you’ll simply lose interest and get bored.Over all Gunslinger girl is an interesting and unique anime although it’s not for everyone it’s still great in its own right. It’s not the fast pacing action show but a somber look into the complex emotions of young girls who just happen to be unstoppable killing machines. in Italy.

The story follows a different types of girl who have suffered traumatic or near death experiences. These girls are given to an agency and turned into robotic-like humans, who have trainers that help them take down certain people.PROSThanks to Madhouse, the art of this anime is top notch. Everything in the anime, including cities and humans, looks very realistic. This is, unfortunately, all taken away in the second season of Gunslinger Girl. I don't want to get too far into it, but I just really hated the turn of visuals that the second season took (which...wasn't made by Madhouse).Now, I would say that the character development is great here, but I can't completely go that far. The thing is that the character development for the girls are all great. Each one of them has a personality that differs from the other, which makes all of their stories very interesting. The males, on the other hand, don't really have much personality or likeability. Besides Jose, the trainer of Henrietta, everyone else is pretty stale. That's not really a bad thing since the characters that are the center of most of the stories are the girls, but it does, at times, feel a bit odd.The story here is really complex and unique. It touches to the human heart in ways that many anime shows cannot express. By the end, you really feel like you've been on a long Journey with all the girls and understand them better than you did at the start.CONSAlthough I loved the sounds used in Gunslinger Girl, the shooting of guns seemed a bit loud at times. Perhaps this was the fault of my t.v., but I felt that the guns were way too loud in certain episodes. I would regularly have to change my volume up or down whenever shoot occurred or stopped.OVERALLGunslinger Girl is a must see for anime lovers.

Solid show. "", 'The synopsis of Gunslinger Girl misrepresents the anime as an action show. Based on other reviews and discussion on this website, many viewers are surprised to find that they have chosen a drama to watch. This was initially disappointing and although I tried not to let it influence my opinion, Gunslinger Girl overall turns out to be an average show.The anime follows the Italian government’s “Social Welfare Agency,” an organization that takes ill or orphaned children and modifies them into “cyborgs” to hunt down terrorists and enemies of the state. Each girl is given to an adult male “handler,” which is essentially a trainer. There...isn’t really a focal duo, rather, the show follows a different pair or two each episode. It is less about the missions each “brother and sister” goes through, rather the relationship they share.The girls are fully devoted to their handlers, but it is never fully disclosed whether or not their feelings are honest or a result of conditioning. The show questions whether or not the girls’ love is reciprocated, which is answered by varying degrees of “no.” Many handlers see the girls as objects, often referring to them as puppets, pets or tools. Making even a small mistake will warrant physical or verbal abuse from the handler- the girls are pushed, slapped and belittled. The girls simply get up, apologize and promise they won’t screw up again.Conceptually, the series is disturbing, but it overall feels repetitive. From episode one (and the synopsis) we understand that this is a twisted operation, but each episode tends to follow the same formula. Really the last few episodes are the most interesting as several of the girls develop an existential crises.On a technical side, the animation style and aesthetics are very early-2000s, so make of that what you will. While short, the action scenes peppered throughout are pretty good. I like the color selection. Rarely are there bright colors in the frame, rather, the browns, blacks and grays represent the grim world these girls inhabit. The soundtrack is pleasing as well.Gunslinger Girl had potential to be a really thought-provoking show, but is unfortunately bogged down by repetition. This isn’t a terrible show, but I wouldn’t place it high on any watch list. This is a decent anime for anyone with a weekend to kill or in the mood for an alternate to standard magical girl series. isn’t really a focal duo, rather, the show follows a different pair or two each episode.

If you are one of those persons who read my reviews and dislike the fact that I'm so “picky” or “strict” [....which I totally don't think I am] it's probably because I'm aware of there being anime gems like this one out there. This show is exactly...what anime is all about and why non-anime fans will forever be perplexed as to why we like them. This show is quality stuff people, right up there with Ghost in the Shell, Monster and Death Note. Some people don't get what makes this show so great. To them I recommend 2 movies: “Le Femme Nikita” and/or “Point of No Return”. If you watch those movies....and understand them, then you will appreciate this anime.~ArtI love the art of this series, it's a little bit more on the realistic side, as far as size and proportion go. The backgrounds and scenes are given an equally great level of attention and detail as the characters. I totally enjoyed a lot of the panoramic views of the Italian hillsides and coastline, I especially liked all of the scenery shown when Henrietta and Josue go on vacation in Tuscany. The wonderful arrangement of the houses on the hills and the cobblestone roadways/alleys between the houses, you can tell these artists or at least the the art director went to Italy.The animation was also pretty high quality stuff, one good way you can ALWAYS tell if the animation is good is how great a fight scene is, especially close hand-to-hand fight scenes, like for Triela's fight scene.~SoundTen! A Perfect ten. This was a professional soundtrack...other anime shows should take note and follow this example. The OP sounds like many songs played on the radio, especially that one song by Mazzy Star called Fade into You, check it out and tell me it's not very similar [without actually being the same song]. It's an awesome song to chill to, maybe go on a ride in a convertible across the countryside or sit on the beach at night and drink a little wine under the moonlight....I dunno I''m sure you get what I mean. And let's not forget about the ED theme, that opera number. It might be a little corny and predictable to play opera for anime set in Italy but it was a very good piece. I don't listen to a lot of opera except the really popular ones by Maria Callas or Pavarotti, classic opera is boring...unless it's a dramatic voice. But either way I totally loved the ED theme, her voice was very dramatic and I love the Italian prayer or whatever that voice in the background is! If more opera was modern like this, more people would like it.~StorySo Ike I was saying in the beginning, this series is very similar to Le Femme Nikita and films of that genre. The purpose of the show is not to be running around blowing everyone's heads off for the sake of thrilling the audience...,people who might complain about the show being too slow paced probably need to understand that point. Gunslinger Girl is probably 50/50 on the action scale, maybe even a 60/40. But the whole point of the the series is about the human conflict, both internal as well as external. It's about how the girls are perceived as these [inhuman] killing weapons/machines, when it's quite apparent that these girls are very much human and how they struggle with reconciling this fact that they do have these feelings.Just from the opening credits alone you can see this...how Henrietta cries but at the same time smiles AFTER looking at her own hand [the same hand and body for killing others / the same hand and body that allows her to be with Josue].The [excessive] killing part I understood, I'm not sure why other's don't get it....like, they're assassins, not Girl Scouts sitting around the campfire. And as far as it being senseless, it's pretty obvious it affects them but obviously the girls are brainwashed extensively and their principal driving force for doing anything is for their “Handler's” to view them favorably. But the show HAS to be slow so they can properly convey this. This is a slow but well-written story like; Monster and Ghost in the Shell.Speaking of Ghost in the Shell, this show also has some minor political intrigue, which is another plus in my book!~CharacterI like the overall character designs, again, very similar to Monster and also Mushi-shi [. The characters were given a somewhat realistic proportion – at least the adults were. The adults in the anime were mostly men but they had a nice shape to them and I really liked how their faces were drawn, they were given very classically handsome features: wide forehead, strong square jawline also very strong, pronounced noses...they also did not have the typical large anime eyes. The women also to some degree were drawn realistically, but they lacked feminine appeal [I understand they women are FED agents and such, but Major Kusanagi from GITS was quite feminine].OK now the little girls I loved them, but I do have 1 minor critique...which is that they all had the same face. They looked like little dolls made from the same mold but given different coloring and different hairstyles, but the faces are all identical. Hmmmmm, now that I think about it, it's even more fabulous that they DO have assembly-line factory doll look, because if one looked at the show from that perspective, it actually makes the show even more so profound.~VerdictThis is definitely a “must see” for anyone requiring a little more depth from their anime. what anime is all about and why non-anime fans will forever be perplexed as to why we like them.

There is no need to have a character acknowledge communication with a series of grunts, or sudden eye movements. Reality is that the listener is usually quiet, especially during more dramatic scenes, and I found this anime is be exceptional at this, which I feel is one of the biggest sins in current animation.Not only does the anime keep it realistic in said regards, but many others as well. There are no over dramatized emotions. Characters show many different levels or joy and grief, and it's easy to...tell just by their faces. With every character, you can start to understand how emotionally withholding they are, and how that drives the characters to act certain ways, there is no need for the story to spoon feed you their characteristics.The character interactions feel much more (and I use the word again) believable with regards to issues they have, whether between all the girls intimately, or with their handlers in a stricter and more formal manner.

It's audiences are not like people who come here looking for reviews. It's the benefit from what common attractiveness it has on certain people.A lot of people try to make out what's up with an anime, what their messages are and how the entirety of the content gains some sort of ideal goal that matches with their scene. This anime is at a certain wavelength for people who are sublimed and looking for escape. The situation here is some what, inferiority complex revolt around the adolescents...and because of their conditioning they are able to effectively fight single handedly. However, the plot deepens between the handler who takes care and lead them is explored. The manga series is a much more expanded though, the anime is an introduction to looking for a standpoint.Ratings & reviews:Story is fair because there are many greater stories than one about adolescents and tragedy.Art has unique style and isn't bothersome, the animation consecutively done well scene after scene the whole 12 episodes.Sound is technically decent, the opening song was pretty wonderful. The voice acting is well pitched.Characters were very good to watch, it gets stale watching it straight no brakes.Overall Fair. and because of their conditioning they are able to effectively fight single handedly.

It delves fairly deeply into what motivates people, and just how necessary human interaction is for someone to grow and thrive. Another good touch point it reaches well is just how small and precious people are, and the way things can suddenly change or shift with a simple action. Another point of it is that it shows that even amidst the harshest things, people can still be kind to one another.Also the ending was spectacular in my opinion. ', 'The best way I can discribe this anime is to imagine the movie ""The Proffesional"" with Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, except ""Leon"" (Reno) lives at the end and ""Mathilda"" (Portman) is a government engineered cyborg designed to be the perfect assassin. This may be the most heartbreaking and tender series about child cyborg killing machines ever produced... what ever that means. The action was perfectly balanced with the relationship study between the girls and their handlers. If you love the ""Hit man"" genre you must see Gunslinger Girl. On a side note the folly sounds of the firearms were spot on as well as...the artistic interpretation of the real life versions of the guns the girls used. the artistic interpretation of the real life versions of the guns the girls used.', 'Gunslinger Girl is a good choice for you if you want to see little girls fighting for the approval of their father and their daddy issues. Isn\'t that enough to get you interested? Fair enough. Gunslinger Girl is a good choice for you if you wanna see a story about the tragic life of some children, how they cope and how the world treats them.Basically, in this story, these children are taken from some already tragic circumstances and brainwashed into being assassins. What the story does is show that these children will still be children and even if they\'re used as tools for the government...and they would\'ve lead shitty lives regardless, it isn\'t morally sound no matter the fact a very positive relationship might result from their struggles. And how it weighs on both the parental figure for these children and the children themselves. It\'s a story about tragedy.The joke I made about daddy issues stems from the fact they\'re all girls and they\'re all assigned a male handler but that doesn\'t change the story in any aspects. Girls are seen as better for portraying innocence and men are seen as more fitting for the portrayal of someone a somewhat cold and reserved attitude, yet somewhat affectionate, towards their children. It\'s merely an artistic choice to help in the portrayal of the fact that the children that are being used as coldblooded murderers are still children and the decisions of the handlers do affect them but they ultimately do their best to ensure they do their job.One of the strengths of this series is the fact that the portrayed relationships are done well. Like for example I\'ll use two relationships in the series as an example, with both not being really a spoiler, so don\'t worry. The main girl, Henrietta, is a girl that is treat well by her handler and has very little conditioning done on her. Due to this she has developed genuine affection for her handler because he does have her best interests at heart and as such, she tries her best to do the best possible job she can in order to please her handler. While her handler, Giuse, is a guy who does feel genuine guilt over having to put a child through this kind of difficulty so he does try to make her life as good as possible, part of which is also making sure she does do her job. Rico is a girl who is thankful for the second life she\'s been given and she wants to do the best possible she can in order to survive and not be deemed useless by her handler and discarded, so she can continue living a life she considers satisfying. Jean, her handler, is a guy who just sees the cyborgs as a means to an end, he didn\'t sign up to babysit a child and he does only what he needs in order to maintain his asset in the game, while making sure the child has to be useful to him in order to stay in the game.Basically each girl has their relationship with their handler portrayed rather well and they\'re pretty differentiable in that aspect. Since the artstyle is bleak and the girls don\'t have any memorable traits as far as appearance goes, them being noticeable through this aspect and differentiable is only a testament to how well the show has portrayed their tragic lives through the use of these relationships. Each child is indeed, a person, just like the handlers are also, people. Despite the atmosphere and how the series looks, you can see and understand their perspective on things and why they act the way they act, which is a lot more than I can say about a lot of characters in a lot of shows.Although the show has some pretty solid strengths the show has some weak spots as a result of these said strengths. Basically, the show stays very true to its theme, tragedy. However due to how much it focuses on displaying tragedy, the show can\'t be watched for much of anything else. The art style of the show\'s color palette is pretty bleak and even scenes that are supposed to look impressive visually don\'t fill you with anything due to how committed it is to its tragedy atmosphere. The sound is either ambience, like some birds  in the distance or some overall noise or classical music. But no ambient sound is what fits most of the scenes in the series because they\'re useful to the theme and that\'s also there. Most of the show tries to stay as morally ambiguous as possible, but due to its inherent atmosphere, it\'s hard to take what it\'s trying to do sometimes as positive due to a negative thing or negative due to a positive thing. It mostly comes across everything is bleak because the world is bleak.Still these aren\'t what derive the actual weakness of the show directly, because the actual weakness of the show is that it didn\'t really focus on doing anything else. You see, the show doesn\'t really have any overarching plot or any strong point other than displaying the morality and relationship of these characters.  It does have action and such things but most of the time I\'ve watched the action bits I was wondering ""is this portrayed right?"" because children with guns and overall fight scenes with guns can always use some work in most things. And about that in this anime\'s case, anything that seems weird I can generally give it one excuse ""it\'s because they\'re children/they\'re fighting children.""Other than that, it has an one track mind. It would\'ve worked far better if there was something happening, some overarching plot, rather than a slow paced character study, because it could\'ve only strengthened the theme and challenged the relationships and driven better points in them. And perhaps people could also the series for the events that are happening rather than to see who, what and why are the characters? There\'s nothing in this show other than its strong theme. It could\'ve worked for an hour and a half movie if this type of focus would\'ve been chosen but in this case, it doesn\'t really.I could recommend this show to you if you\'re interested in a story about tragedy displayed in a melancholic tone and that tries to be as ambiguous as it can in its morality. But I can\'t recommend it for literally any different factor.

I normally stick to only romance/comedy and keep it light hearted.  That being said I absolutely love this anime! I felt myself so involved in the story and anxious to watch the next episode!This is truely an anime that grabs the viewer and draws you in. I definately recommend! ', '""What\'s important is what you do with the time that you have.""The above quote summarizes the core concept of Gunslinger Girl. It\'s an examination of mortality through the eyes of children who know nothing but bringing death to others. Despite their morally dubious origins and their use as tools, the children of the Social Welfare Bureau remain disturbingly human in how they act and think.To watch Gunslinger Girl is to look into the minds of these girls and those of their handlers, men who impose their own way of thinking onto their charges, whether consciously or unconsciously. How do they see their limited life spans?...How do they interact? What brings a moral person to go to such lengths as to join anything like the Social Welfare Bureau? And how do these men deal with or rationalize everything that they\'ve done?Story:This is not a plot-based series. It is not meant to be about the action. What you see is a series of character studies of each of the main characters. In the first half of the show, the audience is made familiar with each girl, showing us the (often disturbing) circumstances that brought them into the Bureau and the motivations of their handlers. You are given a glimpse of how these motivations work on the blank slates of the mindwiped cyborgs. And, ultimately, you see the consequences of it all.If you are looking for explosions and kung fu action, don\'t bother with this show. If you want bizarre plot twists that leave you reeling, forget it. But, if you want to see character development and to experience some decent emotions from it, watch Gunslinger Girl.Art:Do you remember what I said about action? There is one element that is given meticulous detail: The guns. I am not a gun aficionado by any means, but I can easily see that the artists put a lot of love into making sure that the weapons are drawn correctly.Sadly, that\'s not so much the case with the rest of the art. The backgrounds give you a basic idea of where the story is taking place, whether it\'s at the Basilica or in Florence, or wherever else is being visited. I found myself saying to nobody in particular, ""Hey, that\'s Rome!"" or, ""Isn\'t that Florence?"" But it does little more than give you the idea of where they are. The backgrounds are generally rough with broad brush strokes that allow you to understand what\'s being depicted with providing no more detail than that.Likewise, aside from the girls themselves, it\'s sometimes difficult to tell the difference between some of the characters. I often found myself confused between which handler was being featured at the time. And, when two similar ones were in the same shot, I was at a complete loss until one of them actually said something.It seems like most of the art budget went into making the guns look like guns and making the girls look deceptively cute, while everything else kind of suffered.Sound:I\'ll have to keep this part short. Not being much of an audiophile, I can\'t comment on the sound too much. I\'m not sure if it was a problem with the Funimation copy of the Japanese audio but, a lot of the time, the lip flaps came long before the characters actually said anything. Aside from that noticeable out-of-sync, I\'m sad to say that I didn\'t pay attention to the quality of the sound.Though there is one thing that I\'d like to mention: The choice of music for the opening, ""The Light Before we Land,"" was wonderful. It easily gets one into the mood for what will happen in the actual episode. Just gorgeous.Character:The characters are the meat of Gunslinger Girl, as noted earlier. What more can I say that I haven\'t gone over already? The setting and the events are nothing more than a backdrop for learning the intricate details of how our cast of characters tick. And you will learn about them. You might even find yourself identifying with a few of them. And that\'s the whole point.This is the bit that I want to go into so much detail about, but I can\'t because that will only spoil your enjoyment of the series. I\'m not kidding that this is a character-centric show. But just know that you will wind up feeling something for the people depicted.Enjoyment and Overall:From the moment I started watching, I wasn\'t able to stop until I reached the end, which was both sad and satisfying. I can live with slightly sloppy art and a few minor sound issues if a show offers a solid emotional impact. Gunslinger Girl offers that in spades. While I poked inside the many characters\' heads, I was repeatedly reminded of the philosophy that the story was repeatedly trying to explain. All in all, you are given proper stimulation for both the heart and the mind. You\'re left feeling for the broken people while at the same time pondering what it all means.If you choose to watch Gunslinger Girl, keep this thought in mind: What does life really mean to someone who is already dead?So long as that\'s in the back of your mind, you will enjoy it. How do they interact? What brings a moral person to go to such lengths as to join anything like the Social Welfare Bureau?

I think the proper rating is about 7.5, but this site only allows whole numbers so I\'ll be generous and round up as opposed to down, as I guess it\'s SLIGHTLY closer to an 8 than a 7 if you held a gun to my head and made me choose.Art-I liked the art style a whole heck of a lot. The presentation as a whole is likely...the strongest point of the show. From the gorgeous opening sequence to the sharp, crisp character models that superbly convey the omnipresent melancholy and desperation of the story to even more subtle touches such as the expertly crafted and beautiful clip that plays in the background on the blu ray episode select screen, you\'re in for a visual treat free of CGI and over the top special effects from start to finish. This show is truly beautiful in its presentation.Sound-The music, which to me is also part of the presentation, is GORGEOUS! This is seriously some of the highest quality and most gorgeous music you\'re ever going to hear in an anime and it\'s always super fitting to the scene and the tone of the current situation. The composer, Toshihiko Sahashi, has a lot to be proud of.Likewise, the voice acting was covered by a team of established and accomplished professionals who, as always, nailed it. Rico\'s voice in the dub is a bit annoying in my opinion but that\'s a minor nitpick as opposed to an actual problem with the show. Again, not to be a broken record, but the presentation of the show is excellent and there is very little to complain about in this department.Character-The main cast of five Gunslinger Girls are all likable, sympathetic figures and they\'re all badasses. Likewise, most of the handlers, especially Jose, are likable and believable. This anime doesn\'t have a blatantly obnoxious or blatantly unnecessary character the way many others do.The problem here is in the length and structure of the anime. With only 13 episodes, which is definitely too short for having so many main characters and so much potential in the core concept of the story, and with each of the five girls having an episode devoted almost solely to introducing and developing them, very little room is left (only eight episodes after taking away the five ""special to this character"" episodes) for an overarching story or for further character development. Other than the continued day to day, week to week operations of Section 2 and the continued relationship developments between the girls themselves or between girls and their handlers, there really isn\'t much of anything in the way of an overarching plot. There simply isn\'t enough time with the low episode count to properly develop five main characters PLUS their handlers, nevermind characters beyond that.Enjoyment-I liked what I watched, as the presentation was gorgeous from start to finish and most of the characters were really likable and believable, but the episode count is simply too low, in my opinion by quite a lot, to properly develop the characters and build a proper story. The anime as a whole felt incomplete to me. I got a glimpse into this world and these relationships and then it was over and it felt like there was still so much more to see and so much more that could/should happen. We don\'t get any closure whatsoever as to what happens to any of the girls. The anime simply ends without answering a whole heck of a lot of questions and that felt very unsatisfying. And don\'t even tell me ""there\'s a season two for a reason""- it came out five years later, was made by a different studio and is a significantly worse show overall. It\'s not the continuation of what they\'d already built that it needed to be.Overall-A unique and tragic story with all the potential in the world and one of the most gorgeous presentations I\'ve ever seen in an anime significantly diminished by a far too low episode count (should have been in the vicinity of 24) and as such a feeling of simply being unfinished.+Exceptional, gorgeous presentation and music+Unique, tragic story concept+High quality, professional voice acting+Likable, sympathetic characters-Far too low episode count-A feeling of being incomplete- lack of answers/closureOBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5 ish, rounded to 8 because I\'m forced to choose a whole number and the presentation is just that damn goodPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9 or more throughout, but 6 or less at the end, as it simply felt incomplete. the strongest point of the show.

This Anime was recommended to me by a friend and also by review I came across on this website.When I was deciding whether to watch it or not a couple things came to mind. I didn't know much about the series, well anything really. All I knew was the...given, there were little girls who carry some kick ass weapons. My first impression, before even watching it, was that this would more than likely be another failed attempt at making a kick ass story using unconventional methods.But boy was I wrong! The first couple episodes, I will admit, are pretty slow and drag on. Though the upside is that they pound the information they want into your skull over and over again. Though it starts to get annoying when you aren't seeing new information but the same images and dialogue that I saw couple minutes or the episode before. I wanted to fast forward through the repeats but was worried I would miss some dialogue they may throw in without me knowing. But after the first couple episodes, after the pounding.... things began to speed up and by episode 5 I was hooked.This 13 episode series was a good, quick, action anime mixed in with deep thinking about the meaning of everything.Overall the verdict is a solid 8. rewatch Value: High given, there were little girls who carry some kick ass weapons.

I wanted to fast forward through the repeats but was worried I would miss some dialogue they may throw in without me knowing. But after the first couple episodes, after the pounding.... things began to speed up and by episode 5 I was hooked.This 13 episode series was a good, quick, action anime mixed in with deep thinking about the meaning of everything.Overall the verdict is a solid 8. rewatch Value: High"", ""Story 8: The story surrounding this series is not really important, while still mildly interesting, it is more meant as a vehicle for exploring themes of self worth, the role of parentage, existential crisis, and the morale questions unique to the circumstances the characters find themselves in. However, the story is still damn good, making a beautiful balance between action spy thriller and melancholy slice of life. The narrative gives a very emotionally charged tale that does not pull any punches, and I personally was crying a fair bit when it ended. The only issues are that it doesnt really have a solid structure, instead...having the semi-episodic form that holds an over arching narrative, which is great in some cases, but for a 13 episode narrative... it doesnt hold up as well. If the season was closer to 20 episodes than I feel the narrative would be much more well developed and not have the rushed climax this one has.Art 8: The art is quiet muted, and on first glance quite unappealing, but when you pay attention the art is perfect. This is not a happy narrative, and does not feature many uplifting scenes, and as such the art style sets the mood and expectation for the kind of story you are going to experience.Sound 7: The sound design is surprisingly unremarkable beyond a few key scenes, as most of the scenes are not accompanied by music or audio of any kind. Now this does help with the tone of the series, but it does feel that many scenes could at least have been improved with some better sound design. The one exception to this is the heartfelt conclusion which is an excellent balance of melancholy and uplifting expressed through the casts' singing.Character 7: The characters are varied and generally fairly well developed, with some being more so than others, and while I have no real complaints, I do feel that the series would have been improved with a longer run time that way it could explore some of the characters more in depth. Regardless they are still interesting to see, especially when they are on mission, the way they deal with the trauma of every day life is well written and truly packed with emotional power.Enjoyment 9: Now with all these criticisms I do have one important thing to say, I loved this show. It is emotional, somber, and truly makes you empathize with the cast on many different levels, which is something that I find very few anime are able to do in the same way. The action is still solid, and did I mention how great that ending was, because it is absolutely excellent.Over all 8: In the end, this series is not for everyone, as it features realistic depictions of trauma and does not pull away from the more series and traumatic elements of its concept. It is however, a story that I suggest to those who enjoy thoughtful discussions on existential philosophy and dont mind a good cry. Now if only the sequel were as good...oh well. having the semi-episodic form that holds an over arching narrative, which is great in some cases, but for a 13 episode narrative... it doesnt hold up as well.

I could have definitely seen this series elongated from 12 to a full 24-26 episodes by adding a modicum of plot and a lot more character exploration.To briefly discuss the plot, there are a number of girls ranging from 11 to young teens that were in various tragic situations where they wouldn't have much...longer to live. A secret faction of the government would secure these girls and replace much of them with cybernetic parts to maintain their life and give them a high combat potential, brainwash them to forget their previous lives and assign a &quot;handler&quot; to them. This handler was always an older man that would command the girl and would consequently also end up in a sort of father-daughter relationship with the girl. Seeing these relationships play out was possibly the most interesting part of the series.All and all, I'd say this was a real masterpiece, there is very little that I could fault Gunslinger Girl with, and there was so much that it did right. The animation, character expressions, setting and overall feel were spot-on. I'd highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys melodramatic anime. longer to live.

The past version of me was right to drop this, because overall this show felt like a waste of time and potential.Gunslinger Girl follows the lives of 5 cyborg girls (and their much older male handlers) who are brainwashed to work as assassins for an Italian secret society. On the surface level, this premise sounds like a good ""turn your brain off"" type show, however Gunslinger Girl opts to be more...intellectual and slow paced, which is executed rather poorly. This show attempts to be an Evangelion-esque character study of child soldiers and the affects of poor parenting (daddy issues) but it falls incredibly flat on it\'s face, it\'s Achilles heel being that the characters are all bland and unlikable. Excluding the final scene of this show, there is hardly any emotional levity or depth to any of the scenes. Many times while watching this I asked myself why I should care about any of these characters at all, they all sort to blend together aside from the twin tailed Triela, who manages to be somewhat tolerable at times. All the handlers manage to be extremely unlikable and abusive, aside from Henrietta\'s handler Jose. I am aware that\'s the focal point of a lot of the drama in this series, but it\'s really hard to get invested in or remember any of these characters when each of them are interchangeable. It feels like we as the audience are supposed to empathize with Jose the most throughout this show but he\'s just a bland guy who is mildly humanistic, there isn\'t much depth to his character at all.The story structure of this series is rather questionable as well, the second episode is nearly a recap of the first episode, which I have never seen an anime do before. It might be attempting to show a perception shift from Jose to Henrietta, but if it is it\'s poorly executed since it reuses nearly half the scenes from the first episode. What were they thinking?Most episodes in this series are just ""side missions"" (to put it in video game terms) that feel aimless until the last half of the series, which sets up a mystery surrounding one of the girls being murdered, which could have been interesting but instead we are treated to 1 episode to uninteresting set up and  2 episodes of meandering until the mystery is just solved with a melodramatic leap in logic by the main girl. Don\'t get me wrong, I like a good ""slow burn show"" but most of those shows work because of well earned dramatic moments punctuating long stretches of careful character development (think Better Call Saul). Every episode of this show however feels aimless and is punctuated with unearned pathos.Outside of story content, if you are just watching this show for the action scenes, don\'t bother, they suck and are rather infrequent. The animation and art style are very dated, this show goes for a more realistic look but ultimately it makes the show look ugly and bland.  It really confuses me how this anime could get an average score of 7.40, this show lacks any substance or depth, I don\'t know why western otaku of the 2000\'s thought this show was compelling.

This series focuses mainly on ""Girl"" rather than ""Gunslinger"".This short series is all about its characters. It revolves (no pun intended) around members of specialized division experimenting with cybernetic enhancements for military purposes. But these cyborgs are young girls and that means a lot of emotions. Every girl has a handler and every handler-cyborg relationship is unique. Plot takes place in Italy.There is not really much of a story, everything is about the characters, their emotions and ways they are dealing with their problems. If you are intrigued by the title, know...that action just happens to be there. It serves mainly as a reason for girls and other members of division to react and think about the way their life is.In the end I think Gunslinger Girl is typical quiet, philosophical and melancholic anime series with a hint of action and classical music. that action just happens to be there.

Well, I often have, alone in my bed, but not exactly in the same way Gunslinger Girl establishes its story and characters.This anime is one of the most grim and unapologetic I’ve ever seen. From the very beginning, we’re introduced to this concept of little brainwashed girls used as specialized weapons to take out important targets. You’d think that a show like this would be just your typical paper-thin “badass kid kills bad guys” type of deal, but it...touches on somber themes that I never expected to see, such as turbulent friendship, innocence of youth, and parental love. The drama isn’t in the action or the gangster wars, it’s in the way our protagonists develop as characters in what seems like an inhumane world. The little sparks of joy and light are that much more poignant when the surrounding emotions are depressing and dour.There is a big complaint I have with the world-building, though. Sometimes there are moments that take me out of the show, like little details that don’t seem to fit in Gunslinger Girl’s representation of life. For example, when one of the older girls goes on a mission while on her period, they mention that she chose to keep that part of her body intact, despite it obviously hindering her effectiveness. Why would the organization give the girls a choice about their reproductive system when there’s obviously an ulterior motive behind recruiting anonymous little girls and training them to be obedient? Maybe it’s to give the girls a false sense of humanity, or maybe it’s just to determine which girls will be the best slaves in the future. They have this opportunity, supported by the government, to be extremely intimate with these little girls, and I’m supposed to believe that they’d let it pass by giving them a choice about their perfectly constructed bodies? It might sound like a nitpick, but that’s just one example of when I had to sit back and question what the show is really about. It’s obvious that they had a specific audience in mind with this premise, which I personally appreciate, but they need to at least keep it consistent.8/10 for being both heart-breaking and heartwarming at the same time, but overall 7/10 for blue-balling me to no end. touches on somber themes that I never expected to see, such as turbulent friendship, innocence of youth, and parental love.

Episodic writing could be problematic, for there is a tendency for the viewers to be disengaged by the lack of an overall plot. Each episode may seem like a fresh start -- for the worse. Luckily, this problem is not seen in Gunslinger Girl.What makes episodic writing effective for this anime is how it has been exploited to show the development of the characters. The story of each gunslinger girl...is focused at least one episode, and this is thanks to the episodic approach. Each of them is drawn to an intricate plot about governments and secret organizations. However, this does not make the show plot-oriented. In fact, it is the opposite. The show is very character-driven. The featured gunslinger girl is still the focal point of the story. Her actions and decisions, and not the seemingly intricate plot, are what drive the story forward.Speaking of the characters, I find them to be very well-made. Each gunslinger girl has something going on inside her head, and this is expanded during the episode where she is featured. Another thing that makes the characterization amazing is how the characters interact with each other. Each gunslinger girl is supervised by a handler. And it is very interesting how the girls have different relationships with their handlers. There is the master-servant relationship, the sister-brother relationship, the disappointed-teacher-struggling-student relationship, and many others. This just adds to how the story is very character-driven and emotional.The praising doesn’t stop there. The screenplay is also something worth noting. The dialogue is well thought-out, and, often times, there is subtlety between the lines that could even rival that of Seinen titles. Certain plot elements also appear symbolic, either to depict a truth or an irony -- or both.Clearly, Gunslinger Girl is an anime of above average quality. I must admit that I thought it is going to be an action-packed title because it involves governments and secret organizations. But it’s good to know that I’m wrong. This is not your typical show that flashes the viewers with mindless action sequences just to appear interesting. This is the kind of show that will capture the viewers’ attention through its characters and how they move in the dangerous world they live in. Add the fact that the stories are freshly set in different landmarks in Italy, and are embedded with musical soundtracks that fit the setting perfectly, and the show becomes even more compelling. is focused at least one episode, and this is thanks to the episodic approach.

And as that is one of my favorites I had to check it out..Story-8  Eh...I would not say this particular anime has one specifically drawn out plot...more like separate stories revolving around the girls in the story.  This site has all but one of the girls as ""main"" but I believe Henrietta to be the official main, as she and her fratello have the most interesting and unique episodes.Art-9...The art in this show is not 100%, but it is very polished and not crude or glitchy. I was not thrown off by any colors and this helped to keep me drawn in.Sound-10   Amazing soundtrack, not my favorite but definitely in my top 10. The soundtrack helps to remind you of what this anime is actually based around and how it is not a daycare but a government organization.Character-10   In my opinion, the development is what drives this entire show forward. I could relate (figuratively) to almost every one of these girls. The fact that their emotions still push out even though what they have been through is very cruel and unusual.Enjoyment/Overall-(9)  My enjoyment as well as my final verdict stand as one.  Although this has not made it into my top 10, it was close and that is saying something.  I wouldn\'t compare it to Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom in any way however, as that holds a plot and this one does not. But do not let that scare you away, as it is very good to say the least.

If I could leave it at that I would.Gunslinger Girl is one of those titles that you expect to be tongue in cheek humor, balls to the wall action and Michael Bay explosions with a lead heroine that looks like Pamela Anderson.  It's actually more subdued in context and dead serious in tone.  Instead of Pam and the girls, you have a group of school girls who would otherwise be dead if the state (in this case Italy) didn't adopt them and subject them to a touch of cyber...experimentation.

Not really in the quality of the series overall but what the series actually is. Granted though i got used to pretty fast. An anime about Cyborg assassin girls you'd think this story would be more action focused but thats not the case. In fact the assassination isn't really the main part of the story at all.  Each Girl has a Male Adult Handler, and for those cyborg girls there entire life revolves around those handlers. For some its family love, For some its a master/slave relationship and for...other one sided love.  The series isn't really about action but more of a SOL type series of the relationship between the Cyborgs and there handlers. Which i think this series did relatively well.  However the pacing was somewhat slow throught the series. Turns out they adapted 2 volumes in 13 episodes which is rare i guess. Overall though i did enjoy the series it just felt kinda lackluster however the last 4 episodes were quite entertaining. I think this is a good series if your looking for a series where it revolves around 2 characters because i think the depiction on how each of these characters feel i felt were quite well done. It doesn't change the fact that i felt somewhat sleepy throughout the season. Nontheless i think the  anime was fun and entertaining and brings up quite the interesting points the series.Overall 6/10. A fun good time if you don't mind the slow pacing.

It is mainly a character-driven series exploring the pasts of some of the cyborg girls before becoming part of the Social Welfare Agency (SWA) and the different fratello relationship dynamics. Being more a character-focused series, the series does a great job dabbling into the different relationship dynamics with the fratello being either professional or family-like and how each cyborg regards their experiences working with the SWA. The series is well aware of the morally questionable treatment that the girls have received due to being made into...cyborg assassins. But when you also factor in the pasts of the girls before becoming part of the organization, it does offer some interesting insight on whether or not the audience would think the lives of the girls may be better off under their current profession instead of being left to suffer physically and mentally from their tragic pasts.Because the anime only adapts the first two volumes of the manga, this does lead the anime to create a good deal of anime-exclusive material to either expand on stories from the manga or create its own story developments to help pad out its 13-episode length. In cases of story expansion, the additions work to add some more dimension to the fratello relationship dynamics that the manga doesn’t get into. For example, the anime’s first two episodes are each shown from the perspectives of the fratello pairing of Henrietta and Jose, in how each regard their partnership and the handling of busting a local terrorist cell. But in regards to adding anime-exclusive plotting as seen in the show’s final two episodes, it adds nothing new to the story, creates unnecessary drama, and makes the fate of one cyborg go in a direction that it didn’t actually go in the manga at that point. For the last point in question, the anime’s sequel, Il Teatrino, disregards the development in question to stay faithful to the manga source material.A few other issues arise due to elements of the anime’s storytelling. One episode drops possible hints of the cyborg, Triela’s, origins that the series doesn’t thoroughly explore until Il Teatrino later comes out, though this would be a minor complaint. A major complaint that would vary depending on a viewer’s tastes would be the lack of an ongoing plot. Due to the anime being more character-focused, there isn’t actually an ongoing plot for the series to properly follow and it can seem like the series would be going nowhere for those that care more for plotting with anime they follow.For visuals, Madhouse’s animated talents go very well in depicting Gunslinger Girl’s animation throughout its run. The series has detailed scenery, character, and firearm designs shown throughout its run, with setting designs being very faithful to the European locales that characters visit and firearm designs being very faithful to the real life guns used by characters for those who are gun enthusiasts. The series also comes with great action choreography depicted through careful camera editing and shot use to convincingly create the illusion of fluid animation, one notable highlight being the first action scene in the series when Henrietta is dispatching a terrorist cell.Music for the series is depicted with classical musical pieces that fit in well with the show’s Italian setting and help enhance the drama of a number of key scenes throughout the anime’s run. The show’s OP and ED musical choices are hauntingly beautiful and do very well at complementing the mood seen throughout the series.Overall, Gunslinger Girl works great as a character-driven series exploring the relationship dynamics of each of the fratellos and exploring how each cyborg regards their work with the SWA. The series may not be everyone’s cup of tea due to its lack of an ongoing plot and there are some story elements to it that don’t work well in the show’s ongoing developments due to anime-exclusive content that doesn’t always mesh well with the title’s intended focus.

Isekai Quartet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38472/Isekai_Quartet,"[""First of all, let me state the obvious: this is not an independent anime, this is a crossover project with 4 different sources. So, to fully enjoy this title, you should watch at least some (preferably all) of the sources. And when it's done - you will appreciate this title fully, cause all the characters included behave exactly the way they did in original. Or, if you don't - you will miss 90% of humor, cause it is based on originals. Art style may put some people off, but it is the same exact style that was used in short comedy spinoffs, so no problems...here either. There is nothing much to add here, to be honest, cause episodes are short, plot is used only to make some jokes possible, but so far I am enjoying this show a lot, if you are into any of source projects - check this one out. here either.

At first, I thought the announcement of the anime was a joke until I saw the actual trailers and promotional images. Taking a look back, I also remember when Overlord and Youjo Senki had their own version of chibi shorts featuring goofball characters doing what goofballs what do. Maybe they were experiments to prepare for this anime. Who knows?Without a shadow of a doubt, Isekai Quartet is based on characters from isekai shows. The character roster consists of the cast from KonoSuba, Overlord, Youjo Senki, and...Re:Zero. Collectively, they are united as a quartet of characters in a school life setting where all sorts of shenanigans blooms. As someone who is familiar with all of those established franchises, I do recommend watching them before stepping foot into this. Character personalities carries over and in general, I do believe you can get a better experience if you knew who the characters are. But for popcorn entertainment sakes, you can also just dive right into this little gem.Even as a crossover, Isekai Quartet stands out as a show of its own. The episodes contains skit stories that are half length. Its main purpose is to humor with the immense amount of comedy that aims to draw our attention. If someone told me this whole idea sounded absurd, I might have agreed at first. That is, I tasted what Isekai Quartet really is and it’s pretty damn delicious. That’s thanks to the drama within that showcases this like a Saturday morning cartoon. To start off, we have several foil characters which translates into some rather noticeable character drama segments. There’s Tanya and Ainz who were once a salaryman in the real world. These two are portrayed as powerful entities that others seems to fear in from their perspective shows. In Isekai Quartet, there’s a rivalry that develops between the two based on some rather absurd reasons. KonoSuba’s Kazuma and Re:Zero’s Subaru came from fantasy worlds as the two manages to establish themselves in their own ways. However, it is easily noticeable how different both characters are. Kazuma is portrayed more as a butt monkey while Subaru evolved as a dark fantasy hero. When you put all four of these protagonists together in the same show, hell breaks loose. I’m talking about the over the top comedy type of hell of course.With the school setting, the creators aimed to bring as many as possible segments as possible. From school rules to a class talent show, there’s many opportunities for comedy. (yes, there is the infamous “beach episode” too before you ask) Anyone who is familiar with these franchises will also quickly recognize how much their personalities carry over. Make no mistake, every character remains who they are from their respective shows. This includes Overlord’s core characters such as Albedo, Shalltear, and Demiurge. KonoSuba has its own class clowns like Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness. Re:Zero’s Emilia, Rem, Ram, and Beatrice are no strangers when they sit in class. And who can forget Youjo Senki’s adorable Visha? Bringing this legion of isekai characters also means a clash of personalities. Just like at school, there are class leaders and rules. The show establishes the rules early on and as each episode progresses, it becomes more and more evident how some characters can’t follow them. The class talent shows also displays a clash of egos. At the end of the day, the audience is the real winner as the anime accomplishes its job of glorfying popcorn entertainment. In a sense, this is a deconstruction of isekai. Character behaviors are observed in the some of the most outrageous ways possible. KonoSuba’s cast is the guiltiest of this with Kazuma’s antics, Megumin’s explosive personality, and Darkness’ perverted fantasies. However, others such as Albedo, Shaltear, and Beatrice also act on actions that speaks louder than words. My only slight disappointment is how much Tanya has to carry her own franchise in this crossover. Honestly, she is probably the most credible member from Youjo Senki. Even someone like Visha feels like she’s the invisible kid in class if you don’t pay too much attention. Similarly, most of the supporting characters from these perspective franchises is overshadowed by the main cast.Isekai Quartet ended up being an anime that I didn’t know I wanted. When it got first announced, I thought this would’ve ended up being a big fat joke to further alienate the isekai fan base. It seemed like a big risk considering how much controversy their franchises became for certain audiences. But after watching this show to finish, I’ve seen the light. Be prepared to be enlightened.

Be prepared to be enlightened.', ""Isekai Quartet represents the most wholesome and pure type of fan service one can write. In other words a spinoff truly made for the fans of not just one franchise but four of them, more specifically KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Youjo Senki and Overlord; kind of like a 2019 equivalent of what Carnival Phantasm was for the Nasuverse back in 2011. It should go without saying that you should have seen at least some and preferably all of these series before watching Isekai Quartet or you will not be able to appreciate this anime for what it is.This chibi crossover spinoff basically takes all the main characters...from these various franchises and sends them to another world... again... where they meet each other in a seemingly ordinary human school and are forced to become students. Of course what the anime is actually about is simply putting all these loveable characters together just to see what the hell happens, and that is really the charm point of it all. Just seeing the crossover interactions play out is something any fan of these series should have a great deal of fun watching. After all, character relations such as Tanya's hatred for deities like Aqua and in turn Aqua's animosity towards the undead such as Ainz is unavoidably going to lead to a great deal of interesting confrontation.It's a simple show by design but it definitely works. The only real problem with it is that there are so many characters involved and potential interactions that would have been fun to explore, but with only 9-minute episodes (excluding OP and ED duration) we only ever get a quite limited amount of exposure to a large portion of Isekai Quartet's character cast. There are so many things I would have liked to see the show touch upon that never ended up happening simply because it ran out of time. But nevertheless it is still a great spinoff which I would highly recommend any fans of the related series to watch. It may be short but it's exceptionally sweet. from these various franchises and sends them to another world... again... where they meet each other in a seemingly ordinary human school and are forced to become students.

There are so many things I would have liked to see the show touch upon that never ended up happening simply because it ran out of time. But nevertheless it is still a great spinoff which I would highly recommend any fans of the related series to watch. It may be short but it's exceptionally sweet."", ""This is a crossover combination of 4 anime (Overlord, Konosuba, Re:Zero & Youjo Senki), and if you've seen and/or love those anime, you will love this crossover!

I enjoy watching Isekai Quartet immensely.Overall: 9I never expected a crossover like this would ever be made, but I'm so glad it was!

With that said, however, Isekai Quartet is bottom of the barrel entertainment.  Perpetuating the stereotype of puerile-based Japanese comedy.As a word of caution, Isekai Quartet is a perplexing show.  I understand it’s a comedy/parody of the Isekai genre, but the abysmal execution leaves me questioning the effort of the so-called...‘writers.’  Let’s be honest: this show emulates the writing complexity of Donald Trump’s various tweets.  The jokes, if we graciously endow them as such (which we won’t), are reminiscent of those dreadful joke books that your grandfather would read to you as a child to ‘validate’ his ‘hipness.’  Dry, boring, derivative humor.Not even one episode managed to tickle my ‘funny bone.’  The talent show was talentless.  The beach planning episode was coarse — also, it was a real beaaa-itch!  And field day was fieldiculous.Ordinarily, chibi-esque animation (exaggerated versions that exemplify the characters ‘cuteness’) are reserved for intermittent moments of slapstick comedy to juxtapose an otherwise solemn situation.  But when the kawaii aesthetic is the predominant art style, it becomes a sensory overload of ‘cuteness’ that diminishes the prospect of laughter.  Furthermore, the plot convenience of a magical button whisking everyone away is just a lazy excuse to gather the audience’s ‘favorite’ characters in one location.As a word of caution, crossover shows purely exist for super-fans to lose their shit as their favorite characters interact with one another.  The writers often rely on this dynamic to carry the show forward, without offering any substantive character or plot progressions to occur.  And when twelve, ten minute episodes orient around this concept, it becomes excruciating to watch.

The outlandish short comedy that is this show.The biggest crossover not just in anime history, but one that can be said to level off with Avengers: Infinity War (no pun intended): Isekai Quartet, the short crossover that we knew we wanted for a long time, and thanks to the people over at Kadokawa green-lighting this high-profile series, we finally can rest at ease.For the Average Joe, Isekai Quartet combines the Isekai universe\'s 4 most beloved series: Re:Zero, Youjo Senki (Saga of Tanya the Evil), KonoSuba and Overlord. And combine them Kadokawa did, for a collaboration that\'s unthinkable at this high scale, difficult...(or even manageable) to pull off, but what came out of it was a short so highly revered, and in time present and future.With that said, if you haven\'t watched any of the 4 anime series, the references that the cast of characters in the series make will be questionable.So, for the setting of the show, I find it iffy that the overall setting would be in a school, but it works. The part that gets us totally is the pressing of the Isekai ""RED"" button, which summons most (if not all) of the characters in the 4 series into an alternate timeline, one devoid of the bells and whistles of the respective shows they came from. So, with that said, with Roswaal as homeroom teacher, let the misunderstandings, running jokes and gags ensue as the characters attempt to reason with one another about trivial issues. Even better, being a short 12-min series helps us digest the setting, and gets us adapted into the occurring scenarios filled with wholesome goodness.Being a studio that primarily works on Chibi-esque features of series that sorta needed a wide presence, it\'s no surprise that Studio PuYUKAI is given the responsibility to anchor this series, and anchor they did with the simple cartoonish aesthetics. And I have to say that for a high-profile series, it certainly garnered a lot of attention that creates affection and tension for the cast of characters and their countless interactions in the alternate world.And the music. I consider it to be the Holy Grail of the series. Even more unimaginable is the collab for the leads and supports from all 4 series. So the OP features a cool and wacky song by the ""protagonists"" Subaru, Tanya, Ainz Goal Oown and Kazuma, while the 8-bit designed electronic-sounding great ED is done by Emilia, Tanya, Albedo and Aqua. Both songs are equally fantastic that holds equal weight on their own. Add in the background, and this series is musically custom-composed plentifully.Overall, what a great and fantastic showing, and a short to boot! And we have the people over at Kadokawa to thank for, because we may never be sure what triggered this movement of sorts, but at the end of the day, it\'s the company listening to the fans, that matters. So appreciate Kadokawa for this venture project. And this is officially SOTS in a lackluster season.Now all that awaits is a (confirmed) Season 2 showing.

Yet even so, there are a select few Isekai that are generally well received by the anime community for adding unique twists to the genre or by just being entertaining to watch. Four such Isekai anime have been brought together and chibified in order to create the awesomeness that is Isekai Quartet. And so far, it has been a pleasantly enjoyable watch.Obviously, this is just a lighthearted comedy/parody...series, and is not meant to be taken seriously. It’s simply a fun show to watch if you have some free time. The only preparation that I would recommend before going into this would be viewing the four source anime, since some of the jokes and scenarios will go over your head if you don’t understand the context. This is a mostly character driven series, and so far all of the characters featured have been up to their old antics again with the addition of humorous interactions with the casts of the other Isekai anime. Seeing the main Konosuba cast acting like idiots again, best girl Rem being adorable, Tanya and Ainz going head to head, all of it is just, well, fun!Whether or not you liked the characters from the four Isekai will most likely make or break how much you enjoy this show. For me, I like practically all of these characters, and seeing them all together in a lighthearted school setting has been quite satisfying. series, and is not meant to be taken seriously.

In other words, they did a great job at making each viewer of the show content with what they got. It doesn\'t matter if all you like is Overlord because you\'ll still love this show...with it\'s many situations that the overlord characters find themselves in. I think this currently is one of the strong suits of this show.What\'s also important to mention is as things are panning out at the moment, each character is as their true self, they haven\'t needed to change the characters motives, speech nor other way that distinguishes them making it really feel like they\'ve created an anime that has some of the most known ""Isekai"" characters into one show without a compromise, except for of course the animation and design.It\'s very apparent they have changed the way they animated the show just by seeing a couple pictures but what\'s important to understand is why they did this. Looking at this show from a animators perspective it\'s quite obvious fully animating characters which are differently animated in each show, with different colors and shading, and even more importantly created by way different Anime studios, it would basically be impossible to really put all the characters into one anime without destroying the whole aesthetic of the anime to begin with, and to be quite honest, with the great dialogue in this show and action I\'m pretty sure this really isn\'t needed!☄️Story: 8/10:Though I of course haven\'t seen everything this show has to offer I think I have seen enough to be able to rate it somewhat with what we currently have.This show feels structured to say the least.. though things happen very quickly in the show things aren\'t too hard to understand. One difficulty that first seemed could become a problem, is that when you\'re basically mushing together 4 different animes into one, many people won\'t understand the references from the shows... Even this, they have been able to make it easy to follow for someone who is only a real fan one of these shows. This is a great +, and therefore will currently give this show a 8/10☄️Art: 7/10Though it\'s quite apparent that most of the shows focus was not on the actual art of the show, I think it compliments the show very well. It works well together to create a show where the characters kind of feel like they belong, even with their original different art style and so on.In fact I still really like the art style, it puts characters like the mains from Overlord and Youjo Senki (both quite a bit darker types of shows) into a very different type of ""colorful aesthetic look"".☄️Sound: 7/10I don\'t think there\'s much to say here, nothing special, voice acting like in all of these shows is great.☄️Character: 9/10This is basically the main part of the shows, the characters.

Re; zero was a fun watch. Overlord has a neat concept. Tanya is tanya (sorry haven't watched but neither has anyone else). Was getting pretty hyped after hearing this was announced, but man I should've known it would be bland. It starts off with the characters transporting themselves to a new world (iskekai of isekai's, revolutionary). konosuba crew screws around like usual, with copy-paste dialogue from previous seasons, but at least its funny and adds a bit to the ordeal. And this is the set up so I can expect more later on right? (little do I know this is the only...good scene). Then tanya does some stuff and Ainz sits his fat ass on a button in the middle of a long boring meeting, which summarizes the entirety of overlord anyway. They all show up at school and are confused. Wow! where are we? what should we do? who are these people? then re:zero crew show up for fuck all reason. And that's the episode. WHERE IS THE FUN?! Who wrote this?At this point, I assumed it was just a cash cow. Looks like shit, sounds terrible, boring setting and bland dialogue. But after checking the Reddit, people seemed happy and talked about how soon the characters would interact, and the 1st episode is just the intro (if that's the case it should have been episode 0). So I go into episode two, and nothing happened. And 3,4,5,6. It's pitiful that such great stories were squandered in such a cool event like a crossover. I did go in somewhat expecting too much, but I would've honestly taken anything if there was some spark or charm. And I know that it isn't weird for me to wish for something ACTUALLY interesting to happen. Something that builds on the concept to make there be a point of combining these shows.But honestly after so much sitting around has transpired, I highly doubt anything interesting will take place for the remainder of the season.Ainz hasn't done anything to make us think he is sentient/has his personality from overlord. He just sits there. They all sit around in the desks, even though they are all ultra powerful badasses, held back by no restraints except the scriptwriters lacking brain cells. Why haven't the undead tried to take over any territory? why hasn't aqua killed Ainz? why doesn't Kazuma go home? why didn't Subaru's witches call take effect/ why doesn't he do ANYTHING (he sits in place and makes no comments). What's Subaru doing being so nonchalant in the given situation. Why is Everyone just sitting around and staying in class? What do they even do in class? Where did they go home at night? how did buttons appear? These are all questions I have that will most likely never be answered because I don't trust the scriptwriter to have an understanding of the implications of the scenario.3/10go watch a couple episodes of konosuba and skip this entirely. good scene).

But even by those low expectations Isekai Quartet is sorely lacking in just about every area.Despite having a cast of eccentric characters, Isekai Quartet spends much of it\'s time attempting to avoid having them interact. Frequently characters will stick next to characters from their own show, which makes sense from a real social dynamic perspective, but is an awful idea when your key selling point is having these characters meet each other. As a result, Isekai Quartet is dreadfully unfunny....Large portions of the already short running time are dedicated to characters ""enjoying"" a mundane high school scenario.How a show involving Tanya, Kazuma and his band of goons, and the rest from Overlord and Re:zero manages to be dull is a complete mystery to me. Instead of magic battles and other weirdness, you have episodes dedicated to... Rem and Subaru walking to school. These characters all have strong personalities that, if in the hands of a good writer, could be an entertaining combination. But the show kneecaps itself right from the start by insisting that they follow a set of rules that seem designed to ensure that as little fun happens as possible.Despite having a 9 minute runtime, the pace is glacial. Slowburn anime would be green with envy at just how little happens in each one of these nuggets of torture. When the show finally attempts to throw a joke your way (usually via the Konosuba crew) you can\'t help but get the feeling of having been there done that. And when the Konosuba gang aren\'t present, it feels like the show is winding up to a punchline that never comes (usually because the episode ends before it gets to the point.) Unless making you watch a bad show is the punchline.Art? What art? I mean I wasn\'t expecting any sakuga, but the limitations of using this art style become clear very quickly.I can\'t even reccomend this to people who like all four shows involved.

For the anime community were greeted to the ultimate Isekai crossover. A crossover that seemed too true to believe. A crossover of Konosuba, Re:Zero, Overlord and Saga of Tanya the Evil into one show. As a fan of all four of these shows, this felt like a wet dream. And as such, became a highly anticipated show for me. Did I enjoy it though? Well lets talk about it shall we?Sit back relax and get ready to snap those fingers as I present to you the anime review for Isekai Quartet. Lets begin.Story: 6/10...The story begins with our characters all encountering a red button in their respected worlds and through either unluckiness, desperation or sheer stupidity, they press it (Except we don’t see the Re:Zero characters press it for some reason). Suddenly, they get transported to a school and have to start experiencing school life. The characters in question are our lucky idiots of Kazuma, Aqua, Megumim and Darkness. Subaru and his merry band of harem girls. The Devil of the Rhine, Tanya Degurechaff and her lieutenants. And THE GREAT SORCERER KING HIMSELF, AINS OOAL GOWN!!! As well as the floor guardians of Nazerick.It’s as basic as plot as you can get. Our Isekai characters who get Isekaied into their own worlds suddenly get Isekaied into another Isekai and now have to experience school life in this Isekai world. What this show likes to focus on however, is the moment to moment scenes in which we see our characters interact with one another to help insinuate some humour. And when I say some, I mean a lot. This show doesn’t waste time in trying to introduce these characters again (well apart from the class introduction), you know who they are, you know what they are like so here they are reacting to a new setting.  So the jokes and comedic elements all relate to the characters’ respective shows; with some in jokes from the moment to moment scenes, as well as some subtle and not so subtle 4th wall breaking. Now the humour really relies on your past experience with these shows. In context, they work well at delivering the humour, (Darkness will always be funny, no matter what). But if you have not seen every series in this show, some of the jokes will go right over your head; which will probably affect your enjoyment of this show.Now one of the things I was concerned about is how will this show balance this large cast of characters from different shows and how they will balance their screen time? Well the show was struggling a bit at the start when it came to balancing out which characters got screen time. Re:Zero especially felt like it got the short end of the stick for the longest time. In order to highlight who is in its show, they have to have an episode dedicated to them, but Re:Zero’s spotlight should have been in the first half and not the second half. Otherwise, they feel like low end secondary characters. Of course, the latter half of the show came and it balanced out, as all things should be.Characters: 10/10Well I think that it is fair to say that the characters in this show are well translated from their respective shows. Their personalities still remain intact (for better or worse; depends on your opinion) but with an extra bit of comedic flair to it to add to the comedy. The interesting question though was how these characters were going to interact with each other. With such a large cast from different shows, the chemistry that could develop could be rather interesting. We kind of knew that Ains and Tanya would get along well and Aqua would try anything to kill Ains and co. But there were some interactions that I never knew would happen. Who knew that Albedo and Rem would get along with each other so well due to their understanding their love for Ains and Subaru respectively. It’s these kind of character interactions I want to see, even the small ones that last a few seconds. If you can create chemistry with these characters, then you can make for some interesting circumstances whether now or later on in the show.Animation: 7/10For this kind of show, the chibi art style is appropriate. Considering that Konosuba, Re:Zero, Overlord and Saga of Tanya the Evil had different art styles and were all made by different studios (Studio Deen, White Fox, Madhouse and Studio NUT respectively). Having a single art style makes it easier to animate and we don’t have a clash of art styles. The chibi artstyle though looks good and the characters are still expressive. Again, it is appropriate for a show that is meant to a laid back, comedic show and not to be taken seriously. So the animation does its job and does it to a good degree. When you compare the animation to the chibi spinoffs of each show, Isekai Quartet animates better than them. So it is nice to see them put some more effort into this.Sound: 6/10The soundtrack is rather basic to say the least. It has nothing of note and is merely used as background music to help the scene and set a mood. But the show also uses the more popular tracks from the respective shows to know who has got screen time here and who is taking centre stage at the moment. All I can say though is that it is used correctly at the right time.The opening though was enjoyable. Simply titled “Isekai Quartet” and is sung by the main protagonists of each show, Kazuma, Subaru, Ains and Tanya. It is a nice way of introducing who is going to be in this show and backed up by a catchy song that you could sing along to. It helps get you into the mood of what kind of show this is going to be and has a nice pace to it to make it an enjoyable opening. Although side note, I am disappointed that MYTH&ROID didn’t do the opening since they have done the openings for all of these shows except Konosuba.The ending sequence was also enjoyable. ""Isekai Girls♡Talk” is the name of the song and is sung by the main female leads of each show, Aqua, Emilia, Albedo and Tanya. I like the use of the 8-bit art style for the characters and again, the song is catchy and matches the tone of the show. It helps keep up a light mood with its charm and, as such, was one of the more enjoyable ending sequences this season.ConclusionI didn’t come and expect Isekai Quartet to be the second coming of anime or anything like that. I came because I wanted to see four Isekai shows I like come together in a big a ball of fan-service. And I got that. I enjoyed what I saw from this show and got some very interesting character interactions from it. This is what I wanted and expected to see and I got it. For for fans of these shows, you are going to enjoy what you see and how these characters adjust to school life. But I think it is required that you watch all four of these shows to get the full experience and to get some of the humour. Otherwise you are missing out.  So that could affect a person’s decision to watch it. But, like me, you have watched these four shows, then you are going to enjoy yourself.My Personal Enjoyment: 9/10Overall score: 7.6/10 Recommendation: Watch it (If you have watched the four shows beforehand) The story begins with our characters all encountering a red button in their respected worlds and through either unluckiness, desperation or sheer stupidity, they press it (Except we don’t see the Re:Zero characters press it for some reason). Suddenly, they get transported to a school and have to start experiencing school life. The characters in question are our lucky idiots of Kazuma, Aqua, Megumim and Darkness. Subaru and his merry band of harem girls. The Devil of the Rhine, Tanya Degurechaff and her lieutenants. And THE GREAT SORCERER KING HIMSELF, AINS OOAL GOWN!!! As well as the floor guardians of Nazerick.It’s as basic as plot as you can get. Our Isekai characters who get Isekaied into their own worlds suddenly get Isekaied into another Isekai and now have to experience school life in this Isekai world. What this show likes to focus on however, is the moment to moment scenes in which we see our characters interact with one another to help insinuate some humour. And when I say some, I mean a lot. This show doesn’t waste time in trying to introduce these characters again (well apart from the class introduction), you know who they are, you know what they are like so here they are reacting to a new setting.  So the jokes and comedic elements all relate to the characters’ respective shows; with some in jokes from the moment to moment scenes, as well as some subtle and not so subtle 4th wall breaking. Now the humour really relies on your past experience with these shows. In context, they work well at delivering the humour, (Darkness will always be funny, no matter what). But if you have not seen every series in this show, some of the jokes will go right over your head; which will probably affect your enjoyment of this show.Now one of the things I was concerned about is how will this show balance this large cast of characters from different shows and how they will balance their screen time? Well the show was struggling a bit at the start when it came to balancing out which characters got screen time. Re:Zero especially felt like it got the short end of the stick for the longest time. In order to highlight who is in its show, they have to have an episode dedicated to them, but Re:Zero’s spotlight should have been in the first half and not the second half. Otherwise, they feel like low end secondary characters. Of course, the latter half of the show came and it balanced out, as all things should be.Characters: 10/10Well I think that it is fair to say that the characters in this show are well translated from their respective shows. Their personalities still remain intact (for better or worse; depends on your opinion) but with an extra bit of comedic flair to it to add to the comedy. The interesting question though was how these characters were going to interact with each other. With such a large cast from different shows, the chemistry that could develop could be rather interesting. We kind of knew that Ains and Tanya would get along well and Aqua would try anything to kill Ains and co. But there were some interactions that I never knew would happen. Who knew that Albedo and Rem would get along with each other so well due to their understanding their love for Ains and Subaru respectively.

Amidst this popularity, Isekai Quartet emerges, a hilarious parody that brings together four iconic isekai protagonists and their companions for a crossover adventure filled with witty humor, self-aware references, and a unique chibi art style.A Melting Pot of Isekai HeroesIsekai Quartet's premise is as simple as it is ingenious: Subaru Natsuki (Re:ZERO - Starting Life in Another World), Kazuma Satou (KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!), Tanya Degurechaff (The Saga of Tanya the Evil), and Ainz Ooal Gown (Overlord) are...mysteriously transported to a new world, forced to adapt to their new surroundings while navigating the quirky personalities and abilities of their fellow isekai heroes.Parody Done RightIsekai Quartet excels in its parody, seamlessly blending the distinct elements and characters from each of the source material into a cohesive and humorous experience. The anime's strength lies in its ability to poke fun at the isekai genre's tropes, exaggerated personalities, and ridiculous plot points, all while maintaining a level of respect for the original works.Self-Aware Humor and Unique QuirksThe anime's humor is sharp, witty, and often meta, frequently breaking the fourth wall to acknowledge its own parodic nature. The characters' interactions are a constant source of amusement, as their contrasting personalities and abilities clash in hilarious ways. Subaru's self-deprecating humor, Kazuma's bluntness, Tanya's ruthlessness, and Ainz's overconfidence provide a rich comedic tapestry.Familiarity with the OriginalsWhile Isekai Quartet can be enjoyed on its own, familiarity with the original anime series significantly enhances the viewing experience. The anime is packed with references, jokes, and callbacks that will only land if you've seen the source material. This familiarity allows the anime to go deeper into its parody, making the humor more nuanced and satisfying.The Originals Remain True to ThemselvesDespite the parodic nature of Isekai Quartet, the characters retain their core personalities and abilities from their original series. Subaru's emotional outbursts, Kazuma's perversions, Tanya's military efficiency, and Ainz's overwhelming power are all present, albeit presented in a comedic light. This balance ensures that the anime remains true to the spirit of the original works while simultaneously delivering its own brand of humor.Story: 6/10Visual: 6/10Detailed: 7/10Characters: 10/10Emotions: 7/10Smoothness: 5/10OP/ED: 4/10Audio: 5/10Originals: 9/10Intense: 5/10Uniqueness: 8/10Fun/Laughter: 8/10NSFW: 1/10Boring/Idling: 1/10Recommendation: A Must-Watch for Isekai FansIsekai Quartet is a must-watch for fans of isekai anime, offering a refreshing and hilarious take on the genre.

be easiest for me to put some kind of Avengers joke here for the intro, but I\'m pretty sure that\'s been done to death by this point, so I\'ll just go onto the meat of the review.Story:Alright, so let\'s give the main cast of Konosuba, Overlord, Youjo Senki, and Re:Zero a random button that just magically appears on their respective doorsteps in order to Isekai them again into a world where now they\'re forced to participate in high school activities and shenanigans.\xa0 What fantasy!\xa0 What merriment!\xa0 I bet the rights holders were high-fiving each other when they came up with this...idea.The story for Isekai Quartet can be roughly summed up by asking the question: ""How would these characters react to both the setting and the other characters if they were all put in the same place?""\xa0 Each episode heavily spotlights one or two major interactions amongst some or a few members of the four respective casts, cycling through almost every conceivable permutation possible in the high school setting featuring but not limited to activities such as: the Test of Courage, Sports festivals, School chores, Beach episode, and various Afterschool activities.As such, Isekai Quartet doesn\'t really present much of anything beyond the comedic factor that comes with smashing together so many casts together.\xa0 It\'s comedy for the sake of comedy and fanservice for the sake of giving fans of these respective shows (and the isekai genre) a bit more extra material to watch even though it doesn\'t really impact anything in the long run.\xa0 Honestly, referential material makes up the bulk of the show, so much so that I\'m pretty sure not knowing anything makes this show infinitely harder to watch.Characters:In shorts comedies like Isekai Quartet, the essence of these characters are simply boiled down to their base components/memes that most people remember them for.\xa0 Aqua\'s still useless, Shalltear and Albedo continuously poke each other for each other\'s shortcomings and how they\'ll never get Ainz, Ram still spits the word equivalent of fire over Subaru, and Tanya still has her...episodes.This unfortunate byproduct of the shorts medium makes it so that really, there\'s not much to be said about the characters on their own due to comedy for entertainment\'s sake.\xa0 The main draw of their existences now only comes from the speculation of: ""What would happen if Aqua met Albedo?"" and numerous other interactions as each episode features roughly two major interactions between a group of \'unlikely characters\' and see how they would react to each other.\xa0 While not inherently bad, it leaves a lot to be desired because their interactions feel very surface level without much going on aside from laughing at the primary shortcoming of a particular character or talking about seemingly mutual interests and then never interacting ever again.\xa0 The best of these interactions seems to exist only in occasional scenes where the main protagonists ask other protagonists questions and comparing their answers to their own realities, but even those threads don\'t really go anywhere past the one twelve minute block they\'re featured in.Aesthetics:Made by Studio Studio PuYUKAI, a studio whose entire repertoire is basically just these kinds of chibi minisodes, the appearance of Isekai Quartet is very cheap.\xa0 It\'s like they\'re in Flash Animation since the characters don\'t really animate all that much and feel very stiff when they move.\xa0 This is in part due to the style the show\'s presented in, as the chibi/rubber-stamp versions of these characters while crisp and clear, doesn\'t really make much of an effort to be beyond being \'casual\' and \'serviceable\' for the audience.There\'re a few occasional moments where the series makes an effort to be visually impressive, such as the one time they used Megumin\'s explosion and the time Tanya loses it, but aside from select points like that, the appearance of the show really isn\'t all that impressive.\xa0 Hell, characters mostly just slide around if they\'re getting from place to place since animating walking in this style is basically the same thing for the most part.As far as the OST goes...personally I\'m not a fan.\xa0 ""Isekai Quartet"" sung by the VAs of the four series protagonists is this super poppy and catchy song that, since the series is comedy-based, fits with the general tone of the show.\xa0 Similarly, the ED of ""Isekai Girls♡Talk"" has the main heroines (and Tanya...again) do the exact same thing, but changing up the formula by having a more electronic beat that isn\'t as joyful as its OP counterpart.While these songs are ultimately just pure fanservice, my issue arises how half of each \'song\' is just the characters making chide comments about themselves and their series, talking extremely fast while the track of the song is still playing in the background.\xa0 To me, this breaks up the flow of the song and it doesn\'t even really feel like a proper song because of it.Personal Enjoyment:I\'m positive this show just isn\'t for me, and I\'m confident I\'ve made that abundantly clear in the review thus far...\xa0 I\'m not big on the Isekai genre in the first place, and even less of a fan when the industry decides to spit out one of these \'shorts\' series for the sake of a quick cash grab by throwing in every joke, meme, and reference they can in order to suck in the fans of these series\' to be like ""Hey, we got something for this show you like, but not really"".Like really, did this need to be in a school setting?\xa0 Why a school setting?\xa0 Why does everything need to be in a school setting?\xa0 What benefit do we get from having them in a school setting?\xa0 It\'s such a boring and overdone idea for a series crossover that part of me genuinely is surprised how much positive attention this is getting despite how lazily made the show looks on top of how shallow they\'re presenting these characters.\xa0 The one thing I\'m most sad about however is how they never thought to put make Megumin and Emilia interact with each other once.\xa0 Japan freaking loves seiyuu jokes; I\'m surprised they didn\'t do one this time.If you\'re a fan of any of the featured series\', you will most likely find something interesting about Isekai Quartet to watch.\xa0 If not, then in my opinion, it\'s not worth the trouble.\xa0 The show is really just fanservice for the sake of fanservice, and since practically 90% of the show is dedicated to either making fun of the show\'s conglomerate of a cast or referencing any of the four plots, not watching at least one (or the only) season of each of these shows will reduce enjoyment by at least 25%. idea.The story for Isekai Quartet can be roughly summed

Jokes aside this anime is doing very good with its characters, which are from different anime, 4 different anime to be accurate.I really like how they manage characters from different anime and how this anime has integrated them, I liked that Aqua and Ainz have bit of rivalry because Ainz is pure evil and Aqua is a Goddess. I also liking how Tanya is believing that God who she hates passionately is one of  the classmates. How can I forget subaru, who thinks that he is back to his daily normal life (lets be honest...here anything is better for him than his Isekai world) .These chibe characters get some time to before you get used  to them but when you get used to them its really is a fun ride. Animation is smooth, which is always welcomed but production sure is high here, its odd because at glance this anime looks like second thought of some unknown studio but it delivers on the animation department quite well.It have some down sides, like most of the characters do not interact with other and are there for sake of being there, which is a downer but most of the time it does a decent job here. You should watch if you want to see different characters from different anime to interact.8/10 from me.

As the name suggests, it’s a crossover between 4 isekai animes, namely, Overlord, Youjo Senki, Re:Zero and KonoSuba.

If you are a fan of the isekai comedy genre then this anime is just right for you.It starts out as everyone getting transported to a separate world where they are forced to attend school. In this school setting, they take part in various typical anime high school...activities such as going to beach, sports festival, talent show, etc.The character interactions are just as you would expect and also hilarious to watch. The great lord Ainz actually takes damage from the attacks of the useless Aqua and Kazuma just casually punches the goddess; Darkness creates misunderstandings for Subaru and Tanya’s battalion due to her masochist nature; Tanya and Demiurge bond over their love for strict rules and countless more fun interactions.Overall it’s very fun to watch and make to watch all 4 original animes to enjoy it to the fullest. activities such as going to beach, sports festival, talent show, etc.The character interactions are just as you would expect and also hilarious to watch.

Also, Isekai Quartet is the most ambitious crossover event in history (and supposedly, it will become EVEN MORE ambitious in season 2).[My initial worries...]I was skeptical of this show at first. As a cynic, I saw many red flags:1. Half of the quartet had sequels confirmed, with the others likely to follow.2. The show was blatantly riding the coattails of the Isekai genre's popularity....3. The show adopted a digestible, marketable presentation style (including the OP and ED).Given those three flags (and my overall pessimistic outlook on modern anime), I *cautiously* rated this show 8/10...[...were blown away!]To my surprise, I was wrong.

Season 2 is going to be the cashgrab that I'd originally believed this show to be. <BAD END>Given the evidence so far, I'd like to think that Kodokawa is going to make a second season as good- if not better than season 1. We'll just have to wait and see. Despite my nature, I'm riding first class on the hype train.[Final statements]CHOO CHOO SEASON TWO COMING THROUGH!"", 'So anime finally did it huh?...it did an Avengers: Isekai Anime Short EditionIsekai Quartet is one of the FIRST animes to ever bring in four anime from different franchises, in this case, KonoSuba, Youjo Senki, Overlord and ReZero all together!, the closest thing near this feat was Carnival Phantasm with it\'s Type-Moon titles but nonetheless...Here\'s the thing, having these four anime franchises and how the character all mingling together is one thing, but even all four of the animes have ties to one another, giving us many allusions towards each of their anime franchises counterparts and even making jokes to go along with that!. To...say this anime short was LA favourite comedy of Spring 2019 is an understatement and heck the only anime franchise LA hasn\'t all of was Overlord (only finished it\'s first season by the time of writing this review) but LA STILL know it\'s jokes.The basic plot towards Isekai Quartet is that a mysterious switch appears in each of the isekai worlds, guess what happens later and all the main cast of their respective series lands in a..high school setting, for our protagonists they did a ReCreators while the rest of the cast have been isekai\'d in an anime short isekai collab!. But the school seems to have it\'s own secret dealings, much like the case as all the higher up characters of each series are the teachers and maintain ""order""...for some reason.Nonetheless the plot isn\'t where the main focus is at, of course not, it\'s the comedy and all the different franchise mingling with one another. LA said that all the characters have a connection with one another and this just isn\'t in personality, but in their respective parent stories as well. For instances, Subaru and Ainz are good friends with one another why?...well Subaru has faced death so many times and Ainz being an undead (but also embodiment of death in his homeworld) it\'s a given, but Ainz also wants a friend and Subaru is ok with that, the other would be Kazuma and Tanya, why do these two have a connection when one comes from a comedy while the other a violent military fantasy?, well Tanya is VIGILANT towards Kazuma as his ""type"" was the one who got Tanya\'s old self killed and well Kazuma is the butt monkey as per usual. Isekai Quartet just makes it al connect and again it\'s jokes especially works in a similar way.The animation done by Studio PuYUKAI has the entire four casts in chibi mode and in a pretty decent way, sure it\'s all chibi but even the animation can be detailed at times for effect. Studio PuYUKAI did a great job as result.The voice acting, well we have four voice casts together so that\'s an undertaking in itself but some notable examples would be the protagonists Aoi Yuuki as Tanya, Jun Fukushima as Kazuma, Satoshi Hino as Ainz and Yuusuke Kobayashi as Subaru but also to add from the protagonists, Yumi Hara as Albedo, Sora Amamiya as Aqua, Ai Kayano as Darkness and pulling double duty Rie Takahashi as Megumin and Emilia, Yuusuke Kobayashi as Subaru and Warren and Yumi Uchiyama as Puck and Mare Forte. Really the voice casts are back and that\'s what all that matters, just awesome.Now if there were any flaws towards this anime short, is just two, let\'s get the obvious out of the way first, if you haven\'t watched of dipped your toes in ALL four franchises you\'ll miss the many nods and jokes of their respective anime franchises, sure the character jabbing is there but to fully enjoy it, at least having watched all four of the anime franchises is a given (or if your like LA and didn\'t watch Overlord but watched the rest, the first season is enough). the second would be since the huge cast of characters from FOUR anime franchises are coming together and this is an anime short, that means the screentime for many of the characters are limited to say the least and this even comes into play all the crazier scenarios Isekai Quartet could pull off, like LA wanted Megumin and Emilia interacting together, Darkness and Shalltear going at it, Cocytus and Visha talking about war life. BUT to this what we still got was nonetheless a crazy collab-ing comedy conundrum of craziness.The finale was good in many aspects with it teasing with EVEN MORE characters being in this crossover anime short.

I might have chuckled once throughout my entire watching of the show.The plot is stupid, which is FINE, since it is, after all, a spinoff gag show, but the premise of the show wasn\'t what ruined the show, it was the fact that there was absolutely no content that spurred the show on. Obviously, there are 4 different series of characters in this show, and they all were forced to participate on school life. However, it was the fact that the daily school life activites they did, whether it was a field trip, electing reps,...or doing class duties, were actually just very badly done. Not a whole lot is ever put on these aspects of the ""content"" of the episode. I mean, the class goes on a trip to the beach, but nothing out of the ordinary happens.Basically, every single activities the characters do, is put to the side and the same old dialogue happens no matter what actions they are doing, which just makes this show four different casts of characters trying to be funny regardless of the setting, WHICH IS FINE, but that is also poorly done. There are a whole lot of characters for a gag spinoff show with only 12 minute episodes, and as a result, almost none of them get any sort of exposure or screen time, other than the four protags obv, or if they do, it\'s the same old joke over and over again.

The animation was ok but the story was amazing (don't know why tho), even if this is a cross-over it made me count the days and the hours until a new episode will come out.From my point of view the best part was when Subaru tried saying the forbidden phrase, it gave me some hope that they might just understand his pain, that he made it, that even if he can't say it Ainz can tell them for him, but it...ended up the same as it always does.Also that opening song, I can't get it out of my head, the story,sound and characters where outstanding.

The art was pretty good and I truly enjoyed it. So the overall will be a 9. This truly was a godly cross-over."", ""Okay, let me make this straight. If you want to enjoy & understand Isekai Quartet, you need to watch the 4 animes that are featured in this show first. I really get pissed off when people do not enjoy something but doesn't do the most basic thing first, try to make an effort to understand it before saying such things. There are quite a few jokes that you actually have to be a fan of those 4 anime or you wouldn't understand it. Now with my ranting thrown aside, I'll start the proper review.Story : 7The story starts off with a hilarious scene of the...different Isekais getting forced into another Isekai world, and like any other Isekai, gets trapped in it. In order to try to get back to their original world, they have no choice but to attend school. Which they do a bunch of fun activities and have some hilarious moments between the Isekai characters.Art : 7I know this is show uses a Chibi art style, but if I give higher than 7 just because it's cute than every anime can just use a Chibi art style and get high ratings. I will agree the art style is pretty cute, this is the first time I've watched an anime that uses a Chibi art style. It really fits this anime of being light hearted and just made for enjoyment. A drawback of this art is that it can also take some traits away from character. Such as Tanya's menacing personality, Momon's undead glare, Rem's demon looks and Kazuma's lewd stare.Sound : 7The OP felt like it was ready to greet me into a world that is filled with enjoyment and comedy. I wasn't mistaken on that part, the show had pretty good comedy, even if they require more understanding. The ending theme was practically non existent, since it is more of a speech, unique.Character : 8I feel like I shouldn't really talk about the characters since it's a cross-over, but since it is a cross-ever I feel like I should talk about them. Kazuma and his gang come from KonoSuba, the only Isekai out of the 4 that is more concentrated on comedy. They will be the ones that are more naturally packed with humor. Kazuma being the perverted adventurer. Darkness being a masochist. Aqua being a useless goddess and Megumin being an arch-wizard that only has one move, explosion. Subaru and his squad come from Re:Zero. Subaru always tries his best to make somebody smile, although he goes through a lot during the process. Rem and Emilia are girls who care about their comrades, always making that extra move to bring fun. Beatrice is a quiet loli with an attitude. Momon and his guardians come from Overlord. I can't explain every character since there are too many so I'll just explain Momon. Momon is the overlord that resides in The Great Tomb of Nazarick and has a ruthless personality, being able to kill anything without thinking a second time. Tanya and her battalion hail from Youjo Senki. Again, there are too many people and also many of them are not developed a lot so I will only explain Tanya. Tanya is a little girl that is also a major in the Empire. She despises Being X and takes any chance she can to kill it. Therefore having a sadistic personality.Enjoyment : 8I really enjoyed Isekai Quartet, the humor was only point. The characters weren't too off from their original anime where they came from, which was a big relief. I enjoyed the fun times they had together. That also explains that even if they were from other worlds they can co-exist between each another.Overall : 7I'd recommend Isekai Quartet to anybody who has watched all 4 anime. If you haven't watched all 4 of them, I highly recommend you do before watching Isekai Quartet. Chances are you will not understand some things in the anime that really require you to watch that specific anime.Recommended only if you watched the 4 anime. different Isekais getting forced into another Isekai world, and like any other Isekai, gets trapped in it.

It's not a full team up show, as you might see in Western comics, and is instead like the one-off episodes of a sitcom where a few characters from another show visit and make references to their own world. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just don't go in expecting it.The worst I can really say about it is that it's less four different isekai casts interacting with each other...in a school setting, and more four different isekai casts in a school setting, that occasionally interact. There are things you wish they could have done, but the vastly different tones and power levels of each show makes it nigh impossible to do right and really isn't worth the effort in the 9ish minute chibi format.Will you enjoy it? It depends. If you have seen at least two of the shows (ignoring Tanya's, as they give you a quick overview right at the beginning), you will likely laugh at a number of the gags that reference their respective shows. If not, I'd say skip it and watch Konosuba/Re:Zero/Youjo Senki and/or read the Overlord LN if isekais are your cup of tea. in a school setting, and more four different isekai casts in a school setting, that occasionally interact.

It's not really necessary to have seen all of them but if you want a better comprehension just read the argument you're missing.Nice opening, very energic. Great ending with the most remarkable waifus of each anime. (Emilia, Aqua, Albedo and Tanya).A nice character development I think, we can know more about the real thoughts of the protagonists of each isekai.In a nutshell, Isekai Quartet developes a scholar story with the main characters of the animes as students who are not necessarily the best classmates. Very enjoyable. "", 'The best way to enjoy this series is if you have watched all four, if not why the fuck are you reading the reviews you\'ve got some amazing shows to watch. But if you have great, this show is basically what if people that went to another world, went to another world. To be honest I think its nice, like from the 4 anime\'s they chose konosuba is the only ""positive"" one whereas the others are darker. So this gives us a nice pull away from those seasons. Also some of those series are still awaiting their second season such as Saga of Tanya and...Re:zero, which I enjoyed. So this gives me reassurance that there will be another season lol.I think the main reason why this is so enjoyable is to see the characters interact with each other, which we wouldn\'t be able to see. And when they bring up references from their animes that gives it all the more joy.Basically, if you have suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety or anything else that causes you emotional suffering and you have seen Saga of Tanya the Evil, Overlord 1, 2 and 3, Konosuba season 1 and 2 ANNNNDDDD Re:zero, then this is the cure to all your problems.

I especially love the Opening song ""Isekai Quartet"", I never knew that Ainz could sing so well; he\'s the last person I expected, and I loved it.

They picked out the four BEST isekais of all time (Rezero, Youjo Senki, Overlord, and Konosuba) and isekai'd them all into an isekai.

This crossover of various characters provides excellent entertainment, and provides answers for what would happen if one character met a character who, for example, despises the other.I\'m not really sure if there\'s a story, but every episode has a selection of characters performing a certain task. For example, one of the episodes is a test of magic, which allows for the characters to showcase their magic, allowing the rest of the cast to learn and adapt to each other.The art style is cute. It makes sense why they chose...this Chibi style of art, since it would be strange if a giant skeleton was realistic, while you have this skinny tracksuit kid just being stared down at him.The music is amazing, since it brings in tracks from each series into it, alongside the opening song to be sung by the four main characters of their series (Kazuma, Subaru, Ainz, Tanya).

As a result most of them have less spoken sentences than there are episodes.With that in mind, there is simply barely enough room for characters to interact with eachother, let alone build any kind of relationship or having some kind of arc or developement.

I can't not watch the next episode, keep them coming I'm loving it!"", 'If nothing else, I appreciate the sheer cynical genius behind Isekai Quartet. Isekai is the most popular genre in anime right now, Kadokawa owns the rights to some of its most popular entries, so what’s the quickest ticket to printing all the money imaginable? Have them all cross over in a silly gag spin-off,using the combined star power of all these successful casts to rake in fans from across the anime spectrum, encouraging fans of one show to check out the others ones in the process, while banking on the relative quality of all the shows in question to make for an enjoyable experience on...its own merits. That’s on par with the MCU when it comes to Galaxy Brain brand-IP management. And for what it’s worth, I give it all the credit in the world for achieving exactly what it set out to do. Isekai Quartet tosses the casts of Re:Zero, Konosuba, Overlord, and Youjo Senki together into a high school slice-of-life comedy short, transporting them from their own individual parallel worlds to yet another parallel world that requires them to follow classroom etiquette and generally get along with each other. The stage is set for wacky hijinks, in-jokey references, and conversations between all your favorite characters, all while the series itself begins establishing its own mildly intriguing internal lore as to why all these disparate worlds came crashing together in the first place.The obvious appeal of a show like this is going to be in how well it can capture the spirit of the shows it crosses over. And what ultimately makes Isekai Quartet a worthwhile time, despite some flaws that I’ll get to in a second, is that it excels at this task. You never doubt for a second that the characters you see traipsing around the classroom are the same lovable idiots you’ve seen in their own shows countless times before. The writing does a fantastic job capturing the feel of every cast’s respective chemistry, to the point where I wonder if the original scriptwriters were working on the dialogue. And with the communal classroom setting, there’s a lot of fun to be had in seeing how everyone’s archetypes play into classic high school student archetypes. Konosuba’s cast are the stoner losers, blabbering their thoughts in a stream of unhinged improv-adjacent consciousness, courtesy of the fantastic seiyuu performances. Re:Zero’s gang are the jocks of the group, confidently taking charge with tightly written, intricately interwoven quips flying between them a mile a minute. Youjo Senki’s battalion are the preps who handle every situation with dorky seriousness, trying to keep a straight, formal face in the midst of all this madness. And Overlord’s people are... hm... I dunno, the utterly obnoxious LARPers who get way too into their roles and everyone’s too polite to tell them to stop? Look, Overlord fucking sucks, so if nothing else, Isekai Quartet properly represents how mealy, pasteboard and stiff that show is.Which brings me to the first big issue: your enjoyment of Isekai Quartet will depend heavily on how much you like the individual shows. If you’re not invested in at least half of the properties I mentioned, you’re probably better off staying away. For my personal tastes, obviously, any time the cast of Overlord took center stage was an exercise in sighing heavily and waiting for it to get back to the characters I actually liked. But I also find it weird that Saga of Tanya the Evil was one of the properties chosen to cross over. I mean, that show is now known for its ensemble cast like the rest of the quarter here; Tanya and Viktoria are pretty much the only memorable characters. And none of the completely interchangeable soldiers who transport over with them leave any sort of impression here either, which just begs the question of why Kadokawa didn’t choose another popular isekai with a stronger character dynamic to take its place. I mean, Tanya’s story is all about plot and big ideas, it’s not well-suited to this kind of gag spin-off. Thankfully, Tanya herself remains a fantastic character here, so it’s not a total wash, and the remaining two properties are still as solid as ever. I think re-uniting with the Konosuba cast after so long really made me appreciate how much their seiyuus add to these roles; their voices are all so cackle-inducingly elastic, able to snap like a rubber band between low-key snark and utter batshit lunacy at the drop of a hat. And, of course, there’s Re:Zero, my favorite isekai of all time in no small part thanks to its wonderful ensemble dynamic, and I’m pleased to say it hasn’t lost an ounce of its charm. Any more time spent watching Ram’s incredible deadpan act is music to my ears.But up until now, I’ve mainly been talking about the shows as separate entities. This is a crossover, isn’t it? What about the fun of watching them all clash and collide and fulfill every fanfiction author’s wet dream of seeing how X would interact with Y? Well, that’s where my real enduring problem with Isekai Quartet lies; it does not take good advantage of its premise. For a crossover show, we spend far too much time with each cast isolated in their own little community, rehashing and reheating the comedy dynamic of their own universe without expanding it to include everyone else’s influence. The appeal of this show should be seeing how people from different worlds would interact, but I don’t think even half of the show’s runtime is allotted to conversations between the four different properties. Sure, they’re all hanging out in the same classroom, but they’re mostly bouncing off Re:Zero’s Roswaal as their campy, sadistic teacher, with very little time to actually talk to each other. The bits we do get are great; Kazuma and Subaru’s meet-cute in episode 4 is everything you could possibly want it to be. And Aqua’s eternal rage boner for Ainz’ undead presence is probably the funniest joke anyone’s ever told with that character. Hell, I’ll even say that Ainz is able to show some genuine pathos and nuance in his conversation with Tanya, where he finally gets to act as himself instead of an all-imposing skeletal demigod. These bits and pieces do everything you would want from a crossover like this, bringing out everyone’s best qualities and making something even more entertaining in their collision. So why does this show feel so averse to actually letting that happen?Maybe part of the problem is how big the casts are; I feel like it was a mistake to transport so many characters from each show over, as with so little time to spread around so many people, everyone outside of the leads from each show ends up feeling pretty shortchanged. And it doesn’t help that since Overlord has the biggest cast, they end up getting a lot of time in the spotlight, and, well, like I said above, Overlord fucking sucks, so that ends up being a drain on things (plot twist, this review is just my excuse to shit on Overlord some more). My solution? Limit the scope: have no more than four characters from every show. Obviously, the village idiots from Konosuba are fine as is. Re:Zero’s motley crew would work with just Subaru, Emilia and the demon sisters; Ram’s snark kinda removes the need for Beatrice to be there if she’s not an integral story element as well. Youjo Senki can pair itself down to Tanya, Viktoria, that one mullet guy whose name I forget, and one more soldier. And Overlord... eh, I’d say Ainz, Albedo, Shalltear and Demiurge, they’re the most important characters in the show, so they’d be the best option, and it’s not like the rest of the Tomb of Nazarick is any more interesting. Point is, with that decreased scope, I think the show would allow itself a lot more freedom to find consistently fun and interesting things to do with the characters it allowed itself. Because come on, guys, how can you have Megumin and Emilia in the same show and never have them interact? You’ve got two iconic roles by one of the best up-and-coming anime actresses, and you don’t make a point of showing off her talents by making her play them off each other? It’s like they tried to make this the least interesting version of itself they possibly could.Still, for all my gripes and frustrations, I can’t deny that I still had a lot of fun with Isekai Quartet. Maybe it’s cheap, maybe it’s base, maybe I’m just a cog in a marketing machine, but you know what? Sometimes, it’s okay just to hang out with all your favorite fictional friends and not expect much more than a good time well told. This ain’t no masterpiece here, and I hope the inevitable second season finds more time to spend on the inter-cast dynamics, but I still had fun catching up with old friends and reminding myself why I fell in love with them in the first place. And now, the speculation begins on which new franchise(s) is/are being added in for the second season. Anyone know what other big isekai properties Kadokawa owns? Because I’ve got a sinking feeling that I might need to actually watch Shield Hero to prepare for season. God help us all. its own merits. That’s on par with the MCU when it comes to Galaxy Brain brand-IP management. And for what it’s worth, I give it all the credit in the world for achieving exactly what it set out to do.

Re:Zero’s gang are the jocks of the group, confidently taking charge with tightly written, intricately interwoven quips flying between them a mile a minute. Youjo Senki’s battalion are the preps who handle every situation with dorky seriousness, trying to keep a straight, formal face in the midst of all this madness. And Overlord’s people are... hm... I dunno, the utterly obnoxious LARPers who get way too into their roles and everyone’s too polite to tell them to stop? Look, Overlord fucking sucks, so if nothing else, Isekai Quartet properly represents how mealy, pasteboard and stiff that show is.Which brings me to the first big issue: your enjoyment of Isekai Quartet will depend heavily on how much you like the individual shows. If you’re not invested in at least half of the properties I mentioned, you’re probably better off staying away. For my personal tastes, obviously, any time the cast of Overlord took center stage was an exercise in sighing heavily and waiting for it to get back to the characters I actually liked. But I also find it weird that Saga of Tanya the Evil was one of the properties chosen to cross over. I mean, that show is now known for its ensemble cast like the rest of the quarter here; Tanya and Viktoria are pretty much the only memorable characters. And none of the completely interchangeable soldiers who transport over with them leave any sort of impression here either, which just begs the question of why Kadokawa didn’t choose another popular isekai with a stronger character dynamic to take its place. I mean, Tanya’s story is all about plot and big ideas, it’s not well-suited to this kind of gag spin-off. Thankfully, Tanya herself remains a fantastic character here, so it’s not a total wash, and the remaining two properties are still as solid as ever. I think re-uniting with the Konosuba cast after so long really made me appreciate how much their seiyuus add to these roles; their voices are all so cackle-inducingly elastic, able to snap like a rubber band between low-key snark and utter batshit lunacy at the drop of a hat. And, of course, there’s Re:Zero, my favorite isekai of all time in no small part thanks to its wonderful ensemble dynamic, and I’m pleased to say it hasn’t lost an ounce of its charm. Any more time spent watching Ram’s incredible deadpan act is music to my ears.But up until now, I’ve mainly been talking about the shows as separate entities. This is a crossover, isn’t it? What about the fun of watching them all clash and collide and fulfill every fanfiction author’s wet dream of seeing how X would interact with Y? Well, that’s where my real enduring problem with Isekai Quartet lies; it does not take good advantage of its premise. For a crossover show, we spend far too much time with each cast isolated in their own little community, rehashing and reheating the comedy dynamic of their own universe without expanding it to include everyone else’s influence. The appeal of this show should be seeing how people from different worlds would interact, but I don’t think even half of the show’s runtime is allotted to conversations between the four different properties. Sure, they’re all hanging out in the same classroom, but they’re mostly bouncing off Re:Zero’s Roswaal as their campy, sadistic teacher, with very little time to actually talk to each other. The bits we do get are great; Kazuma and Subaru’s meet-cute in episode 4 is everything you could possibly want it to be. And Aqua’s eternal rage boner for Ainz’ undead presence is probably the funniest joke anyone’s ever told with that character. Hell, I’ll even say that Ainz is able to show some genuine pathos and nuance in his conversation with Tanya, where he finally gets to act as himself instead of an all-imposing skeletal demigod. These bits and pieces do everything you would want from a crossover like this, bringing out everyone’s best qualities and making something even more entertaining in their collision. So why does this show feel so averse to actually letting that happen?Maybe part of the problem is how big the casts are; I feel like it was a mistake to transport so many characters from each show over, as with so little time to spread around so many people, everyone outside of the leads from each show ends up feeling pretty shortchanged. And it doesn’t help that since Overlord has the biggest cast, they end up getting a lot of time in the spotlight, and, well, like I said above, Overlord fucking sucks, so that ends up being a drain on things (plot twist, this review is just my excuse to shit on Overlord some more). My solution? Limit the scope: have no more than four characters from every show. Obviously, the village idiots from Konosuba are fine as is. Re:Zero’s motley crew would work with just Subaru, Emilia and the demon sisters; Ram’s snark kinda removes the need for Beatrice to be there if she’s not an integral story element as well. Youjo Senki can pair itself down to Tanya, Viktoria, that one mullet guy whose name I forget, and one more soldier. And Overlord... eh, I’d say Ainz, Albedo, Shalltear and Demiurge, they’re the most important characters in the show, so they’d be the best option, and it’s not like the rest of the Tomb of Nazarick is any more interesting. Point is, with that decreased scope, I think the show would allow itself a lot more freedom to find consistently fun and interesting things to do with the characters it allowed itself. Because come on, guys, how can you have Megumin and Emilia in the same show and never have them interact? You’ve got two iconic roles by one of the best up-and-coming anime actresses, and you don’t make a point of showing off her talents by making her play them off each other? It’s like they tried to make this the least interesting version of itself they possibly could.Still, for all my gripes and frustrations, I can’t deny that I still had a lot of fun with Isekai Quartet. Maybe it’s cheap, maybe it’s base, maybe I’m just a cog in a marketing machine, but you know what? Sometimes, it’s okay just to hang out with all your favorite fictional friends and not expect much more than a good time well told. This ain’t no masterpiece here, and I hope the inevitable second season finds more time to spend on the inter-cast dynamics, but I still had fun catching up with old friends and reminding myself why I fell in love with them in the first place. And now, the speculation begins on which new franchise(s) is/are being added in for the second season. Anyone know what other big isekai properties Kadokawa owns? Because I’ve got a sinking feeling that I might need to actually watch Shield Hero to prepare for season. God help us all.', 'Honestly, there is not much to say about Isekia  Quartet.

Essentially just a fun, fanservicey romp where we turn off our brains and enjoy some light situational comedy between characters that have already been set up in their respective shows. The style may be simple, but I found it was really conducive to the snappy type of comedy that the show was going for, and for its part the comedy was successful nine of out ten times.

I'm sure that there were a lot of subtle jokes that would've only made sense if you had seen all four of the shows, but for what it was worth I found it to be pretty funny. The animation is...pretty basic, but the chibi designs for all the characters are pretty cute. The ED is pretty good as well.

I finally got round to watching this but, only after being pestered to. And I have to say. That wasn’t bad at all. Initially what put me off watching it was just the fact that the way it was presented looked more like an OVA than a full-fledged series. On top of the fact that I had already seen each of the respected series. But was pleasantly surprised.First, it made me laugh. Which is quite rare these days, but I did have a good old giggle. I found it fascinating seeing all the characters talk to other characters from the different series. I mean...when you put them all in the same room, you can only help but notice the similarity’s in personality’s with characters. Which I didn’t think about before.I liked the length and the quality of the animation. It wasn’t too long that it would drag out and I think the simplified character design was an interesting choice which just worked well for some reason. Music wasn’t something that stood out to me, but the opening and endings was pretty good. I mean I didn’t skip them which is something.The story was alright. Predictable at times and lack lustre but I think that’s nothing to be picky about. I mean what else do you expect when you take all these high actions other world anime and stick them all in a school.On wards and up wards. I will for sure be watching the second season at some stage and if they make a third season well. All the merrier. But I was satisfied with that.

The episodes are short so if you get tired of watching subaru get fucking murdered in re: zero, you can always come here for comedy relief. I haven't seen overlord or youjo senki but ainz and tanya seemed pretty interesting regardless. It was fun to see the cross-series interactions, like subaru and kazuma, what a insane duo that we never knew we needed. Episodes are only 10 minutes...long though.

Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38959/Lord_El-Melloi_II_Sei_no_Jikenbo__Rail_Zeppelin_Grace_Note,"[""This show is set in the same timeline as Fate/Zero which means it was an autopickup because it's finally a Fate show that isn't a spinoff. On the surface, the idea of Waver Velvet doing Sherlock Holmes things is genius. Remember how Waver discovered Caster's lair in Fate/Zero? This show promises more of that with adult Waver and more dangerous mysteries!While this show is still worth watching if you're a Waver or Fate Zero fan, it's ultimately let down by it's mediocre writing that poorly emulates Detective Fiction. Detective Fiction is a genre where the excitement comes from the audience engaging in the same problem...solving as the protagonist. When you read Sherlock Holmes, you're essentially playing a metaphorical puzzle game with the writer; they are feeding you clues in a game with clearly defined rules. The reader must therefore know these rules. For example Sherlock finds a corpse in a room locked from the inside? You know the rules already because you know how locks work in real life. Waver finding Caster's hideout by measuring the concentration of mana in the river? You know the rules because it's analogous to dilution IRL. A character using necromancy to ask a corpse what they remember before dying? Even that works because it's magical CCTV footage.Where this show falls flat is that fact that readers do not know the rules.Take episode 2 for example. The entire plot hinges on Waver realising that Fargo's ritual circle is using the Heliocentric model of the solar system instead of a Geocentric one. Unfortunately the average viewer is not a Cultist or a 400 year old Astrologer. We do not understand anything that's going on until Waver spells out the solution. We cannot engage in the same problem solving as the protagonist. If Detective Fiction is a puzzle game, then the El-Melloi plot is like watching the writer playing both sides of a chess game. For all intents and purposes, the writer is essentially making up the rules on the spot, which ultimately leads to a boring experience for the audience.Makoto Sanda's mysteries are impossible because you don't understand the rules needed to solve them. Once you do understand them, they're laughably simplistic (essentially 1+1=2 quick Eldritch magic). And that is why El-Melloi is a mediocre work of detective fiction.edit; Here is a Youtube review that raises many similar issues (better than my own review :P); https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_5YWTthl-w solving as the protagonist.

It’s 2019 and we now live in an age where another one of its light novel series gets an anime adaptation from the Nasuverse. Taking place years after the events of Fate/Zero, you have to wonder how the show will be able to keep up its hype. This is especially true with a protagonist like Waver Velvet, a professor from the Mage’s Association. But with a sigh of regret, I am rather flabbergasted at how this Nasuverse anime ended up being no more than mediocrity.Watching Lord El-Melloi II...Sei no Jikenbo Rail Zepplin Grace Note feels like you are thrown into a world where you need at least some prior experience with Nasuverse. If you have no experience with Fate/Zero, then I would highly suggest at least reading some insight about that series. Before getting to the juicy part of Lord El-Melloi, I should also mention the series is seemingly divided by two arcs. The light novels is still ongoing in Japan with 10 volumes running so common sense logic designates this show as an incomplete adaptation. That’s not a main problem but it doesn’t stray from the fact that the anime feels like an advertisement. My impression from the first few episodes is based on the introduction of the characters, in particular members of the Mage’s Association. Waver Velvet feels like a character who practically lives with his job. As a lecturer of the Clock Tower, the man has a reputation and is well-known for his knowledge of magic. Rarely showing emotions and devoted to his work, Lord El-Melloi may be a character that the audience won’t be easily accept or relate to. On the other hand, I do appreciate a protagonist who is has a strong head with knowledge. Lord El-Melloi II may not be an easy person to make friends with but he is an extremely valuable asset to the Mage’s Association.Nasuverse contains an expanding lore that can be rather complex if you’re unfamiliar with its franchises. This anime won’t be too easy to understand at first based on its magic system. Some episodes uses a method of ‘show and tell’ while others vaguely touches upon its branches of magic. However, I do feel that the anime contains a feeling of mystique at times. It seems the anime wants the audience to figure out how things work before certain concepts are explained. In fact, the first half of the show has weekly mysteries that connects to the series’ overall themes. It isn’t until the second half where we get an ongoing plot, known as the Rail Zepplin arc.With that being said, there’s one main character I’m sure fans have taken notice from the start. Gray, the hooded girl with “Saber-face”, is the apprentice of Lord El-Melloi II. Coming from the countryside, there’s a certain level of mystique about her character that will get the audience curious. The relationship she shares with Lord El-Melloi II is that of a master-apprentice. It’s straightforward with the two collaborating on missions although sometimes, it’s shown that Gray can let emotions get the best of her. This is noticeable in some episodes when Gray is anxious about Lord El-Melloi II’s safety. Their relationship is not fully developed in this anime and stands out best at mediocrity. This is in similar stance to Reines, the bloodline successor of the El-Melloi household. Throughout the show, she has a brother-like relationship with Lord El-Melloi II but the anime doesn’t make the pair significant enough to appreciate. In fact, I think this is one of the main weakness of the series. It lacks character relationships that are meaningful to talk about. From start to finish, I can’t recall any character pair that makes the show worthwhile to watch. This is a bit ironic considering some of the previous Fate series usually has character pairs in the form of servants/masters. Even Fate/Apocrypha has character relationships elements that are worth talking about. In this show? Not a chance.In addition, it’s worth noting the anime reintroduces some of the previous characters Fate fans may be familiar with. Characters such as Luvia and Kairi makes appearances with various roles that sometimes feel like they can overshadow the protagonists. New characters such as Flat Escardos and Olga also has more personality than the main leads. It’s a sad state of affairs when the main characters can’t carry an anime together. Perhaps the better question to ask yourself in this case is how much we should appreciate the plot. An important arc known as the “Rail Zepplin” takes place in the second half of the series with high stakes and mystery. It also takes place on a unique train that gets darker and darker with each progressing episode. Hell, the arc even adds elements of murder suspense that turns the show into more of a thriller. However, the overall execution turns peculiar turns with introductions of characters such as Hephaestion. The mystery involves with a murder case and the Mystic Eyes that fans may draw references from the Garden of Sinner franchise. But with all due respect, putting Lord El-Melloi on the sidelines weakens his character importance even more. Instead, the anime decided to gives more role to Luvia and Kairi during their investigations. Gray herself deals with Hephaestion who develops a sort of rivalry between the duo. The overall Rail Zepplin arc really depends on how you’d appreciate it but at the end of the day, mixing different kinds of genres together without character development is no good.Even as the show retains a rather serious mood, there are occasionally tongue and cheek humor. The anime plays around with some character gags such as Gray’s unfamiliarity with being normal. There’s even one particular episode where she goes shopping with her female friends. Other times, we get characters acting like goofballs such as Flat at the academy. Ironically, the Mage Association hardly feels like a school and more about preparing students for mages. Outside of Lord El-Melloi II’s class, you don’t get to see other professors or classes being taught. This isn’t Hogwarts, folks.Studio Troyca helms this show and visually, it retains a familiar look with its other previous projects. As the director, Makoto Katou designs the characters with similar style but also visually enough to make each unique. Lord El-Melloi II is perhaps most noticeable as someone who looks like an older adult and genuinely gives the impression of a professor. Plus, let’s not forget about the technical quality. If there’s something to brag about the show, this is it. The production quality looks like poetry in motion. The battle cinematics looks like watching a film on occasions especially in the second arc. Each fight is impactful and draws out the abilities of the characters. If that wasn’t enough, we do get to see flashy weapons used such as Gray’s signature scythe. Fan service does exist although minimal and isn’t distracting. The show relies much more on its visual dynamics than showing skin. And to top it off, we also get a stylish OP song without lyrics but with a mesmerizing tune.As a fan of the Nasuverse and some of its previous Fate franchises, Lord El-Melloi felt like watching a long movie as part of an major saga. With 13 episodes, the anime didn’t have enough time to develop its cast or craft storytelling that is worth remembering. However, I do have to give credit about the show’s technical elements thanks to the work of the director and studio. With all that being said, this anime is probably worth watching if you’re instinctively curious about the expanding Nausverse. But if you’re someone expanding a lot from this show, you should turn back now. Sei no Jikenbo Rail Zepplin Grace Note feels like you are thrown into a world where you need at least some prior experience with Nasuverse.

With all that being said, this anime is probably worth watching if you’re instinctively curious about the expanding Nausverse. But if you’re someone expanding a lot from this show, you should turn back now.', 'In the world of mages, it doesn\'t matter who did it, or how.I\'ll preface this short review with a quick statement about myself - I\'m writing this review as a novice fan of Type-Moon lore. I have yet to reach a level of knowledge that could even be faintly construed as being an expert, and as a result I welcome any corrections to lore mistakes I may be making!When I first heard that Lord El-Melloi II\'s Case Files would be receiving an anime adaptation, I was overjoyed. I have read a portion of Case Files before, and I am aware that Makoto Sanda is...the go-to man for Kinoko Nasu with regards to fixing any inconsistencies in the deep lore of the Fate universe, specifically those with regards to the Clock Tower and the Mage’s Association.Permit me a metaphor, if you will. Many people would love a series or movie dedicated to exploring the underworld of the Continental and other institutions in the universe of John Wick. Case Files effectively is that series, except for the convoluted world of one of Fate’s three primary magical institutions. We got a teaser of the Clock Tower\'s proceedings at the end of Unlimited Blade Works, Zero hinted at this by introducing the idea of Freelancers and Sealing Designations; the latter of which also appear in Kara no Kyoukai, and Hollow Ataraxia’s Bazett Fraga McRemitz is an Enforcer of the Clock Tower. However, these little pieces of information leave more questions than answers, and rarely addressed the mechanism of how the Clock Tower operates.Herein, to me, lies the real beauty of Case Files. Beyond a detective story, it introduces us to many aspects of the Clock Tower that highlight just how chaotic and conflict-riddled an organization it truly is. Case Files also makes multiple references to other spinoffs of the main Fate world; some will have noticed some familiar faces when the show outlines the concept of the twelve Lords, such as Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg from strange/fake, Tsukihime and Heaven’s Feel. Others will recognize characters such as Kairi Shishigou, Luviagelita Edelfelt and Olga-Marie Animusphere.Apologies for the verbiage. Let us begin with the actual review.StoryThis adaptation of El-Melloi II’s Case Files is split into two halves; Episodes 1 through 6 focus on a series of anime-original content (collectively, the Grace Notes). The second half, starting from Episode 7, adapts the Rail Zeppelin arc from the novels.The Grace Notes arc (teamed with the initial episode 0, ""A Grave Keeper, a Cat, and a Mage ~There is no such thing as ""truth"".~"", do a respectable job of introducing us to the main characters of the show. It is a fair point to make that this may not be the case for someone who hasn’t watched Fate/zero, and thus this marks it down a little. The anime-original content also does an excellent job of introducing the conflicts in the Clock Tower and the various tensions between departments, such as Waver/Lord El -Melloi II’s own Faculty of Modern Magecraft Theories and the 13th (technically separate) Faculty of Law, or Policies. Other reviews have pointed out that Case Files does not follow the conventions of a detective novel. I personally don’t think that one should approach Case Files as a conventional detective story precisely because it follows so many esoteric rules of magic; rather, one should treat it as an atmospheric exploration of the weirder aspects of magic in the Fate world, with a relatively simplistic detective element thrown into it. However, even with that being said, it is a genuinely valid criticism to be making of the show; from a detective fiction standpoint Case Files is barely a third-rate piece of fiction, given how many puzzle pieces either require so much background knowledge that the show no longer counts as a standalone piece of fiction, or are just straight-up non-decipherable until Waver spells out the magical construct behind it. Basically, it’s magic, not logic.The Rail Zeppelin arc also explores the concept of Mystic Eyes, especially their ranking. And we all know tier lists are exceptionally important. Once again, there are little tidbits of information that will tickle the fancies of those familiar with Type-Moon lore, such as the appearance of the Child of Ainnash, or the reveal of the class of the main antagonist’s Servant.However, at this point, I must unfortunately report that the Rail Zeppelin half of the Case Files adaptation showcases the greatest weaknesses of the show so far. While clues are dropped throughout the episodes for the reveal of the main antagonist of this arc as well as the rationale behind their unmasking, very little actual evidence onboard the train points to the main antagonist being who they are. Their relationship with Waver is also sadly under-explored in the show; something which I suspect the novels go more in-depth about, though I cannot comment on the matter having not reached the segment in question.As a general rule, the Case Files anime\'s story (especially the Rail Zeppelin arc) suffers from contraction - it\'s clear some details are missing for expedience, but as a result it is not a friendly story to outsiders from the Type-Moon universe - many of the nuances are easy to miss. As an approachable story then, sadly this adaptation is not successful.Art and MusicPerhaps the single greatest strength of this anime adaptation is the presentation. Having been to London multiple times, Troyca’s depiction of London is not short of a masterpiece. It complements the story perfectly, and the buildings are replicated in painstaking detail, emphasizing the grandiosity and pomp of London as a city and the Clock Tower as an institution.Yuki Kajiura has handled the music for this adaptation, and it is beyond perfect. Kajiura’s work often has a single instrumental element that recurs in the more dramatic tracks within the soundtrack of a specific show – for Fate/zero, it was a violin-led orchestral element, and for Kara no Kyoukai it was the choir backing vocals. Case Files’ soundtrack (now that it is out as of September 5th)’s main element is the flute, teamed with the violin; this is most apparent in the opening theme ”starting the case: Rail Zeppelin”. However, some old Kajiura classics seem to always show up – ”deep in old grief” is practically lifted straight from the Fate/zero studio session, and ”waving goodbye” has the soft chimes and choir straight from Kara no Kyoukai.CharactersWaver Velvet is a man on the outside, and a young boy on the inside. Not your average mage, trying to reach the Root like everyone else. He has unfinished business from ten years ago. From time to time, the young Waver that was bullied and tossed around by Iskandar surfaces. Perhaps you can’t teach a young dog new tricks either. He is a man tortured by his past mistakes, and constantly motivates himself out of a desire to finish what he started. Yet he is also undeniably older; and thus far more rational, careful, and calculating. Until he isn’t. At which point he either blushes or goes a little chuuni. He owes his current position to a certain smug Inorin-I mean, blonde young magus.Reines El-Melloi Archisorte is a heady contender for the crown of smug. Endlessly confident, devious to a fault, curious and creative as well as sadistic, Reines is a perfect overlord for Waver (the man himself does not share this opinion). Cruel all the time, but genuinely compassionate and helpful when she needs to be. It’s not good assistance without some smug comment thrown in on the side. Inori Minase was truly the perfect CV to choose for someone like Reines. Also comes with Kayneth’s Mystic Code Volumen Hydragyrum, which has been changed into a Mercury Maid, Trimmau. I want a Mercury Maid.Gray is our requisite Saberface. It isn’t a Fate spinoff without a Saberface. Perhaps this is why Strange/fake has yet to receive one. She has a complicated backstory herself which I will not go into as it is a rather major spoiler (though it has since been hinted at and partially revealed within the show). She’s a perfect sidekick to Waver, dedicated to taking care of him. She finds reassurance in that he tolerates her and does not expect anything unreasonable from her, as well as having a certain degree of respect for her, addressing Gray as ‘Lady’. Also has Add, a talking cube/scythe/hammer voiced by Daisuke Ono. No JoJo memes here. In Add’s final form, The Lance that Shines to the Ends of the World, Kawasumi Ayako also makes a guest voice appearance, courtesy of a changed role for her in Fate/prototype. Fate spinoffs are only made when Saber or her voice can be stuffed in.Aside from the main three, several characters very familiar to those with Fate experience appear. Kairi Shishigou, Caules Forvedge and Rocco Belfaban of Fate/Apocrypha (though it is important to remember that Apocrypha takes place in an alternate world line, and thus these characters do not have any memories of that event), Luviagelita Edelfelt of Hollow Ataraxia and UBW fame, and Flat Escardos of later Strange/fake repute, just to name a few. Some original characters also appear, such as Yvette Lehrman and Hishiri Adashino. Overall, these characters do spar with each other rather well, although Yvette’s attempts at being a consort are about as endearing and successful as Waver finds them.ConclusionAlright. I’ve dragged on for long enough. I should probably dedicate this much effort to work instead, but that’s nowhere near as fun. Time to wrap it up.In summary, Case Files is indeed a rather mediocre detective story. The latter half of the show, the actual adaptation, also unfortunately severely lacks in depth of lore as well as exploration into the world of Case Files on the level of the previous anime-only episodes. But what it makes up for instead is an almost unparalleled insight into how the Clock Tower’s various rivalries and tensions work, an overview of several magical concepts and theories in the Fate universe, even more lore to give Type-Moon fans a headache, top-class animation and music, and enjoyable characters that riposte off each other with a quaint charm.Did I use the word quaint? I did, didn’t I?Isn’t that the perfect word to describe the world of Case Files, then? the go-to man for Kinoko Nasu with regards to fixing any inconsistencies in the deep lore of the Fate universe, specifically those with regards to the Clock Tower and the Mage’s Association.Permit me a metaphor, if you will.

I did, didn’t I?Isn’t that the perfect word to describe the world of Case Files, then?', 'Imagine a story taking place in the fate world except all the focus is on magician lore instead of hero lore and you got rail zeppelin. Set a few years after the grail war, Rail zeppelin is heavily focused on the exploits of a former master and his apprentice, specifically it is focused on a magical train where an auction on mystic eyes is held.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSStory: 6The main character is one of the surviving masters from Fate Zero, Waver Velvet, who is now a famous magician and one of the lords of the mages association. Most of the story is focused on...him and his students and apprentice investigating and solving all sorts of mysteries. This story genuinely had potential to be great, it had an interesting cast, a likable main character and took place in an already established well thought out world.Problems quickly arose however with how the story unfolded, the mysteries were not fun to watch because it is assumed the audience has a master thesis understanding of Fate Lore and on ancient magical systems. Mysteries were exclusively of the supernatural nature, and they genuinely could not be solved by the audience without a deep understanding of half the chuuni nonsense that was coming out of Waver’s mouth. The average viewer does not know what the fuck mystic eyes are, what the fuck old and new magic are, what the fuck the model of celestial bodies has to do with magic, and I doubt that even with thorough explanation, the average person watching rail zeppelin is going to understand what a human modelled after a servant really is.This heavily detracts from the plot as it is a mystery show, in a mystery series viewers are supposed to be able to come to their own conclusions from the evidence presented and from the behaviors of the characters. This does not happen though since the vast majority of viewers can’t figure out anything from the evidence themselves since it is all supernatural nonsense that no one who hasn’t played the games and read up the Light Novels would get. The motives and such are also hard to understand since most viewers are not versed on the politics of the mage underworld in Fate. I feel sorry for anime only viewers since I doubt the viewers ever got any enjoyment at all out of the mystery plotlines which were probably half or more of the show. Other aspects of the story were not so bad though, the power games between the major players, the backstory of how Waver Velvet ended up in the seat of El Melloi and the zeppelin arc itself were quite solid. This raised the enjoyability of the story for a lot of viewers since it was easy to follow and did not require a strong background in fate lore to understand.Art: 8The visuals were absolutely beautiful, although they were overshadowed by truly exceptionally good looking shows this season like the firefighter anime or demon slayer, they definitely lived up to the standards Fate related anime is held to. The studio may not be Ufotable but you can tell some of the same freelancers also worked on this project, the background was clean and a great copy of London, the character designs were beautiful, of course every girl is cute and adorable as is expected in a Fate show so you got a lot of best girls to look forward to. The opening is exceptionally well done and is likely in the top 3 of the season, which is quite impressive given how all out the firefighter anime went with its opening.The combat choreography and animation were solid as well, although not to the standards of Ufotable who normally animate the main Fate storyline, but it was definitely better than all but 2 shows this season. You can look forward to some decent flashy fights and clean movement and transition while watching this show.Sound: 7The opening song is really good, good enough to add to a playlist of songs you would want to listen to again, but most of the soundtrack out side of that was fairly average and not something you will remember or consider listening to outside of the show.Characters: 7There are a lot of best girls like most Fate shows, they are all cute, have distinct personalities, and have fun dialogue. Most of them also grow a bit through the show, have important roles in the plot and their own highlight scenes. Overall solid characters, but don’t expect anything to exceptional, the most notable characters were still Waver and his Apprentice.Enjoyment: 7This show was enjoyable enough that I had no problems watching it, and if you like the fate series its an interesting bit lore and world building, but due to how poorly executed the mystery aspects of the show was done I can’t ever give it a high rating.Overall: 7The poorly executed main story detracts enough that this show has no chance of being as good as the main Fate story, it also requires viewers to have watched most of Fate and played the games to really get what is going on. Since everything else was solid or even pretty good I won’t say this is a bad show or not worth watching, if you really love fate it is worth a watch. him and his students and apprentice investigating and solving all sorts of mysteries.

What in the world is going on here?"" My thoughts exactly Melvin. What in the world is going on in this series????Ah, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note, this is I think the first time ever I have given an episode 0 a higher score than the actual series!! I have long awaited this anime as a big fan of Fate anime series, and summer 2019 seemed like it was going to be an incredible season!! For nearly a year I looked forward to Lord El- Melloi, Vinland Saga, and Mo dao zu shi...season 2! You can imagine how heartbroken I was when all 3 of them were total busts. Fortunately the season did feature a couple sleeper hits in Given and O maidens in your savage season, but that\'s not what I\'m here to talk about.Who would I recommend this series to? Well the answer is simple, readers of the light novel. That, and people who want more of the loli from Gosick, just with a bigger forehead this time.I couldn\'t at all make sense of the plot in this show. Episodes 6 and 12 especially were just moronically written. Perhaps if I had read the LN, and was familiar with every last corner of the Nasuverse, I may have enjoyed it more.... But that\'s a lot to ask of a viewer.Studio TROYCA though, I do not think is to blame. They have proved themselves time and time again as probably the strongest up and coming anime studio in Japan right now! In 2018 they animated two major domestic hits in Idolish7 and Bloom into you. Neither of these got very much attention in the west (aside from that ass Gigguk randomly shouting out Bloom into you as he does with every seasonal show), but were very popular in Japan. In fact I highly recommend both Idolish7 and Bloom into you. They were put together fantastically well. Lord El-Melloi II was as well, at least in terms of production.TROYCA alway animate faces extremely well, displaying a lot of emotion and subtle changes, this holds up in El-Melloi as one of the show\'s strong points. The voice acting is also really well done.“You are correct Magus. And I have no intent of listening to any more of your nonsense.”The above is a line that doesn\'t make any sense, just like the rest of this story!!!Sometimes you just gotta ask yourself, what the hell is this plot?The last 5 minutes of the series was the best part, as all I really wanted out of this show was to see more Waver/ Iskander banter.Even if you watched Fate/ Zero, there is absolutely no guarantee that you will understand this series. If you don\'t care about plot than this series is well put together otherwise. Waver also is very attractive which is a plus. Gray was nice but I don\'t really understand why they chose to keep her hood up the entire series, except for one short scene where Waver scolds her, for reasons that were either never explained, or simply went over my head. Some of the Mystic eyes introduced in this show were kind of cool, but the 6 episode arc concerning them was chalked full of inconsistencies which was truly a bummer for me. Plus the antagonist of this arc had two different colored eyes which always bugs me in anime.Edit: It really didn\'t help that the this show premiered every week immediately after Kimetsu no Yaiba lol.In conclusion, you should watch this show only if you\'ve read the LN, or are some sort of Nasu expert. Just being a fan of the anime side of Type-Moon may not be enough... season 2! You can imagine how heartbroken I was when all 3 of them were total busts.

Their bond evokes one of the most touching scenes throughout both season, and it extends here on how Rider brought an impact to him with Rider’s ideals to an extent that he’s never imagined before. With the words “ live on ”, Waver embarked on many adventures and became more mature with greater magical abilities, embracing the spotlight as one of the professors in modern magecraft and became the Lord El-Melloi...II.As certain events unfold, he is reluctantly brought into the world of crimes and mysteries unbeknown to anyone. Surprisingly, each case has a typical detective-style vibe with little clues such as presence of alibi and motives of different suspects from various background being presented. It doesn’t bend the process and managed to retain basic detective method such as deduction skills through analysis and observation with limited resources. Then, it step up the game with the blend of modern magecraft in the story world to enhance the techniques in solving and conducting crimes. The lead detective however, is not omnipotent, which brings in the cute and powerful Gray to deal with physical threats as one of his trusted apprentices. One by one, his apprentices join him as they tackle crimes and mysteries with their unique skillsets. With that, their adventure begins.The animation is done by TROYCA. It’s a studio I’ve never heard of before, but they have done a splendid job in depicting the city of London that capture the reflecting gold-ish street light in night and the old-style English mansion with classic Victorian-like character designs. This presented a city seemingly enveloped in mysterious mist, so inviting and thrilling, yet so dangerous with unknown threats lurking in the shadows.The ending theme song, ‘Hibari’ is freaking amazing. The tune has a chilly feeling that eases the heart, with Gray holding the lantern as the seasons around her changes, as if she’s waiting for someone. The setting is so calm and so relaxing, that it’s just that pleasant to watch till the end. The opening, on the other hand is only accompanied by the Sherlock-like instrumental opening, which is much fitting to the theme of the story. Adding the scores of both animation and song, the set up of ambience are done elegantly with more moments to look forward to.Overall, the story is quite interesting so far.

Lord El-Melloi (I respect your time so I\'m not going to use the full name) only fails to be smart, successful, and entertaining.It is blindingly obvious that the people behind this project wanted to work on any of TROYCA\'s other upcoming shows, or do accounting work, or do...anything else. Although I think this show is bad, I believe that it is not the worst in the Fate franchise, that award rests firmly in the greasy, grimy hands of Fate/Extra: Last Encore, as Lord El-Melloi has the virtue of having 1 and a half good episodes.And now, since I\'m not smart or creative enough to write a review normally, here is my MAL formatted review.Story: 2/10If there are any major plot points, they sure aren\'t worth remembering. The Train arc is the only one that lasts for more than one episode, and all I can remember is that ___ died, ___ lost his eyes, ___ killed them, and there was maybe one or two fight scenes. Virtually nothing is memorable.It seems like this show\'s only reason for being is because someone thought a mystery in the Fate universe would ""be pretty epic."" And I think it could have been, were it in the hands of people who knew how to write a story instead of a plot. Watching Lord El-Melloi feels like you\'re watching a plot synopsis, with all the depth of a nano particle.Art: 8/10It\'s Fate. It always looks good. Decent art is the only consistency in all of the Fate franchise. Good art should never be any shows best quality. Good art and a good soundtrack should complement the story, not be the only passable things present in the entire production.Sound: 5/10Just take the last paragraph and replace the word art with soundtrack.Character: 2/10Everyone present besides Waver and Gray are only present to give Waver and Gray an excuse to do things or are one of the three comedic relief sidekicks. If they had changed every characters name every time their name was spoken, I would be none the wiser. No one is worth remembering, especially when the revealed big bad guy at the end of the only arc that matters is a character you\'ve never seen before.Enjoyment: 3/10Like a prostitute made of Vaseline, it can barely grab your attention and it sure can\'t hold onto it.Overall: 2/10The fact that this isn\'t the worst part of the animated Fate franchise really shows how far it\'s fallen since its inception.Also, a murder accomplice gets off immediately with a plea bargain and is not punished by the law or by their school. This doesn\'t really affect the quality, I just thought that it was funny. anything else.

Okay, in all seriousness, I like this guy. He's intelligent, but a bit too brash and serious for his own good. His companions, including the mysterious hooded Gray and the blonde imouto Reines, round out the main/recurring cast quite well with their own unique personalities, and everyone is always a joy to be around. That may actually work to Waver's detriment, though, since he is usually...the one to dispense exposition and thus may come off as a bit trite and one-note, but he has his moments of personality, and they are rather enjoyable. The episode plots aren't bad, but can be a bit trying if you actually want to solve the mysteries yourself; they tend to pull some kind of random magic stuff you can't possibly already know out of freaking nowhere to solve the whole thing. If you're confused by all the fantasy jargon tossed around, don't worry, everyone else is just as confused as you because it's basically all brand spanking new. Did you know the Fate universe had fairies? I didn't, but I should have guessed so! :D :DDo you need to watch Fate/Zero to enjoy this show's stories? No, in fact you basically need no prior knowledge at all except that the Holy Grail War is this big death game over a wish-granting McGuffin. And even that isn't all that important. Just like this show for what it is, and if you are a Fate fan, then you can appreciate the small bits of fanservice they throw in. However, its Fate-ness is, ultimately, its Achilles Heel; the show can often struggle with being... well, watchable. Mystery often revolves around exposition dumps, true, and endings to mysteries tend to just be long-winded revelations, but those revelations and most of those exposition dumps have payoff because of the suspense built up beforehand. This show lacks necessary suspense; it spends most of its time explaining why things work the way they do, and we end up just waiting for everything to happen. It's almost as though the show would provide a more entertaining experience if it came with a big textbook where we, upon pausing the episode, look up relevant information ourselves before continuing. At least that way there would be some real audience investment to the mystery because the audience would be actively working toward figuring it out.But let's focus on positives. In terms of production, TROYCA have outdone themselves and even ufotable (gasp!), if we're looking at the God-awful UBW series (oh, nvm then). The backgrounds (which I suspect ufotable has been helping with) look gorgeous, the character designs are slick, unique, and memorable, and the CGI, when present, is really solid. This show is probably the best-looking of the season so far. Directing is solid, though I'm not really seeing much in the way of uniqueness. Episode 4 had a cool focus-shifting blur effect, but not much else. The music, courtesy of everyone's favorite Yuki Kajiura is decent (with a solid instrumental opening theme) but it's a noticeable step down from Fate/Zero in my opinion. It doesn't make and carry scenes like it did there.Should you watch this show? As of yet, it's nothing meaningful, but that could change depending on how Waver is developed; he has the right foundation to be a vehicle for a genuine message. The other characters don't have much in the way of deep themes driving them, so this really is a straight-forward mystery, putting story over character, but not being allowed the ability to do it well. The show kneecaps itself with every Fate-universe-centric exposition scene to the point where it can downright be painful and eye-rolling to watch. I may not have the patience for it, but I am sure that others do. Throw in some great production value and you have yourself a nice 7 out of 10.I do, however, recommend watching Un-Go. It doesn't have a tenth of the exposition scenes that make you want to just stop. I highly urge you, if you are a fan of mysteries and enjoy a bit of the supernatural, to check it out. Make sure to watch the prequel film partway into the series, though.

It is not your usual detective anime, unless you're very well-versed in the Type Moon franchise, it is often impossible to pinpoint the culprit.However, that's where the fun is. Watching Waver solve mysteries and wondering why would the culprit do something like that is all part of the fun. Every episode feels short and I cannot wait for the next week's.Sound and Art is a solid 10 for me. I enjoy watching the OP and ED every episode, and that says a lot.Character...is also 10 so far - this is a minor spoiler, but every character has a role to play, even after their mystery has been solved. That's also what I like about the Fate series - character development for every character.

Have we, at last, reached the limit of how fucking ridiculous light novel names can get? Was it not enough to inquire after the morality of picking up girls in a dungeon? Were the rascals not satisfied by dreaming of bunny girl senpais? Didn’t we all suffer enough on the death march to the parallel world rhapsody? Must we now be tormented by this ungodly amalgamation of letters and symbols arranged loosely into some perverted fascimile of a descriptive title? What’s next? Are we going to start throwing in parentheses now? Percent signs? @ symbols, dare...I ask? How deep does this rabbit hole go? When does this nightmare end? When do we wake up? WHEN DO WE WAKE UP?!?!?!?!*sigh*Anyway, let’s talk about the latest Fate spinoff, henceforth referred to as Detective Waver because fuck me if I’m indulging this bullshit any more.Gripes about the title aside, if there was any way to get me genuinely excited about a Fate side project, following the life and times of Waver Velvet would be it. The snot-nosed brat’s journey to maturation and humility was one of the best parts of the original Fate/Zero, telling a fantastic coming-of-age tale in the skin of the most enjoyable buddy comedy this side of Death Note. His story had tragedy, humor, heart, genuine pathos, all the building blocks that make this bloated franchise work so damn well at its best. And best of all, he was a character who still had so much to explore. Who wouldn’t want to follow this blubbering dork into adulthood and see him try to put everything he learned from Iskander into practice? Who wouldn’t want to peel back his psyche even further and explore how the boy he was influenced the man he became, and how deep those connections might run? Who wouldn’t want to see Waver Velvet move on, find closure, grow and evolve while still being the same lovable punching bag he always was? Honestly, I can’t think of many better places for a Fate spinoff to go than this.So it’s a real shame that it ultimately doesn’t work. And the problem, sadly, is simple: it’s a property in the Fate franchise, with all the frustrating, bloated baggage that brings with it.Structurally, at least, there’s a lot of promise to Detective Waver, which sees our favorite son inducted into the El-Melloi family as a way of repaying his debts to his mentor Kayneth, who you may remember as the least interesting part of Fate/Zero. Now a member of high mage society, Waver must balance his personal pursuits with the politics and backstabbing of the countless ruthless factions vying for power and influence. By day, he’s taken on Kayneth’s role as academy professor, but his real profession, as the name suggests, is acting as the Sherlock Holmes of the Fate world. The first half of the series is episodic in nature, each episode focusing on a new magical mystery that Waver is called out to solve. Meanwhile, a larger plot builds up in the background, eventually taking over the second half of the series for a massive, six-episode whodunnit. Accompanying him in his sleuthing are a handful of Fate crossover characters that you thankfully don’t need to be familiar with to enjoy their presence here (Luvia the wrestler is an absolute peach), a couple students from Waver’s class who enjoy tagging along his missions, some political wheelers and dealers, and Gray, a mysterious hooded girl who considers Waver her master and is easily the best part of the series. Seriously, she strikes such a great balance between adorable, goofy, badass and haunting, and every time she was on screen was a delight.In fact, there’s a lot I liked over the course of this show’s first half. I liked the overall aesthetic and animation, which does a damn fine job replicating the hazy grandeur of Ufotable’s Fate properties (Troyca in general is a damn fine animation studio). I liked the camaderie between the characters and how willing this show was to lean into the goofier sides of the franchise. I really liked Waver himself, who, while still recognizably being the Waver of Fate/Zero, has matured and taken on some incredibly interesting dimensions. There’s a running undercurrent of PTSD metaphor, how Waver’s obsessed with finding some way to speak with Iskander again and reconnect to the greater Grail War mythos, despite it clearly having a negative impact on his mental well-being. It’s a damn well-realized portrait of someone grappling with the past, trying to figure out where their place should be in the world now that they’ve decided they want to be part of it. For the most part, it was what I always wanted from a Fate spinoff. It was enjoyable, it was lighthearted without being devoid of weight, and it legitimately fleshed out the parts of the mythos I had emotional investment in.And then it got to the second half, and the whole thing fell apart.See, as much as I was enjoying myself in the first part of the show, there was one aspect that wasn’t clicking as well as everything else: the detective stuff itself. Which for a detective show is kind of a problem. See, because this is a Fate spinoff, all the detective stuff that should be the draw in any good mystery show- the clues, the misdirections, trying to piece the evidence together for yourself alongside the characters- is tied up in the mechanics of the Fate world and its magic systems. And I’m sorry, but let’s be frank here: Fate’s magic is bad. It’s a convoluted mess of pretentious-sounding phrases and ideas with no set rules outside of “whatever the fuck we want it to be”, which wouldn’t necessarily be a problem if it weren’t for this franchise consistently trying to build so goddamn much of its structure out of it. It’s impenetrably dense, unfairly obtuse, and you need a PhD in bullshit lorekeeping to even begin to understand it. And every single mystery in Detective Waver, from the murder weapons to the motive to the sleuthing mechanics to the reveal itself, is built out of that bullshit. Thus, there’s no way to get invested in solving the mysteries, because there’s no way for you to actually solve them, because the answer to any question is always just whatever magical bullshit sounds cool to do.Still, this wasn’t too annoying in the first half of the show. Because the adventures were all so episodic, it allowed the stories to flesh out the characters and have fun beats in between all the magic stuff, focusing more on the actions the cast took en route to the mystery than the mystery itself. They were character pieces that just happened to have dumb, nonsensical mysteries rolling around in them, and it made it easy enough to just enjoy the emotions driving the plot while appreciating the cool magical bullshit for what it was. But once you get into that six-episode mystery plot, everything collapses under the weight of too much bullshit. The obtuse mechanics and unreliable lore completely take over, shoving the characters to the sidelines as the plot piles on complication after complication, each question making less sense than the one before and each answer raising a million more questions in its wake. It gets bogged down in complication, and the easy charm of the first half is lost in favor of exhaustion and boredom. Even as Detective Waver tries to keep the character beats flowing, they’re squeezed out by the sheer amount of disconnected stuff this plot throws at you. So in the end, once again, the greatest weakness of a Fate spinoff is that it’s too bogged down by Fate Stuff(tm) to relax into being it’s own thing.Look, I’m a huge fan of the core Fate timeline. What Ufotable did in bring Zero and Stay Night to life wasn’t just epic, it was the kind of awe-inspiring urban fantasy that truly captures the grandeur and majesty this genre is capable of. But these classics weren’t built on mechanics and lore. They were built on characters and themes, emotions and hope, triumph and despair, stories of people with dreams and desires fighting to realize them in a world that sought to stamp them out. It was epic not because of the convoluted rules holding everything in place, it was epic because of the stories it told within those rules, the people that brought those rules to life. Detective Waver could’ve been the spinoff this franchise deserved, a story that truly did justice to the heart and humanity of Fate at its best. Instead, it gave into all of Fate’s worst instincts yet again, leaving crushing disappointment in its wake. I ask? How deep does this rabbit hole go? When does this nightmare end? When do we wake up? WHEN DO WE WAKE UP?!?!?!?!*sigh*Anyway, let’s talk about the latest Fate spinoff, henceforth referred to as Detective Waver because fuck me if I’m indulging this bullshit any more.Gripes about the title aside, if there was any way to get me genuinely excited about a Fate side project, following the life and times of Waver Velvet would be it.

But once you get into that six-episode mystery plot, everything collapses under the weight of too much bullshit. The obtuse mechanics and unreliable lore completely take over, shoving the characters to the sidelines as the plot piles on complication after complication, each question making less sense than the one before and each answer raising a million more questions in its wake. It gets bogged down in complication, and the easy charm of the first half is lost in favor of exhaustion and boredom. Even as Detective Waver tries to keep the character beats flowing, they’re squeezed out by the sheer amount of disconnected stuff this plot throws at you. So in the end, once again, the greatest weakness of a Fate spinoff is that it’s too bogged down by Fate Stuff(tm) to relax into being it’s own thing.Look, I’m a huge fan of the core Fate timeline. What Ufotable did in bring Zero and Stay Night to life wasn’t just epic, it was the kind of awe-inspiring urban fantasy that truly captures the grandeur and majesty this genre is capable of. But these classics weren’t built on mechanics and lore. They were built on characters and themes, emotions and hope, triumph and despair, stories of people with dreams and desires fighting to realize them in a world that sought to stamp them out. It was epic not because of the convoluted rules holding everything in place, it was epic because of the stories it told within those rules, the people that brought those rules to life. Detective Waver could’ve been the spinoff this franchise deserved, a story that truly did justice to the heart and humanity of Fate at its best. Instead, it gave into all of Fate’s worst instincts yet again, leaving crushing disappointment in its wake.', ""Characters :10/10 Characters characters characters characters... yes yes yes yes!!!!!! It has been such a long and terrible time since I have come a across an anime with so many lovable characters. From Waver (Lord El-Melloi II) to Gray, to Karabo and everyone else. Every single character at least to me was absolutely amazing. Their motive their actions decision to choices all seemed so real and in character. I have seen hundreds of anime where characters do stupid shit or annoying or out of character garbage that makes no sense. I really wish I could write it down to explain it but I would much...rather have a conversation or even go through scene by scene of the whole show and individually explain why I love each character and why I love their actions. Each character has a certain charm that absolutely made me love all of them I honestly don't know how to put into writing but I will try my best. And when (minor spoiler) the train stopped I literally got up and begged that no other character would be killed off.I could not believe it myself! I wanted not a single one of the characters to die that is crazy thing for me to want while watching anime.I felt like I went crazy writing that so let me clear my head and continue. Waver was my second favorite character from Fate/Zero after his servant Aleksander the Great or Rider to make it easier. They absolutely stole the spotlight in that series( one of if not the best big bro little bro dynamic/ similar to Kamina from Gurren Lagann and Takamura from Hajime no Ippo) and I was exited to see Waver again after having to drop the pile of garbage disappointing nonsense of a series called Unlimited Blade Works which was garbage and left such a bad taste in my mouth having to drop the 4 different times I tried to watch.But this series is just without a doubt plane and simply amazing.Waver has this charming knowledgeable but somewhat sad air about him (because of how his participation in the Holy Grail War went I truly feel like he did nothing wrong but he has genuine regret that honestly made him even more likable and understandable). But for me and I hope other who watch this will truly admire and all the other characters played off of him perfectly.This anime had perfect interactions between character. They felt like real people not characters from a story. Interactions that were never forced annoying or illogical like many on top of many anime are. All interactions pushed the story forward. Right now as I write this I still don't know how they were able to make every single character even the villains but they certainly did. I have never liked so many characters in one anime as much as I do in this series. Truly well done. I would honestly love to go through every single character and say why I love them individually if I had the time.The tone of the series was serious but it had many light-hearted moments and moments where the viewer can smile or even laugh that also fit in perfectly and was never out of place. In an early ep there is a moment when Reines get sick and is in a room with Waver alone and makes a joke that makes Waver blush. That is one of the most perfect moments of comedy and warm moments I have ever seen in any media from anime to live action to movies to books. When she said that and you saw that Waver blushed and acted as if he was that teenager talking to rider from Fate/Stay you know it is the exact same character just older. That in and of itself is also a truly amazing feat. And I believe that only a cold hearted person who does not know the meaning of friendship would not understand. It was a beautiful moment.Another thing about the characters that you see is the love waiver has for his students. It also does something else with this that I've only seen in one other anime in which Waver is the weakest person in the series. That is made clear but you can see how much each and every one of his student love and cherish him. He cares for, knows, understands and talks to his students because he was once in their shoes. I love Waver or Lord El Melloi so much. Again only in Hunter X Hunter have I seen a main character who at all points throughout the story is the weakest.  He is not overpowered hes not a chosen one; he is just a person like anyone who is just kind. Watch this series please trust me.Story: 9/10 The story isn't a game changing new story but it was amazing I would love to give it a 10 out of 10. But I will have to re-watch it 2 more times before I could do that. I only give 10s to series that I have re-watched at least 2 times.But I do know for certain within the next few months I will be watching this series again. I don't want to ruin anything so watch the series.Sound: 10/10 I guess I don't really care. It could be mute and I would still watch. But it was good. I am eagerly awaiting the dub though.Art: 10/10 It is Ufotable if it wasn't a 10 that would be a surprise.Enjoyment: 10/10 Through the roof through the sky and surpassed my expectations.

Back when Apocrypha came out, I described it as a love letter to the entirety of the Fate canon. In contrast, I believe that Lord El Melloi II and his case notes are its shadow. And a shadow aware of its existence as such.A war survivor following after the shadow of a king long gone, not one, but two different shadows of kings, dreaming with the shadow of a love they assume unattainable, yet worth fighting for. Lingering shadows from time past, and the looming...shadows of the fights yet to come. Its no surprise that little Waver became a detective, living his entire life looking for a light amidst such shadows.Even the production of this show seemed aware of the legacy they had been granted the opportunity to belong to, and saw themselves as working under the shadow of a giant. I believe that is why, given the chance to create original stories for the start of this adventure, all they conjured up were shadows of other tales, past, present and future.Nearly all entries in the remaining fate lore end up touched in some way by the shadow of this work, and in that sense, it achieves the greatest peek any shadow could aspire to: tracing the limits of the light that spawned it.This show was a shadow of all that I loved from the Fate universe, and in that, I cannot hate it in the ways it is cast over such love. shadows of the fights yet to come.

What\'s left of it?Well, the art\'s great and polished like one would come to expect from the fate franchise at this point. The sound is eh...I don\'t think any insert theme stuck out, though the voice acting was definitely not bad (Waver\'s last line is so well voice-acted that it almost got me to bump the sound a little higher) and the intro was decently...catchy. Nothing atrocious there. Character-wise, there\'s variety and expression, and while basically none of them had development, one did have some: Waver himself. Still, the way every character is portrayed is certainly colorful but also so very... \'anime\'. There are complex characters that express themselves normally, trope characters that express themselves entirely through anime gestures, and then there is this weird thing this show has which characters which do have complexity yet seem to express themselves entirely through anime phrases and expressions. It\'s hard to explain, and I don\'t entirely hate it, but does hinder a bit their chances of development throughout.With this said, the show seemed like it was designed (again, still ignoring the mystery part) by someone under the premise of a bet of how many fate references can we stick in one show. These come in two times: a stream of exposition about random trivia on fate and niche mythology facts, and more direct references like character cameos and its very own saberface (come and get your own for just 298 Yen!). They are mostly integrated with the story and definitely get to show their cool side in a way that I hadn\'t seen or hadn\'t seen enough of in other fate properties. As for the lore dumps...This is where we bring back the mystery element, because ""Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note"", DEFINITELY wants to be a mystery show, it makes no secret of it. It employs a very traditional mystery structure including straight up using the formulas for a couple of mystery classical set-ups. It also continually uses thoses ""whydunit"" and ""whodunit"" and so on..phrases. I think I made my point there. The show, on the other hand, completely misses the point (of a mystery).L.E.M.II.S.N.J: R.Z.G.N. wants to be a mystery, however it botches the most basic elements of what makes a good mystery. The show always centers its mysteries on elements of the nasuverse lore, sprinkled with a few random mythology facts or rumors to make itself seem more clever. However, either it assumes the audience is informed of these things, or it doesn\'t want the audience to be able to follow along with the plot until things are resolved by our protagonist in the end.I repeat: this show fails at the most basic elements of a mystery. Sheer curiosity might generate a bit of intrigue for you, but I\'m not genuinely going to be questioning myself about how something is done if the answer is always going to be \'magic\' and the only reason I have to think any of what I\'m seeing on screen is at all odd, out of place or ""mysterious"" is because characters state it. Nor will I ask myself ""who did it"" once I learn that they can pull a new potential perpetrator out of their ass without ever introducing them.It\'s impossible to follow along with the gathering of clues and trying to guess, as even if you are the most hardcore fan of fate lore, you still need to know basically everything about every mythology in the world to be able to guess the answer to some of these questions- when they are even answered. Throwing dice to see who might have done is about as reliable as trying to do it yourself and since the answer is often something out of the blue without any basis on what came before it, it\'s hard to even be surprised by it.And of course, there\'s the resolution of the mystery itself, which as already mentioned a few times is often pulled out of the writer\'s ass and while it does tie the threads together, we need Waver to explain how. Through exposition, sorry, MORE exposition.All the explaining bogs down the pace of the shown and what action there is isn\'t executed all that well either most of the time, with tension being constantly undercut by random spells of unpredicatble nature at best, and pseudo-philosophical concepts that sound like a kid who thinks using bigger words will win them the argument.If I had to boil down the problems with the plot down to one single thing, this is what it would be: The complete inconsistency of the nasuverse\'s rules creates a disconnect between the set ups an pay-offs in this show. It thinks that by being fate it can keep you excited as long as it is pulling stuff from the fateverse, that you will feel it is earned as long as its coming from that fandom universe. It thinks that you will be happy with the explaining as long as it is referencing something from fate, that you will be happy with any way for the plot to be resolved as long as it is somewhat tied to fate, that any characters just needs to belong to fate to be interesting. Because of that, it can\'t make good set ups and payoffs, which means it does a horrible job as a mystery, which in turn really stands out because it sells itself as a mystery show.Despite all of this, I still found myself entertained by the show, and it was one of my favorites to accompany weekly. I was always eager to see the latest episode when they came out. However, I was still bothered by how cheaply they used fate\'s content, and it put a bad mark for me on what the show is without the awesome concept of the holy grail war at its back. catchy.

Secondly It didn't feel like a fate series, it was more like a detective/mystery show. The start was good but after a while its alright but nothing interesting was happening anyways. I would recommend watching the first episode if you are a fan of Waver or want more Waver content but anything after that is not worth it.Lets talk about the other things about the show- Character: 3/10Design...of most characters were amazing, making them feel like an actual worth/likeable character was not.- Story: 3/10The train arcs probably the only good part of the story which is episode 7 and later- Sound: 8/10Nice soundtracks- Enjoyment: 3/10Not a lot to enjoy of most characters were amazing, making them feel like an actual worth/likeable character was not.- Story: 3/10The train arcs probably the only good part of the story which is episode 7 and later- Sound: 8/10Nice soundtracks- Enjoyment: 3/10Not a lot to enjoy"", ""Remember that one retarded kid from Fate/Zero? Waver Velvet? I do. He was probably the reason why I enjoyed Fate/Zero less. I don’t like his character. I don’t like it at all. So what is he up to now? Well...He became a Lord of the clock tower. He turned more mature, grew, and now he looks even better than his old self.This show is pretty much about the after story of Waver Velvet. “The Conan of The Fate Series, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo : Rail Zeppelin Grace Note.”Honestly, this show wouldn’t be as fun as is if Gray wasn’t there....Gray - the descendant of Saber, Lord El-Melloi II’s assistant and student. She pretty much carries about ⅓ of the show by simply just showing off her Noble Phantasm.The “mystery” thingies aren’t too bad but they’re also quite bland.

Gosh. Fuck me, man. They were so cringe. Agh. I can’t. I. I just can’t.Other than that, it’s pretty cool to see how much Waver grew and how he’s following Alexander's ambition.

It’s also pretty cool to see a relative of Saber who can use a Noble Phantasm."", 'For Want of a Nail...Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is really a who\'s who of Fate characters especially if you\'d seen OR played from the Fate franchise but for the most part it focuses on Waver Velvet or Lord El-Melloi II taking on supernatural cases while still being a teacher in the Clock Tower. It\'s not until halfway that the ""Rail Zeppelin"" comes into play and gives us an entire arc which focuses on Waver\'s main focus and goal come into play.So for the first half of the anime, we see Lord El-Melloi (can we just call him Waver from...this point?) takes on isolated supernatural cases. The only thing these separate cases does is to introduce characters, be it cameos from previous Fate installments or show off what the ""Waver team"" can do while tackling the supernatural case, he of course has some rivals like Hishiri Adashino voiced by Yuko Minaguchi an officer of the department of Policies of the Clock Tower and is the polar opposite in terms of investigations thus her clash with Waver.The second half is a little more focused and changes the plot structure to be more like an arc focusing on Waver\'s prized possession of Iskander\'s cloth being stolen and this thief now boarded the ""Rail Zeppelin"", something like a ghost train to the dead BUT holds an invitational auction selling and ""buying"" Mystic Eyes and it\'s up to Waver to find the thief and of course...murders and strange occurrence happen while on board. This arc does by all means gives us alot of development of Waver as well as his apprentice Gray voiced by Reina Ueda but once again gives us even more cameos from other installment as well as those cameos doing thing sin the background that has links to all the incidents happening in Rail Zeppelin.Waver and his want of a nail is pondered as well as tested against with the thief and the strange occurrences in this arc while Gray having a mild crush on her master while other characters test and is intrigued by her ""status"" is brought upon as well. In terms of characters...most of the main cast is developed and a bit fleshed out but oddly enough LA\'s favourite character is actually a cameo character from a previous Fate installment..that of the wrestling Mage Luviagelita Edelfelt voiced by Shizuka Ito from both Fate Illya and Fate stay night unlimited Blade Works, she was just a fun character and Reines El-Melloi voiced by Inori Minase was similar to Luvia as well as always was interesting when she was on screen.Now as for the mystery element of this anime, well it\'s mixed to say the least mainly for the fact that the first half\'s isolated mysteries don\'t give us the audience much if any hints and how the mystery unravels itself is all kept until the end with Waver\'s deductions thus we can\'t really connect with these mysteries as well, the only exception for LA being the shopping mall mystery as the hints were there. As for the Rail Zeppelinn arc, well since it\'s an arc with tons of foreshowing as to who the culprit of the entire installment is, the mystery though rather convoluted since the mystery tries to bring light to MAGIC but for what\'s it\'s worth they didn\'t exactly handwave it away...but likely will confuse you with the magic mumbo jumbo and how it all connects, the mystery at worst is confusing, at best is barely manageable as a mystery and of course Waver has EVERYTHING prepared and hid it away from the audience until it\'s needed. So yeah the mystery element to say is mixed and it doesn\'t do the anime any favours and much like Higurashi trying to unravel magical phenomenons into rational real notions killed the mystery, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note does it to try and enrich the Fate lore but at the expense of making a rather magical mystery even more magically confusing....it\'s Fate guys...it\'s Fate.If your wondering how many installments have links and cameos to Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note...well Fate Zero, Fate stay night Unlimited Blade Works, Fate Apocrypha and Fate Grand Order and no you DON\'T need to watch these in order to understand what\'s going on in Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note, though it more or less hints that THEIR roles from that installment in question instead. In a ways it seems that Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is like a codex for the Fate franchise to keep up to speed with the Fate lore or know more about it.The animation done by TROYCA was actually very well done, form the crisp character designs to the great backgrounding as well as the magical effects of this anime was great in all respects. Even though Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is something of a spinoff from the Fate franchise, TROYCA still put in the leg work in terms of animation.As for the voice cast..well we have a large cast but LA might as well do the standouts MVP\'s and for LA...Shizuka Ito as Luvia (of course), Reina Ueda as Gray, Inori Minase as Reines, Yuko Minaguchi as Hishiri and finally Daisuke Namikawa as Waver.As for the final villain, he DOES tie things not only the Rail Zeppelin arc but some of the isolated mysteries as the man behind the man in orchestrating everything and thus the rest of the final episodes of the Rail Zeppellin focuses on stopping the final villain, he or more or less his Servant, Hephaestion is actually the more interesting villain oddly enough all due to her screentime and presences all the while the final villain is the cackling ""world dominating"" villain that Waver needs to take care off, while Gray fighting Hephaestion is the highlight of the Rail Zeppelin arc.If anything along with what LA thinks that Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is a codex for the Fate franchise, LA ALSO thinks this will maybe\' get people up to date for the Fate installment coming up, mostly Fate Grand Order Camelot and Babylonia...but that just may have been LA.LA thinks Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note tried to be so many things at once, one part magical mystery anime, one part Waver\'s story after Fate/Zero and one part a codex for Fate and became a jumbled mess of what it really wanted to be and let\'s not get started on the mystery element that did itself no favours. If this was JUST an anime about Waver wanting to reunite with Iskander then it\'ll be fine heck throw in the mysteries in but when it tries to be a pseudo Holy Grail War while being in a murder mystery genre then LA thinks Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note failed to notice what it was trying to be, it crossed the boundary if anything. Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note was a jumbled mess of a mystery anime but an even bigger crisis of having an identity and piggybacking off Waver to achieve it\'s overly complex convoluting confusing plot.Waver deserved better... this point?) takes on isolated supernatural cases. The only thing these separate cases does is to introduce characters, be it cameos from previous Fate installments or show off what the ""Waver team"" can do while tackling the supernatural case, he of course has some rivals like Hishiri Adashino voiced by Yuko Minaguchi an officer of the department of Policies of the Clock Tower and is the polar opposite in terms of investigations thus her clash with Waver.The second half is a little more focused and changes the plot structure to be more like an arc focusing on Waver\'s prized possession of Iskander\'s cloth being stolen and this thief now boarded the ""Rail Zeppelin"", something like a ghost train to the dead BUT holds an invitational auction selling and ""buying"" Mystic Eyes and it\'s up to Waver to find the thief and of course...murders and strange occurrence happen while on board. This arc does by all means gives us alot of development of Waver as well as his apprentice Gray voiced by Reina Ueda but once again gives us even more cameos from other installment as well as those cameos doing thing sin the background that has links to all the incidents happening in Rail Zeppelin.Waver and his want of a nail is pondered as well as tested against with the thief and the strange occurrences in this arc while Gray having a mild crush on her master while other characters test and is intrigued by her ""status"" is brought upon as well. In terms of characters...most of the main cast is developed and a bit fleshed out but oddly enough LA\'s favourite character is actually a cameo character from a previous Fate installment..that of the wrestling Mage Luviagelita Edelfelt voiced by Shizuka Ito from both Fate Illya and Fate stay night unlimited Blade Works, she was just a fun character and Reines El-Melloi voiced by Inori Minase was similar to Luvia as well as always was interesting when she was on screen.Now as for the mystery element of this anime, well it\'s mixed to say the least mainly for the fact that the first half\'s isolated mysteries don\'t give us the audience much if any hints and how the mystery unravels itself is all kept until the end with Waver\'s deductions thus we can\'t really connect with these mysteries as well, the only exception for LA being the shopping mall mystery as the hints were there. As for the Rail Zeppelinn arc, well since it\'s an arc with tons of foreshowing as to who the culprit of the entire installment is, the mystery though rather convoluted since the mystery tries to bring light to MAGIC but for what\'s it\'s worth they didn\'t exactly handwave it away...but likely will confuse you with the magic mumbo jumbo and how it all connects, the mystery at worst is confusing, at best is barely manageable as a mystery and of course Waver has EVERYTHING prepared and hid it away from the audience until it\'s needed. So yeah the mystery element to say is mixed and it doesn\'t do the anime any favours and much like Higurashi trying to unravel magical phenomenons into rational real notions killed the mystery, Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note does it to try and enrich the Fate lore but at the expense of making a rather magical mystery even more magically confusing....it\'s Fate guys...it\'s Fate.If your wondering how many installments have links and cameos to Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note...well Fate Zero, Fate stay night Unlimited Blade Works, Fate Apocrypha and Fate Grand Order and no you DON\'T need to watch these in order to understand what\'s going on in Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note, though it more or less hints that THEIR roles from that installment in question instead. In a ways it seems that Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is like a codex for the Fate franchise to keep up to speed with the Fate lore or know more about it.The animation done by TROYCA was actually very well done, form the crisp character designs to the great backgrounding as well as the magical effects of this anime was great in all respects. Even though Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is something of a spinoff from the Fate franchise, TROYCA still put in the leg work in terms of animation.As for the voice cast..well we have a large cast but LA might as well do the standouts MVP\'s and for LA...Shizuka Ito as Luvia (of course), Reina Ueda as Gray, Inori Minase as Reines, Yuko Minaguchi as Hishiri and finally Daisuke Namikawa as Waver.As for the final villain, he DOES tie things not only the Rail Zeppelin arc but some of the isolated mysteries as the man behind the man in orchestrating everything and thus the rest of the final episodes of the Rail Zeppellin focuses on stopping the final villain, he or more or less his Servant, Hephaestion is actually the more interesting villain oddly enough all due to her screentime and presences all the while the final villain is the cackling ""world dominating"" villain that Waver needs to take care off, while Gray fighting Hephaestion is the highlight of the Rail Zeppelin arc.If anything along with what LA thinks that Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note is a codex for the Fate franchise, LA ALSO thinks this will maybe\' get people up to date for the Fate installment coming up, mostly Fate Grand Order Camelot and Babylonia...but that just may have been LA.LA thinks Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note tried to be so many things at once, one part magical mystery anime, one part Waver\'s story after Fate/Zero and one part a codex for Fate and became a jumbled mess of what it really wanted to be and let\'s not get started on the mystery element that did itself no favours. If this was JUST an anime about Waver wanting to reunite with Iskander then it\'ll be fine heck throw in the mysteries in but when it tries to be a pseudo Holy Grail War while being in a murder mystery genre then LA thinks Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note failed to notice what it was trying to be, it crossed the boundary if anything. Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note was a jumbled mess of a mystery anime but an even bigger crisis of having an identity and piggybacking off Waver to achieve it\'s overly complex convoluting confusing plot.Waver deserved better...', ""Awww! What a shame! I was so hyped by the idea of a miniseries that was cannon and followed Waver Velvet from Fate/Zero.A nice little detective show with more background on the clock tower and characterization; no need for much fighting, just cool deductions and Waver being Waver and squeeaaa! ^_^And y'know Waver was real cool. Glad to have his original voice actor back. It's amazing to hear him do the old-Waver (very fitting), but also still be able to do the young version every now and then where needed. I also love Waver as a character. He's bitter, filled with regret and guilt, hard...to make friends with, calculating - but when you do get close, he's a real nice guy who's trying to do the right thing. So much so, he takes on debts that aren't even his'! And I love how he solves his (and others') issues.But!In the end, the show didn't work for me. Art and sound was fine. Loved Waver and accepted Gray. I enjoyed it somewhat just because I crave Fate, but I also missed a whole bunch.Basically, the crimes are too convoluted or filled with mumbo-jumbo that I just don't get any of it. Maybe I'm just dumb; but it feels like the show expects you to know the entire nasuverse, high-end astrology, and a whole bunch of weird rituals to have just a vague idea on what's going on.I didn't understand the villain or his plot, I didn't understand the fights, I didn't understand the motives or methods, I didn't understand the noble phantasm, none of it. And that made it all just a blur..On top of that, most characters aren't great. For one, I think the show expects you to have seen several spinoff series, or otherwise be heavily invested in Fate/Grand Order and the like. I recognized a few characters, but most I didn't. And all of them get far too little time, so that I don't know who they are, or their motivations, or really get a feel for them. Which is a shame, because some of them had real promise. I liked the 'filler' episode in the mall, which actually focuses on the three girls hanging out, and allowing us to get to know them. Wish there was more than that!Finally Gray - she's a new character and she's a Saber-lookalike because reasons. Now, the reasons are actually fine enough, with a bit of head-cannon. I also think she's different enough as a character, to actually be a character. That said, I think she had more potential. I feel like she was only there because we needed another Saber-face, and some action scenes. But I think there was no need for the weird fights, and thus no need for her. If only there was more time!She's pretty cool tho.So yeah! Waver's cool. If you're a total fan and/or you know everything about F/GO and all that stuff, go for it! But I can't advise it as a standalone series, to my sadness. :'( to make friends with, calculating - but when you do get close, he's a real nice guy who's trying to do the right thing.

But I can't advise it as a standalone series, to my sadness. :'("", ""When I first saw the announcement of this anime, I was absolutely ecstatic.  Waver Velvet  and Rider were my favorite pair in Fate Stay Zero, which also happens to be one of my highest rated anime to date.  The possibilities of what one could do with his character as an adult seemed endless.  Sadly, The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II only serves as a continuation of the downfall of what was once revered as one of the greatest series of anime.How do you take one of the best characters from arguable the best Fate series to...date and get such a bland result?  Well apparently you do it by giving more screen time to a Loli than your actual main character and using plot devices so convoluted that it sounds like characters are just making them up as you go.Let's begin with the characters.The anime was suppose to feature Waver, serving as a magical detective, solving cases in an almost Sherlock Holmes style while still dealing with the lost of his partner, Rider.  However, for one of the most developed characters from Fate Zero, it feels like the writers didn't know what to do with Waver.  While he certainly has some development towards the end of the Anime, it falls shallow when compared to his young self.  The first couple of episodes featuring him started out very strong, but then we get to a main issue of the anime; Grey.Grey is a shy, enigmatic girl who for some reason bears and uncanny resemblance to Saber of the original series.  She has an undying loyalty to Waver and despite being a butt kicking, scythe wielding warrior, suffers from low self esteem.  Grey very much steals the show, with the mysteries of her and her attachment to the main character never being fully explored unless you want to rely on Wikipedia.  While not necessarily a bad character, she was mostly an unnecessary one, and felt like little more than a Loli trope.After Grey and Waver, you have the rest of the cast who for the most part had little presence and didn't feel as if they fulfilled much roles in the series.  Now I did enjoy Waver's new little sister, Reines.  Her methods of tormenting Waver in a comedic fashion never ceased to give me a chuckle.  Also, seeing Kairi from Fate Apocrypha was an absolute treat.  I also enjoyed Waver's rivalry with Hishiri Adashino, although it was never fully explored.The rest of the characters fall flat.  You have the stereotypical Loli number #2 who's goal is to just get Waver to bang her despite there being a 15 year difference.  Then there are a pair twin boys serving as Waver's students whose main shtick is just fighting over Grey's attention.  Even the main villain you barely ever see or learn much of.As far as Plot, the first half of the series focuses on Waver solving mysterious.  This is certainly the strongest part of the show.  However, even here there is a major issue, and that is the crimes always involve magic, and the magic system is never fully explained in the anime.  A good mystery leaves the audience guessing who committed the crime.  However, due to having one of the loosest magical systems I've seen in anime, it's impossible for the audience to actual predict where the show will take them.  The end of each case simply involves our main hero listing pieces of evidence to the audience that we have little to no way of fully understanding due to the lack of understanding how the world itself works.The second half of the show features a single, ongoing missions where a Waver's last piece of Rider was stolen from him, and now they have to follow clues to determine the main culprit and stop his plan.  Sadly, the issues mentioned earlier in this review are all more prevalent in the second half forcing me to lose interest in the show all together.The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II had the potential to be a top notch Anime, focusing on an already strong developed character, and watching him continue to grow while solving mysterious of a magical world.  It could have brought the series's focus on  moral ideals and what it means to be a hero to another level.  Instead the anime falls victim to the same issues as recent Fate series; forgetting its true roots and instead using main-stream cliche's and tropes in an attempt to retain its popularity. date and get such a bland result?

I mean that half sarcastically, everyone knows Fate at this point however that\'s only what draws people in. What keeps them are well developed characters and/or amazing visuals and battles. El-Melloi does both of these well, with a lot of visual and lighting effects that come off pretty well in most fights(a noticeable lack of CGI which I always love), and I genuinely want to see the development of the cast of characters. Waver returns from Fate/Zero in a strong upfront drive: to make his...king proud. The giant arc of his development is him trying to find what his liege from Fate/Zero would want him to do to further their goals. It\'s honest in the simplicity of what Waver needs, yet still touches on so many magical concepts that the main series\' never really have time to delve in to. Although it is based on a game, the thought that went into the series seems further than a cash grab (I\'m looking at Fate Apochraphya), yet it still saves time by introducing typical characters that have appeared in much more than this single anime (i.e. Luvia, Waver, a Sabre-knock off, etc.). Truth be told, I kept telling my roommate ""Yeah I\'m just watching Sherlock Holmes but if it was a fate anime,"" and I really mean that. The sense of mystery and intrigue that goes around the entire Clock Tower is engrossing. In fact, for most this is the first real look at the Clock Tower politics besides some small ending bits from UBW. Overall, this series is just a really nice tie-together between Fate/Zero and Fate/SN to really establish why the Grail War was so small in future, or why so many families were apathetic towards another so soon. If you\'ve invested heavy time into the Fate series, ""Lord El-Melloi II Sei no Jikenbo: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note"" is a great way to fill the void between now and the third Fate Heaven\'s Feel movie. king proud.

Even though the characters seem distinct enough, the series\' entire \'atmosphere\' feels a little more muted than usual.◧ Soundtrack: seems to be, mostly, comprised of orchestral music (violins, violas, percussion, flute, piano, etc.) with some of it being lower in...tempo, while other pieces are more upbeat. Also, I\'ve noticed a track or two having Middle Easterninfluences.◧ Concept: this may have been the first spin-off work that overtly displaces the Fate franchise\'s general premise, that magicians are searching for the omnipotent magical artifact called ""Holy Grail"" by summoning Heroic Spirits and fighting it out, in favor of a detective story in the Holmesian tradition early on, and in the Poirotian tradition later on.✘Negative Aspects✘◧ Plot: there\'s not much to speak off. The first 6 episodes are stand-alone, clearly meant to introduce as to the way the protagonistic duo go about their way, while the next 6 episode constitutes a narrative, sort of. Even though I am fairly acquainted with the franchise, this spin-off introduced so many new elements that I did not manage to grasp them all in their entirety, since I\'ve finished the series with quite a few questions.◧ Character development: once again, there\'s not much to speak of. Even though the series uses the first 6 episodes to introduce as to the protagonists and deuteragonists, and their way of living, there\'s only a depiction of their character traits and temperament without anything substantial. Further into the series, there is some biographical information given but it is quite limited and somewhat perplexing.◧ Action sequences: since the importance of fighting is downgraded and is substituted by Holmesian detective work, it\'s no surprise that the action scenes are generic, mostly based on a third-person camera perspective.  There are few quick zoom-ins/outs, no alternating between different camera \'heights\' during battle, and certainly no Michael Bay-influenced, heavily distorted & slowed down sound effects at the beginning of and moments before the impact of high-energy attacks (which are no more than a handful).Overall: A combination of multiple deuteragonists with both heroic and villainous qualities, along with countless, new story elements and a significant reduction of action scenes in favor of the detectivization of the story, makes for a very substandard end-result.P.S.

Unfortunately, as a show it doesn't work strongly on its own as the gravity of Waver's situation is only felt through having experienced Fate/Zero. Despite it, the show does still feed the audience bits and explanations for Waver and Gray's backstory and intentionally shows us the meaning behind their struggles.In its own conception, Waver Velvet aka Lord El Melloi II, has his own baggage and potential for growth. It is without a doubt one of Type-Moon's better written characters as he has his...weaknesses, his goals and self-awareness. There are many themes that are thrown around Waver's characterization. He struggles to become a better Magus due to his own natural limitations, but has talents that lie elsewhere. Namely his detective work within the magus world, as well as being able to gather the talented and teach them. This parallels Iskandar's ability to gather followers, hence why Iskandar saw such great potential. Waver is a relatable character that struggles against the unattainable while being very well aware of it. The show itself is more a character study on Waver's lingering feelings after Fate/Zero. He struggles with his regrets, and he essentially grieves for the Iskandar that accompanied him in the events of Fate/Zero.Gray is our female lead, although a saberface-meme by the definition of the Fate fandom, she stands apart with her personality. She is our sheltered character who struggles to find her own purpose in relation to Waver; paralleling Waver's own struggle to find his own purpose despite his own failings. Manufactured/crafted in order to recreate King Arthur in form, she was saved from that existence by Waver and given the opportunity to find her place in the world at his side.Each episode initially feels episodic, but it eventually shows its hand that it's been building upon each other. The show, or even the series itself borrows heavily on Sherlock Holmes. Adashino as an unromantic Irene Addler, Gray as a sheltered Watson. Doctor Heartless as Moriarty.The animation is without a doubt remarkable, considering that it's helmed by TROYCA, a studio partially founded by one of the original directors of Fate/Zero(at the time he was with UFOtable). Sound and music are irreproachable. The OP's sequence, although not a vocal song, is reminiscent to a James Bond film's opening sequence. ASCA's Hibari for the ending song is a soothing ballad, that represents well Gray's fragile nature.What stands out for this anime is Reina Ueda's voice acting for Gray as it highlights her vulnerability very well. It is easy to forget all the saberface jokes and all the plot points that demonstrate her connection to Arturia/Saber, considering how well they set her personality apart, especially with the emphasis put on by the voice actress.Overall, it's great for a Fate fan, as it does tease bits of lore such as mystic eyes, overlaps/alternate with certain elements from Fate/Apocrypha. (For example Caules from Apocrypha is present and is the heir to his family earlier than the events of Apocrypha). It is however not a high paced anime, and therefore it is not for everyone. Being someone who doesn't usually read Light Novels, the show does entice me to want to read the original source of the Lord El Melloi II's Case Files series. weaknesses, his goals and self-awareness.

It is set in present day, yet the visuals & attire feel Victorian - suitable to a Sherlock Holmes feel.I was also captured by the idea of Sherlock Holmes operating in the world of magic. I am a big Holmes fan. And the adult Waver character captured many Holmes-isms (tall, dark, slender, brooding but given to sudden intense outbursts, a lot going on under the surface, more concerned about the case than his personal safety), but was still obviously its own character, not a mere...copy.I felt the plot was interesting enough.

My review will not satisfy people who want that kind of review. It is more of a review to see after you\'re already done with the show and more. I will have some concrete things to say and a lot of opinions based on feelings, but I expect every single person who reads my take on CF...anime series to finish not only the anime, but a hell of a lot more.Story: -/10Characters: -/10Animation: 8/10Music: 8/10Enjoyment: -/10Overall: 5/10Many aspects of this are wildly different depending on the episode and I can\'t give this thing a more precise rating. But even being very generous with my rating, 5/10 is the absolute maximum overall score I can give it for now. You should not watch this show if you haven\'t read the source material and then some. You have been warned.I\'ve searched for any novel readers having the same impression on the show as me in the review section, but couldn\'t find anything sufficient. This review will probably be boring at first, as I like having everyone who reads this being completely in tune, and understanding where the nuance in my experience may lie to the best of my ability without spending too much time as my big handicap. Thus, I\'ll be repeating my path through the Nasuverse as many times as it takes on each review that I feel needs it.Now, without being overly detailed about everything and without including nearly any databooks or bonus stuff that does not seem to be overly-relevant, an oversimplified part of my journey that\'s relevant to Case files looks something like what you see below. I\'m sure the ones who ""know"" will understand my reasoning instantly as well as some potential flaws near the end of this path.

(future me isn’t relevant here, but it might change)Honestly, even with this I don\'t have as much to say about the show as I would\'ve liked to because it was set-up wrong from the get-go. This review will be interconnected with my light novel and manga experience. It\'s a core component to any introspective source material fan reviewing adaptations and is pretty important.FINAL SPOILER WARNING: I will spoil things from all over the place, beyond the anime, and beyond just CF novel series. You have been warned.Before even watching the show, I already had tremendous issues with the anime just adapting volume 4-5, but tried to stay open-minded as usual. And at first, my impression on the show from episodes 0-1 were pretty positive, despite some of my issues. It was really interesting to see how the anime can handle Case Files in animation. How will the presence of visuals, voice acting, music, and generally anything outside of Gray\'s (and sometimes Reines\') perspective will affect the feeling of everything? It was fun at first because I could tell that despite clearly getting a wildly different vibe from the novel I could find enjoyment in this anyway. I liked the vibe of this show\'s music (made from the same person responsible for KnK OST), I really liked OP/ED to the point of ED becoming one of my favorites among any Nasuverse anime titles pretty quickly. I consider the casting choices to be perfect for everyone except maybe Yvette and Hishiri. That first potential exception is somewhat debatable because she was meant to be annoying to some extent in the novel, but I cannot express how much I started hating her guts after she was given this voice here and it made me actually dislike her a lot when the Rail Zeppelin arc was taking place (which is unusual for me after not having any issues with her in the novel). My dislike for Hishiri\'s voice may seem a bit dumb, especially how it seems to fit her description from the novel, but I\'m just really tired of this overly onee-san voice and it just annoyed me the whole way through. But alright, enough about the voices. I didn\'t mind episode 0 being focused on the cat incident only very briefly mentioned in the very first page of volume 1. There was an image of a dead cat at the very beginning, and then Gray and Luvia were talking about Waver where one single line about the cat popped up (or something along those lines). They made an episode out of just that. Which is cool and all, but it sneakily started this tendency within me where I question many of this extra stuff with a ""why?"" when we could\'ve had a normal full adaptation instead. I tried to be thankful that we got any Case files anime at all, and this mindset is honestly the only reason I switched my decently long-lasted rating of 4/10 into 5 after finishing the last episodes. But I digress. My experience with episode 1 is a bit complicated to explain, but overall I was fascinated with it as a novel reader. Reading that scene of Waver meeting with Reines for the first time at the start of volume 2 from Reines\' POV was undoubtedly better than in the more basic way the anime did it. The anime changed up young Reines’ design by shortening her dress, giving it frills, and having Reines shorter haircut. And when I was watching the scene, I found myself liking it more than the illustration of her in the same scene from the novel or in that Fate/Zero: Another Epilogue chapter (even if it was a bit closer to the novel than the anime design-wise and with more bits from the novel preserved in general). The anime may have been basic in a lot of ways (without having the luxury to go into things deeper due to the format of anime restricting it somewhat) and the pacing of the episode split the scene into 2 parts with the Waver traveling and meeting Melvin part in-between, but I liked this approach. I also found the changes to the way Waver gets interrogated in this version pretty amusing. Having Waver be upside down and the guards shaking him around is a silly devious thing that Reines may come up with if she were to feel particularly impish and childish (the new design helps with that feeling too, so good job). I liked how the anime did it with what it had, basically. Now, the Fate/Zero manga, on the other hand, took a more comical approach and the peculiar artstyle of it helped a lot for the situation to feel very lighthearted compared to every other version of this scene, and I liked it in its own way, too. All 4 iterations of their meeting scene do their job well in very different ways and are all welcome additions. But I’m unsure if any of them work quite as well as the novel. In the novel it was very expository (which is exactly what we needed and waited for after that first volume), introspective, and with a certain vibe to it that only really was felt in the Case files manga adaptation of the scene. In that manga, this scene was handled as perfectly as it could be in the visual medium without going full light novel. Definitely was the second best version of the scene after the LN (it was even better than the original in some instances). I may have liked the visual and directorial approach of the anime version of the scene, but Case files manga made me truly understand why the first intended Reines’ design from that novel illustration works the best, after all (especially with the content of the novel), and why having very little of Reines goofing around in that situation was superior in the narrative compared to her feeling a bit too childish in the Zero version and to a lesser extent in the anime. Reines may like to do a little trolling and can be silly at times, but she is also supposed to be very mature and reserved for her age due to all of the bullshit she had to go through like having to be a target for assainations and such. This duality is pretty much what makes up Reines’ personality. She is much cuter in the anime and you can argue she looks better there visually in some aspects, but the manga handles her much better in that core aspect of her character visually than anywhere else. We see less of her being exaggerated and more ’real’ in the novel and the manga thanks to the knowledge of what Reines was thinking about during this ‘heartwarming’ episode and pretty much every time we have the narrative switch to her perspective. It doesn’t take much to realize how much better this introduction was for Reines in the novel and the CF manga compared to the anime and Zero manga, so I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed by the thought of people seeing those versions first instead of the superior ones (although ofc no one’s reading Zero manga’s version first normally unless they know Japanese or something, so realistically it’s mostly the anime I’m a bit concerned about). That’s nearly all my thoughts on the topic of the ‘Reines meeting Waver’ prologue, but I have one more thing to say before moving on. Having this prologue scene interrupted by Waver traveling and then having our first young Melvin meeting all in one episode is quite awesome. If not to at least just know how both may affect the story and my experience in general (granted, I can\'t really ever know how it feels like for anime-only people, but oh well, you can\'t have it all). When we finish with Melvin scenes and go back to finish up with the second part of Reines meeting, the coat transition into Iskander’s at the end is just awesome and with that short montage stuff the ending of episode 1 is pretty great. Really makes you wonder if it would be better for someone to skip episode 0 or not, even if it came out earlier than this episode or not. Anime-only experience must be super weird as usual and it is quite amusing to think about. But of course, I would never advocate CF anime or this point in the story being your first time meeting Reines or Melvin. I’d rather most people read the novel or try the manga (there’s really not enough manga translations, though). You can already imagine by how long it took us in the novel or the manga to see that Reines meeting scene and even more so meeting Melvin for the first time properly in the later volumes just how ridiculously fucked this anime had to be paced to make up for the number of episodes or a limited production or whatever the hell was the reason behind it. Part of the reason for some of the directorial moves is simply the format of an anime being different from the novel, but a lot of the scenes in the manga prove it could still be made work well in the anime if they maintained similar pacing and the core structure of the novel without jumping around to the 3rd arc straight away. In that aspect alone this anime deserves the spot of the worst Nasuverse anime. Starting off, it\'s already wildly different from anything we\'ve seen in the Nasuverse and not in a good way. We\'ve had a lot of wild shit happen here: from KnK 6 being simply ridiculous as an adaptation, HF3 anime ending section being very unfriendly to the anime-only Fate fans, Zero anime being a menace to every OG novel reader fan out there for being a normie magnet, Deen Fate route mixing shenanigans, Deen UBW being a fun scene compilation movie and nothing more, ufotable’s UBW changes lessening Illya’s character +spoiling Zero +""hidden"" stuff for those who played FHA and CCC (and have read Case files), Prototype OVA being a thing to mald over never being a full anime, Prillya anime being Prillya anime, random FGO animes that somehow are watched by the people who’ve never played FGO, Tsukihime anime actually existing, one of the most reference-heavy titles like FSF becoming an anime, and up until Last Encore being so unfathomably based most cannot understand it (much less enjoy). This CF anime is the only one that went as far as just starting in the literal middle of the story and not finishing it because the story was never meant to be consumed separately from the novel. CF anime tried to do it anyway, and it reminded me of the Canaan anime situation where the core part of the story was already told in Shibuya Scramble. But that didn’t start in the middle of the story, instead after it was done already. The only difference between CF and Canaan anime is that the latter wasn’t trying to adapt anything and instead was serving as a largely redundant product that only served to make the original source look worse by having this unnecessary thing attached to it (even if having more Type-Moon content isn’t entirely unwelcome). CF was and is a LN adaptation and it tried to do this ridiculous thing. I could tolerate it with FGO anime a lot more because the source material there wasn’t a light novel and FGO in general tended to be a very flexible thing to adapt compared to something like Case files. And currently, having parts of FGO’s first arc adapted/interpreted through First Order, Camelot, Babylonia, and Solomon is already much better than only having Rail Zeppelin in the CF anime being the only thing adapted in the entire novel series. First Order would be an equivalent to Arda’s Castle arc and Solomon would serve as an equivalent of the final arc to Case files (Grand Roll) and we do not have either adapted in the anime form here. And while I hate that with an endless passion, I gotta admit this takes some balls. If I am really just being impatient and if CF anime really will get that final arc adapted some time later, I’ll have to take that into account later, however then you’d have the same problem as in this first CF anime with later having characters from volume 1 appearing as well as the events from all other volumes mentioned which they may even remove entirely to replace with more anime-only stuff again. That hypothetical Grand Roll anime adaptation is going to be just as weird as this one if they don’t adapt more of the previous arcs, but with just a bit more chances to be enjoyable because the whole thing with Heartless and his servant was set-up in this anime already and that’s what’s the most important. Rail Zeppelin anime overall was just not it for being a setup for CF anime series, just like the first Camelot movie was before the second one saved it from being a pure garbage adaptation or having anime-only people experiencing Babylonia arc before going through Camelot. Rail Zeppelin anime is the closest to the first Camelot movie in my earlier “FGO anime to CF anime comparison” equation. It can also be close to the latter half of Babylonia (when it started to fall off), but Camelot fits a bit more here. CF anime managed to disappoint me more than Tsukihime anime (for already having an expectation of that one being terrible) or Prillya anime (with an expectation of it simply being nothing more than a uoh joke compilation), and This CF anime is right up there with the worst of the worst for me in Nasuverse as of right now. But it can definitely change in the future more easily than the other anime I’ve mentioned could.I went off-topic for long enough with my whiny ass rants. Let’s bring some positive energy back again for a moment and remind you where we’ve left off. Episode 1 did everything well with these peculiar production circumstances. Having to see Waver travel around and get in trouble with Melvin after the 4th HGW was a great addition to this weird limited anime format they were going for as was having to see the scene of Melvin landing Waver the money animated. It was confusing when paired with the cat episode before it, but pretty good. I was now ever more hopeful to see the anime get to the arc it was supposed to adapt. But what I didn\'t take into account is something ridiculous happening like this show only having 7 episodes to adapt the entirety of the Rail Zeppelin arc in the latter half of the show with the rest of the earlier episodes being anime-only filler that blue-balls its viewers. That made me pretty freaking mad, but the first 0-1 episodes did pretty alright as far as filler-esque episodes go, so I tried to be patient. Episode 2 was when it started to go downhill. As much as having to see some random Animusphere branch family filler seems okay in vacuum or some random Clock Tower shenanigans in general, I\'d really rather not have to sit through it when I know it could\'ve been novel content instead. But the unfortunate thing here is that the overall plot doesn\'t work without this kind of tomfoolery precisely because, despite the anime being so bold with starting in the middle of the novel and even referencing stuff no anime-only watcher would know, they didn\'t want to go all the way with it. Having the viewers see this overly-complicated magecraft stuff wasn\'t as neat as in the novel and even in there it wasn\'t a particularly big reason for your enjoyment (as you can\'t truly guess anything as you would with most normal detective novels and just having to follow the flow), instead it was character interactions and the overall lore stuff. Having to see this random filler plot where anime-only people can see a fraction of this astronomical magical stuff we went through in the novels but so much worse is just irritating. It\'s obvious that the anime wanted to hit the same beats as the novel with displaying Waver\'s magical deconstruction prowess and to make callbacks to it later because they’ve decided volume 1-3 weren\'t worth its own adaptation apparently. And let me make this clear, I am super mad about CF anime not starting with volume 1 because I truly think it\'s the best starting point for the series and I have made a point to myself to re-read it alongside the manga of that arc to make this point clear to myself once and for all that anime sucks ass (trying to uncover the differences between the manga and the novel was a big W). And as a bonus, if you\'ve read just a few volumes of CF before FGO on top of Garden of Avalon, your enjoyment for Camelot will skyrocket to overshadow Babylonia in some ways. But I digress. Episode 2\'s family drama angle was very much a replacement for what would\'ve happened in Twin Towers of Iselma arc (vol 2-3) and the secret plan of the dead father becoming a culprit instead of someone present being suspected of it at first was clearly meant to be Adra Castle arc\'s replacement (vol 1) and it was all in the same episode. Next up, episode 3 actually had that random-ass Clock Tower Slice-of-Life nonsense that I wanted to see more for a long time and I enjoyed it a whole lot more than episode 2. Much of the lightheartedness here cheered me up a little and gave me some more hope for the Case files anime to turn out enjoyable by the end. Although, it irked me a little bit that Flat\'s inner character stuff was mentioned at all here. After catching up to the FSF novel, it was done and revealed so much better as it was always supposed to be truly delved into right there in FSF and nowhere else. This was why the CF novel wasn’t really keen on wanting to explore his character and why you always knew that something about him was off. You were supposed to get all of that from FSF instead of this random filler episode, and the thought of someone watching this episode before reading FSF makes me cringe deeply, even if this moment was very brief. Another thing that irked me a little bit were tiny FGO references within this episode. I did like them and I wouldn’t want them removed but at the same time it’s amusing how had I been a little more of an idiot and decided to read the novel up until vol 4-5 and went straight for the anime without catching up to FGO, I would\'ve missed out lol. This is just the nature of these easter eggs and it’s not even an issue (I just wanted to bring it that thought). Tiny pet-peeves of mine aren\'t enough to really detract from my initial enjoyment, even if I did still feel it\'d be better to focus more on the novel content instead and for these random filler-esque episodes to happen in-between instead of replacing it entirely. Episodes 4-5 were a mixed bag and they actually managed to make an anime-only filler arc on top of this already ridiculous situation Case files anime is in. But let’s start from the beginning. I like the scene of Reines and Bram (Sola-Ui\'s brother) talking about the 5th HGW for a tiny bit a whole lot, but while briefly bringing up Bazett didn’t really change anything, Altrum\'s brief presence on the photo only served to remind me that we couldn\'t have volumes 2-3 animated. Having both photos there was perfect and better than one or none, so the point is still “I like this scene”. Now about this arc thing they were trying to do. By the end of episode 4 I was so shocked and mad that those bastards included an anime-only filler arc instead of animating more of the novel, it was kinda funny. But I\'ve actually calmed down more than expected as episode 5 kept going. It\'s unclear how much different it\'d feel if I didn\'t already read LB6 and never met a Nasuverse fairy in full before (and no one would call the brief appearance of one in this episode “in full” when compared to LB6 characters), but despite the anime and volumes 8-10 coming out before LB6, I\'m still glad I\'ve read LB6 before seeing both of those (as much as that may make me more of a normie in the eyes of even more hardcore Type-Moon fans who’ve been around far longer than me) because my first experience with fairies and Albion was with Nasu\'s writing instead of Sanda and this anime (and it helped out especially a lot while reading final CF arc for obvious reasons any LB6 reader could tell you). But even with all of that, I can\'t really describe these episodes as anything but a mixed bag, yet I kinda liked them by the end to an extent. Although that brief underground graveyard tunnel stuff really reminded me of volumes 6-7 and that cool Gravekeeper, and that we can\'t have that arc animated either (lol). My mind turned out to be quite the downer this time, huh? But I couldn\'t help it. Why must this show be structured like this? Anyway, having Shishigou show up was a brilliant move I couldn\'t really expect. Actually seeing the concept of Wild Hunt being played around with in Nasuverse besides it just being contained within a physical being like a servant was very nice, and so was knowing the fact that the fairy realm can be accessed through a portal. That moment when Reines jokingly offered Waver to sleep with her with intoxicating smugness reminded me of how much I liked Reines, and by the next episode I felt she was carrying this anime. When the Rail Zeppelin arc started I felt that it was so much better with her around, too. The feeling of ""Mid (Gray) vs Kino (Reines)"" was profound at times. But it’s all in good jest, Gray is great. Although I wanted to just briefly mention how Gray\'s voice could be a bit too meek at times to the point of annoying, but as that was pretty similar to how it was supposed to be in the novel, it was absolutely spot on. Now, episode 6 was most blatantly combining the theme of beauty from vol 2-3 with the entrapment aspect from that one awesome scene from vol 1 but being way more passive in here. There\'s more at play here like Reines explaining stuff to Gray about Iskandar and Luvia wandering around the place being pretty meh and how I\'d rather see vol 1-3 animated again, but it was actually fine and I liked these calm moments with the girls together (and Reines carrying the show for a little while). It was pretty short and we\'re quickly back to where we started the episode, focusing on Iskandar\'s relic again and with the Reil Zeppelin arc about to begin (finally). And how should I put it? The Rail Zeppelin arc in this anime doesn\'t live up to the novel at all. It\'s easy to see why it failed to grab the attention of some people for me especially, because I\'m one of those people. Visually, the train and all about it was done almost perfectly and I really respect how the studio handled it, but the story here simply failed in this medium in my opinion. I think I’ve talked about how vastly different Case files anime felt to the novel a little bit, but this is where I\'m gonna expand on that. The anime needed to have this outward all-encompassing direction to work as an anime and you couldn\'t really ever transfer that peculiar sense of isolation or seclusion that Gray\'s inner monologue provided (the lack of visuals in the novel help with that feeling a lot and the manga doesn\'t have it either). Sanda sure can write them to the point of the reader occasionally getting tired from it, but it worked great when you’ve taken much needed breaks in-between and most importantly it added to the characters’ charm, made them fully fleshed out and developed. Reines and Gray suffered a lot without that, just as Shirou did in all FSN anime that there is. The only times I can even recall this similar vibe done perfectly in an anime was in some of the scenes of Evangelion, and Case files clearly was never meant to be like that. This is definitely my inexperience talking, but I honestly don\'t know if transferring that mood would ever be possible without making the show feel too awkward. It simply didn\'t deliver in the anime at all for me. It was so boring, in fact, that I could not finish some of the episodes for hours, instead opting to pause and stare at a screen for 20 minutes at a time. My mind went to switch to literally anything else like a YT video or just typing out about how I hated the show in discord chat. Blankly staring at a screen was better to me at one point and this is simply insane. Minutes were stretching into hours and I\'m still in disbelief that it actually happened. It was the first for me in any Type-Moon anime and it was as impressive as it was depressing. Just thinking about it again makes me sick. I was initially intending to finish the anime right before reading volume 10 because I wanted to feel the sense of it being ""over"" more profoundly (despite there still being a sequel novel series), but in the end it made me so bummed out and almost made me lose faith in the Case Files series when it was instead supposed to have the opposite effect. The disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined, seriously. ""Volume 10 better be very good"" I thought, hoping it would return me to normalcy the novel provided and cleanse me of this anime filth. And the next day, it actually did. Made me so enthralled that I finished it in a single day. I\'ve been reading until morning and refused to leave until I was finished.  It turned out to be one of the best volumes CF had, if not top 1. But after that, it took me a while to return to the anime, and once I did I was determined to be as clear about what was different in the anime from the novel as I could. Last time the memory wasn\'t as clear as I would\'ve liked (as you can imagine seeing how far in the timeline it was) and it probably made me dislike the anime more than necessary, so I wanted to avoid repeating that mistake. For just 3 more episodes it wasn\'t really that much of a game changer, but it did help. It was a fairly standard case of ""novel was better, what else is new?"" with nothing much to really comment on given how ‘done’ I am with this arc here, but I at least wanted to touch upon the new Reines/Shishigou/Luvia investigation side-plot (aka the changes that contradicted the novel the most that I could notice). What some of those early filler-esque episodes really served for is more connection for this investigation side-plot and having more backstory/organic explanation to some things that couldn’t be done in the anime quite as normal as it would be in the novel in a way it was written. They wanted to make some eureka moments for viewers to get them to feel how interconnected Neartless\' presence was in Case Files because they didn’t want to mention too much stuff from the previous volumes (I can only assume so, at least) because if they went too far with that it would seem like too much of a cop-out for anime-only viewers that didn’t read the novels. And all of that was done despite us not really knowing anything substantial about Heartless until the final arc in the novel anyway, it’s not really possible NOT for it to feel incomplete and missing something already. It feels like something done out of necessity and feels more fake than what it felt like to me in the novel, but at the same time some of it also feels completely unnecessary for the people who simply wanted them to make more anime adaptations either before or after this one. But despite that, once I delve into it again I become way more fine with it than I was in my initial viewing of the first 0-10 episodes. Trisha’s investigation was explained a bit more in the anime and I appreciated it. I liked how this suspicion of mine for why Trisha was investigating was confirmed. Trisha was doing this to find out about why Olga was not cared for properly by her father Marisbury after he got to the HGW investigation. The anime-only girl from the branch Animusphere family from episode 2 was there, so that’s kinda a little bit cool. That silly mage in the sewer workshop from episode 3 had some connections with Heartless too, that’s cute. Shishigou that we’ve met in episodes 4-5 went to investigate stuff with Luvia on behalf of Reines and met up with that zombie cooking show mage guy (that was actually supposed to be on the train this whole time in the novel) to confirm that Iskandar’s relic being stolen was done from within (as if it wasn’t obvious already without Shishigou’s involvement) and probably more behind the scenes. That’s pretty interconnected and cool, at least. I didn’t mind that stuff too much since Reines indeed was doing some investigation in the meantime while the story was focused exclusively on the train and Gray’s POV in the novel’s volumes for the most part. Touko travel part was still a little bit odd (even if Touko is exactly the kind of person that can make me believe she would make something like that and especially after CF volume 3), but at least we now visually see the procedure with summoning circle a little bit, how much exhausted the people were in the process of the ritual to activate it, and most importantly the fact that Flat was involved in making it work (refer to FSF to know more about Flat’s importance). Shishigou was hired to do the investigation in the anime and to my memory he does not appear in the novel, which is why it was especially weird to see this huge disconnect. His involvement and some scenes would’ve looked differently in the novel given how that TV star mage was supposed to be on the train this whole time, but then the whole story would’ve been altered a bit too much. Just a thought experiment of this sounds fun, though. Anyways, I couldn’t remember this zombie cooking guy in the novel too well except that he was on the train giving some info and stuff, so perhaps this switcheroo wasn’t too detrimental to the novel’s narrative? In times of confusion like this, I really wish I could’ve experienced this arc in the manga in full to compare. But even if I tried very hard to read it, the manga is quite literally still ongoing at the moment and after this many years it’s currently still only close to the middle of Rail Zeppelin arc. I respect Case files manga a lot and it is such a shame we don’t get more translations for it. Maybe in the future someone picks it up again, but who knows. Now enough about the superior CF adaptation. What else can I say about the anime? In a lot of ways it’s simply confusing. It’s going to be really hard to rate the story, or the characters, or my enjoyment when there’s so much nuance to account for, so I wasn’t really planning to make an objective take with all of this weirdness involved in the first place. There were points in time where the enjoyment was okay and where it was nonexistent. Some of this stuff was interesting and some of it was simply dreadful. If I extend my rating to the characters connecting it to the novels, my rating would be probably 10 since I liked the voice actors and nothing was really fucked up about them except not having inner monologue and making them feel flatter than I would’ve liked (or what I would’ve liked being possible in this anime format to begin with). But even that would be somewhat disturbed by my dislike of Yvette and Hishiri in this show. And first of all, this anime is divided into volume 4-5 parts on top of so much anime-original content, it’s nigh impossible to judge clearly for me. I wish this was an actual adaptation and for the filler-esque episodes to be either left in-between or reserved to anime specials or a separate series or something. Honestly, that would be ideal. So, ironically enough, now I can finally feel what some have already felt towards Last Encore about not getting a Fate/Extra adaptation. But I have a few issues with those people who think Last Encore is worse than Rail Zeppelin anime (besides the fact that there’s plenty of OG Fate/Extra content without having it to be an anime that’s just yet to be translated). I’m of the opinion that the ideas and the execution of the completely anime-original Fate/Extra story in Last Encore was done well and it makes even your most Nasuverse lore goblins and the most hardcore Fate/Extra fans think a whole lot. Usually the most you have to think about as a novel reader with Type-Moon anime is about the structural changes and always comparing every aspect of the character and story portrayed to the other mediums/adaptations, but LE required the most amount of thinking and research out of any Type-Moon anime ever. The only other intentionally vague anime piece within Nasuverse I could think of that’s on the same level would be Moonlight/Lostroom OVA (we’ve yet to see part 2 of FGO finish so you would have even less info to speculate about when that OVA first came out), but it’s a short OVA and not a full series. Last Encore’s existence wasn’t pointless and it even managed to be quite meaningful to the overall narrative of Extaverse. And it wasn’t even an adaptation but something new, which none of the other Fate anime series can boast about. Last Encore is the only Fate anime of its kind so far in many ways and I wouldn’t want to see Fate/Extra anime adaptation if it makes Last Encore not be a thing. Just like I would’ve enjoyed seeing the anime original Tachie (stray servant, proto-Mash from FSN) route that was planned to be a thing before it was canned and changed to Fate route adaptation. All of this to say that this short snapshot of what Case files anime could’ve been is not comparable to Last Encore at all. Case files anime is supposed to be an adaptation from the start, and it fails at it, due to this strange way they decided to start it in the middle of the story. Somehow it makes me wonder if they actually planned to continue Heartless related stuff and adapt the final arc from the novel later while skipping the arc right after Rail Zeppelin (especially because of the insanity that was volume 7), because there’s no way they could’ve entered into the franchise in the middle of the story and just ended it without moving to the finish line, right? This anime legit comes in like “does a thing, refuses to elaborate, leaves” just like Heartless himself and that kind of vibe is just funny to me while also incredibly sad. Speaking of Heartless, there was a moment in episode 12 on top of the train where KnK-esque music was playing and I really felt the weight of how poetic the anime could be and what it’s trying to do in that moment. Whenever the topic of fairy kidnappings comes up, you obviously think about that Satsuki guy from KnK 6 where it first got introduced to us. The fact that the same composer with the same kind of music is back for this very moment again feels just right at home. Makes you crave for more in a good way, for more KnK and more of this arc actually being finished. So I’m very conflicted. And of course the last episode just had to be a good note to end on to make me conflicted even more. This anime is weird and simply incomplete as of now. While I could tolerate something like the first Camelot movie because the second one was just that good for me, I cannot do it here because there is no second season on the horizon. And even if there was, it wouldn’t just instantly fix all of my issues here in this Rail Zeppelin anime. This show overall screams part 1 of 2 of the now (unfortunately) normal “season cour” trend and leaving it at that is just not right. It wasn’t right to start here and it’s not right to end it here, either.I could’ve gone on for more and analyzed stuff better without rambling as much (and not formatting walls of text as horribly), but I just don\'t feel like spending any more time on this. Here\'s hoping this review doesn’t seem completely trash to you. It’s a frustrating show, but can also be interesting, despite how boring it can be at times. If there even is a number to represent this confusion and conflict within me, 5/10 is the only fit here. But don’t get me wrong, I still want to leave this anime feeling hopeful for the future, just as I want you to feel hopeful and excited for Case files anime to maybe return in a proper form (and not just for one special episode) to finish what Rail Zeppelin anime started one day. A lot of my frustrations and dumb mindset issues I couldn’t help with could be turned around with more of this anime becoming more passable if Type-Moon simply adapts more Case files. I would still be grumpy about the story sucking compared to the novel (which no one would expect an anime adaptation to compete with in the first place), but it’ll just be one part of the whole anime series and not as annoying overall. Despite heavily separating them from the novels, I still very much like most of the KnK movies, even as I heavily dislike what KnK 6 adaptation turned out to be. I dislike Camelot movies changing around so much that they’re inconsistent with even Babylonia anime (much less the game), but I enjoyed my time with the second movie. If there was more CF anime made, small inconsistencies that may arise from some of this stuff like repeating scenes (Reines meeting, for example) or something else for the anime-only people would be wholly irrelevant to me if you could make it enjoyable. Give Lord El-Melloi anime series more content and we’ll be seeing the whole picture more objectively. And once there’s more, this time capsule of an opinion will evolve and become more nuanced in the future. Right now I feel like a moron even writing about it, to be quite frank. I simply had to collect my current thoughts somewhere and find out if someone out there could relate to this stuff I felt and what I had to say. I’ve only decided to post this take months after writing 99% of this initially because of getting bored while waiting for LB7.2.Despite everything, I’m glad Case files got an anime at all, and that it didn’t have as much of a bad rep as Tsukhime anime, DeenSN, or Prillya anime for me to have more of a “normal” experience. But it still leaves too much to be desired, and this surface-level appearance of normalcy may have actually been detrimental to how I perceived this adaptation. I am left wondering if it could be salvaged in some way, hoping the future will bring something eventually to improve the situation. anime series to finish not only the anime, but a hell of a lot more.Story: -/10Characters: -/10Animation: 8/10Music: 8/10Enjoyment: -/10Overall: 5/10Many aspects of this are wildly different depending on the episode and I can\'t give this thing a more precise rating. But even being very generous with my rating, 5/10 is the absolute maximum overall score I can give it for now. You should not watch this show if you haven\'t read the source material and then some. You have been warned.I\'ve searched for any novel readers having the same impression on the show as me in the review section, but couldn\'t find anything sufficient. This review will probably be boring at first, as I like having everyone who reads this being completely in tune, and understanding where the nuance in my experience may lie to the best of my ability without spending too much time as my big handicap. Thus, I\'ll be repeating my path through the Nasuverse as many times as it takes on each review that I feel needs it.Now, without being overly detailed about everything and without including nearly any databooks or bonus stuff that does not seem to be overly-relevant, an oversimplified part of my journey that\'s relevant to Case files looks something like what you see below. I\'m sure the ones who ""know"" will understand my reasoning instantly as well as some potential flaws near the end of this path.

This review will be interconnected with my light novel and manga experience. It\'s a core component to any introspective source material fan reviewing adaptations and is pretty important.FINAL SPOILER WARNING: I will spoil things from all over the place, beyond the anime, and beyond just CF novel series. You have been warned.Before even watching the show, I already had tremendous issues with the anime just adapting volume 4-5, but tried to stay open-minded as usual. And at first, my impression on the show from episodes 0-1 were pretty positive, despite some of my issues. It was really interesting to see how the anime can handle Case Files in animation. How will the presence of visuals, voice acting, music, and generally anything outside of Gray\'s (and sometimes Reines\') perspective will affect the feeling of everything? It was fun at first because I could tell that despite clearly getting a wildly different vibe from the novel I could find enjoyment in this anyway. I liked the vibe of this show\'s music (made from the same person responsible for KnK OST), I really liked OP/ED to the point of ED becoming one of my favorites among any Nasuverse anime titles pretty quickly. I consider the casting choices to be perfect for everyone except maybe Yvette and Hishiri. That first potential exception is somewhat debatable because she was meant to be annoying to some extent in the novel, but I cannot express how much I started hating her guts after she was given this voice here and it made me actually dislike her a lot when the Rail Zeppelin arc was taking place (which is unusual for me after not having any issues with her in the novel). My dislike for Hishiri\'s voice may seem a bit dumb, especially how it seems to fit her description from the novel, but I\'m just really tired of this overly onee-san voice and it just annoyed me the whole way through. But alright, enough about the voices. I didn\'t mind episode 0 being focused on the cat incident only very briefly mentioned in the very first page of volume 1. There was an image of a dead cat at the very beginning, and then Gray and Luvia were talking about Waver where one single line about the cat popped up (or something along those lines). They made an episode out of just that. Which is cool and all, but it sneakily started this tendency within me where I question many of this extra stuff with a ""why?"" when we could\'ve had a normal full adaptation instead. I tried to be thankful that we got any Case files anime at all, and this mindset is honestly the only reason I switched my decently long-lasted rating of 4/10 into 5 after finishing the last episodes. But I digress. My experience with episode 1 is a bit complicated to explain, but overall I was fascinated with it as a novel reader. Reading that scene of Waver meeting with Reines for the first time at the start of volume 2 from Reines\' POV was undoubtedly better than in the more basic way the anime did it. The anime changed up young Reines’ design by shortening her dress, giving it frills, and having Reines shorter haircut. And when I was watching the scene, I found myself liking it more than the illustration of her in the same scene from the novel or in that Fate/Zero: Another Epilogue chapter (even if it was a bit closer to the novel than the anime design-wise and with more bits from the novel preserved in general). The anime may have been basic in a lot of ways (without having the luxury to go into things deeper due to the format of anime restricting it somewhat) and the pacing of the episode split the scene into 2 parts with the Waver traveling and meeting Melvin part in-between, but I liked this approach. I also found the changes to the way Waver gets interrogated in this version pretty amusing. Having Waver be upside down and the guards shaking him around is a silly devious thing that Reines may come up with if she were to feel particularly impish and childish (the new design helps with that feeling too, so good job). I liked how the anime did it with what it had, basically. Now, the Fate/Zero manga, on the other hand, took a more comical approach and the peculiar artstyle of it helped a lot for the situation to feel very lighthearted compared to every other version of this scene, and I liked it in its own way, too. All 4 iterations of their meeting scene do their job well in very different ways and are all welcome additions. But I’m unsure if any of them work quite as well as the novel. In the novel it was very expository (which is exactly what we needed and waited for after that first volume), introspective, and with a certain vibe to it that only really was felt in the Case files manga adaptation of the scene. In that manga, this scene was handled as perfectly as it could be in the visual medium without going full light novel. Definitely was the second best version of the scene after the LN (it was even better than the original in some instances). I may have liked the visual and directorial approach of the anime version of the scene, but Case files manga made me truly understand why the first intended Reines’ design from that novel illustration works the best, after all (especially with the content of the novel), and why having very little of Reines goofing around in that situation was superior in the narrative compared to her feeling a bit too childish in the Zero version and to a lesser extent in the anime. Reines may like to do a little trolling and can be silly at times, but she is also supposed to be very mature and reserved for her age due to all of the bullshit she had to go through like having to be a target for assainations and such. This duality is pretty much what makes up Reines’ personality. She is much cuter in the anime and you can argue she looks better there visually in some aspects, but the manga handles her much better in that core aspect of her character visually than anywhere else. We see less of her being exaggerated and more ’real’ in the novel and the manga thanks to the knowledge of what Reines was thinking about during this ‘heartwarming’ episode and pretty much every time we have the narrative switch to her perspective. It doesn’t take much to realize how much better this introduction was for Reines in the novel and the CF manga compared to the anime and Zero manga, so I couldn’t help but feel underwhelmed by the thought of people seeing those versions first instead of the superior ones (although ofc no one’s reading Zero manga’s version first normally unless they know Japanese or something, so realistically it’s mostly the anime I’m a bit concerned about). That’s nearly all my thoughts on the topic of the ‘Reines meeting Waver’ prologue, but I have one more thing to say before moving on. Having this prologue scene interrupted by Waver traveling and then having our first young Melvin meeting all in one episode is quite awesome. If not to at least just know how both may affect the story and my experience in general (granted, I can\'t really ever know how it feels like for anime-only people, but oh well, you can\'t have it all). When we finish with Melvin scenes and go back to finish up with the second part of Reines meeting, the coat transition into Iskander’s at the end is just awesome and with that short montage stuff the ending of episode 1 is pretty great. Really makes you wonder if it would be better for someone to skip episode 0 or not, even if it came out earlier than this episode or not. Anime-only experience must be super weird as usual and it is quite amusing to think about. But of course, I would never advocate CF anime or this point in the story being your first time meeting Reines or Melvin. I’d rather most people read the novel or try the manga (there’s really not enough manga translations, though). You can already imagine by how long it took us in the novel or the manga to see that Reines meeting scene and even more so meeting Melvin for the first time properly in the later volumes just how ridiculously fucked this anime had to be paced to make up for the number of episodes or a limited production or whatever the hell was the reason behind it. Part of the reason for some of the directorial moves is simply the format of an anime being different from the novel, but a lot of the scenes in the manga prove it could still be made work well in the anime if they maintained similar pacing and the core structure of the novel without jumping around to the 3rd arc straight away. In that aspect alone this anime deserves the spot of the worst Nasuverse anime. Starting off, it\'s already wildly different from anything we\'ve seen in the Nasuverse and not in a good way. We\'ve had a lot of wild shit happen here: from KnK 6 being simply ridiculous as an adaptation, HF3 anime ending section being very unfriendly to the anime-only Fate fans, Zero anime being a menace to every OG novel reader fan out there for being a normie magnet, Deen Fate route mixing shenanigans, Deen UBW being a fun scene compilation movie and nothing more, ufotable’s UBW changes lessening Illya’s character +spoiling Zero +""hidden"" stuff for those who played FHA and CCC (and have read Case files), Prototype OVA being a thing to mald over never being a full anime, Prillya anime being Prillya anime, random FGO animes that somehow are watched by the people who’ve never played FGO, Tsukihime anime actually existing, one of the most reference-heavy titles like FSF becoming an anime, and up until Last Encore being so unfathomably based most cannot understand it (much less enjoy). This CF anime is the only one that went as far as just starting in the literal middle of the story and not finishing it because the story was never meant to be consumed separately from the novel. CF anime tried to do it anyway, and it reminded me of the Canaan anime situation where the core part of the story was already told in Shibuya Scramble. But that didn’t start in the middle of the story, instead after it was done already. The only difference between CF and Canaan anime is that the latter wasn’t trying to adapt anything and instead was serving as a largely redundant product that only served to make the original source look worse by having this unnecessary thing attached to it (even if having more Type-Moon content isn’t entirely unwelcome). CF was and is a LN adaptation and it tried to do this ridiculous thing. I could tolerate it with FGO anime a lot more because the source material there wasn’t a light novel and FGO in general tended to be a very flexible thing to adapt compared to something like Case files. And currently, having parts of FGO’s first arc adapted/interpreted through First Order, Camelot, Babylonia, and Solomon is already much better than only having Rail Zeppelin in the CF anime being the only thing adapted in the entire novel series. First Order would be an equivalent to Arda’s Castle arc and Solomon would serve as an equivalent of the final arc to Case files (Grand Roll) and we do not have either adapted in the anime form here. And while I hate that with an endless passion, I gotta admit this takes some balls. If I am really just being impatient and if CF anime really will get that final arc adapted some time later, I’ll have to take that into account later, however then you’d have the same problem as in this first CF anime with later having characters from volume 1 appearing as well as the events from all other volumes mentioned which they may even remove entirely to replace with more anime-only stuff again. That hypothetical Grand Roll anime adaptation is going to be just as weird as this one if they don’t adapt more of the previous arcs, but with just a bit more chances to be enjoyable because the whole thing with Heartless and his servant was set-up in this anime already and that’s what’s the most important. Rail Zeppelin anime overall was just not it for being a setup for CF anime series, just like the first Camelot movie was before the second one saved it from being a pure garbage adaptation or having anime-only people experiencing Babylonia arc before going through Camelot. Rail Zeppelin anime is the closest to the first Camelot movie in my earlier “FGO anime to CF anime comparison” equation. It can also be close to the latter half of Babylonia (when it started to fall off), but Camelot fits a bit more here. CF anime managed to disappoint me more than Tsukihime anime (for already having an expectation of that one being terrible) or Prillya anime (with an expectation of it simply being nothing more than a uoh joke compilation), and This CF anime is right up there with the worst of the worst for me in Nasuverse as of right now. But it can definitely change in the future more easily than the other anime I’ve mentioned could.I went off-topic for long enough with my whiny ass rants. Let’s bring some positive energy back again for a moment and remind you where we’ve left off. Episode 1 did everything well with these peculiar production circumstances. Having to see Waver travel around and get in trouble with Melvin after the 4th HGW was a great addition to this weird limited anime format they were going for as was having to see the scene of Melvin landing Waver the money animated. It was confusing when paired with the cat episode before it, but pretty good. I was now ever more hopeful to see the anime get to the arc it was supposed to adapt. But what I didn\'t take into account is something ridiculous happening like this show only having 7 episodes to adapt the entirety of the Rail Zeppelin arc in the latter half of the show with the rest of the earlier episodes being anime-only filler that blue-balls its viewers. That made me pretty freaking mad, but the first 0-1 episodes did pretty alright as far as filler-esque episodes go, so I tried to be patient. Episode 2 was when it started to go downhill. As much as having to see some random Animusphere branch family filler seems okay in vacuum or some random Clock Tower shenanigans in general, I\'d really rather not have to sit through it when I know it could\'ve been novel content instead. But the unfortunate thing here is that the overall plot doesn\'t work without this kind of tomfoolery precisely because, despite the anime being so bold with starting in the middle of the novel and even referencing stuff no anime-only watcher would know, they didn\'t want to go all the way with it. Having the viewers see this overly-complicated magecraft stuff wasn\'t as neat as in the novel and even in there it wasn\'t a particularly big reason for your enjoyment (as you can\'t truly guess anything as you would with most normal detective novels and just having to follow the flow), instead it was character interactions and the overall lore stuff. Having to see this random filler plot where anime-only people can see a fraction of this astronomical magical stuff we went through in the novels but so much worse is just irritating. It\'s obvious that the anime wanted to hit the same beats as the novel with displaying Waver\'s magical deconstruction prowess and to make callbacks to it later because they’ve decided volume 1-3 weren\'t worth its own adaptation apparently. And let me make this clear, I am super mad about CF anime not starting with volume 1 because I truly think it\'s the best starting point for the series and I have made a point to myself to re-read it alongside the manga of that arc to make this point clear to myself once and for all that anime sucks ass (trying to uncover the differences between the manga and the novel was a big W). And as a bonus, if you\'ve read just a few volumes of CF before FGO on top of Garden of Avalon, your enjoyment for Camelot will skyrocket to overshadow Babylonia in some ways. But I digress. Episode 2\'s family drama angle was very much a replacement for what would\'ve happened in Twin Towers of Iselma arc (vol 2-3) and the secret plan of the dead father becoming a culprit instead of someone present being suspected of it at first was clearly meant to be Adra Castle arc\'s replacement (vol 1) and it was all in the same episode. Next up, episode 3 actually had that random-ass Clock Tower Slice-of-Life nonsense that I wanted to see more for a long time and I enjoyed it a whole lot more than episode 2. Much of the lightheartedness here cheered me up a little and gave me some more hope for the Case files anime to turn out enjoyable by the end. Although, it irked me a little bit that Flat\'s inner character stuff was mentioned at all here. After catching up to the FSF novel, it was done and revealed so much better as it was always supposed to be truly delved into right there in FSF and nowhere else. This was why the CF novel wasn’t really keen on wanting to explore his character and why you always knew that something about him was off. You were supposed to get all of that from FSF instead of this random filler episode, and the thought of someone watching this episode before reading FSF makes me cringe deeply, even if this moment was very brief. Another thing that irked me a little bit were tiny FGO references within this episode. I did like them and I wouldn’t want them removed but at the same time it’s amusing how had I been a little more of an idiot and decided to read the novel up until vol 4-5 and went straight for the anime without catching up to FGO, I would\'ve missed out lol. This is just the nature of these easter eggs and it’s not even an issue (I just wanted to bring it that thought). Tiny pet-peeves of mine aren\'t enough to really detract from my initial enjoyment, even if I did still feel it\'d be better to focus more on the novel content instead and for these random filler-esque episodes to happen in-between instead of replacing it entirely. Episodes 4-5 were a mixed bag and they actually managed to make an anime-only filler arc on top of this already ridiculous situation Case files anime is in. But let’s start from the beginning. I like the scene of Reines and Bram (Sola-Ui\'s brother) talking about the 5th HGW for a tiny bit a whole lot, but while briefly bringing up Bazett didn’t really change anything, Altrum\'s brief presence on the photo only served to remind me that we couldn\'t have volumes 2-3 animated. Having both photos there was perfect and better than one or none, so the point is still “I like this scene”. Now about this arc thing they were trying to do. By the end of episode 4 I was so shocked and mad that those bastards included an anime-only filler arc instead of animating more of the novel, it was kinda funny. But I\'ve actually calmed down more than expected as episode 5 kept going. It\'s unclear how much different it\'d feel if I didn\'t already read LB6 and never met a Nasuverse fairy in full before (and no one would call the brief appearance of one in this episode “in full” when compared to LB6 characters), but despite the anime and volumes 8-10 coming out before LB6, I\'m still glad I\'ve read LB6 before seeing both of those (as much as that may make me more of a normie in the eyes of even more hardcore Type-Moon fans who’ve been around far longer than me) because my first experience with fairies and Albion was with Nasu\'s writing instead of Sanda and this anime (and it helped out especially a lot while reading final CF arc for obvious reasons any LB6 reader could tell you). But even with all of that, I can\'t really describe these episodes as anything but a mixed bag, yet I kinda liked them by the end to an extent. Although that brief underground graveyard tunnel stuff really reminded me of volumes 6-7 and that cool Gravekeeper, and that we can\'t have that arc animated either (lol). My mind turned out to be quite the downer this time, huh? But I couldn\'t help it. Why must this show be structured like this? Anyway, having Shishigou show up was a brilliant move I couldn\'t really expect. Actually seeing the concept of Wild Hunt being played around with in Nasuverse besides it just being contained within a physical being like a servant was very nice, and so was knowing the fact that the fairy realm can be accessed through a portal. That moment when Reines jokingly offered Waver to sleep with her with intoxicating smugness reminded me of how much I liked Reines, and by the next episode I felt she was carrying this anime. When the Rail Zeppelin arc started I felt that it was so much better with her around, too. The feeling of ""Mid (Gray) vs Kino (Reines)"" was profound at times. But it’s all in good jest, Gray is great. Although I wanted to just briefly mention how Gray\'s voice could be a bit too meek at times to the point of annoying, but as that was pretty similar to how it was supposed to be in the novel, it was absolutely spot on. Now, episode 6 was most blatantly combining the theme of beauty from vol 2-3 with the entrapment aspect from that one awesome scene from vol 1 but being way more passive in here. There\'s more at play here like Reines explaining stuff to Gray about Iskandar and Luvia wandering around the place being pretty meh and how I\'d rather see vol 1-3 animated again, but it was actually fine and I liked these calm moments with the girls together (and Reines carrying the show for a little while). It was pretty short and we\'re quickly back to where we started the episode, focusing on Iskandar\'s relic again and with the Reil Zeppelin arc about to begin (finally). And how should I put it? The Rail Zeppelin arc in this anime doesn\'t live up to the novel at all. It\'s easy to see why it failed to grab the attention of some people for me especially, because I\'m one of those people. Visually, the train and all about it was done almost perfectly and I really respect how the studio handled it, but the story here simply failed in this medium in my opinion. I think I’ve talked about how vastly different Case files anime felt to the novel a little bit, but this is where I\'m gonna expand on that. The anime needed to have this outward all-encompassing direction to work as an anime and you couldn\'t really ever transfer that peculiar sense of isolation or seclusion that Gray\'s inner monologue provided (the lack of visuals in the novel help with that feeling a lot and the manga doesn\'t have it either). Sanda sure can write them to the point of the reader occasionally getting tired from it, but it worked great when you’ve taken much needed breaks in-between and most importantly it added to the characters’ charm, made them fully fleshed out and developed. Reines and Gray suffered a lot without that, just as Shirou did in all FSN anime that there is. The only times I can even recall this similar vibe done perfectly in an anime was in some of the scenes of Evangelion, and Case files clearly was never meant to be like that. This is definitely my inexperience talking, but I honestly don\'t know if transferring that mood would ever be possible without making the show feel too awkward. It simply didn\'t deliver in the anime at all for me. It was so boring, in fact, that I could not finish some of the episodes for hours, instead opting to pause and stare at a screen for 20 minutes at a time. My mind went to switch to literally anything else like a YT video or just typing out about how I hated the show in discord chat. Blankly staring at a screen was better to me at one point and this is simply insane. Minutes were stretching into hours and I\'m still in disbelief that it actually happened. It was the first for me in any Type-Moon anime and it was as impressive as it was depressing. Just thinking about it again makes me sick. I was initially intending to finish the anime right before reading volume 10 because I wanted to feel the sense of it being ""over"" more profoundly (despite there still being a sequel novel series), but in the end it made me so bummed out and almost made me lose faith in the Case Files series when it was instead supposed to have the opposite effect. The disappointment was immeasurable and my day was ruined, seriously. ""Volume 10 better be very good"" I thought, hoping it would return me to normalcy the novel provided and cleanse me of this anime filth. And the next day, it actually did. Made me so enthralled that I finished it in a single day. I\'ve been reading until morning and refused to leave until I was finished.  It turned out to be one of the best volumes CF had, if not top 1. But after that, it took me a while to return to the anime, and once I did I was determined to be as clear about what was different in the anime from the novel as I could. Last time the memory wasn\'t as clear as I would\'ve liked (as you can imagine seeing how far in the timeline it was) and it probably made me dislike the anime more than necessary, so I wanted to avoid repeating that mistake. For just 3 more episodes it wasn\'t really that much of a game changer, but it did help. It was a fairly standard case of ""novel was better, what else is new?"" with nothing much to really comment on given how ‘done’ I am with this arc here, but I at least wanted to touch upon the new Reines/Shishigou/Luvia investigation side-plot (aka the changes that contradicted the novel the most that I could notice). What some of those early filler-esque episodes really served for is more connection for this investigation side-plot and having more backstory/organic explanation to some things that couldn’t be done in the anime quite as normal as it would be in the novel in a way it was written. They wanted to make some eureka moments for viewers to get them to feel how interconnected Neartless\' presence was in Case Files because they didn’t want to mention too much stuff from the previous volumes (I can only assume so, at least) because if they went too far with that it would seem like too much of a cop-out for anime-only viewers that didn’t read the novels. And all of that was done despite us not really knowing anything substantial about Heartless until the final arc in the novel anyway, it’s not really possible NOT for it to feel incomplete and missing something already. It feels like something done out of necessity and feels more fake than what it felt like to me in the novel, but at the same time some of it also feels completely unnecessary for the people who simply wanted them to make more anime adaptations either before or after this one. But despite that, once I delve into it again I become way more fine with it than I was in my initial viewing of the first 0-10 episodes. Trisha’s investigation was explained a bit more in the anime and I appreciated it. I liked how this suspicion of mine for why Trisha was investigating was confirmed. Trisha was doing this to find out about why Olga was not cared for properly by her father Marisbury after he got to the HGW investigation. The anime-only girl from the branch Animusphere family from episode 2 was there, so that’s kinda a little bit cool. That silly mage in the sewer workshop from episode 3 had some connections with Heartless too, that’s cute. Shishigou that we’ve met in episodes 4-5 went to investigate stuff with Luvia on behalf of Reines and met up with that zombie cooking show mage guy (that was actually supposed to be on the train this whole time in the novel) to confirm that Iskandar’s relic being stolen was done from within (as if it wasn’t obvious already without Shishigou’s involvement) and probably more behind the scenes. That’s pretty interconnected and cool, at least. I didn’t mind that stuff too much since Reines indeed was doing some investigation in the meantime while the story was focused exclusively on the train and Gray’s POV in the novel’s volumes for the most part. Touko travel part was still a little bit odd (even if Touko is exactly the kind of person that can make me believe she would make something like that and especially after CF volume 3), but at least we now visually see the procedure with summoning circle a little bit, how much exhausted the people were in the process of the ritual to activate it, and most importantly the fact that Flat was involved in making it work (refer to FSF to know more about Flat’s importance). Shishigou was hired to do the investigation in the anime and to my memory he does not appear in the novel, which is why it was especially weird to see this huge disconnect. His involvement and some scenes would’ve looked differently in the novel given how that TV star mage was supposed to be on the train this whole time, but then the whole story would’ve been altered a bit too much. Just a thought experiment of this sounds fun, though. Anyways, I couldn’t remember this zombie cooking guy in the novel too well except that he was on the train giving some info and stuff, so perhaps this switcheroo wasn’t too detrimental to the novel’s narrative? In times of confusion like this, I really wish I could’ve experienced this arc in the manga in full to compare. But even if I tried very hard to read it, the manga is quite literally still ongoing at the moment and after this many years it’s currently still only close to the middle of Rail Zeppelin arc. I respect Case files manga a lot and it is such a shame we don’t get more translations for it. Maybe in the future someone picks it up again, but who knows. Now enough about the superior CF adaptation. What else can I say about the anime? In a lot of ways it’s simply confusing. It’s going to be really hard to rate the story, or the characters, or my enjoyment when there’s so much nuance to account for, so I wasn’t really planning to make an objective take with all of this weirdness involved in the first place. There were points in time where the enjoyment was okay and where it was nonexistent. Some of this stuff was interesting and some of it was simply dreadful. If I extend my rating to the characters connecting it to the novels, my rating would be probably 10 since I liked the voice actors and nothing was really fucked up about them except not having inner monologue and making them feel flatter than I would’ve liked (or what I would’ve liked being possible in this anime format to begin with). But even that would be somewhat disturbed by my dislike of Yvette and Hishiri in this show. And first of all, this anime is divided into volume 4-5 parts on top of so much anime-original content, it’s nigh impossible to judge clearly for me. I wish this was an actual adaptation and for the filler-esque episodes to be either left in-between or reserved to anime specials or a separate series or something. Honestly, that would be ideal. So, ironically enough, now I can finally feel what some have already felt towards Last Encore about not getting a Fate/Extra adaptation. But I have a few issues with those people who think Last Encore is worse than Rail Zeppelin anime (besides the fact that there’s plenty of OG Fate/Extra content without having it to be an anime that’s just yet to be translated). I’m of the opinion that the ideas and the execution of the completely anime-original Fate/Extra story in Last Encore was done well and it makes even your most Nasuverse lore goblins and the most hardcore Fate/Extra fans think a whole lot. Usually the most you have to think about as a novel reader with Type-Moon anime is about the structural changes and always comparing every aspect of the character and story portrayed to the other mediums/adaptations, but LE required the most amount of thinking and research out of any Type-Moon anime ever. The only other intentionally vague anime piece within Nasuverse I could think of that’s on the same level would be Moonlight/Lostroom OVA (we’ve yet to see part 2 of FGO finish so you would have even less info to speculate about when that OVA first came out), but it’s a short OVA and not a full series. Last Encore’s existence wasn’t pointless and it even managed to be quite meaningful to the overall narrative of Extaverse. And it wasn’t even an adaptation but something new, which none of the other Fate anime series can boast about. Last Encore is the only Fate anime of its kind so far in many ways and I wouldn’t want to see Fate/Extra anime adaptation if it makes Last Encore not be a thing. Just like I would’ve enjoyed seeing the anime original Tachie (stray servant, proto-Mash from FSN) route that was planned to be a thing before it was canned and changed to Fate route adaptation. All of this to say that this short snapshot of what Case files anime could’ve been is not comparable to Last Encore at all. Case files anime is supposed to be an adaptation from the start, and it fails at it, due to this strange way they decided to start it in the middle of the story. Somehow it makes me wonder if they actually planned to continue Heartless related stuff and adapt the final arc from the novel later while skipping the arc right after Rail Zeppelin (especially because of the insanity that was volume 7), because there’s no way they could’ve entered into the franchise in the middle of the story and just ended it without moving to the finish line, right? This anime legit comes in like “does a thing, refuses to elaborate, leaves” just like Heartless himself and that kind of vibe is just funny to me while also incredibly sad. Speaking of Heartless, there was a moment in episode 12 on top of the train where KnK-esque music was playing and I really felt the weight of how poetic the anime could be and what it’s trying to do in that moment. Whenever the topic of fairy kidnappings comes up, you obviously think about that Satsuki guy from KnK 6 where it first got introduced to us. The fact that the same composer with the same kind of music is back for this very moment again feels just right at home. Makes you crave for more in a good way, for more KnK and more of this arc actually being finished. So I’m very conflicted. And of course the last episode just had to be a good note to end on to make me conflicted even more. This anime is weird and simply incomplete as of now. While I could tolerate something like the first Camelot movie because the second one was just that good for me, I cannot do it here because there is no second season on the horizon. And even if there was, it wouldn’t just instantly fix all of my issues here in this Rail Zeppelin anime. This show overall screams part 1 of 2 of the now (unfortunately) normal “season cour” trend and leaving it at that is just not right. It wasn’t right to start here and it’s not right to end it here, either.I could’ve gone on for more and analyzed stuff better without rambling as much (and not formatting walls of text as horribly), but I just don\'t feel like spending any more time on this. Here\'s hoping this review doesn’t seem completely trash to you. It’s a frustrating show, but can also be interesting, despite how boring it can be at times. If there even is a number to represent this confusion and conflict within me, 5/10 is the only fit here. But don’t get me wrong, I still want to leave this anime feeling hopeful for the future, just as I want you to feel hopeful and excited for Case files anime to maybe return in a proper form (and not just for one special episode) to finish what Rail Zeppelin anime started one day. A lot of my frustrations and dumb mindset issues I couldn’t help with could be turned around with more of this anime becoming more passable if Type-Moon simply adapts more Case files. I would still be grumpy about the story sucking compared to the novel (which no one would expect an anime adaptation to compete with in the first place), but it’ll just be one part of the whole anime series and not as annoying overall. Despite heavily separating them from the novels, I still very much like most of the KnK movies, even as I heavily dislike what KnK 6 adaptation turned out to be. I dislike Camelot movies changing around so much that they’re inconsistent with even Babylonia anime (much less the game), but I enjoyed my time with the second movie. If there was more CF anime made, small inconsistencies that may arise from some of this stuff like repeating scenes (Reines meeting, for example) or something else for the anime-only people would be wholly irrelevant to me if you could make it enjoyable. Give Lord El-Melloi anime series more content and we’ll be seeing the whole picture more objectively. And once there’s more, this time capsule of an opinion will evolve and become more nuanced in the future. Right now I feel like a moron even writing about it, to be quite frank. I simply had to collect my current thoughts somewhere and find out if someone out there could relate to this stuff I felt and what I had to say. I’ve only decided to post this take months after writing 99% of this initially because of getting bored while waiting for LB7.2.Despite everything, I’m glad Case files got an anime at all, and that it didn’t have as much of a bad rep as Tsukhime anime, DeenSN, or Prillya anime for me to have more of a “normal” experience. But it still leaves too much to be desired, and this surface-level appearance of normalcy may have actually been detrimental to how I perceived this adaptation. I am left wondering if it could be salvaged in some way, hoping the future will bring something eventually to improve the situation.', ""Another installment in the Fate universe and from someone who enjoys the fate series, I really liked what they had to offer, it's an all rounder 8 for me, but for those who aren't versed in the fate universe I don't recommend this cuz the world, characters and the plot will feel unappealing and you'll find yourself not knowing what's going on most of the time, but for those interested let's get a bit into details:Story:The plot takes a bit of an episodic form, every episode or 2 centers around a case related to magic and mages,(except for last case which is 6 episodes) and...Waver (now Lord El Melloi II) takes on these cases, by orders of his adoptive younger sister.now the magic aspect for me is still complicated so I'm not sure I understood all the deductions, but it's interesting to watch how they work it out as Waver's past is catching up to him, there is more to these cases than meets the eye.so I personally enjoy the mystery element of the plot.also the pacing was very good, I like that the cases didn't feel rushed.Characters:there is lot of nostalgia if you're fate fan, most characters are well known, and most were in cameo in previous works so it's interesting to see more of them, and if you're a fan of Fate/Zero it's a quite a scene, the transformation for Waver and seeing him in a new light.Art:The Art was surprisingly very good considering the studio isn't a major one  animation was okay/good I guess, battles aren't flashy or as good as Ufotabe of course but I guess that's okay cuz the show is not about flashy battles.Sound:OST was one of the best thing this anime has to offer and I don't always pay attention to OSTs but it stood out for me and OP/ED were brilliant.Enjoyment:I think it was enjoyable enough, but due too it's episodic nature it can get a bit boring at times but at the end it was worth it!story:

in solving mysteries, the main one being Rail Zeppelin Grace Note. I was super excited for this anime after watching Fate/Zero, because Waver and Iskandar were my favorite duo in that- so, a story revolving around Waver was a pleasing sight.Story: The story felt a little spontaneous to start, they kinda attempted to warm you up to the cast and paint an initial picture with some less relevant cases to start, and eventually it transitions into the main case, Rail Zeppelin Grace Note. It does a relatively good job of keeping things interesting...with a minor plot twist here and there, but nothing too crazy.Art: The art gets the job done. For a story from the Fate universe, there isn't a ton of combat, so in that regard, the art and animation is a bit tame. It does have its flashy moments where the artistic talents are shown off a bit more indepth, but outside of that, the character art and animation was solid all the way around.Sound: This was okay as well, nothing too crazy, the OP was catchy in its own right, even though, it's not what I think of, when I think about anime openings. They used their soundtrack effectively to portray the feeling of mystery, or danger, when it was prevalent. The voice acting was good as well, but nothing too insane.Characters: I loved the character work here, and, I hope to see Waver and Gray again in some other rendition of the Fate series. I loved the cameos of characters from all the branches of Fate, you had characters from Apocrypha show, some from Grand Order, and of course, the main character being from Fate Zero. It was a joy to see characters show up, and tie into this side branch.Enjoyment:I really enjoyed this anime, I think it got a tough bill of goods, considering, it was always watched right after Kimetsu no Yaiba on Saturdays, but, in it's own right, it was solid. Like I said, the story follows some of my favorite characters in the entire Fate universe, so, i might be slightly biased based on that.Overall: It gets a 7/10. I think, the score is just a bit lower, because everything was a bit tame for the Fate universe, you had tie ins, and explanations of things that happened in that world, but, there wasn't a ton of action revolving around that. I'm hopeful that we'll get to see some of these characters again, when Fate Grand Order kicks off in the fall season. with a minor plot twist here and there, but nothing too crazy.Art: The art gets the job done.

Furthermore, we must not be misled by the name ""Lord El-Melloi II\'s Case Files"" and expect an investigative anime that involves the viewer in the search for the culprit while formulating hypotheses as to how the crime took place. The central theme of the anime is Waver...Velvet\'s maturation after the events of the 4th Grail War shown in Fate/Zero.FROM NOW ON THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.The anime is divided into two parts: the first which, in small stand-alone investigative cases, acts as a worldbuilding and presentation of some characters, and the second in which the main events of the anime transpire.Earlier I wrote that you shouldn\'t approach this anime with the desire to see cases like those of Sherlock Holmes because the main issue is that Lord El-Melloi II is set in a world of mages. The magic in the Nasuverse, as far as I know, has never been precisely framed with a list of specific spells, rules or limits and therefore turns out to be beyond its users. As a result, the cases presented in this anime become impossible for the viewer to solve. On the contrary, if you look at the anime because you are fascinated by the Nasuverse and its magical system, the cases and the plot can be pleasant and interesting, in particular Rail Zeppelin\'s arc which explores aspects related to mystical eyes.A flaw of this arc is certainly the main villain, Dr. Heartless, of which the viewer is almost totally unaware of until his appearance in episode 12 and, until the end, very little is known about him. I hope for a second season that better characterizes this individual since in the finale he and Faker manage to escape and it is said that Heartless and Lord El-Melloi II will be destined to fight again.As already mentioned before, the central theme of the work is Waver\'s personal growth after the farewell with his Servant, Iskandar. The protagonist, despite having now become an adult, remains trapped in the past and suffers from this due to the frustration of not having fought in the Holy Grail War but of having remained a spectator. He feels that he is missing something to be worthy of being by Iskandar\'s side. Although he knows of the enormous danger, he is willing to assert himself by fighting another war, but above all to see his old friend again. During the anime Waver matures and understands that his place is not on the battlefield, but behind the desk: his path is the teaching and education of young people. He manages, in this way, to untie himself from the past and to move forward and feel worthy of being a companion of Iskandar. And this is precisely the teaching that this anime wants to transmit: we must find the strength to get up and always go forward, chasing our dreams.Speaking of the rest of the cast, the secondary characters do not have a deep characterization like that of Waver and turn out to be very forgettable, except for some characters who, like the protagonist and thanks to the teachings of Waver, manage to mature too. In particular, during the course of the episodes, Gray\'s maturation path is interesting, leading her to understand herself and her desire to assist Waver.As for the artistic side, drawings and animations are discreet but nothing exceptional.  I found the opening titles (ep 1) that flow during the battle between Iskandar and Gilgamesh fantastic. A note of credit goes to the settings, the backgrounds were well made and very pleasant, in particular those of the train.The opening has no vocals but this does not mean that it has less value than the ""classic opening"", indeed, as a lover of OSTs, I love this opening so much that I have never skipped it. In general the OSTs accompany the scenes quite well and there are some that stand out among the others and that I would gladly hear as ""they are magicians"" or ""we call him heartless"".The voice actors all did a good job, in particular Ueda Reina who was able to perfectly interpret the character of Gray and giving to ""Rhongomyniad!"" the same vibes as ""Excalibur!"" of the original Saber.In conclusion Lord El-Melloi II\'s Case Files is aimed at a small target of people because to enjoy it at its best you need a fairly broad knowledge of the Nasuverse and it turns out to be a good anime if you look at it for the maturation path of the characters but an anime not successful if you look at it for the cases themselves.STORY: 7ART: 7SOUND: 8CHARACTER: 7ENJOYMENT: 9OVERALL: 8 Velvet\'s maturation after the events of the 4th Grail War shown in Fate/Zero.FROM NOW ON THERE WILL BE SPOILERS.The anime is divided into two parts: the first which, in small stand-alone investigative cases, acts as a worldbuilding and presentation of some characters, and the second in which the main events of the anime transpire.Earlier I wrote that you shouldn\'t approach this anime with the desire to see cases like those of Sherlock Holmes because the main issue is that Lord El-Melloi II is set in a world of mages.

The series is a spin-off of Fate/Zero, which is a prequel to the most popular visual novel in Japan, ""Fate/stay night"".The plot takes place somewhere between 2001 and 2004. The main character, Waver Velvet, AKA Lord El-Melloi II, is a lecturer in the Magus Association headquarters, the Clock Tower. Because of his debts he, together with a girl named Gray which is his assistant of sorts, has to help in many different crime investigations.I\'m gonna start with flaws, because most of them are located before the Rail Zeppelin part (I\'m going to call this part ""the introduction"") started.To begin with, Gray. Gray is the biggest plus and minus at the same time.Her voice actor did an excellent job. It\'s so thrilling to hear her fluently switch between high-note screams full of despise and whispering the level unlock chant. That alone got me madly hyped during the final fight. On the bonus note, she sometimes sounds like my favorite female VA ever, so that\'s even better. However, while we are at it, I have to mention this: Engrish. I know how R and L work in Japanese so I can let sketchy R pronunciation pass, but ""kuleiv"" (crave) killed me.Gray\'s personality (or rather its remnants that we got to see) is also a big advantage of her character, if not the whole series. She is quite a bit toned down when Waver is around, but when he isn\'t she gets really interesting. Her personality isn\'t easily explainable, I can\'t even assign any character archetype to her. I\'m just gonna say she is charming, but not stupid, as the most of alike her are. One example of that which comes to my head is that she once bought a gift for Waver, but was too anxious to give it to him. She tried, but time and time again she would back out a second before making the move. She finally managed to give it in the last episode, and the wait was rewarded with a really happy scene between the two.Additionally, Add (10/10 pun, ik). This happy little cube (or a scythe. Or a shield. Or a giant King Arthur\'s lance) and its interactions with Gray aren\'t the most common thing, sadly, but my god are they funny. I sure got a good laugh at least twice, especially in the last episode. Its irony and friendly taunts are just on point.Wasn\'t I supposed to be complaining? Right.First fatal mistake of the series (funny, like, isn\'t something fatal supposed to be singular?): Gray\'s backstory - or rather the not-so-total lack of it.When it comes to backstories there are two options: give the viewer at least the amount of a character\'s history that you need to and then use it to thicken the plot, or don\'t give the backstory at all and don\'t use it as a story expander. Can you guess which one Troyca chose to go with? Anyway, you are wrong - they chose neither of those.I know this series is based on 10 long novels and they just couldn\'t possibly have fit her story in full, but I just don\'t understand their move here. Why would you unveil just a little of mystery (that Gray was rescued by Waver from some village - like I myself couldn\'t deduct that he saved her from how loyal and attached to him she is), but then full-fledged use it in the darn climax of the series? I just have too little information to understand what the priest said to her just before he died - I only understand that it was important. Oh well, at least it was short enough to get me just a little mad.Another got-me-irritated thing: everybody is speaking Japanese, for no apparent reason. The action takes place in Great Britain (and Iraq), why wouldn\'t they be speaking in English? I\'ve seen only two series with the action going on outside of Japan, the other one being Great Pretender. In the latter authors were able to justify making everyone speak Japanese, why couldn\'t they do something about it here? It\'s such a tiny detail, but it breaks the immersion a bit.Let\'s get away from the characters for a bit and talk \'bout art style (and the technical execution overall).I like it. Characters are a tiny bit plain; I\'d like for, for example, Waver\'s coat to be a little bit more detailed, but on the other hand, Gray\'s outfit is quite    pretty - although until like the 11th episode I haven\'t noticed that it was a dress.Next up - animations, camera movement, CGI, color palette, shadowing. These are all really nice. Not amazing, no, but for a low-budget adaptation to a spinoff of a prequel, they\'re great. Colors are nice and more on the colder side, which fits the mood well. Oh, and I\'m impressed with how well did they manage to animate magic. Normally it\'s nothing hard, but when you are restrained by the way it works (eyes glow = on, eyes not glow = off), animating it so captivatingly is surely hard. Also, god damn was the final fight beautiful, no other words to describe it. Lastly, the soundtrack. It\'s no Monogatari Series, but it\'s great nevertheless. Only the opening disappoints.But I said this anime is flawed, didn\'t I? As for now, I brushed off every flaw I pulled out, right? It ends here.The second fatal mistake. The one which actually influences on the score I\'m going to give, the one which made the introduction such a hassle. Lore explanations.Sounds stupid. Everyone loves to experience some juicy lore. I also do. Some context: I am a Nasuverse (is El-Melloi even a part of Type-Moon? I don\'t know anymore) fan; I watched Fate/Zero; I saw Fate/stay night both in the original and adapted form; I watched Kara no Kyoukai. In short, I have a bigger than average knowledge on how does magic in Nasuverse works... and I heavily struggled to understand Waver\'s explanations of not only the lore, but also on what just happened and why it happened (heh, whydunit). Thus, each and every episode of the introduction is just a big question mark to me. Things, however entertaining they wouldn\'t be, are happening pretty much randomly and Waver is pulling his brilliant answers out of thin air. Even my initial (after episode 0) impression was ""I\'m hooked, but I\'m not really sure on what exactly..."".Of course, our heroes gettin\' on the magic train didn\'t change anything in that regard, but the explanations then were easier and happened much less often. Wow, who could have guessed that not trying to pack 700 pages into 40 minutes of screen time would make everything clearer.Ah, this really aggravated me. Listen, I\'ve seen Danganronpa, I can sense when something from the source material is getting skipped. In Lord El-Melloi my plothole detector was ringing a lot more than it should. Example? I said this before - dying priest\'s words. They were darn important, but without context provided from omitted parts, they just made no sense.Ok, I\'m good now. Let\'s praise it some more.Humor. It\'s great! You already know my opinion on Add, but it isn\'t the only comedic aspect of this anime. I swear, I have at least five saved screenshots of Yvette\'s dialogues and more or less the same goes for Reines (her jokes just couldn\'t age any better). A subtle reference to the F/sn (""King Arthur was a guy, right?"") made my day once.We are getting closer and closer to the meat of the matter, but just one thing before that: Waver. I didn\'t like him at first because he was kinda cold and seemed haughty, he also definitely ain\'t my favorite Fate/Zero character, but after we got to know him a bit more and learn of his depression after Iskandar\'s sacrifice, it\'s easy to start feeling sorry for him. He often spaces out during lectures or unintentionally lets his sorrow out, those moments were sad. On the other hand, his brain is just massive. Remember ""Murder on the Orient Express""? He would\'ve solved that case in a day.Oh, but I\'m getting ahead of myself. The plot.Or rather just the part that is understandable and not rushed (let\'s keep a conspiracy of silence over the rest, hm?). The titular ""Rail Zeppelin"". Incredibly captivating, making you think, inducing heart-throbs and thrills.A quick summary: Iskandar\'s coat (very powerful and even more important magic artifact) gets stolen and the thief leaves Waver an invitation to the Rail Zeppelin, a mystic eyes train. Mystic eyes are like superpowers and on this train is the only place in the world where you can buy/sell them (yes, sell eyes. Your own, of course. This happened). Not so long after the train gets off, a murder happens, and the victim\'s head is nowhere to be found. While the mystery of the crime slowly unveils, the thief from before attacks Waver, seriously wounding him and knocking him unconscious for some time. While he is unavailable the train suddenly changes tracks and goes into a cursed forest. The rest is solving the mysterious murder and theft, which are strangely connected to each other.It seems pretty basic. Like just another detective story. Let me assure you, it\'s not. The viewer is kept in suspense to the end (hell, even after it, the epilogue leaves just another cliffhanger!). Whydunit and whodunit are supposedly unveiled multiple times, but the real answer remains to be seen. It isn\'t, however, only a crime investigation. There is another plot thread - a direct attack from the thief. There are some fights (better or worse, depending on the story progress - at first they are kinda static, the characters would just grapple with their weapons and talking over it. They get more creative and nonlinear with time), and there is an absolutely epic final battle scene where Gray uses her full potential (I mentioned this moment like 7 times already, that\'s how good it is).I liked a lot of little things about narrative. The narrator does not give us any more information than Gray knows (Gray, not Waver, because he knows everything), which does happen from time to time in other series and aggravates me heavily. When there are two plots threads happening at the same time the one we are following would constantly switch in a Hollywood-like way (the camera moves and the scene changes etc.). Flashbacks are greatly balanced, they are never annoyingly long. I could go on and on, but I don\'t want to spoil all the plot lol.It\'s getting kinda long, isn\'t it? Let\'s get to the verdict.8/10.Why so high? Hm. You know, I tend to say that ""a good series can be destroyed by a horrible ending and vice versa. In the end, the part you are going to remember the most vividly is going to be the climax"". This is true here. Is this series a masterpiece? Nah. It\'s flawed, rushed and it just doesn\'t have this \'something\'. The first half is mostly forgettable, because you can\'t remember something without understanding it. There is nothing really fresh or innovative here, everything I have seen before in one form or another. Before the Rail Zeppelin part started I thought of giving it a 5/10 at most. However, the ending - especially the climax - managed to change this series for better. Again, no masterpiece, but a great way to spend four hours. Must-watch for a Fate fan. Watch out for the cliffhanger - it\'s spicy.I\'m hooked. I would happily read the books... but they are getting translated at a speed of a monkey with a writing machine. I guess I\'m better off learning Japanese on my own...Gray... Rave... Crave... Deprave... Grave... me. Grave for you.

The art style is good...and the writing is alright. The episode was long but kept me entertained throughout. and the writing is alright. The episode was long but kept me entertained throughout.', 'Lord El-Melloi II\'s Case Files is a mystery for more than one reason. Not only does the main character Waver spend the series trying to solve cases, but you, as the audience, will also be required to conduct detective work, except this time on the plot and logic of the show itself. You\'ll analyze each character\'s nonsensical lines, replay the same section over and over again, and stay up all night pondering the meaning of a single episode, until you feel like a real detective.Watching this show feels like walking into a fourth year physics class halfway through the semester, while only being a...first year art student. The teacher presents a scenario and you\'ll try to wrap your mind around it, but having no prior experience or knowledge you\'ll have no idea what anything means. Everyone around you will act like everything makes sense, and major details won\'t be explained because it\'ll be assumed that you already know them. Unfortunately, this analogy gives this show too much credit, because at least in a physics course things would actually be logical. Lord El-Melloi II\'s Case Files features a jumbled mess of unclear motives, unecessary personalities, illogical explanations, and finally an incoherent plot. All of the cases involve magic, which is just an excuse for the author to make up whatever they feel like and pretend like it makes sense. It would actually be surprising if they were sobre when they wrote this, because you could not explain the plot of even one episode without sounding completely crazy. For example, in one episode, a man dismembers himself and places his own body parts in specific locations all around his mansion. His heart is placed in the middle, because he believes in the heliocentric model (his family believes in the geocentric model). How does this have to do with anything? It\'s because the heart represents the sun, obviously. In another case, a few of the supporting characters get stuck in a ""bounded field"", that is essentially a room that opens in on itself so that no one inside can escape. The characters stand there, pondering the motive of whoever trapped them, and all sorts of deep questions revolving around this mystery. After 5-10 minutes of thinking, one of the characters simply walks into a random hallway, beats up a bunch of their own automated guards, and saves the day. It turns out it was all a misunderstanding and the security configuration of the building had turned against these characters arbitrarily because one of the characters had messed up one of the magical settings within the building. Did that not make sense, even though I said in a matter-of-fact tone? That is exactly what every mystery\'s explanation is like. And even if you buy into this illogical answer, I can\'t think of any mystery more riveting than one that\'s caused by the main character\'s own absent-mindedness. Once again, it would be surprising (and even more disappointing) if the author was sobre while writing this.The entire ""mystery"" aspect of this show is a joke. The real mystery is figuring out what\'s going on, but nothing makes sense in the first place so there isn\'t even any point. The characters are okay, but they\'re not fleshed out enough because arbitrary characters get more screen time than the important ones, and because the show generally doesn\'t spend much time on characters in the first place. Oddly enough, the characters would be better off in a slice of life/comedy rather than a mystery show, as there are hints of these themes and they are done quite well.

This anime was a unique take on the Fate series. From all the action based anime with a little drama we got a from the fate series, this was a mystery based drama with action sprinkled in there and I was here for it. One problem with the story was how confusing and hard it was to understand the mysteries in this anime. Trying to grasp the root of the mystery was really hard and I could only get about half...of it when the case was solved. One thing I did love about the story was the world outside the fate stay night series. Information on Mage society and the infrastructure on how they live was intriguing. Character interactions was the highlight of this show. I love how people act with Waver. They sprinkled in a few funny moments that made me chuckle. One thing I love about this show was Waver maturity. He went form daddy step on me energy to Oh Oh Oh STEP ON ME DADDY and I fucking love it. Just seeing the inner chad in him just pop out was one of the greatest highlights of the fate franchise for me. Ost wasn't memorable for me but the OP just makes me want to bust. Animation was also very clean. For a studio that wasn't ufotable I am impressed. I really have to say I am grateful that this series was created. of it when the case was solved.

Instead of focusing on a glorious treasure, this anime focuses more on the life of Mages and the strife they go through. The anime goes through several murder mysteries that make you realize its not just enemies that have to fear mages; their friends and families are not as safe as they would prefer to be. Before beginning this anime, watchers should make sure they have a basic understanding of how the Fate world works as the anime takes you through one fantastical scenario after the next. Although the...main character does explain his thought process in finding the culprit, similar to novels for Sherlocke Holmes (mc even says Elementary a few times lol), the magic and mysteries in the Fate world is quite advanced. I found this anime to be a lovely change of pace for the Fate World and am sure for people who like fantasy, mystery, and character development, you will enjoy it as well. main character does explain his thought process in finding the culprit, similar to novels for Sherlocke Holmes (mc even says Elementary a few times lol), the magic and mysteries in the Fate world is quite advanced.

I have not read the F/SN visual novel, and I have watched only two of the animated routes (UBW and HF), as well as F/Z. Still, I was familiar with Waver\'s story going in, and I thought that would be enough to understand this series. I was wrong.Rail Zeppelin (I\'m not typing out the whole title) is less the mystery series it claims...to be and more of a 13 episode convoluted dump of Fate lore. Dozens of people, organizations, magic abilities, and artifacts are mentioned so rapidly I could hardly keep track of what was going on. The first half of the show consists of episodic mystery storylines which in theory would be easier to follow but in practice introduced too many moving plot elements. The second half, taking place on the Rail Zeppelin train, follows a single storyline, but the amount of different events going on at the same time was dizzying. It is not a mystery whose solution you can guess by paying attention to the show. Plot twists are introduced seemingly out of thin air at least three times an episode. This may not be an issue for some, and if you don\'t mind that, you are perfectly valid and may wish to check out this show if you\'re a Fate fan. However, while I personally am rather poor at guessing plot twists or solving mysteries ahead of time, during a good mystery series I can look back after a reveal and go ""Oh! THAT\'S what that was about!"" With this show, it\'s nearly impossible. Not to mention the countless moments where characters are shown to have predicted many complex and improbable events in advance. Again, this is more of a personal pet peeve of mine. It\'s much more compelling when a character encounters a shocking roadblock and must adapt or risk a terrible failure. Plus, given how convoluted the events of this show becomes, it breaks my immersion when characters has a ""just as I planned!"" moment for something so unpredictable. Finally, while keeping this complaint as vague as possible to avoid spoilers, a series falls flat for me when the grand reveal of the entire series involves an entity which was completely unmentioned by the plot until the very end of the show. While this show sets up such a moment with heightened drama and tense music, I could not care less about the reveal since I had no investment in what was involved.One more extremely nitpicky thing. The ""WHYDUNIT"" and ""Grave... crave... deprave..."" moments were so comically clunky that they killed any drama I might have felt during whatever scene was going on.There were a few things I did enjoy about the show, however. Waver was one of my favorite characters in F/Z, and I loved seeing his journey continue here. Seeing how much of an impact Rider left on him was emotional and interesting to watch. Gray was also an interesting character, though I found her somewhat sadly underdeveloped. The art, animation, and music are gorgeous, and I really liked the opening and ending themes. I liked some of the side characters like Melvin and Caulas (though most of them just irritated me). Some of the humor fell flat, but there were some genuinely funny moments too.Overall, if you are a Fate fan, this series might be worth checking out for the lore, character building, and beautiful production quality.

Many frames so beautiful that I want to take them for wallpapers.The characters have nice designs. I understand that it was taken from the original source. But it was not screwed up. At times there are problems with the movements of the characters, it is not realistic. But it is a problem from the beginning of the anime. It does not apply to action scenes.2. StoryYou have to watch Fate/Zero to understand the anime.The plot blends several...detective stories that later become a whole history. The stories are spiced with anguish of the main characters. The anguish will be resolved by the end, but I cannot say so about the detective line. And you cannot guess who is the criminal, because you have not enough knowledge.

Major 2nd,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36565/Major_2nd,"['The very first scene seen in episode 01 offers enormous emotional depth when Daigo talks about his father and tells about his dreams in front of the class. The empty baseball fields at sunset work as the perfect, powerful backdrop while a soundtracks from the original series starts playing. The inability to meet the expectations set for him and the lack of natural talent required to follow his father\'s footsteps are the very core of his character. But he is not his father. It\'s time for him to be himself.When I started watching Major 2nd, I didn\'t expect it to hit me in the feels...with a baseball bat already in the first episode. This is the 7th season for the Major franchise, and it\'s nothing less than a love letter to its fans.The story is once again far from being perfect. The beginning suffers from compromises that were made in purpose of making this season watchable to a new audience that hasn\'t seen the original 6 while simultaneously trying to create the next generation of Major and its setup. The pacing is rather weird and jumpy, time skips happen already in very early stage. The 2nd main character introduction is random and could be called to be based on coincidences alone just to create the preferred settings for the anime itself. Basically the first 7 episodes are rather mediocre and messy, but once the beginning is left behind and the story starts advancing, we get a more consistent flow centering around the familiar things that Major has always done so successfully.The characters are fun to follow. Daigo\'s sister is absolutely lovely. She has clearly inherited her mother\'s temper. The voice acting alone makes me smile uncontrollably because the seiyuu work delivers so much personality. Especially the adult version of Shimizu has turned out fantastic. Daigo\'s pondering and uncertainty can be little annoying and feel filler-ish at times, but what it also did was leave more room for character development which Major 2nd relies almost as much as its predecessor. The romantic subplot plays much bigger role and the potential love interest is full of charm, much like all female characters in the series.The single best part of the cast is how there is not a single anime character in it. Anime as an adjective I mean. Everyone follows the realistic pattern where characters rely on their personalities. In one way, this is the polar opposite of let\'s say Kuroko no Basket where character specific skills/talents are essentially superpowers, personalities follow archetypes and character designs is based on the ""spot the main character"" tier fakeness. Major is downright genuine work, relying on itself and not on common tropes that create false appeal.When it comes to balance, that is certainly among the most impressive sides of this season. Every bit of drama and character centric insecurities are overcome during the baseball games where character development, character relations and sport intelligence all continue to advance. Seeing how our cast grows closer to each others while growing as persons as games advance, is the perfect example of awe-inspiring. Yet, at the same time, the matches itself exist as baseball games on the surface level, and the importance of this hasn\'t been forgotten. The smoothness creates a rather magnificent atmosphere that manages to make the series incredibly entertaining and offer a fresh experience.In one way, Major 2nd is nothing but light slice of life drama centering around baseball and focusing on character relations and development. It\'s a widely used formula in the sports genre and those who have never seen this to be anything special won\'t be changing their minds here either. What I see is an endless potential and Major 2nd is yet another massive success that managed to live up to its potential and offer beauty that can only be achieved under these settings. with a baseball bat already in the first episode.

Will you throw away everything just to not suffer anymore?Life's not fair, everyone s born with a gift but they desire things that cant achieve easily, that's why we struggle to become better persons.Before starting the review I'm going to say that Major is one of my favorite series of all time, both manga and anime, so I'm very excited and happy about this sequel, it's a shame that not much people are into sport, but I could not care less, I love it and I hope...people reading this review will change their minds.First of all it's a given that if you want to grow even more attached to the characters you have to read or watch the first series, and I know for a fact that reading 700+ chapter or watching 150+ episodes it s huge investment of time, luckly for you Major 2 dont revolve too much around the first series, so you can start and enjoy this as it is.Clearly is not going to be as epic as was with Goro, pitcher and catcher are obviously different roles that requires different types of skills.Story (9):The two main characters of the story are the sons of the famous Gorou, amazing pitcher and at the end of his career batter, and Toshiya the strategist catcher.They were chilhood friends and same thing is happening with their sons.This time around the roles are swapped, Daigo, Gorou son is not like his father, he doesnt have his powerfull arm nor his amazing talent, on the other end Hikaru has all the talent that Daigo wanted.Art (10):I'm a sucker for this kind of art. Simply beautifull, neat, colorfull and dynamic when it needs to be.Sound (9):The opening is good but I prefer the ending, voice actor and background sounds are really solid and do a good job to create the atmosphere needed.Characters (9):I guess people will find the attitude of Daigo quite annoying, but can you really blame him? Hikaru on the other end is so carefree and funny.Ohhhh Kaoru is simply fantastic haha her facial expressions are hilarious.A good cast full of potential in my opinion.Enjoyment (10):Even tought not as dramatic or epic like the first series I find Major 2 really relaxing, exciting when needed and funny to watch, I'm loving it, as much I did with Major 1.Thanks for reading. people reading this review will change their minds.First of all it's a given that if you want to grow even more attached to the characters you have to read or watch the first series, and I know for a fact that reading 700+ chapter or watching 150+ episodes it s huge investment of time, luckly for you Major 2 dont revolve too much around the first series, so you can start and enjoy this as it is.Clearly is not going to be as epic as was with Goro, pitcher and catcher are obviously different roles that requires different types of skills.Story (9):The two main characters of the story are the sons of the famous Gorou, amazing pitcher and at the end of his career batter, and Toshiya the strategist catcher.They were chilhood friends and same thing is happening with their sons.This time around the roles are swapped, Daigo, Gorou son is not like his father, he doesnt have his powerfull arm nor his amazing talent, on the other end Hikaru has all the talent that Daigo wanted.Art (10):I'm a sucker for this kind of art.

Its Major, but don't expect the first season of Major here in '2nd'. And oh, spoilers in the review.TL;DR - Its a great anime, but if you hold high expectations of this like i did, then maybe you might be slightly disappointed. However, it's still worth the watch and i have high expectations of subsequent seasons. If you're a fan of Major, definitely go ahead and watch. If you like sports anime in general, give it a chance, see if you like it. I'm sure subsequent seasons will be really good and this might be important for...those.This season of this possibly long series basically tackles the question of how expectations might affect a second generation (third actually) of a professional athlete family. And it portrays it well. Just it's not that interesting to me. The original Major, the entire series, was a testosterone filled, action packed and at times tear jerking series about the triumphs of Goro in his journey of becoming a baseball player. The first season of it as well fits that description. It was also about establishing the motivation of Goro, the early trials that he faced like his father's death, the motivation Gibson gave him and the like, and while great in itself, it largely helped propel subsequent seasons to greater emotional heights because we knew what Goro went through. His father's death and that epic match at the end of the tournament in the first season.I came into this expecting similar things. Now when i compare that with the new MC, Daigo, and his inability to cope with expectations placed on him because of his father's success, it just didn't have the same impact. I kept expecting Daigo to come up with a cool move or show inhuman determination that made everyone acknowledge his genius and make my spine tingle and my hairs stand on end. He doesn't. The show itself doesn't. And i guess the point is, the show and he shouldn't. Those kinds of things would be at odds with the theme its trying to deal with. Major 2nd feels much more grounded. Daigo, at least for now, isn't a baseball genius. The show repeatedly pounds you with that early on. The progress he makes throughout the show in terms of skill are minor (like learning how to bunt). Even later on, he doesn't make as much of an impact on games like Goro did. Mostly it's Daigo's best friend, and Satou's son, Hikaru, who is shown to be the baseball genius that the team needs to win games. And apart from him, the emphasis is more on Daigo dealing with his inferiority complex and how the entire team contributes collectively to their, and Daigo's, success.Needless to say, that requires strong secondary characters. And often, I found myself skipping through bits of the show because the character conflict it tried to drive just fell flat for me. Most of the characters are boring. The original had Goro to single handedly lead the show. Here it understandably tries to focus on multiple characters. Multiple, underdeveloped, weak characters. And did I mention how much I find the FMC this time irritating. Uh.(A bit of an aside, Mayumura's son is voiced by the guy from Konosuba - I didn't even need to check - and the entire time I found his lines hilarious because I kept seeing him in a comedic light. Still that guy is probably the most fun character in the show for me)The show has its moments however. It shines when there are matches to be played instead of conversations. The baseball is exciting as ever which kept me watching this. We look at what a few of the characters from the earlier season are doing and the final match of the show is great as well. Its basically a second generation version of the last match Goro had while a part of Kaido. In terms of characters that is, not epicness. It pales in comparison to the last match of major's first season as well. And I say that while not exactly remembering the specifics of how that match played out. This series still has a long way to go to get to those heights.A bit of a cursory comment on the other aspects. Art is good, nothing standout, consistent throughout. Sound...hmm i don't remember much about this lol. OP is ok. The second ED is just 'Uhh!'.That was long, and I probs repeated myself more than once, thanks for reading. Here's hoping there is more baseball and badassery next season. those.This season of this possibly long series basically tackles the question of how expectations might affect a second generation (third actually) of a professional athlete family.

The original had Goro to single handedly lead the show. Here it understandably tries to focus on multiple characters. Multiple, underdeveloped, weak characters. And did I mention how much I find the FMC this time irritating. Uh.(A bit of an aside, Mayumura's son is voiced by the guy from Konosuba - I didn't even need to check - and the entire time I found his lines hilarious because I kept seeing him in a comedic light. Still that guy is probably the most fun character in the show for me)The show has its moments however. It shines when there are matches to be played instead of conversations. The baseball is exciting as ever which kept me watching this. We look at what a few of the characters from the earlier season are doing and the final match of the show is great as well. Its basically a second generation version of the last match Goro had while a part of Kaido. In terms of characters that is, not epicness. It pales in comparison to the last match of major's first season as well. And I say that while not exactly remembering the specifics of how that match played out. This series still has a long way to go to get to those heights.A bit of a cursory comment on the other aspects. Art is good, nothing standout, consistent throughout. Sound...hmm i don't remember much about this lol. OP is ok. The second ED is just 'Uhh!'.That was long, and I probs repeated myself more than once, thanks for reading. Here's hoping there is more baseball and badassery next season."", ""SpoilersAfter 8 years of Major being off our screens, finally a glimmer of hope appears:major 2nd is the continuation from, 6 seasons of Major as well as a Major Movie and 2 Major OVA series.the story starts with different characters compared to the original anime, to be precise the sons of titular characters Goro and Toshi from the original run.the story seems similar to the start of the first season , taking it back to the basics, however, I'm not sure whether Major 2nd will be able to wrap up the current series as well as the original series was ended.if any of you haven't...seen major before, be it for dislike of sports anime or don't want to watch the older series due to quality, i recommend you take some time to catch up, however it is not required nor is it necessary to enjoy Major 2nd.Major, in my opinion is quite different from other baseball anime such diamond no ace, for example Major from Season 1-6 and throughout the OVA's show you not just Goro's kindergarten days as seen is the first series but shows you his progression through life, from being a child to being a grown adult having played professionally in America and now returning to Japan, from which point the story is continued with Major 2nd.So all I can say to leave you with is, if you enjoy an anime following the story of a underdog who rises from zero living in the shadow of their father before they find their own light and shine through, i thoroughly hope you enjoy Major 2nd as much as many people who grew up watching the original 6 seasons did.Shamial, thanks for the proofreading! seen major before, be it for dislike of sports anime or don't want to watch the older series due to quality, i recommend you take some time to catch up, however it is not required nor is it necessary to enjoy Major 2nd.Major, in my opinion is quite different from other baseball anime such diamond no ace, for example Major from Season 1-6 and throughout the OVA's show you not just Goro's kindergarten days as seen is the first series but shows you his progression through life, from being a child to being a grown adult having played professionally in America and now returning to Japan, from which point the story is continued with Major 2nd.So all I can say to leave you with is, if you enjoy an anime following the story of a underdog who rises from zero living in the shadow of their father before they find their own light and shine through, i thoroughly hope you enjoy Major 2nd as much as many people who grew up watching the original 6 seasons did.Shamial, thanks for the proofreading!"", ""Honestly didn't like the first couple episodes, but it brought me in the same way the original Major did.The setting/premise for the series was perfect.Gotta admit the character growth was larger than i expected. It brought tragedy in like how the original series did, which I didn't think it would. I liked how they played that.It made us focus on other characters problems, which again followed the original series.I didn't like how when they pitched or hit, there were sparkles. Bad animation choice....But that final episode was amazing. Brought in all the feels.Overall great series if you watched the original one. And if you're new I'd say it is a good one with some weird problems. But if they follow suit and provide multiple seasons, it'll grow into something big. But that final episode was amazing.

Although Im not a baseball fan (I like sports though), it was very wholesome, inspirational and unpredictable.Major 2nd was unwatchable to me by episode 7. The ""Satou"" 2nd is very flimsy as far as background and character development go. Very ""friendship and baseball"" with the only substance being young Shigeno\'s (2nd) trying to step out of his fathers shadow.But instead of focusing on that its mostly the mother and sister talking about the boy constantly and manipulating him into playing baseball. I was very annoyed by those two as the first 7 episodes...(atleast) were mostly them being almost cruel to a boy whos trying to figure out things thatre bigger than baseball.... Instead, all the nagging and manipulation make it very gynocentric although its a boy\'s sport.This seems to be geared to a very young audience that will not read too deep into it and just go with the ""friendship power"" theme. Its like the original Major if all the deeper plot points and thorns were removed.

It\'s something you fulfill of your own will."" - Moritaka Mashiro (Bakuman)This quote is from another great/masterpiece anime but it fits in here perfectly. You probably watched the whole main Major series so you probably can expect what this anime is about. If you dont have seen the main series please watch it, its very great but even if not you can watch Major 2nd. There is nothing you cant understand if you didnt watched the main series.Back to the quote: Major 2nd is not only another season of Major its very diffrent from...the main series. While the whole main series is about Goro shigeno the boy we see grew up and find out the reasons why baseball isnt only an sport for him... Major 2nd takes place with Daigo, the son of goro shigeno - a pro baseball player. It sounds like the same plot as the main series because goros father was also a pro baseball player. But Daigo is a lot diffrent than goro. He feels the expectations very hard. Yes, he likes baseball and want to play it like his father did and his father did, but he hasnt the talent like his father with a monster throw. His body is weak even for his age.This anime is about a boy who likes baseball and want to play it but gets pulled down from expectations and a nonexistent talent. Also it shows you a littel more of baseball next to only pitching. Now there are some positions in a baseball team who will get more spotlight. Also the grewing up of Daigo is a lot diffrent from his father, aswell as the grew up from Hikaru, a other son of an pro beaseball player. Also the sister of Daigo Izumi is a interesting new character, there was no character like her in the main series. If you want something the same like the main series Major you will get disappointed but if you are open for baseball and struggel with expectations and nonexistent talent, exchanged with training and hard work you will like this anime.So far I like Major 2nd. It is diffrent from the main series and a littel bit harder to get close to it but give it a try. I think it is worth your time! AT least it is worth my time. There only 6 episodes out yet thats why my opinion can change a littel bit if this series tooks a other path.Last but not least I hope you will enjoy the series like I do and apologize my bad english I am from germany so it is not my mother tongue. the main series.

Just the story and character development is superb. No anime compares to this anime in terms of character development and story telling. I have the seen the first major series a long time ago so seeing a new sequel come out really made me excited. this sequel was definitely worthy to be its predecessor.Characters: Definitely the strongest point for the whole majority of the major series the character development is without a doubt the best I've seen from the characters background...to intense emotional cut-scenes that really make you feel bad for the character. Hopefully this season will add to that and more!Story: Major has A really amazing story line no argument its one of the best relating to sports.Overall: IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE ORIGINAL MAJOR GO WATCH IT NOW EVEN IF YOUR NOT A SPORTS FAN TRUST ME YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY WITH THE EMOTIONS AND THE FEELS WATCH IT NOW!DONT WATCH THIS SEASON BEFORE WATCHING THE ORIGINAL FIRST! to intense emotional cut-scenes that really make you feel bad for the character.

While I consider myself a fan, I think the original series is far from perfect and suffers from consistent flaws from start to finish.One of my biggest issues with the previous show was how similar each arc was. This may be a controversial statement, but the original Major kept retreading on the same conflicts, some you even see in other baseball manga before and after its inception. Goro's development, at least to me, peaked in S2, and we've only seen micro-improvements...to Goro's skill and character since then, with the only unique issue being his yips in S6.All of this to say is that I was pleasantly surprised to see Major 2nd tread in a completely different path than the original series. Goro from the start was shown to be an incredibly talented individual with his independent goals. Daigo on the other hand is less talented and has to fight the pressure of his legacy. The combination of the two makes his journey as a character more poignant as an athlete than anything I really saw from Goro in my opinion. There's also significantly more highlighting of the side characters in Major 2nd that the original started to mostly forget, especially in later seasons of the show. Finally, Daigo is a catcher, one of the most interesting positions in baseball but one that's constantly overshadowed by most baseball manga in favor of highlighting the pitcher. This new perspective that you don't see in almost any other manga makes this a unique and fascinating read.This is not to say that Major 2nd is perfect, I think the show in particular has a weird and borderline unhealthy view of child development in how they go about encouraging baseball. While it's not really too bad in the beginning, it gets really bizarre in the final few episodes to the point where it's hard for me to wrap my head around.That being said, Major 2nd overall brings so much flavor and uniqueness using Daigo as the star of the story that Major never offered. The original Major felt like gourmet french fries. It tastes good, it's flashy, and it's well-made, but ultimately you only appreciate the first fry for so long before you just scarfing piece after piece down and it all blends together. I genuinely believe that Major 2nd is on track to be much more ambitious than that and more than any other season of Major I've seen to this day, I'm incredibly excited to see what comes next. to Goro's skill and character since then, with the only unique issue being his yips in S6.All of this to say is that I was pleasantly surprised to see Major 2nd tread in a completely different path than the original series.

Instead, they\'ve nearly dropped detailes overall WHILE pruning character power levels, at the same time making characters show their big feelings, making it hard to use empathy there, because not much happened, can only say ""omg just play normally...already 4Head "", when in the 1st this was the fans work, they yelled from stands and made you feel for players, trying their best. But here, it feels like Major making a step to Dia no Ace, with random no setup events having a chance to make u just roll eyes and say ""whatever happens already"". Not nesessarily the improvement, ehm.But if you\'ve watched the first one, you\'re nearly obligated to watch the 2nd, a mere connection between them is already enjoyable, the bitter side is that it may be mosly this element that will carry.Honestly, it lost a lot of qualities first anime had, it gained some details thing, but lost so many other elements, it feels like some pocket budget 1st. As I said, it does have that Dia no Ace dreadful scent, which had completely random outcomes every time, for, I guess, ""realism"", but it backfired as hard as possible, printing that indifference to the outcome feeling I honestly DONT want to feel. I mean, finding flaws mode is fun to use when the info can be used, but when the project is already up to gold, there\'s nothing to use from those unfounits you\'ve generated gathering smaller infounits with organse of senses... It\'s an artificial story, don\'t need it to be random, how can one be exited if it\'s literally ""whatever happens, all Random Number Generator"", now generate a nickname for me as well pls coz whatever my name will be, let\'s all be indifferent. It should teach some meaningful stuff + it should be cool at the same time. And ""meaningful stuff"" is usually some ""improved from training, that\'s why it happened this way""(did pitch out some really strong batter who every1 thought is gna get the homerun or big hit, etc.), or whatever else plot, but this RPG factor or some interesting plot factors are abscent so much. Sure anime had some good old Bats ""no motivation, whatevah, I will kill u guys if I will miss the date with Jenny"" lazy molding skill of baseball vibes, but in a new key of just girls bumping that boy puberty muscle mass increase wall, but way too many random moments in between them. Hope we got why random moments are bad already, why reality thing is not good because there are actual MLB matches, can watch those and it will even be more detailed, with every pitch speed and course, can even sit and write down all pitcher/batter habits strengths weaknesses etc if able to see em, but this is not a freggin MLB, this is an artificially made piece of content which should entertain right here right now, with limited time. Real matches last 1-2hrs and its exhausting to wait for anything dramatic to happen, but in anime there should be those moments. That\'s why I gave only 7 for Enjoyment, honestly ok Art is 9, good new effects and stuff, drawing is whatever to me, I can see shadows and stuff done well enough, Story 7 as well, I mean, Hikaru bumping into the chest is way too dragged by ears, some other moments as well, they an author cannot make something happen with crossing all events logically and just drags it by ears, I personally instantly see it, like, set it up, man, don\'t just throw it in randomly. Reminds some Sasukeh moments where he just forcefully survives 100500 Deidara explosions zero scratches recieved, like that Tao girl that were smug about not getting dirty and playing halfhearted(which in 1st ssn would\'ve been seen isnta and beat out of, btw), these dragged by ears moments that are almost against all odds in the situation, it\'s like a negative set up or something, really makes feel dreadful. This feeling like robbed of some dramatic setup, as if ur Niko from GTA IV and Roman is showing u his home for the first time and u realise it was all a lie, all that bragging. I know the anime is still partly done well and sometimes almost at the 1st Major lvl, but at times it drops like a forkball. Pitchers throwing 4 balls left and right without stopping on 3, all the atmosphere on not giving the damn is getting to me, honestly making not give the damn as well, keeping in synch by default. The first ssn could\'ve been more RPGy, but for some reason it wasn\'t, author didn\'t show us that everything is trainable, like it was with Goros\' left hand pitching after breakin the shoulder, which is a great real life lesson as well, I would\'ve enjoyed some plot like that for the 2nd time EASY, because it\'s SO REAL, can rehab irl big time, some ppl cure their freggin fatal knee injury in some 4 months when every doctor says that 2year and dont even try faster, I mean they prob use some peptides or w/o hormonal stuff but ye, worth a try when it\'s a career yeh/na question in the air. Making that shoulder gain power was, after all, the thing that was most likely the essential RPG element for the story, but the Daigo RPG did stop even much before the 2nd ssn(of 2nd Major), he learnt some technique, aight, now throwing a bit better, where\'s the rest of RPG, why is there no info about how he\'s building the shoulder up, I mean, why not, Goro did all kinds of stuff like that even with a strong one, and it reflects the reality as well, u can build muscles, in any exercises suitable, for pitching even, EZ, and if he had ABSOLUTELY NO way of building the shoulder enough for monster speed pitching his pops did, Major 2nd could\'ve had a thing about breaking balls, some deeper breaking ball meta, detailed breaking balls strats, that\'s what the 1st ssn did lack, all Fastball-Fastball-Fastball till the very end almost, when atm some Kershaw uses all kinds of em pitches, some clutch once in a thousand times Euphus, and the trick with a moving fastball + fast slider(Katori thing from the 1st), making best batters swing like a yard away coz they look extremely similar, this is what Major did lack, as for me. That Mayumura skillset, where he in reality had not as insane fastball as Shigeno did(even if a close one, it seems), but made up for it more than enough with insane breaking balls development, where he could pierce em through the strike zone by one pixel and before that make em fly in and away completely outside of the strike zone. 1st ssn had these things with ""pitches looking similar and super hard to hit"", with Katori ""kousoku suraida"" feint with pitching into the ball course to feed Goro a fake slider he was training to hit, because they\'ve defined what he\'s trying to hit by looking at where his eyesight is directed to. Or with Bravo(Cuba) pitching in the World Cup, where he had 3 similar lookin curves, and the biggest curving one pitching out the almighty Kyoshiro. Fox was also doing tricks like that to make up for Sanchezu lack of control coz he\'s a slow starter. But still those were like rare ones, although I like how they were set up to, it felt so natural that it was unreally cool. In Major 2nd not only setups aren\'t done sometimes, but also stuff isn\'t that cool as well. Honestly, everything is pruned, like that shoulder of the main hero. If you prune the starting abilities of the hero then make up for it with deeper RPG stuff, that technique of throwing like Kyoshiro is a good start, now add some mad training with some rubber strings, some athletic ball throwin or whatever! :OThe anime is done in a way that really has that deep RPG intended, yet the author makes the skip of details value even larger than in the 1st Major, where it worked perfectly with the monstrous power characters\' irrational kind of vibes, being in the zone not caring about details and smashing, the ""flow"" essence of irrationality, giving all plots in maximally natural way, at the same time drawing crazy shonen energized scenes. But here in 2nd, when no strength, need precision, right? And this is what makes it really weird, approaching us from the ""This is actually The Smart Terrotory, bby"" way, with the main protagonist Daigo being a catcher, seemingly moving to that Jeff Keene thing with being efficient as a supercomputer with teamplay and ordering pitches and smashing hard by doing that, yet all details just SINK ezpz, who threw a sinker with details boiz, making random number generator matches with Daigo not droppin a single sweat particle, watching his pitcher throw 3 balls, each worse than the one before, some TWELVE times in a season, while showing him as ""attentive to all details and smartplaying it"", and ofc it turns to 4 balls each time, every1 is surprised, ikr, how comes. Even in the 1st ssn, that had that hard-boiled irrational madskill flavor, some Komori or Toshiya did insta yell ""TIIIME!!"" at like Ball 2, let alone 3, and asked pitcher if he ate some tomato with milk, or told him he\'s danzo, gabella, kapit, and he will just lose all ERA the next pitch, like Keene did, or Goro with ""Kawabata, lemme talk with Toshi for a sec I\'m sure that he understands the situation"" and then straight up flaming him to the ground for being confused as a catcher. But they DID give the damn, even back then, in the irrational monsterpower 1st Major!When watching 1st, I could relate on so many things, it felt like I\'ve lived through the same even if not being a Major Leaguer. 2nd needs plenty of fixing in the future if there will be one, to make ppl relate to it easier, so far it\'s been some minor(league) value of that, some niche elements of sympathy. Let\'s hope Masuda will get it better next time, and, hell ye, all to gym, boiz, rebuild em shoulders :> already 4Head "", when in the 1st this was the fans work, they yelled from stands and made you feel for players, trying their best.

And this is what makes it really weird, approaching us from the ""This is actually The Smart Terrotory, bby"" way, with the main protagonist Daigo being a catcher, seemingly moving to that Jeff Keene thing with being efficient as a supercomputer with teamplay and ordering pitches and smashing hard by doing that, yet all details just SINK ezpz, who threw a sinker with details boiz, making random number generator matches with Daigo not droppin a single sweat particle, watching his pitcher throw 3 balls, each worse than the one before, some TWELVE times in a season, while showing him as ""attentive to all details and smartplaying it"", and ofc it turns to 4 balls each time, every1 is surprised, ikr, how comes. Even in the 1st ssn, that had that hard-boiled irrational madskill flavor, some Komori or Toshiya did insta yell ""TIIIME!!"" at like Ball 2, let alone 3, and asked pitcher if he ate some tomato with milk, or told him he\'s danzo, gabella, kapit, and he will just lose all ERA the next pitch, like Keene did, or Goro with ""Kawabata, lemme talk with Toshi for a sec I\'m sure that he understands the situation"" and then straight up flaming him to the ground for being confused as a catcher. But they DID give the damn, even back then, in the irrational monsterpower 1st Major!When watching 1st, I could relate on so many things, it felt like I\'ve lived through the same even if not being a Major Leaguer. 2nd needs plenty of fixing in the future if there will be one, to make ppl relate to it easier, so far it\'s been some minor(league) value of that, some niche elements of sympathy. Let\'s hope Masuda will get it better next time, and, hell ye, all to gym, boiz, rebuild em shoulders :>']"
Meitantei Holmes,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1972/Meitantei_Holmes,"['I love this anime ever since I got it from my local Library. I found it by accident while looking for a different video (which seemed to not actually be there) and so picked it up.At first, I thought this was going to be serious like all the other Sherlock Homes creations out there but this is like a children’s version of the story. It feels strange to see Professor Moriarty actually taking part in the crimes instead of just having his henchmen doing it. It pulls away a lot from the normal story line with the difference that each show can pretty much...be standing on its own and you don’t need much to understand them. It’s like a crime of the week and I don’t remember if there was any that actually went 2 shows long.I like how whimsical they make the story and it has some of the feel as the real Sherlock Homes, although they don’t really let you try to piece together the crime yourself which makes me rather sad.I never really liked the music to it but I love the animals being portrayed as humans. Though sometimes the dogs look like cats such as a very small boy in one of the episodes. I wasn’t surprised when I found out that Miyazaki actually helped create this show even if some of it wasn’t the greatest. be standing on its own and you don’t need much to understand them.

The style of direction in this series is very similar to that film, as well as the scenic designs! And if you\'re a fan of the original Sherlock Holmes, all the better! ""Meitantei Holmes"" is a warm-hearted collection of episodic stories revolving around the most famous fictional detective, diurnally living in an anthropomorphized world!⚠️ This review will be spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersProbably the weakest link in this series is its continuity. Towards the...beginning of the series, Professor Moriarty takes the beautiful Mary Hudson (part of the ※triad of Sherlock\'s companions) hostage, and falls madly in love with her modest and virtuous demeanor. This plot point seemed very interesting, especially since Sherlock seems to be quite taken with her as well, but this progression is completely nixed after a couple of episodes that vaguely hint at it. While often being the case in televised programming, other shows are still able to be more tactful with keeping true to the prior character progressions.※ I assume she\'s a shoe-in for Irene Adler.Sadly, this series has no real character development. Something will be hinted at or shown to be canonical in one episode, but then, the next segment will completely ignore what had happened a mere episode earlier! It\'s ingratiating, because it feels as though there\'s no real growth happening. An example of where an episodic formula works really well in one of my all-time favorite shows, ""Galaxy Express 999""! Most of the characters that they meet along their galactic journey are never seen again and Maetel has a nearly impenetrable poker face, so the lead male character, Tetsurō, is shown undergoing a considerable evolution from wanting to escape impoverishment through immortality, and then accepting his mortality and being fine with his fragility and human limitations. The characters in ""Meitantei Holmes"" are like morsels of bean paste, in comparison to that!Luna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Hayao Miyazaki (director), notable works:* Gake no Ue no Ponyo* Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short* Hoshi wo Katta Hi (""The Day I Bought a Star"")* Howl no Ugoku Shiro* Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä ✅* Kaze Tachinu (""The Wind Rises"") ✅* Kemushi no Boro* Koro no Dai Sanpo (""Koro\'s Big Day Out"")* Kujiratori (""The Whale Hunt"")* Kurenai no Buta (""Porco Rosso"") ✅* Kūsō no Sora Tobu Kikaitachi* Lupin III: Cagliostro no Shiro ✅* Majo no Takkyūbin (""Kiki\'s Delivery Service"") ✅* Mei to Koneko Bus* Mimi wo Sumaseba (""Whisper of the Heart"") ✅* Mirai Shōnen Conan* Mirai Shōnen Conan: Kyodaiki Gigant no Fukkatsu* Mizugumo Monmon* Mononoke Hime* Nandarō (""What is it?"")* On Your Mark ✅* Pandane to Tamago-hime (""Mr. Dough and the Egg Princess"")* Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi (""Spirited Away"") ✅* Sora Iro no Tane (""The Sky-Colored Seed"")* Tenkū no Shiro Laputa (""Castle in the Sky"") ✅* Tonari no Totoro (""My Neighbor Totoro"") ✅* Yadosagashi (""House Hunting"")Commentary:  Mr. Miyazaki doesn\'t need an introduction, he is large reason why Japanese animations have become so much of a respected medium in the western hemisphere of the world. Simply put, ""Meitantei Holmes"" is visually stunning: the fluid animation, the expressive character motions, the gorgeous backdrops with an inventive configuration of shots. This series has Ghibli-tier production levels, but TMS Entertainment has a lot of clout to its name, too.

Love Live! Sunshine!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32526/Love_Live_Sunshine,"[""Love Live Sunshine is the successor to the popular Love Live, which recently ended with a movie. This continuation to the series really got me excited, since love live is one those anime that I don’t get tired or re-watching (I probably re-watch it twice a year or so.) and also at some point I religiously played the mobile game every single day. But still, in the end, little by little I got disappointed of the show throughout the season. Spoilers ahead for those who haven't finish them yet.The dialogue of the characters isn’t well thought out. It’s basically them spouting memes non-stop hoping that...some of them will stick as much as the infamous nico nico nii. Seriously,Hanamaru went from somewhat shy bookworm to just simply saying zura and mirai most of her dialogue. There’s also the part where she’s just stuffing her face with the noppo bread in the background most of the time just to fill the advertisement quota.The way they recruit their members feels forced, this got painful for me to watch when Yoshiko joined in specific. The setting is somewhat a rehash to the first LL the way I see it. There’s too many to point out but the point is that they basically just used the same plot points, which seems like lazy writing. The only part where it felt original was the third year drama.The most annoying part that really irked me is the constant mention of μ’s. I feel like they mention them too much, mentioning them a few times is okay and all but mentioning them literally all episodes except the last one is a little bit too much.Should you watch it because you’re a Love Live fan? Sure why not. Overall it’s not that bad of a show, I still enjoyed watching it on time every week, but I felt like they could do better, since the characters and the songs are pretty solid. But I guess to me this feels like more a last minute cashgrab to pander to the hardcore love live fans. some of them will stick as much as the infamous nico nico nii.

But I guess to me this feels like more a last minute cashgrab to pander to the hardcore love live fans."", 'I had very mixed feelings when I heard Love Live would be starting again with a new cast of characters. Muse had finally gotten to the point where each member had earned their place, and while it made sense for their story to end, I always felt a desire for more. I wanted it to be the beginning rather than the ending.Love Live Sunshine may not have been the beginning I wanted, but it is hardly a weak addition to the series. It does many of the things that made the original series so special, and more than justifies its own existence. I\'m glad...it exists, and am without any doubt looking forward to seeing more of Aquors.But Sunshine isn\'t without issues. It follows the footprints of the original series a bit too closely-- the flaws and missteps of its first half included and ever more so apparent.Sunshine, like the first season of the original, moves too fast and swims a bit too deep in the drama, rather than giving the audience the main thing they are looking for: reason to like and care for the girls. It sets a nice stage for the inevitable second season, but at the same time, it\'s hard to not feel a little bit bummed out when Sunshine starts with the same stumbles rather than learning from the original\'s excellent second season. If it sounds like I am being a harsh critic, you may be right, but part of that is because I have a strong attachment to the original series and want to see its successor reach the same highs. If it can\'t, wouldn\'t it be reasonable to lament that there is not just more Muse instead?Sunshine actually does a pretty admirable job with its drama. It never aims to be something more or different from what it truly is, and what is there is handled with meaning and clarity-- even if its themes are something we have heard a hundred times before-- and its bittersweet and well-timed background music consistently amplifies its message. Sunshine\'s heart is in the right place. The problem is just that there is just too much of this drama, too soon. Assuming there is to be more of Aquors (and I will bet my non-existent heart that there will be), the climax of their story is not now, but then. This isn\'t the time to bring them on the big stage, but to prepare them for it. They aren\'t ready, and neither is their audience.While Nico\'s ""Nico Nico-nii"" catchphrase was silly (and adorable), the original series did not ever attempt to paint that as a genuine part of her character; it was a joke even to herself, and entirely contrary to her personality. Yoshiko, and to a lesser extent, Mari and Hanamaru, are defined to varying extents by these sorts of catchphrases, without the same sort of depth or rationale to it that Nico\'s character had. Some may find Yoshiko\'s terminal autism to be amusing (and indeed it can be!), but these sorts of gimmicks do little else but make them feel somewhat artificial, at times even empty. And empty is the last thing a character from Love Live should be.But nine main characters is a lot to deal with in only thirteen episodes. The original series had yet to accomplish the same by that point, so, I suppose, it is only fair to expect Sunshine will also start hitting those strides from here on. Most of the girls (particularly Ruby) are cute and interesting enough in their own right, even if they have done little yet to stand out from the more outgoing characters. I\'m just worried that Sunshine has turned Yoshiko into such a joke that there may be no way of ever doing anything meaningful with her character. Making a serious character into a joke is an easy thing, but a joke into a real character is a much harder process.Aquor\'s rival group, Saint Snow, is certainly more interesting than the original\'s counterpart. Ria and Seira aren\'t successful because they are \'perfect\' idols, but rather because they have their own unique thing going on. There\'s a neat contrast between the traditional, idol-y nature of Aquors, and Saint Snow\'s more eclectic Babymetal leanings. Ria and Seira have reason to be hostile-- Aquors is the exact opposite of what they want to be.If you were to ask me why I have spent so much time comparing Sunshine to the original series, rather than discussing it solely on its own merits, it is because Sunshine itself does so on a regular basis. It doesn\'t try or even want to disconnect itself, and instead recognises and pays respect to Muse. The girls of Aquors started their group precisely because they were fans of Muse. It\'s the appropriate turn to take the franchise; if it attempted to be entirely its own thing, never making a reference to the original, it would feel a bit distasteful, considering just how similar a road the two shows travel. The only troubling part of it all is that it makes you long for Muse all the more.Sunshine continues the tradition of having some of the best music in the entire idol industry. I would argue that songs like ""Todokanai Hoshi datoshitemo"" and ""Kimi no Kokoro wa Kagaiyaiteru kai?"" are better than most of what real idol groups (Momoiro Clover et al.) produce. There may not be any real bangers like Start:Dash or Snow Halation, but I do find Aquors sneaking their way onto my playlist every now and then, too. Ruby\'s voice also may not be quite as lovely as Nico\'s or Kotori\'s, but she\'s still hella cute regardless.If it weren\'t being compared to its predecessor, Love Live Sunshine would still be one of the better idol anime produced. I have no problem with it, stumbles and tumbles aside, and can see both Love Live fans and newcomers to the franchise having a great time with it.Aquors just have yet to convince me that they are capable of standing on the same stage that Muse once did. I\'m open to being convinced otherwise-- heck, I want, and I expect to be convinced otherwise. There are certainly worse ways to start. it exists, and am without any doubt looking forward to seeing more of Aquors.But Sunshine isn\'t without issues. It follows the footprints of the original series a bit too closely-- the flaws and missteps of its first half included and ever more so apparent.Sunshine, like the first season of the original, moves too fast and swims a bit too deep in the drama, rather than giving the audience the main thing they are looking for: reason to like and care for the girls. It sets a nice stage for the inevitable second season, but at the same time, it\'s hard to not feel a little bit bummed out when Sunshine starts with the same stumbles rather than learning from the original\'s excellent second season. If it sounds like I am being a harsh critic, you may be right, but part of that is because I have a strong attachment to the original series and want to see its successor reach the same highs. If it can\'t, wouldn\'t it be reasonable to lament that there is not just more Muse instead?Sunshine actually does a pretty admirable job with its drama. It never aims to be something more or different from what it truly is, and what is there is handled with meaning and clarity-- even if its themes are something we have heard a hundred times before-- and its bittersweet and well-timed background music consistently amplifies its message. Sunshine\'s heart is in the right place. The problem is just that there is just too much of this drama, too soon. Assuming there is to be more of Aquors (and I will bet my non-existent heart that there will be), the climax of their story is not now, but then. This isn\'t the time to bring them on the big stage, but to prepare them for it. They aren\'t ready, and neither is their audience.While Nico\'s ""Nico Nico-nii"" catchphrase was silly (and adorable), the original series did not ever attempt to paint that as a genuine part of her character; it was a joke even to herself, and entirely contrary to her personality. Yoshiko, and to a lesser extent, Mari and Hanamaru, are defined to varying extents by these sorts of catchphrases, without the same sort of depth or rationale to it that Nico\'s character had. Some may find Yoshiko\'s terminal autism to be amusing (and indeed it can be!), but these sorts of gimmicks do little else but make them feel somewhat artificial, at times even empty. And empty is the last thing a character from Love Live should be.But nine main characters is a lot to deal with in only thirteen episodes. The original series had yet to accomplish the same by that point, so, I suppose, it is only fair to expect Sunshine will also start hitting those strides from here on. Most of the girls (particularly Ruby) are cute and interesting enough in their own right, even if they have done little yet to stand out from the more outgoing characters. I\'m just worried that Sunshine has turned Yoshiko into such a joke that there may be no way of ever doing anything meaningful with her character. Making a serious character into a joke is an easy thing, but a joke into a real character is a much harder process.Aquor\'s rival group, Saint Snow, is certainly more interesting than the original\'s counterpart.

There are certainly worse ways to start.', 'Last year, we were told that μ\'s had come to an end and a PV of the new LL! idol group was shown. Their name is Aqours. They are going to continue on the μ\'s legacy and (try to) become more successful than μ\'s. They are namely, Chika, Riko, You, Ruby, Yoshiko (or Yohane whichever preferred), Hanamaru, Dia, Mari and Kanan. I had indifferent opinions about them at first. I didn\'t delve too deep like how I did during the μ\'s era to be honest. None of them interested me because the brand new LL!Sunshine!! project was too rushed, where μ\'s was still around and...had their movie and their Final Live concert upcoming. While the news gave a slap to all the LL! fans, most of us started to worry if Aqours could do better than their predecessors.Now that it comes to an end with its finale being aired last night. Let\'s go!Story: 6/10Note: In LL!, story, is NEVER ever the selling point. Same goes to LLSS!!.Reusing and referencing the good ol\' stuff from μ\'s isn\'t a bad thing if the series is executed well. As a fan of the original LL! I sincerely hope that LLSS!! is better, or at least on par, with the original. Surely, the beginning looked promising and didn\'t disappoint me, and the rest of the series didn\'t either. A good beginning makes a good ending, eh? Not happening in LLSS!!, unfortunately.I am here just going to say, the ending... is not meant for everyone. The way the series ended was, not something I will rate 1/10 but still, bad. It could be done better but man, imagine you are sitting on the LLSS!! hype train all along the journey just to reach a cliff and everything goes downhill and bam.Art: 10/10One thing you can never complain in LL! and LLSS!! is their art. It\'s really good, and the art improves so much coming to LLSS!!. (tho the CG dance may be pretty annoying from time to time)Sound: 8/10For OP, OST and ED, they are really good. VAs did their amazing work too.My only concern goes to the inserts. They ARE good, but not impacting enough in their respective episodes.Character: 7/10I have a mixed feeling about the characters itself. 3rd years\' (Mari, Kanan, Dia) chemistry is great even though I am not a fan of either one of them. 1st years (Ruby, Hanamaru, Yoshiko) did a great job too though I never like Yoshiko (sorry but chuuni isn\'t to my liking). 2nd years (Chika, You, Riko) tho, they have the same problem as μ\'s (Kotori, Honoka, Umi) had. There\'s too much focus for them, and they aren\'t that great either.Enjoyment: 7/10I swear I really enjoy everything up to the 12th episode, but the finale is.... wew. Let\'s not talk about the weird skit which I think it\'s actually okay-ish, I am disappointed by the absence of ""Step ZERO to ONE"" after being referenced so much in the anime. The question ""Why do you not perform it and instead using a new song that doesn\'t give that much impact as a finale?"" will always be in my head from now on.Overall: 7/10 (Revised score: 8/10)The series is good, but nowhere better than the original LL! first season imo.TL;DR: A good start, with a badly executed ending. had their movie and their Final Live concert upcoming.

I myself was skeptical at first, incredibly worried this may be a case of ""milking the cash cow"". Thankfully, no. Sunshine has even surpassed the first season of the original Love Live in my eyes. Honestly, I\'m quite surprised with the outcome.Sunshine starts off with a story that sounds undeniably similar to that of the original. Let me clarify-- it\'s not an exact story copy. I\'d say only the base, its starting point, is the same. We won\'t, for instance, see our...lovely Nico look-a-like in the same kind of situation as the real Nico. The girls of Aqours each have their own story to tell.It certainly is hard to make a good anime with this many main characters in such a short amount of time. Love Live Sunshine is no different. Just like its predecessor, the girls did not receive an enormous amount of development. What do you expect from a show with nine main characters and just thirteen episodes? Things could\'ve been handled differently. Sunshine, unfortunately, repeats the same mistakes. A future second season would set things straight, probably, though. Yes, again, similar to the original. Then, why did I give Sunshine a much higher rating? I\'ll get to that in a bit.I don\'t blame anyone with a huge attachment to Muse to doubt the new series, with the introduction of complete new characters. Aware of that, though, I think they should still give Aqours a chance, a chance to shine. And, it sure did shine. Sunshine\'s cast is a whole lot more likeable and memorable than its predecessor. I had an easy time liking the characters, and even sympathized with them during emotional scenes-- even if I didn\'t like them one bit initially. Mari and You, just to note a few examples. The new girls are what made Sunshine so much better for me personally.Talking a little about my favorites; Chika, pretty much an exact copy of Honoka, the side-ponytail being the only difference. I\'m quite fond of her positiveness and leadership ability, and basically being the driving force of the group. Honoka was one of my personal favorites from Muse-- it wouldn\'t be that strange to have Chika as one of my favorite Aqours girl as well. Hanamaru, or rather Zuramaru as I like to call her, is a fun character, too. Not only is her lack of tech knowledge humorous, her zura\'s are also very charming. ""It\'s the future, zura!"" The girls each have their own quirks, some which may be irritating, and some that are genuinely fun. The one character with a disturbing amount of annoyance, though, is Yoshiko. She reminds me of that one Chuunibyou show I didn\'t like very much. Yoshiko comes over as obnoxious, and feels completely out of place. I\'d much rather have a different girl in her stead. Oh well, it can\'t be helped.What\'s more disappointing is the fact that a couple did not receive the screen time they deserved. And by that, I\'m actually mostly referring to a certain blue haired, ponytailed goddess. She had so little screen time in the first half of the show, I was starting to question whether or not she\'ll become a member of Aqours later. I guess that beach episode made up for it... uh, just a little bit. Kanan is a fine-looking lady for sure!Who is the real star of Aqours? The girl - who coincidentally looks a lot like Nico - with the gorgeous red twintails and aqua eyes, of course! Her name is Ruby, the one who invented cuteness and has the voice of an angel. She certainly stands out the most with her design, cute expressions and such. She made her debut in the first episode unlike the Nico. Ruby has already accumulated quite a reputation by just a couple scenes alone-- and now that I think about it, the show needed more of those. The more we got to the end, the less Ruby we got. Though, I was honestly not that upset about it. It indicates how much I actually liked Sunshine, even with the absence of Ruby in the latter episodes. Keep staying unbearably cute, it makes my life so much better. I am keeping this short, since I do not want this to turn into a Ruby love post. (I love her.)Now, I do have to mention that none of the new characters have been able to completely fill the gap that\'s been left behind by Nico. Ruby, though, is the cutest in the whole wide world and tries her absolute ""Rubesty"" to make up for it. Her efforts, however, were in vain. I still missed hearing the phrase ""Nico-Nico nii,"" but, oh well, I guess ""Ganbaruby"" is a decent enough replacement. I kind of go a little crazy whenever Ruby says it.Something that was quite bothersome was that there was no audition process of sorts going on. Chika was captivated by the beauty of this natural wonder, named Ruby. She got an invitation right on the spot. Apparently, looking gorgeous and cute is all that\'s needed for one to become a true school idol. Singing and dancing skills are irrelevant. Seriously though, this part has been ignored, yet again.Notable are the outstanding visuals, a huge improvement over the original. The show is very colorful and the background sceneries are very pretty, especially the seaside ones. And yes, there\'s still the use of 3DCGI during live performances. However, in Sunshine, it\'s less distracting, more fluid, and should now be on a tolerable level, which makes it more enjoyable to watch.The sound is what you would expect from the Love Live series. The musical performances are outstanding and definitely worthy of praise. The hardships the girls went through, following their dreams-- you can actually feel the emotions they put into their songs. Mirai Ticket, sung in the final episode, is especially a good example. The vocals are great and the voices of all Aqours girls fit well with each other, not to mention the regular voice acting is admirable, too. Have I already mentioned Ruby\'s angelic voice? Great background music as well.If you had any doubts about Sunshine, I can assure you, there is little to worry about. It\'s certainly an enjoyable show for fans and newcomers alike. Just remember that Ruby is best. I\'m very disappointed, though, that the anime did not learn from its past mistakes. Sunshine has the potential of being exceptionally good. And seeing as how popular the Love Live franchise is (especially in Japan!), it will surely get a second season in order to make that happen, and flesh out the characters a bit more. I look forward to the day I see my lovely Ruby animated again.""Let\'s change that zero into a one!"" lovely Nico look-a-like in the same kind of situation as the real Nico.

Whether they're big fans of the original or never liked the series in the first place there's always going to be skeptics who throw around generic phrases like 'milking the cash cow' when an anime studio so much as thinks of continuing a popular series. Sometimes you can win them over, but most of the time they like to stubbornly stick by their viewpoints even it goes against all logical thinking. But regardless of how baffling I find the point of view that these people have, I'm not here to talk about them...or the fan reaction to this series. I'm not here to make comparisons to the original series either. I'm here to talk about the series.Love Live Sunshine is a continuation of the original series which I loved very much. But I think Sunshine has its own set of unique strengths. Some have even argued that these strengths make it a better series than the original. But what I find great about Sunshine is that its good points don't detract from what made the original series great. It's a fantastic series that stands out on its own merits. I feel like slovenly comparing the two in that way doesn't do either series justice. As such, I will refrain from making comparisons to the original unless I feel it's absolutely necessary.Chika Takami is a normal girl wasting away her days going through the motions like any other high school girl. But she's no longer content with living that kind of life.  When she sees µ's on the big screen of the UTX building in Akihabara (Which I've just recently found out is called the 'UDX' building in real life. Pretty cool huh?) something in her mind clicks. She's finally found a way to break the mould and escape her normal everyday life. That's the basic setup at least. Obviously their journey isn't as easy as it initially seems, but what makes Sunshine uniquely interesting is the nature of the potholes on their road to success. Pretty much everyone who heard µ's was on their side. It was just a matter of getting people to hear them out. As is natural for a series of that nature there are complications along the way but they're mostly irrelevant to how the people react to their music. The problems they faced were mostly either internal conflict or getting people to notice them. But when µ's put in their best effort and succeeded nearly every time. Sunshine does deal with those very same themes in its own way, but it also deals with heavily a theme that the original series never really touched upon. Rejection. People who heard what they had to say, considered where they were coming from and just said 'no'.I'm honestly not sure if a theme like that would be a good fit in the original series. But this is a completely new series and Sunrise have taken this as an opportunity to try something completely new. While the show also deals with many of the same themes as the original, it does so in a very different way. The show initially lures you into believing that the impact µ's has had means their journey is gonna be a walk in the park. Right? Right? Wrong! Not only are they outright rejected on a number of occasions, but they have an even harder time getting people to hear them out. School idols are everywhere in this day and age so standing out from the crowd is a lot more difficult. Even their flashy Babymetal-esque rivals Saint Snow have difficulty getting people on their side. Plus unlike µ's, Aqours don't live in the heart of Tokyo and getting people to notice them out in the middle of nowhere is a very difficult task.To put it simply, they're being brought down by circumstances completely out of their control. You can understand their frustration over being in this situation because these are all problems that everyone has to face at some point in their life. These themes aren't some super complex analysis of the human condition, but they're a perfect fit for the type of series that Love Live Sunshine is trying to be. Not only are the themes relatable to a lot of people regardless of cirmustance, but they're executed really well... at least for the most part. If I had to make a criticism (And I kinda do since this a review and not just a discussion of why I love the show) it's that it takes a while to get really stuck into the themes. The show is very deliberately paced and every episode is filled with great moments, but it's not until the final few episodes where the show really flourishes. That's not to say what comes before it is a waste of time. But even though I thoroughly enjoyed the series from start to finish its finest moments are definitely during the latter episodes. That being said this is admittedly a very weak criticism. I found the show as a whole to be fantastic and I can't imagine those last few episodes being anywhere near as impactful had it not been for everything that came before it.A new series brings with it a new set of characters and I was really impressed with what they brought to the table this time around. They've all got their cute little quirks and catchphrases as expected but there's a little bit more to them once you get past all that. In terms of comedy the 9 girls all have a great dynamic and bounce off of each other really well when the show wants to make the viewer laugh. But they've also got a wide range of emotions as well as a number of flaws. It's nothing ultra complicated but there's enough to them so that they feel more human and believable than what some would argue (Looking at you Yamakan) is necessary in this kind of series.When I read the character descriptions I was particularly worried about Yohane since Chuunibyou's are a very stale trope in anime. But the show does a fantastic job of justifying her reasons for being that way and her love of the occult. Ruby is often shy and scared but when the going gets tough she isn't afraid to get assertive. Hanamaru is kind and pleasant to a fault but she's also a goofball and an antisocial bookworm who has trouble making friends. I could go on to describe what makes each and every character great and how they evolve over the course of the series but I'm rambling enough as it is. Though I think what's most important in creating a strong show is a strong lead character and Chika certainly delivers. Chika always wants to do the best she can by her friends but she isn't without her flaws. As much as she tries she's not always capable of making a difference. But over the course of the series she becomes more understanding of her own limitations and more reliant on the people around her. Not only does this make her a likeable character, but a believable one too. And the same goes for the rest of the cast too.Though there is an elephant in the room that I think is worth discussing. Kanan. All things considered she did get a good amount of attention in the later episodes and the buildup to that point was handled very well. But when you're watching the show weekly you just can't help but wonder 'Where's Kanan?'. Fortunately, the resolution to the conflict between the third years is probably one of the best moments in the entire show. Conflict between characters can make or break a series depending on how it's handled. In Love Live's Sunshine's case, it brings about some of the show's very best moments. The show's world is definitely an exaggerated version of reality but every problem they face arises naturally. They're problems that one can reasonably expect to occur in their situation and they're always solved in an emotionally satisfying way. Simply put, the characters and their interactions are probably Love Live Sunshine's greatest strength.The animation in Love Live Sunshine is a definite strong point of the series but I wouldn't call it mind blowing. It's a very good looking show that definitely blows the vast majority of anime out of the water. That being said the production quality isn't on the same level as something like Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero or a KyoAni production. Just like the original series the show mixes 2D and 3D animation for its performance scenes and they're an absolute visual treat with a lot of great effects and some very memorable choreography. I've come to accept that the CG animation is an intentional design choice so I'm not going to criticise the show just because they use that style. However it definitely does look a bit wonky on occasions and even at its best it never looks as good as the 2D animation. But overall, when it comes to the visuals the positive far outweigh the positives.Of course another important aspect in a show like this is the sound. I mean, it is an idol show right? The voice acting, the songs, the sound design, the background music, all of this is very important. The show isn't flawless in every regard but the way the show uses sound is definitely one of its strengths. The songs themselves are plentiful, diverse and very easy on the ears to say the least. The fast paced energy of the opening theme that gets you hyped for the episode, the infectious bouncy melody of Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, the pounding bass drum and soaring vocals in Mijuku Dreamer. Even if you were to detach the songs from the flashy choreography in the performance scenes there's a lot to talk about. Not every song is as awesome as Mijuku Dreamer, but they're all great for their own reasons and not one of them is a dud.On the topic of sound, voice acting! While there are quite a few well known seiyuu playing side characters every single one of the 9 girls is played by a newbie. That being said, they've obviously been trained very well. The girls all sound distinctive and their acting is on point nailing both the light hearted comedy scenes and the more dramatic moments of the series. There are a few missed lip flaps and awkward line reads, but in the grand scheme of things these are relatively minor flaws. The seiyuu performances are a key aspect of any show like this and Love Live Sunshine does not disappoint. Just like its predecessor, Sunshine does indeed have an English dub. While NIS America handled the first series in conjunction with Bang Zoom, Love Live Sunshine is entirely a Funimation effort. Moving from Texas to LA means there's a whole new talent pool to work with and the dub uses this to its advantage with a good mix of newbies and veterans from the area. In an effort to remain consistent with the original series the English dub is directed by Caitlin Glass who played Maki in the original series. However, just like the Japanese version, there are no returning cast members. There's definitely some awkward line reads and questionable translation choices here and there but all things considered it's a very solid dub handled by a team of people who evidently enjoy working on the show. However in this case I have to say my preference is with the original Japanese version.Overall, Love Live Sunshine was an unexpectedly great series that follows up on the original in a very big way. Rather than relying on what made the original series great, Sunshine (And Aqours) establishes itself as something uniquely amazing. I could go on forever talking about everything this show does right yet my issues with the show are relatively minor. It's obligatory that I mention the things that bothered me in a review, but honestly I could spend way longer talking about why I loved the show. It's very rare that a show elicits that kind of positive response out of me so obviously they've done something right. Love Live Sunshine is undeniably something special and I would be very surprised if anything else can take its place as my favourite anime of 2016. or the fan reaction to this series. I'm not here to make comparisons to the original series either. I'm here to talk about the series.Love Live Sunshine is a continuation of the original series which I loved very much. But I think Sunshine has its own set of unique strengths. Some have even argued that these strengths make it a better series than the original. But what I find great about Sunshine is that its good points don't detract from what made the original series great. It's a fantastic series that stands out on its own merits. I feel like slovenly comparing the two in that way doesn't do either series justice. As such, I will refrain from making comparisons to the original unless I feel it's absolutely necessary.Chika Takami is a normal girl wasting away her days going through the motions like any other high school girl. But she's no longer content with living that kind of life.  When she sees µ's on the big screen of the UTX building in Akihabara (Which I've just recently found out is called the 'UDX' building in real life. Pretty cool huh?) something in her mind clicks. She's finally found a way to break the mould and escape her normal everyday life. That's the basic setup at least. Obviously their journey isn't as easy as it initially seems, but what makes Sunshine uniquely interesting is the nature of the potholes on their road to success. Pretty much everyone who heard µ's was on their side. It was just a matter of getting people to hear them out. As is natural for a series of that nature there are complications along the way but they're mostly irrelevant to how the people react to their music. The problems they faced were mostly either internal conflict or getting people to notice them. But when µ's put in their best effort and succeeded nearly every time. Sunshine does deal with those very same themes in its own way, but it also deals with heavily a theme that the original series never really touched upon. Rejection. People who heard what they had to say, considered where they were coming from and just said 'no'.I'm honestly not sure if a theme like that would be a good fit in the original series. But this is a completely new series and Sunrise have taken this as an opportunity to try something completely new. While the show also deals with many of the same themes as the original, it does so in a very different way. The show initially lures you into believing that the impact µ's has had means their journey is gonna be a walk in the park. Right? Right? Wrong! Not only are they outright rejected on a number of occasions, but they have an even harder time getting people to hear them out. School idols are everywhere in this day and age so standing out from the crowd is a lot more difficult. Even their flashy Babymetal-esque rivals Saint Snow have difficulty getting people on their side. Plus unlike µ's, Aqours don't live in the heart of Tokyo and getting people to notice them out in the middle of nowhere is a very difficult task.To put it simply, they're being brought down by circumstances completely out of their control. You can understand their frustration over being in this situation because these are all problems that everyone has to face at some point in their life. These themes aren't some super complex analysis of the human condition, but they're a perfect fit for the type of series that Love Live Sunshine is trying to be. Not only are the themes relatable to a lot of people regardless of cirmustance, but they're executed really well... at least for the most part. If I had to make a criticism (And I kinda do since this a review and not just a discussion of why I love the show) it's that it takes a while to get really stuck into the themes. The show is very deliberately paced and every episode is filled with great moments, but it's not until the final few episodes where the show really flourishes. That's not to say what comes before it is a waste of time. But even though I thoroughly enjoyed the series from start to finish its finest moments are definitely during the latter episodes. That being said this is admittedly a very weak criticism. I found the show as a whole to be fantastic and I can't imagine those last few episodes being anywhere near as impactful had it not been for everything that came before it.A new series brings with it a new set of characters and I was really impressed with what they brought to the table this time around. They've all got their cute little quirks and catchphrases as expected but there's a little bit more to them once you get past all that. In terms of comedy the 9 girls all have a great dynamic and bounce off of each other really well when the show wants to make the viewer laugh. But they've also got a wide range of emotions as well as a number of flaws. It's nothing ultra complicated but there's enough to them so that they feel more human and believable than what some would argue (Looking at you Yamakan) is necessary in this kind of series.When I read the character descriptions I was particularly worried about Yohane since Chuunibyou's are a very stale trope in anime. But the show does a fantastic job of justifying her reasons for being that way and her love of the occult. Ruby is often shy and scared but when the going gets tough she isn't afraid to get assertive. Hanamaru is kind and pleasant to a fault but she's also a goofball and an antisocial bookworm who has trouble making friends. I could go on to describe what makes each and every character great and how they evolve over the course of the series but I'm rambling enough as it is. Though I think what's most important in creating a strong show is a strong lead character and Chika certainly delivers. Chika always wants to do the best she can by her friends but she isn't without her flaws. As much as she tries she's not always capable of making a difference. But over the course of the series she becomes more understanding of her own limitations and more reliant on the people around her. Not only does this make her a likeable character, but a believable one too. And the same goes for the rest of the cast too.Though there is an elephant in the room that I think is worth discussing. Kanan. All things considered she did get a good amount of attention in the later episodes and the buildup to that point was handled very well. But when you're watching the show weekly you just can't help but wonder 'Where's Kanan?'. Fortunately, the resolution to the conflict between the third years is probably one of the best moments in the entire show. Conflict between characters can make or break a series depending on how it's handled. In Love Live's Sunshine's case, it brings about some of the show's very best moments. The show's world is definitely an exaggerated version of reality but every problem they face arises naturally. They're problems that one can reasonably expect to occur in their situation and they're always solved in an emotionally satisfying way. Simply put, the characters and their interactions are probably Love Live Sunshine's greatest strength.The animation in Love Live Sunshine is a definite strong point of the series but I wouldn't call it mind blowing. It's a very good looking show that definitely blows the vast majority of anime out of the water. That being said the production quality isn't on the same level as something like Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero or a KyoAni production. Just like the original series the show mixes 2D and 3D animation for its performance scenes and they're an absolute visual treat with a lot of great effects and some very memorable choreography. I've come to accept that the CG animation is an intentional design choice so I'm not going to criticise the show just because they use that style. However it definitely does look a bit wonky on occasions and even at its best it never looks as good as the 2D animation. But overall, when it comes to the visuals the positive far outweigh the positives.Of course another important aspect in a show like this is the sound. I mean, it is an idol show right?

Love Live Sunshine is undeniably something special and I would be very surprised if anything else can take its place as my favourite anime of 2016."", ""So i knew this anime from Love Live! School Idol Festival. LLSIF is a mobile rhythm game that feature all character from Love Live. I decided to watch the anime because the story there is great, so after a few weeks playing it i'm interested to watch the anime. And boy oh boy, i'm surprised that the story is more complicated in the anime.Story 10/10Since Love Live! Sunshine!! is the first that i watched in this franchise, i can't compare it to Love Live! School Idol Project. Some people say the story is same like LLSIP. So in here i will review the story based...on this anime alone and didn't take previous anime to compare. Well as a person who got here from the game, i'm really surprised. I didn't expect it to be like this, i thought it will be like other Cute Girls Doing Cute Thing anime. But no, its more powerfull than that. It has taught me something. That something is never give up, no matter what the situation is, no matter what the problem is, just never give up. It'll done when it is the time.The story make us really feel how hard they work. But this anime isn't all about being a hardworker, this anime also contain about friendship. Not only that, it also has has an emotional episode that will make your heart touched because their wholesomeness.Art 10/10I really like this artstyle. Its so colorful and because of that it also bring happiness and cheerfulness mood. Which is good, because almost all the song they sing match with the mood. A bonus point for their uniform, now i like sailor uniform because this anime. Sometimes they make a really weird but funny faces, and it became a memes. The background art is really beautiful because the anime take place in a shore area. They draw all of it really good, from the sea to the hill. The animation is also really smooth. The girls here like to jump everytime something happy occuring and they jump so fluidly. Oh yeah they also have CGI, but it didn't really a big thing because they only use CGI when they are singing.Sound 10/10This is a music anime, of course the sound must be good. I already like their music since i was playing LLSIF. And now i knew the story behind the music i was listened, i love them even more. I can't really describe the music, you should watch the anime to feel it. I also have some of their music in my playlist. Beside from the music, the SFX is also really good. I don't think it has problem with SFX.Character 10/10They really do a great job making all the 9 main characters here a different personality. Not to mention they really consistent with it. Like their personality never change. So if you want to choose your perfect waifu maybe you can pick one from here. Now we're talk about the side character. In the early episode they just give the spotlight to the first 3 main characters. And the side characters feel so plain because we barely hear anyone talk beside the main character. But as this show progressively move, the side characters is actually as important as main character. They even can make someone personality that didn't appear in the anime, which mean we can't see them but we can feel them.Enjoyment 10/10Thanks to this anime, now i'm inside idol hell and can't get out. But i'm not regretting it, even a little bit. I don't think other anime fans will like it, especially that didn't really got into this type of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, because this anime is a little bit over dramatic about almost everything. Even though this anime is like that, it doesn't stop me from rewatching this series in dub. I'll definitely remember this series as 'that school idol anime'. It just so iconic. Oh yeah the group also exist in real life, so you can really enjoy it to the fullest.If you are wondering why i'm surprised when i watch the anime. It is because the story in the game is so simple, short, funny, and cheerful. While the anime is serious, tense, and more in depth story. But not all the episode like that, usually the first half is filled with comedy and the second half is focused to the story. So yeah, thank you for reading my review. on this anime alone and didn't take previous anime to compare. Well as a person who got here from the game, i'm really surprised.

You\'ll often hear claims that it\'s just a rehash of the first series, that the plot is the same for both. But what makes up a plot, anyways? Is it how things go, the events that happen; or is it the reason, the ""why"", to the things that happen? I\'ll let you decide for your self.As this is the second anime series under the Love Live franchise, you\'d expect it to more or less have the same strengths and weaknesses in the overall animation. Like the clean character designs, and the god awful 3DCG when dancing. Surprisingly, though, Sunshine is all strengths. Sunrise (the animators) delivered an overwhelming upgrade to its aesthetics. The art is really detailed and clean. Characters are refined, and the scenery and background are really spectacular. The animation is smooth and fluid, and the 3DCG now fits into the sequencing with better motion and design. Also, the water is really really marvelous. It resembles more the School Idol Movie than it does the original series.The sound is understandably outstanding. The voice acting fits the characters personalities, and feels natural to listen to. The sound effects are consistent and doesn\'t overpower the main dialogue, and the ambient sounds pay close attention to detail. There\'s always the low and soft sound of water moving and waves crashing when they\'re near a body of water, and there are random seagull squawks every now and then, as expected of a seaside town. It makes you feel like you\'\'re genuinely there. The background music fits with the atmosphere, and carries the many emotions of the show. As for the songs, you can expect it to be great. The opening and ending themes are catchy and tells the story of them as they start out. The songs are good as it is, but gets even better with the emphasis they put on them.The concept for the story is pretty straightforward, and that is good for a fun show about girls following their dreams and having fun. This isn\'t meant to be a deep and complex story. The pacing is perfect. Events happen and change at a decently slow speed, which gives more time for the characters to interact, and for their feelings to show and intentions to take shape. With this, the development of each character is clear. Also, Sunshine goes to great lengths and makes excellent use of its elements in emphasizing their characters struggles and accomplishments, creating these beautiful and touching moments unexpected to the viewer, making it that much more of an enjoyable and memorable show.I loved the first series, and I went into Sunshine knowing that I would also love it. It could have just been me being biased, or it could have just been them riding the immense wave of popularity left by µ\'s, so I wondering if they could really do it. But I honestly didn\'t expect it to be this good. It\'s been breaking a lot of my expectations, and I have high hopes for this series.

The first episode was super well laid out and showed that it was going to be a lot different than its pseudo-predecessor and I really love that shift in tone, it added a lot of depth and sincerity the genre needed. Chika as a main character is a very self-aware and earnest main character and the rest of the group were very detailed and shaped in such a way as to give lots of similarities and parallels to other known characters in the series.My favorite narrative tool they used was...the ""Fabled Legend"" where you use the previous installment or story that had elements of uniqueness, as a pillar to hold the current story towards and contrast in specific ways. A lot of characters had different levels of familiarity to Muse and the show used these differences to make interesting dilemmas and themes on the idea of purpose and being unique amongst the crowd.In terms of animation and directing, it was a step up above your standard idol/CGDCT shows. Using really fluid 3D animations in the dancing choreography, alongside great shot composition and narrative structure make for a very enjoyable experience delving into 9 different people\'s backstories. As a stickler for ""good"" 3D animation, this is my cup of tea. It felt almost like it was shot as a drama instead of a funny comedic idol show. It gave the much needed sincerity to each character and made their persona shine even more.Other than the ending, my only negative critique would be how disconnected some of the song/performances felt. Even though they had the right preparation and setting, without some more ""leading up to"" scenes, they felt out of place. They themselves were done very well though, just didn\'t feel right in context/in the moment.As for the ending, I wished it was a little more concrete in its resolution and its progress. It felt as though it was written with having a season 2 in mind, but I would have wished they had written a more standalone ending that you can jump off the back of for another season. What we did get didn\'t feel very rewarding, compared to all the work they did in changing their motivations and delving into the true reasons for becoming school idols.Would have rated it higher if the ending was better. the ""Fabled Legend"" where you use the previous installment or story that had elements of uniqueness, as a pillar to hold the current story towards and contrast in specific ways.

Sunshine!! is a show that needs you to pay attention and to understand it, which is kind of interesting considering most of these types of shows are pretty straightforward, but this one needs you to understand the message it starts building up at the very beginning and that it concludes really well. Hopefully this will erase all the misconceptions about this show that you might have seen anywhere else on the internet. I\'ll have a TL;DR section at the end if any of you wishes to skip the explicit content.Also, it is not completely necessary to watch the predecessor series,...Love Live! School Idol Project, to watch Sunshine since they follow two different groups, but as a recommendation, you should check it out if you still haven\'t. It presents references that enhance the experience if you have seen the first series. :)STORY: 8/10Contrary to what some believe, Sunshine!! does not follow the journey of Aqours after its creation, the entirety of this season shows us the background of the group, the reason why it is created, their motivations, the relationships the members develop, why they are different from Muse, etc. This is a much more character driven plot than the one in School Idol Project S1, which was a bit more story driven.It follows Chika Takami, a normal high school girl who finds a dream to follow, and that is to shine as a School Idol being influenced by Muse, our protagonist group from Love Live! School Idol Project. Chika creates her School Idol group in Uranohoshi Girls High School, with the goal of being just like Muse and recreating their story, however... will that really wield any good results...?The story in Love Live! Sunshine!! is simple and yet needs you to understand it. I\'m so tired of the ""Aqours is just a carbon copy of Muse"" thing that makes this show really underrated and that it\'s been driving me nuts, so let\'s just get that out of the way first.Sunshine!!  CONSCIOUSLY draws parallels between School Idol Project and Sunshine!! , yes, consciously. They adress this openly and honestly in the anime, Sunshine is intended to reflect and to mirror School Idol Project\'s setting, just to then get past this comparisons and show us how different the situation is. This is where everything starts to build up, and is at the very beginning of the show, and why? Because the whole message of the show is that ""Aqours is not Muse, and they\'ll never be"", and ""Be Yourself"". Which is explained and shown later in episodes 8 and 12.""Why did they take so long to acknowledge something like that"" you ask? Because the purpose of this show never was to show us Aqours journey right after it is created with all 9 members, but rather to have a season where the torch of the Love Live franchise would be passed from the first generation to the second (done symbolically in episode 12 with Chika catching the feather) and to form the bonds of the members of Aqours. The last shot in episode 13 tells us that the TRUE story of Aqours is beginning now (in the really probable second season and onwards), since the shot replicates the picture that marked the beginning of Love Live! Sunshine!! and Aqours as a multimedia project back in 2015. So, this is the message that the show conveys to us, that they are different, the reasons why they are different, that is important to be yourself and that you can still be influenced by someone but you can walk your own path.This is a huge misconception in the franchise so I wanted to get it out of the way first, that Aqours and Sunshine are just blatant carbon copies of its predecessors, trust me, they are not. The show consciously draws this parallels and breaks all the expectations they created in the first half of the show by showing us that they are indeed really different (I\'ll talk about the characters in the later part). That is the reason why I say this show needs you to pay attention and understand it. This plot point can be seen building up since episode 1, and then reaching its breaking point at a certain episode, which is a complete turning point to the series.This first season servers as a set-up season to kick off with Aqours\' Love Live story in the future.ART: 8/10There\'s not much to talk about here, an obvious improvement in terms of animation and art compared to the previous TV Anime seasons and that holds a resemblance with the art used on the movie which is just as good. Granted better budget, more to spend on animation and art, but the experience of the animation team clearly shows here too. Art is subjective indeed, so you can like it or dislike it depending on your standards, but it is clean and crisp.SOUND: 9/10Kind of the same as the art, another improvement which is to be expected since the team has now experience and a bigger budget. The OST has some quite nice tracks that can convey emotions really well.One thing to note is how the series captures the sounds of a small and silent seaside town. The squawk of the seagulls, the sound of the waves hitting the shore, it really helps to the immersion and it sounds clean.In terms of Music and insert songs, is subjective. I like my idol music, so I enjoyed all of the songs, not only here, but on the franchise as a whole. However, Aqours has a distinguishing feature, and is that their singing voices blend together really well and they harmonize a lot.Coupled with the music and insert songs is the fact that the musical performances are usually linked to character development and plot progression, which is a constant of Love Live that we\'ve seen in previous seasons. So, if you haven\'t seen it or you thought of them being out of place, I\'d recommend you to watch them with subs or look for the lyrics of those songs, since they usually work as an extension or conclusion to a certain topic.CHARACTER: 8/10This. This section is probably the most important besides ""Story"".Love Live! Sunshine!! is the successor to Love Live! School Idol Project, and Aqours is the successor to Muse, they are part of the same franchise and as such, Dengeki G\'s Magazine, Sunrise and Lantis need brand continuity to ensure continued profitability and success. This and the fact that they still have the same artist lets us know why are some of the girls similar in design. Is the same as other brands, for example, how the leader of a Power Ranger\'s team is always a really strong guy, and he becomes the red ranger, this applies the same way here. Similar character archetype and design, yet definitely different characters.The girls are intended to be mirrors and reflections of the girls in Muse so people can remember that even though it is a new season, with a new group, it is still Love Live, it is the same franchise, thus, if you come into it looking for similarities in their characters\' personalities and design, you will find them on the surface.HOWEVER, that\'s all you get, since the show draws parallels between the current cast and the past cast, again, to move past them and then break those expectations and start developing them even further, to the point where they are completely different characters, yet working as a reflection of their predecessors, which is really hard to achieve.  And all of them actually have reasons to act how they do which are shown in each girl\'s character development episodes.Character development, although there is just a little bit because, again, this is a set-up season, is clean and easy to relate, the drama is well handled and is not forced since all of it has a proper build up, and the character interactions feel natural (except for two characters). Something that helps to this is how the relationships are formed within this group. We have childhood friends in almost every year group, and even between them. We have a pair of sisters as well, etc. All of them, except for Riko, are connected to at least one of the members even before the creation of their group, and it makes sense since they live in a small seaside town, you know that unlike in the big cities, is more likely that most of the population of a small town gets to know each other.ENJOYMENT: 9/10This kind of story was really enjoyable to me, giving such a nice message of ""Be Yourself"", with a cast of funny eccentric characters while still making them relatable due to the realistic and harsh situations they are put in that will most likely make us cheer for them or feel sympathy towards them if we had experienced it before. If Sunshine was your first entry into the Love Live franchise, I\'d kinda bet that you may have enjoyed it as well.OVERALL: 9/10Love Live! Sunshine!! is a very underated show because it comes after the juggernaut that Muse was (and still is of course), and the huge popularity that they and School Idol Project attained, thus making quite a number of people not wanting to understand it and care for it.However, that is no reason to just blindly hate on it and give it an unfair, superficial judgement. Its story is sweet and simple, yet it has a really deep meaning to it. Its characters are very lovely, enjoyable and relatable, once you get to know them well on the inside, you can see all the development they go through. The music is on point, the drama is very well handled, and my only complaint with the series would be that they wasted a big chunk of the last episode and how it kept forcing Chika and Riko in our faces, overshadowing and throwing aside the rest of the cast, but it still had some nice touching scenes and musical performances.Looking and analyzing at how it was handled and executed, Sunshine surpasses School Idol Project S1 in almost every aspect, and that\'s not a bad thing, fellow fans, that\'s how it should be. With the extra experience and capital the production team has, they are now able to provide better storytelling, better art and animation, better production values on the whole. If they hadn\'t grow and learn from their mistakes in the past and improved this second time around, it would have been a big failure for the franchise.This doesn\'t mean that you must enjoy one more than the other because it is better made in terms of production, enjoy whatever you want, both series are similar yet different with its own charm, and both are really, really enjoyable. But you should at least acknowledge the effort put into this series to take the anime adaptations of the franchise to a higher level.TL;DR: Don\'t trust all the negative bias and superficial judgement this series has. It shows a story of self-discovery and self-appreciation with characters that are enjoyable, lovely and very different from their predecessors when you get to know them. It is by no means a carbon copy as some call it out to be, and the series shows this with facts throughout its run, addressing this openly and honestly, drawing parallels to its predecessor to then break them all and develop their cast and plot even further, and get past those comparisons as the series advances. Love Live! School Idol Project, to watch Sunshine since they follow two different groups, but as a recommendation, you should check it out if you still haven\'t. It presents references that enhance the experience if you have seen the first series. :)STORY: 8/10Contrary to what some believe, Sunshine!! does not follow the journey of Aqours after its creation, the entirety of this season shows us the background of the group, the reason why it is created, their motivations, the relationships the members develop, why they are different from Muse, etc. This is a much more character driven plot than the one in School Idol Project S1, which was a bit more story driven.It follows Chika Takami, a normal high school girl who finds a dream to follow, and that is to shine as a School Idol being influenced by Muse, our protagonist group from Love Live! School Idol Project. Chika creates her School Idol group in Uranohoshi Girls High School, with the goal of being just like Muse and recreating their story, however... will that really wield any good results...?The story in Love Live! Sunshine!! is simple and yet needs you to understand it. I\'m so tired of the ""Aqours is just a carbon copy of Muse"" thing that makes this show really underrated and that it\'s been driving me nuts, so let\'s just get that out of the way first.Sunshine!!  CONSCIOUSLY draws parallels between School Idol Project and Sunshine!! , yes, consciously. They adress this openly and honestly in the anime, Sunshine is intended to reflect and to mirror School Idol Project\'s setting, just to then get past this comparisons and show us how different the situation is. This is where everything starts to build up, and is at the very beginning of the show, and why? Because the whole message of the show is that ""Aqours is not Muse, and they\'ll never be"", and ""Be Yourself"". Which is explained and shown later in episodes 8 and 12.""Why did they take so long to acknowledge something like that"" you ask?

Sunshine!! is a slice of life musical anime, about nine high school girls trying their hand at becoming school idols, competing with many other schools nationwide in Love Live! Inspired by their favorite and first school idol Love Live winners, μ's, they work hard to become this years best school idol group!Love Live! Sunshine!! While is very similar to it's original Love Live! School Idol Project anime, still manages to be just as entertaining and charming in this spin-off. The nine girls are again, all lovable in their own way, overflowing with charm and quirkiness. The humor here is even more zany and...witty, while still allowing each girl to have their own development and desires that set them apart. Myself personally while I love both School Idol Project's μ's group, and Sunshine's Aqours. I love the Aqours here in Sunshine ever so slightly more, but would still highly recommend both respective Love Live anime.Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place on a remote coast in Japan, where our girls come together from a small town to share their love of school idols together, hoping to be recognized like the more popular groups in more populated areas, and ultimately winning the Love Live competition.The character cast is rather interesting and by that I mostly mean Saint Snow, Aqours' rival group. Since you could say they are the counterpart to A-RISE in the first season, compared to them, Ria and Seira don't start out as the biggest idol group and are the performers or characters you'd expect them to be if you know what A-RISE is like. Though Aqours faces the same issue as in the first season of the first series, I find them to be quite lovable and special on their own subjectively.As expected, Sunshine continues to milk out outstanding idol music that's another reason to why I find Aqours to be special on their own. ''Snow Halation'' and ''Start:Dash'' have been quite the songs but I listen to a lot of Guilty Kiss (I have been doing so way before I got into LL actually) and as I go by more episodes, I can see Aqours clawing themselves in my playlist here and there.I find myself to be comparing the first Love Live! to Sunshine a lot but it's not like the series isn't doing so itself. It isn't disconnecting itself by any means and, as a matter of fact, the series pays homage to μ's often and, to be precise, from the character standpoint, Aqours.This doesn't exactly appeal to every audience but if you're willing to give Love Live! a try, watch the first series + the movie and come back here. If you want to see more from the series then certainly watch this! witty, while still allowing each girl to have their own development and desires that set them apart.

My attitude, my opinion on certain things, and of course my music taste!I've never watched many inspirational anime before, so this one was pretty new to me. The story of a bunch of girls trying to save their school seems like a pretty simple one. But this was a truly sweet show. It really helped me out in my personal life, as before I watched it I was a really dark person. But it quickly brought me out of all that...negativity and gave me a more positive world to look at.After watching this show, I knew I had found my favorite anime.  I'll always look back fondly on some moments like when riko and yohane had to take care of a stray dog they found. Or the third years finally making up from a fight; that left them apart for almost two years. And if you wanna cry, then there's plenty of tear jerking scenes in this show.The shows graphics are really good, with all the girls looking extra kawaii. If you've heard the music then I'm sure you can agree that the songs sound great. And the enjoyment for it is never ending really, there's basically a whole love live universe to emerse yourself in if you want. They've got games, (that unfortunately take up a lot of space on your phone.) two movies, three shows, music to jam too, and a ton of merch to choose from. A lot of people like the original show, while there's nothing at all wrong with it. I prefer Sunshine's characters over theirs any day. I've fell in love with the likes of kanan, Mari, and my favorite riko.Riko's been my favorite waifu of all for a long time now. All in all this show is amazing, and if your ever feeling down then definitely give this a watch. Theirs a whole inspirational idol universe to drag yourself down into.

The original Love Live was actually the first idol anime I have seen, so there isn't much of a reference for me on if this actually was any good or not, besides my personal enjoyment of things, so my rating for Sunshine comes mostly from that personal point of view on what makes the show enjoyable for me.Story (7/10):The story might be the biggest weakness of Sunshine. Too much of the time is about trying to follow the nine muses of the original and catch the shining...light of them. Most of the time it's about trying the same things in a different setting and only near the end, they finally try to go their own way.Art (8/10):There isn't much negative to say about the look of Sunshine. The 3d stuff finally better and the rest is great to look at anyway, so I would have only prefered less of the 3d stuff in the dance numbers, but it's still really good.Sound (9/10):I actually liked most of the songs and the voice actors did a great job. Nothing really to say here.Characters (9/10):I believe that the characters are what makes Sunshine better to me. Yes, they don't seem like more than the original girls, but their interactions and reactions to things feel better to me. While µ's always had their happy-go-lucky charm, which made them pretty much win anything, Aquors has it much harder and actually loses at most things. They are sad, they cry, but together they never give up. Fitting the title of the show, the girls shine thanks to their faults and instead of going for the top, they are just happy with turning that 0 into a 1. To me this makes Chika a better leader and her group into something I want to follow and see develop. That's also where most of my enjoyment comes from. Yes there is more drama, but it's always used to have the characters grow and try to become better. It's not about being the best school idol group, but about being best friends.Overall (9/10):While I would have prefered the story to be more of its own thing, it's actually used in the end to have the characters grow into their own kind of school idol and I'm looking forward to more of that in Season 2. For now I think that this was just slightly worse than Season 2 of the original, but I was definitely happy with what I got. light of them.

After several hours on Reddit, I ultimately decided to continue, I haven\'t looked back since.StoryLove Live Sunshine depicts a similar story in a different setting, with familiar aspects making returns while new ones arise. We start with a core trio in their second...year of high school, with one of them having been inspired to become a School Idol, she quickly gathers her other friends and starts recruiting, along the way, the core trio helps the first years overcome their nervousness, while helping the third years atone for their past mistakes. A conflict of interest inevitably comes up, as well as the risk of the school closing down. The first concert is inevitably one of the more memorable ones, no matter how well it does, and the crew\'s choreography and song composition inevitably climbs from there. From an outsider\'s perspective, it would inevitably seem that the Studio itself is clinging to the legacy µ\'s left behind, as the characters introduced, the sequence of events, and the plotline all paralleled events that µ\'s went through as a group, until it didn\'t. It should also be noted that while these events parallel the things µ\'s went through, they certainly did not parallel the depth of each event. Aquors experienced way more hardship along the way compared to what µ\'s did, even doing really badly at their first concerts, but eventually slowly climbing their way all the way to the top of the leaderboards. While the majority of the season was basically a carbon copy, around 2/3 of the way through, our new idol group, now affectionately named Aquors, realizes that they aren\'t µ\'s, and will no way match what µ\'s made into a legacy, instead, they split away from the carbon copy plotline to form their own. This obvious copied plotline splitting into a new one makes for an oddly stunning realization to the viewer that that plotline is exactly what their train of thought is. We all started this series pleading for any chance to see µ\'s again, but we slowly come to know and love each and every member of Aquors. Well Played.Art and SoundFrom the first moment the OP played, it became clear that Aquors was its own thing, while the animation style remained the same, because, duh, its from the same studio. There was an interesting shift of atmosphere. Not because this time the story\'s set in a coastal town, but because of the namesake. Everything done in this season reflects the name ""Sunshine"". Everything\'s brighter, and I mean everything.Of course, you can\'t have an idol anime without its music, and this is where Aquors truly shines in its individuality. Their songs are notably brighter, happier, and perhaps shinier than µ\'s tracks. It makes sense on a physical level, considering that many of the voice actors in Aquors have higher voice registers or know how to sing higher than most members of µ\'s, but also because of the namesake once again, While µ\'s specialized in dreamy, sparkling music, Aquors bursts in with such an overwhelming amount of positivity I would honest-to-god recommend their tracks to the more pessimistic people in life. A comparison between the two season\'s OPs also proves my point. µ\'s Bokura wa Ima no Naka de is an absolute banger, however, when you hear Aquors\'s Aozora Jumping Heart, you are instantly filled with more determination than Honoka\'s ever had in her time spent with µ\'s. It shows how serious Aquors is about setting their own legacy and how much skill they have to back it up.CharactersThe characters of Aquors and µ\'s share a lot of similar traits like, a TON of similarities. Here\'s a few I noticed before diving into the specifics of each character. A few of the similarities were shuffled between characters, possibly to mix things up a bit, but ultimately they show up in both groups- An extremely upbeat, overly hyper orange haired protagonist- A grey haired second year who\'s the protagonist\'s lifelong friend- A second year who sacrificed time at her other club to be at the School Idol Club- An overly shy 1st year- The best friend of the overly shy 1st year with a signature catchphrase- A third wheeling 1st year who everyone also likes- A foreigner 3rd year with a signature catchphrase in their mother tongue- Another 3rd year who tried starting their own School Idol Group but failed for whatever reason- A 3rd year who\'s the Student Council President- A pianist who serves as the composer for the groupThose were just a few of the similarities the groups have, of course, these listed traits have been shuffled from person to person, but it still bears an undeniable similarity to µ\'s and therefore an even bigger reason for that hole in your heart to open back up.Overall, I feel that despite being basically a carbon copy of the original Love Live with some uniqueness to them, it still feels reasonable and not bad. The explanation behind this makes sense too, that Aquors is simply trying to find their own path, what makes them different from µ\'s, and their own unique musical style. It keeps that hole in your heart open, but at the same time also seals it. Its refreshing knowing that the group that inspired us also inspired them, and I can\'t wait to see what this group will do year of high school, with one of them having been inspired to become a School Idol, she quickly gathers her other friends and starts recruiting, along the way, the core trio helps the first years overcome their nervousness, while helping the third years atone for their past mistakes. A conflict of interest inevitably comes up, as well as the risk of the school closing down. The first concert is inevitably one of the more memorable ones, no matter how well it does, and the crew\'s choreography and song composition inevitably climbs from there. From an outsider\'s perspective, it would inevitably seem that the Studio itself is clinging to the legacy µ\'s left behind, as the characters introduced, the sequence of events, and the plotline all paralleled events that µ\'s went through as a group, until it didn\'t. It should also be noted that while these events parallel the things µ\'s went through, they certainly did not parallel the depth of each event. Aquors experienced way more hardship along the way compared to what µ\'s did, even doing really badly at their first concerts, but eventually slowly climbing their way all the way to the top of the leaderboards. While the majority of the season was basically a carbon copy, around 2/3 of the way through, our new idol group, now affectionately named Aquors, realizes that they aren\'t µ\'s, and will no way match what µ\'s made into a legacy, instead, they split away from the carbon copy plotline to form their own. This obvious copied plotline splitting into a new one makes for an oddly stunning realization to the viewer that that plotline is exactly what their train of thought is. We all started this series pleading for any chance to see µ\'s again, but we slowly come to know and love each and every member of Aquors. Well Played.Art and SoundFrom the first moment the OP played, it became clear that Aquors was its own thing, while the animation style remained the same, because, duh, its from the same studio. There was an interesting shift of atmosphere. Not because this time the story\'s set in a coastal town, but because of the namesake. Everything done in this season reflects the name ""Sunshine"". Everything\'s brighter, and I mean everything.Of course, you can\'t have an idol anime without its music, and this is where Aquors truly shines in its individuality. Their songs are notably brighter, happier, and perhaps shinier than µ\'s tracks. It makes sense on a physical level, considering that many of the voice actors in Aquors have higher voice registers or know how to sing higher than most members of µ\'s, but also because of the namesake once again, While µ\'s specialized in dreamy, sparkling music, Aquors bursts in with such an overwhelming amount of positivity I would honest-to-god recommend their tracks to the more pessimistic people in life. A comparison between the two season\'s OPs also proves my point. µ\'s Bokura wa Ima no Naka de is an absolute banger, however, when you hear Aquors\'s Aozora Jumping Heart, you are instantly filled with more determination than Honoka\'s ever had in her time spent with µ\'s. It shows how serious Aquors is about setting their own legacy and how much skill they have to back it up.CharactersThe characters of Aquors and µ\'s share a lot of similar traits like, a TON of similarities. Here\'s a few I noticed before diving into the specifics of each character.

Well, then you\'ve seen Love Live Sunshine too, without even knowing.- Plot:The plot is badly copied from the first Love Live. Sunshine is made basically just to milk the cow and to make fanboys scream of joy cause now they can ship more idols and make more memes about it.The story is often slow-paced when nothing is happening and it\'s light speed fast when it comes to interesting moments. Indeed it\'s like everything happens behind the scenes while you\'re not watching and along the anime you\'re probably gonna ask yourself ""How?"" more often than you would...expect. Also, most of the useless and casual stuff that happen is very predictable and cliché.In general it feels like creators had in mind how cool moments should have happened but they didn\'t know how to arrive to them.- Characters:Generally characters have no defined personality, like if they ran out of stereotypes so they made them as plain and vague as possible just to make everyone happy. Rather than taking the opportunity to do something good, events that should help you knowing the characters a bit deeper happen in dumb funny ways.- Animation and art:Characters pretty much look as if they were from μ\'s but with different hair and eye colors. The animation is decent even if there\'s still CGI in some parts of dancing scenes, like in Love Live.- Sound:I really like μ\'sic and I pretty much like Aqours songs too, it\'s the only good point of this anime. expect.

However, Sunshine takes what made the original series so magical and throws it out the window. If you\'ve seen the original Love Live series, you probably shouldn\'t watch Sunshine. If you haven\'t... maybe you\'ll find something enjoyable in it? This review will contain spoilers for the original series, though, as you\'re supposed to have seen it already.First, I should admit that the animation is amazing. It\'s definitely a step up from the original series, and you can see proof of that in the very first episode. That doesn\'t stop it from having...CGI dance sequences, though. The only one that was fully hand-drawn was the performance by the ""rival"" idol group that is only relevant for about one episode.The music is also amazing. As much as I love Muse, Aqours just has better singers. However, some songs do tend to bleed together. Yume de Yozora wo Terashitai sounds very similar to Mijuku DREAMER, for example. However, there is a fatal problem related to the music, which I\'ll go into in a little bit.Now that I\'ve talked about the good aspects of this series, it\'s time to talk about what killed it: the writing. Unlike in the original series, the MC here has no particular reason for becoming a school idol - whereas Honoka wanted to save the school, Chika wanted to be an idol for its own sake (a realization that took Honoka a long time to have). I have no problem with this - though it does make Kimeta yo Hand in Hand (the Susume->Tomorrow of Sunshine) lose a lot of impact.But wait! There is a reason! Several episodes in, we learn that - *gasp* - the school is in danger. And this is when the problems with this series start to really show themselves. Simply put, Aqours is a bunch of Muse fangirls. They could hardly go a single episode without making a reference to them, and they were even HAPPY when they heard the bad news about their school - because now they could be more like Muse. This series lives in Muse\'s shadow and never really steps out of it.Speaking of Muse, let\'s take a moment and remember why we loved that series. The original Love Live anime was a story of nine girls pouring in blood, sweat, and tears to protect the school that their families have been attending for generations. Then they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to be the best idols they could be. Then, once they were standing on top of the world, they poured in blood, sweat, and tears to ensure that school idols would live on forever.Notice how much I said ""blood, sweat, and tears."" There were countless scenes of the characters practicing their dancing, worrying about costumes, asking Eli to coach them, and so on. We saw all the effort they put into their activities, which made their successes all the more rewarding. Sunshine has... maybe two practice scenes? There was one in episode eleven, and I think there might have been one or two brief ones earlier. The original series used the practice scenes for character development (and the performances, which I\'ll get to in a second), while Sunshine does character development in other ways. Which is fine, but we still need to see the girls practice. When their performances happen, they don\'t feel believable. It doesn\'t feel like they\'ve earned it.AND speaking of the performances, let\'s talk about why the ones in Sunshine were disappointing. In the original series, most of the performances (not quite all, but nearly all) were situated within the context of the anime. It was ""okay, we\'re going to perform now,"" and then they performed. In season one, the only one that wasn\'t like this was Susume->Tomorrow. Since context was given for these performances, we knew that they were actually happening. We could focus on the lyrics - which were ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, as they often served to summarize or even develop the characters\' feelings up until that moment. Who can forget the moment when Honoka, Umi, and Kotori performed START:DASH!! in an empty auditorium? Who can forget the moment when Rin led the team in performing Love wing bell? Not only did we see the characters earn their performances (as discussed above), but we also saw how their performances affected them.In Sunshine, three of the six insert songs are just kinda... shoved in there. With no context. Even the movie had little segues into Hello, Hoshi wo Kazoete and ?<-HEARTBEAT. But Sunshine just plops the characters into stage outfits and shows them performing in some random place. We have no way of knowing if they\'re actually happening in-universe. How, then, are we supposed to take them seriously? Why are we supposed to care?To be fair, episode eleven of Sunshine is good. We see the girls practice, we see their feelings develop over the course of the episode, and the insert song is rooted in the context of the story. Plus, its lyrics are extremely relevant to the characters\' feelings. It felt like classic Love Live. It made me wish we\'d been getting that all season.Oh, I haven\'t even gotten to the writing yet. The writing is... man, I wish I could say it was good. But it wasn\'t. I talked earlier about the ""save the school"" plot being reused. I can\'t say I\'m entirely opposed to it, but I feel like it would only have worked if they had been up-front about it. Bring it up in episode one. Don\'t fake us out and make us think you might be doing something different. But anyway! The constant references to Muse get old really quick. They happened so often that I thought they were set-up for a ""we need to step out of their shadow and be our own group"" realization, but that never happened.And then there\'s the third-year subplot. This permeates the first half of the series, eventually being resolved in episode nine, and the tone is unreal. It feels very gloomy and depressing - very strange for Love Live. The rest of the time, the show\'s tone is exactly what you\'d expect from a Love Live anime, and the juxtaposition is jarring and rough. It feels like the plot to a late-night drama got mixed into the happy, fun idol show. And when this subplot does get resolved, the reasoning behind the offending character\'s actions is very flimsy, hard to believe, and - frankly - insulting. When it was first revealed, my reaction was, ""They expect me to buy this?"" It left a lot of actions unexplained, it blatantly contradicted plenty of other scenes we\'d seen in earlier episodes, and it just reeked of bad writing. And then, in the very next episode, Chika does the exact thing that this subplot condemned - and gets rewarded for it!Oh, and let\'s not forget the yuribait. It was very heavy. In fact, I\'m not sure it can even be called ""bait."" It was just plain old yuri (that never ended up going anywhere). Don\'t get me wrong - I love yuri. I own eight NicoMaki doujinshi. But it didn\'t add anything to Sunshine. The involved characters didn\'t gain any development, and the yuri never went beyond one line at the end of episode ten. A line that, might I add, would be the precursor to a romantic subplot in just about any other anime. It felt like they were trying to pander to fudanshi in the same way that they were pandering to Muse nostalgia for the rest of the series. I was, again, kind of insulted that they thought we\'d buy it if they splashed a little yuri in there somewhere.Then good things spontaneously start happening for our characters for no reason, as they\'d only canonically had two performances so far (one of which was a local event, the other of which was a flop). And half of episode thirteen is dedicated to a recap of the season. No, seriously. And this recap illustrates all the things I\'ve been talking about. They never really earned any of the popularity they got at any point in the series. There never really was a good reason for Yohane to join the group - they even glossed over it in the recap. And there never really was any reason to care about the group\'s successes and failures.I really wanted to like this anime. At first, I figured it could never live up to the legacy of the original series, but I decided to give it a fair chance. And I realized that my original misgivings were right on the money. Sunshine was plagued by bad writing, meaningless performances, and nervous desperation as it tried to simultaneously lean on Muse for support and ignore the secrets to Muse\'s success.My final rating for Love Live! School idol project Sunshine!! is a four out of ten.Oh dear lord this review is long. If you\'ve read this far, thanks. CGI dance sequences, though. The only one that was fully hand-drawn was the performance by the ""rival"" idol group that is only relevant for about one episode.The music is also amazing.

School idol project Sunshine!! is a four out of ten.Oh dear lord this review is long. If you\'ve read this far, thanks.', 'We all know that Love Live! is an economically successful franchise. I admit, I\'ve also sinked some of my money on Love Live! \'cause I\'m a big fan of the franchise. So it\'s no surprise that this got a spin off. I was really hyped for Sunshine and now that I finished the series, did it live up to my expectations?(This review will contain SPOILERS)[Story]When Sunshine got announced, I got really excited because I wanted to see more Love Live!. I was skeptical though because when I saw the 10 minutes character introduction PV for LL Sunshine, not only do some characters of this new...group look like the original cast from Love Live! (You and Kotori, Mari and Eli, and etc.) but also, some of the characters\' personalities are alike. They basically show you the bio of the new characters in the video and that\'s how I learned about their personalities.Just like the 1st Season of Love Live!, the story here is relatively simple and fairly similar to the 1st Season of LL. The difference here is Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place about 5 years after  µ\'s disbanded and now focuses on a new group called ""Aquors"" (pronounced as Aqua) which consists of 9 girls aspiring to become the next famous school idol like  µ\'s. Just like the previous seasons of Love Live though, I don\'t really give a shit about the story since the school idols are the main focus of the series and the songs.The aspect that I found a bit annoying, but nothing major, in Sunshine is the constant references of µ\'s and callbacks. Yes, I get it. They won Love Live and they\'re very famous but I just found it really annoying that the show constantly mentions µ\'s this and that. For example, the episode that introduced us to Hanamaru. I got really irritated at the end of the episode because of how much they were focusing on Rin\'s shot. I get it, she\'s relating herself to Rin but it was too much. Now, there\'s a reason why I didn\'t exactly dislike the said aspect that much.In the first 7 episodes, Chika was basically following  µ\'s\' footsteps and thinking that if she does exactly what  µ\'s did, she and her group would become just as popular as  µ\'s. I\'m glad that the 8th episode completely blew my conception of Sunshine being just a ""blatant rip-off of Love Live!"". I really love the 8th episode because it was reality slapping Chika\'s face. Aquors got 0 points in  the preliminaries and she realizes that ever since  µ\'s won Love Live, the idol competition has become way more competitive than before and she also realized that simply copying  µ\'s won\'t get them to where they want to go. Man, I am loving this ""From nothing to something"" concept that I\'ve been seeing in anime lately. Aquors\' song ""Step!Zero to One!"" now makes perfect sense. Btw, that song is really good.Love Live Sunshine is also aware of the fact that Aquors is copying µ\'s and that\'s the reason why I mostly changed my mind about the constant references and callbacks of µ\'s in earlier parts of the series. In the 12th episode, Chika realized how µ\'s exactly got successful and also realized that she needs to stop copying µ\'s, be their own selves and forge a new path, breaking away from µ\'s. This whole season is basically about Aquors forming and learning about who they truly are. I\'m quite excited for the 2nd Season, now that Aquors is heading on their own path towards success.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9.5/10)The art style of the original Love Live was decent, at best and the character designs looked good but was too moe, for my taste, but I got used to it. Also, just like everyone else, I hated the use of CGI in µ\'s Live Shows. However, in Love Live Sunshine, every aspect of the show\'s visuals and animation is significantly improved. The art style looks better, the visuals and backgrounds is more superior than the predecessor and the character designs looks like more work was put into it. The Live Shows, for once, doesn\'t burn my eyes. It\'s looks like Sunrise learned how to utilize and blend the CGI and 2D Animation perfectly. Seriously, watching Aquors\' CGI performance was a lot more bearable than watching µ\'s CGI performance.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (10/10)As a µ\'s fan, I\'m sorry for betraying µ\'s by saying this but Aquors\' songs sounds A LOT better than most µ\'s songs. Aquors songs sounds more energetic and lively as opposed to µ\'s dramatic-tune and sometimes melancholic but with a touch of happiness (That\'s the best I can explain µ\'s songs). In LL 1st Season, the only songs that I liked was START:DASH and Susume Tommorow. In Sunshine, I love almost every song. Some examples are Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu (which completely shits on almost every µ\'s song that I\'ve listened to in the past few years), Omoi yo hitotsu ni nare, and more because you get what I\'m trying say here. I just wished that they used ""Step!Zero to One"" in the last episode because it would have fit the show\'s context.The OP theme song is ""Aozora Jumping Heart"" by Aquors. I really love this OP the same reason I love the mentioned songs earlier. It\'s better than the 1st OP of Love Live but it\'s on par with the 2nd OP of Love Live.The ED theme song is ""Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou "" by Aquors. Just like the first OP, I also love this song but if I have to be more specific, I love the version where only Chika and Riko were singing. I think this is better than the 1st ED of Love Live! but the 2nd ED of Love Live! is still better than Sunshine\'s ED.I watched the show in English Dub and Subs but I\'m only going to review the Japanese\'s VA\'s singing talent. Chika, Riko and You\'s singing voices are godlike and they\'re 50% of the reason why Aquors\' songs are great. Hell, that\'s the reason why I think ""Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu"" is better than most µ\'s songs. Their voices are just absolutely amazing and I\'d prefer if Chika, Riko and You have their own subunit. I still don\'t know why one of Aquors\' official subunit comprises of Chika, You and Ruby. It should have been Riko instead of Ruby :/______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (8/10)Despite all the good things that I\'ve been saying about Aquors, I still like the members of µ\'s more than the members of Aquors. It\'s not because Aquors is uninteresting. It\'s because the characters from Love Live! has way more screentime and character development than Aquors at the moment. Once Sunshine gets 2nd Season and a movie then I\'ll love Aquors just as much as I love µ\'s.Like the original Love Live!, Sunshine has 9 characters and evenly split into 3 girls per grade. I just want to say that the difference between Aquors having 9 members and µ\'s having 9 members is that µ\'s 9 members group had meaning into it and makes perfect sense because of the name of their group while Aquors\' amount of members is just....umm..yea.....Who cares, right? Gotta stick with the winning formula and I\'m not complaining. Anyways, the first years are Ruby Kurosawa, Hanamaru Kunikida and Yoshiko Tsushima (Yohane). Ruby is Dia\'s younger sister and she\'s shy and bit of an introvert girl. To make it more simpler, she\'s like Hanayo except I found Ruby to be a lot more cuter but Hanayo\'s extreme love for rice was what made her more likable. Hanamaru is Ruby\'s best friend and she loves to read books and she has little to no knowledge when it comes to technology since she lives at a temple. She says ""zura"" at the end of her sentence all the time. To make it more simpler, she\'s like Rin except she\'s a bookworm and she doesn\'t get on my goddamn nerves. Then there\'s Yoshiko, a chuunibyou girl who thinks she\'s the ""fallen angel"" and she prefers to be called by her persona ""Yohane"". Honestly, I still prefer Nico over her but I can\'t help but love her ""Yohane"" persona. I wouldn\'t mind sacrificing myself to become her little demon.Then there\'s the second years Chika Takami, You Watanabe and Riko Sakurauchi. You (Pronounced as Yo) is Chika\'s longtime childhood friend and has a habit of dressing up in a sailor suit since she\'s a marine enthusiast. You is currently my best girl of the series. Judging by her appearance, you\'d think she\'s like Kotori except she\'s not. Besides her designing Aquors\' costumes, hers and Kotori\'s personality are nothing alike. You is more lively and her voice doesn\'t make my ears bleed while Kotori is the cute girl but with an ear-piercing voice. As much as I want to make a You pun right now, I don\'t want to because I love ""you"" and I really don\'t want to break ""you"" \'re heart by making all these terrible puns xD. Chika is the enthusiastic leader of Aquors. I just want to mention that Chika got way more character development than Honoka did in the 1st Season of LL. In the original LL, it wasn\'t until the 2nd Season where Honoka got a character development. Even so, Chika\'s character development is already more impressive than Honoka so even though both characters\' enthusiasm and determination to reach their goals are the same, I still prefer Chika over Honoka. Riko is a transfer student from Otonokizaka High (µ\'s school) and a girl who plays the piano. Riko is like a mixture of Umi and Maki and I really like her Maki side. In other words, I like it when Riko gets all flattered over something.Then there\'s the third years Dia Kurosawa, Mari Ohara, and Kanan Matsura. Dia (Pronounced as ""Daya"" or as in Diamond) is the student council president. She\'s mostly like Eli, in terms of her being stubborn at times and the way she acts as a student council president. The similarities are there. The difference here is Dia has a legitimate reason for rejecting Chika\'s application sheet to form a school idol club. I mean, Eli has a legitimate reason too but both of their reasons are completely different. Mari is a rich girl who decided to come back to Uranohoshi after hearing about someone forming a school idol. I really thought Mari was going to be either Nozomi or Eli but boy, was I wrong. I mean, the only similarities between Mari and Nozomi is they both like to grope someone\'s breast but other than that, their personalities are completely different. I also love Mari\'s ""Engrish"" catchphrases. Especially her ""It\'s joke"" quote and my most favourite is her ""Oh My God!"" quote. Fun fact: Mari\'s ""It\'s joke"" quote was kept in the English Dub version but almost every one of her Engrish quotes was changed to an Italian accent. Kanan is that almost non-existent character who barely made an appearance in the first half of the series but had more screentime in the second half. I started liking Kanan more when the third years were getting more focus on the early 2nd half of the series.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)Face it people, µ\'s time is over and it\'s Aquors\' time to shine. The sooner you accept that, the more you\'ll enjoy this show like I did. I really enjoyed the characters, especially Chika and her determination to never give up even though she got cornered but managed to got herself out of the position. Plus, the songs are better than most songs from µ\'s. Currently, my Aquors-created playlist in my phone is now at over 13 songs and counting.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]When Love Live Sunshine and Aquors first got introduced, I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought they wouldn\'t live up to µ\'s\' greatness. Now that I finished Sunshine, the series blew away my expectations. As of right now, µ\'s is still better but Aquors has a lot of potential to overtake µ\'s and as time grows on, they\'ll either be on par with them or end up being better than them. I mean, most of Aquors\' songs are already better than what the 1st Season of LL offered.The story is recycled but I kind-of saw this coming since the 2nd Season of LL did the same shit. Also, the µ\'s references and callbacks were a bit dragged out. The character is where it\'s at though. The character development for the third years and the 2nd year, especially Chika were really good but just like the 2nd Season of LL, their character development will definitely get better (and hopefully more character development for the first years) once Sunshine gets 2nd Season.[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)Pros:+Aquors turned out to be a very lovable idol group at the end of the series+Aquors\' songs are great and better than µ\'s songs from 1st and 2nd Season+Enjoyable characters with amazing character dynamics between two or three Aquors members+Great character development for Chika and the 3rd years+Visually Appealing Animation+CGI in Live Shows is significantly improvedCons:-Constant references and callback to µ\'s got a bit annoying group look like the original cast from Love Live! (You and Kotori, Mari and Eli, and etc.) but also, some of the characters\' personalities are alike. They basically show you the bio of the new characters in the video and that\'s how I learned about their personalities.Just like the 1st Season of Love Live!, the story here is relatively simple and fairly similar to the 1st Season of LL. The difference here is Love Live! Sunshine!! takes place about 5 years after  µ\'s disbanded and now focuses on a new group called ""Aquors"" (pronounced as Aqua) which consists of 9 girls aspiring to become the next famous school idol like  µ\'s. Just like the previous seasons of Love Live though, I don\'t really give a shit about the story since the school idols are the main focus of the series and the songs.The aspect that I found a bit annoying, but nothing major, in Sunshine is the constant references of µ\'s and callbacks. Yes, I get it. They won Love Live and they\'re very famous but I just found it really annoying that the show constantly mentions µ\'s this and that. For example, the episode that introduced us to Hanamaru. I got really irritated at the end of the episode because of how much they were focusing on Rin\'s shot. I get it, she\'s relating herself to Rin but it was too much. Now, there\'s a reason why I didn\'t exactly dislike the said aspect that much.In the first 7 episodes, Chika was basically following  µ\'s\' footsteps and thinking that if she does exactly what  µ\'s did, she and her group would become just as popular as  µ\'s. I\'m glad that the 8th episode completely blew my conception of Sunshine being just a ""blatant rip-off of Love Live!"". I really love the 8th episode because it was reality slapping Chika\'s face. Aquors got 0 points in  the preliminaries and she realizes that ever since  µ\'s won Love Live, the idol competition has become way more competitive than before and she also realized that simply copying  µ\'s won\'t get them to where they want to go. Man, I am loving this ""From nothing to something"" concept that I\'ve been seeing in anime lately. Aquors\' song ""Step!Zero to One!"" now makes perfect sense. Btw, that song is really good.Love Live Sunshine is also aware of the fact that Aquors is copying µ\'s and that\'s the reason why I mostly changed my mind about the constant references and callbacks of µ\'s in earlier parts of the series. In the 12th episode, Chika realized how µ\'s exactly got successful and also realized that she needs to stop copying µ\'s, be their own selves and forge a new path, breaking away from µ\'s. This whole season is basically about Aquors forming and learning about who they truly are. I\'m quite excited for the 2nd Season, now that Aquors is heading on their own path towards success.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9.5/10)The art style of the original Love Live was decent, at best and the character designs looked good but was too moe, for my taste, but I got used to it. Also, just like everyone else, I hated the use of CGI in µ\'s Live Shows. However, in Love Live Sunshine, every aspect of the show\'s visuals and animation is significantly improved. The art style looks better, the visuals and backgrounds is more superior than the predecessor and the character designs looks like more work was put into it. The Live Shows, for once, doesn\'t burn my eyes. It\'s looks like Sunrise learned how to utilize and blend the CGI and 2D Animation perfectly. Seriously, watching Aquors\' CGI performance was a lot more bearable than watching µ\'s CGI performance.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (10/10)As a µ\'s fan, I\'m sorry for betraying µ\'s by saying this but Aquors\' songs sounds A LOT better than most µ\'s songs. Aquors songs sounds more energetic and lively as opposed to µ\'s dramatic-tune and sometimes melancholic but with a touch of happiness (That\'s the best I can explain µ\'s songs). In LL 1st Season, the only songs that I liked was START:DASH and Susume Tommorow. In Sunshine, I love almost every song. Some examples are Kimeta yo Hand in Hand, Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu (which completely shits on almost every µ\'s song that I\'ve listened to in the past few years), Omoi yo hitotsu ni nare, and more because you get what I\'m trying say here. I just wished that they used ""Step!Zero to One"" in the last episode because it would have fit the show\'s context.The OP theme song is ""Aozora Jumping Heart"" by Aquors. I really love this OP the same reason I love the mentioned songs earlier. It\'s better than the 1st OP of Love Live but it\'s on par with the 2nd OP of Love Live.The ED theme song is ""Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou "" by Aquors. Just like the first OP, I also love this song but if I have to be more specific, I love the version where only Chika and Riko were singing. I think this is better than the 1st ED of Love Live! but the 2nd ED of Love Live! is still better than Sunshine\'s ED.I watched the show in English Dub and Subs but I\'m only going to review the Japanese\'s VA\'s singing talent. Chika, Riko and You\'s singing voices are godlike and they\'re 50% of the reason why Aquors\' songs are great. Hell, that\'s the reason why I think ""Daisuki Dattara Daijoubu"" is better than most µ\'s songs. Their voices are just absolutely amazing and I\'d prefer if Chika, Riko and You have their own subunit. I still don\'t know why one of Aquors\' official subunit comprises of Chika, You and Ruby. It should have been Riko instead of Ruby :/______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (8/10)Despite all the good things that I\'ve been saying about Aquors, I still like the members of µ\'s more than the members of Aquors. It\'s not because Aquors is uninteresting. It\'s because the characters from Love Live! has way more screentime and character development than Aquors at the moment. Once Sunshine gets 2nd Season and a movie then I\'ll love Aquors just as much as I love µ\'s.Like the original Love Live!, Sunshine has 9 characters and evenly split into 3 girls per grade. I just want to say that the difference between Aquors having 9 members and µ\'s having 9 members is that µ\'s 9 members group had meaning into it and makes perfect sense because of the name of their group while Aquors\' amount of members is just....umm..yea.....Who cares, right? Gotta stick with the winning formula and I\'m not complaining. Anyways, the first years are Ruby Kurosawa, Hanamaru Kunikida and Yoshiko Tsushima (Yohane). Ruby is Dia\'s younger sister and she\'s shy and bit of an introvert girl. To make it more simpler, she\'s like Hanayo except I found Ruby to be a lot more cuter but Hanayo\'s extreme love for rice was what made her more likable. Hanamaru is Ruby\'s best friend and she loves to read books and she has little to no knowledge when it comes to technology since she lives at a temple. She says ""zura"" at the end of her sentence all the time. To make it more simpler, she\'s like Rin except she\'s a bookworm and she doesn\'t get on my goddamn nerves. Then there\'s Yoshiko, a chuunibyou girl who thinks she\'s the ""fallen angel"" and she prefers to be called by her persona ""Yohane"". Honestly, I still prefer Nico over her but I can\'t help but love her ""Yohane"" persona. I wouldn\'t mind sacrificing myself to become her little demon.Then there\'s the second years Chika Takami, You Watanabe and Riko Sakurauchi. You (Pronounced as Yo) is Chika\'s longtime childhood friend and has a habit of dressing up in a sailor suit since she\'s a marine enthusiast. You is currently my best girl of the series. Judging by her appearance, you\'d think she\'s like Kotori except she\'s not. Besides her designing Aquors\' costumes, hers and Kotori\'s personality are nothing alike. You is more lively and her voice doesn\'t make my ears bleed while Kotori is the cute girl but with an ear-piercing voice. As much as I want to make a You pun right now, I don\'t want to because I love ""you"" and I really don\'t want to break ""you"" \'re heart by making all these terrible puns xD. Chika is the enthusiastic leader of Aquors. I just want to mention that Chika got way more character development than Honoka did in the 1st Season of LL. In the original LL, it wasn\'t until the 2nd Season where Honoka got a character development. Even so, Chika\'s character development is already more impressive than Honoka so even though both characters\' enthusiasm and determination to reach their goals are the same, I still prefer Chika over Honoka. Riko is a transfer student from Otonokizaka High (µ\'s school) and a girl who plays the piano. Riko is like a mixture of Umi and Maki and I really like her Maki side. In other words, I like it when Riko gets all flattered over something.Then there\'s the third years Dia Kurosawa, Mari Ohara, and Kanan Matsura. Dia (Pronounced as ""Daya"" or as in Diamond) is the student council president. She\'s mostly like Eli, in terms of her being stubborn at times and the way she acts as a student council president. The similarities are there. The difference here is Dia has a legitimate reason for rejecting Chika\'s application sheet to form a school idol club. I mean, Eli has a legitimate reason too but both of their reasons are completely different. Mari is a rich girl who decided to come back to Uranohoshi after hearing about someone forming a school idol. I really thought Mari was going to be either Nozomi or Eli but boy, was I wrong. I mean, the only similarities between Mari and Nozomi is they both like to grope someone\'s breast but other than that, their personalities are completely different. I also love Mari\'s ""Engrish"" catchphrases. Especially her ""It\'s joke"" quote and my most favourite is her ""Oh My God!"" quote. Fun fact: Mari\'s ""It\'s joke"" quote was kept in the English Dub version but almost every one of her Engrish quotes was changed to an Italian accent. Kanan is that almost non-existent character who barely made an appearance in the first half of the series but had more screentime in the second half. I started liking Kanan more when the third years were getting more focus on the early 2nd half of the series.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)Face it people, µ\'s time is over and it\'s Aquors\' time to shine.

Yet here it is, in all of its glory. And for the past six years, only one franchise dared to ever raise that question in the 2010s.Love Live has enjoyed worldwide popularity, and not just because it has cute girls and really nice songs. If such were the case, then that would mean stuff like Show by Rock! would be popular. Sunrise doesn\'t just take what it sees...and rolls with it, adding irrelevant junk and catering to \'""realistic"", cute-girls-need-to-suffer fags\' and \'wish-fulfillment\' like IM@S does, but instead, takes the whole package; by creating story about girls striving to shine, and really, that\'s all it needs to be. ""So, how different, then, is it from other idol shit like Aikatsu?"" I\'ll tell you why.Because Love Live succeeds at it. Especially Sunshine.I\'ll be the first to admit that I was downright skeptical when this was first announced. I was worried it was going to be a copy of the first season, making the same formulaic recruitment episodes and drama, and the mistakes that plagued it. And oh boy was I wrong. I mentioned earlier that Sunrise takes the \'whole package\', so what exactly is in it? It\'s everything about idols. From the way they dress, what they sing down to the girl\'s personalities and the struggles of adolescence. However, they didn\'t always succeed at using it. Let\'s date back to the first Love Live season. While superb in its own way, there were things that prevented perfect enjoyment, such as issues with characterization and drama, as well as circumstances that made little to no sense on the part of some character arcs. All of these problems were whisked away with the advent of Love Live S2, which is probably the most inspiring piece of media I have ever watched. No teen melodrama or action-induced fantasy isekai story is able to say ""go do something better with your life"" better than this particular second season has, filled to the brim with sad and happy moments that touch my heart deeply. And after just one year after Muse ended their story, Sunshine arrived.Seeing as it\'d be another first season, you could understand my fear. But Sunshine does more than just correct the mistakes of the first season. It takes the very concept of creating a school idol group and makes it its own. Sure, the entire ordeal is formulaic on paper, but the way it blossoms is just so spectacular and uplifting, its as though its not Love Live at all. Yet at the same time, it is.At first glance, the character designs look about the same, with some copied tropes from the previous series (e.g. student council president, the clumsy one, the shy one, the ""futsu no onna"" one, the groper etc.). I\'m not gonna surprise you by saying ""OH! BUT THEYRE DIFFERENT!"", no. Essentially, they are different takes on the trope, and this is necessary if Sunshine really wants to tell a new kind of story. What makes these characters stand out and shine on their own is the way they are characterized, and this has a lot to do with the involvement of Muse. It\'s actually amazing how much influence a group of characters that aren\'t even there have on the story. In Sunshine, Muse have moved on from singing school girls to living, breathing gods. From the way they\'re only seen through posters to the way the characters talk about them with revere and divinity. Heck, in one of the episodes, one of the girls sends a fan letter to Honoka (from the first 2 seasons) but it sounds more like a fucking prayer than fan mail.Essentially, Idol anime are character stories, taking the viewer through the journey of a girl to become the number one star. And while some anime require about a hundred episodes to make a story whole, some only need as few as 13.Sunshine is rich with flavorful characterization, often using visual directing to do most of the talking rather than outright telling. The use of common/cheesy phrases and emphasis of tone help bring out what these girls are, pulling away from the idea that every teenage girl is a dark, wild and emo Chloe Moretz and instead giving the audience something very different. They give them dreams; desires, none poisonous, but awfully human and representative of who the girls are inside and out. From painful outbursts to soft-spoken sympathy, Sunshine embraces the use of imagery and dialogue to tell us who these characters really are without (mostly) words. A girl seeking acceptance taking a stray hand, a girl who hasn\'t once dreamed of breaking out of her shell witnessing it on a magazine cover, the desire to shine brighter than diamonds with everyone you\'ve met; there are simply so many things to take from these characters, and in only 13 episodes. Sure, it can be lacking at times, but what the series delivered was more than enough. I\'m not going to say what exactly was developed and how; that\'s for you to experience yourself.Side-characters were also great, but a bit underused. Of course, with idols, you\'re always going to have competition and just from simply existing, Saint Snow captures that feeling of intimidation almost perfectly. From their music, to the way they walk, they were certainly very captivating, not only in terms of fear for the main cast, but in their outright beauty. The rest of the cast were your supportive sisters and classmates, and were utilized well if to help the series lose that feeling of insularity.Going technical, Sunshine not only looks better, is animated better or sounds better. It also FEELS better. It\'s taken the spirit of Love Live and turned it into something so engrossing and captivating to watch. The short moments on stage are always spectacular, showcasing lots of fluid choreography and outstanding cinematography that puts the original series\' efforts to dirt. . While newcomers will be engulfed by the simply beautiful direction of these sequences, old time fans will be welcomed again by the feelings and passionate emotion present in the film or even, dare I say, the Final Live. The music is also fantastic. Every track resembled what was happening at the moment of the series and creates a wholly immersive experience when listening to the tune and lyrics. The best example I can give is Saint Snow\'s performance, 「Self Control」. It was certainly the most memorable moment in the series, not only in introducing Saint Snow as an idol group or a threat, but as professionals; a pair that knew exactly what they were doing and knew how to do it good.The backdrop work and animating are nothing short of ecstatic. There is more fluidity in the character and mouth movements, use of lighting and colors are beautifully done and the sound quality is great. There is simply no reason not to watch this in 1080p, if only to get the full experience of the series. On part of directing outside of character drama, there is a whole slew of hilarious moments. Some great, some just okay but nothing ever a bad joke. The timing of the jokes and delivery are a lot better than in previous seasons, where it was usually out of nowhere or just downright unfunny at times. Slice of Life moments had great presentation, making use of attractive sea-like colors for reflection and energy of the scene, to drive out the boredom.This is money very well spent on Sunrise\'s part.Love Live! Sunshine!! recaptures the beauty of the original series through different lens and delivers something that exceeded all of my expectations. It is the second series this year that\'s made me feel so emotionally captivated, enough to make me shed tears. 2016 wasn\'t so great but with gems like these, any year can be truly memorable. I look forward to whatever Sunrise has in store for the franchise next, or if we\'re ever getting that Yohane spin-off that\'s in high demand right now.8/10 and rolls with it, adding irrelevant junk and catering to \'""realistic"", cute-girls-need-to-suffer fags\' and \'wish-fulfillment\' like IM@S does, but instead, takes the whole package; by creating story about girls striving to shine, and really, that\'s all it needs to be.

Most of the Love Live fanbase was trying so much to hate this anime since Aquors was replacing µ\'s and most of them were trying to hate the new girls.  I always thought Sunshine would make a fresh new start in the series and would make us like the new girls in a different way we loved µ\'s.  Sadly, Love Live Sunshine didn\'t live up on my expectations, but still it is a very enjoyable anime.Story 5/10Even though I started liking the story, the writing becomes...repetitive.  Most of the ideas were taken out from the first anime: Start:Dash moment, school is closing again, some characters were retired idols.  While I feel like µ\'s spent too much time practicing and worrying about Love Live, Aquors like to hang out and eat ice cream.  During the final episodes, Chika wants to practice a lot, but still, it seems like the anime focuses more on ""cute girls doing cute things"".Character 7/10I\'m not disappointed with the character writing, but I don\'t feel overwhelmed neither.  Most of the characters were already written in Love Live.  Chika is a Honoka clone:   it\'s the exact same character with no actual reason to become school idol except ""I want to shine"".  We have Ruby, a Hanayo-like character who is cute and loves idols.  Dia is the student council president that doesn\'t want Chika to become an idol at first, exactly like Eli. Mari is a Nozomi like character who says english stuff combined with japanese, she also rubs everyone\'s breasts...uhh.  Then we have Riko, who is an Um -like character combined with Maki\'s abilities, she serves as the protagonist main love interest and best friend (I\'m not kidding here).  Kanan is a gloomy character that becomes more like Eli as time passes.  Yoshiko is probably one of my favorite characters, even though her character has been done a lot of times; she delivers fun like Nico in a Chunii way, but Nico is probably funnier, and I don\'t like Nico a lot.  I feel like Hanamaru and You are the best characters here.  You is a girl with a lot of security but she\'s kind of jealous, she is always smiling  and cheering people up; she isn\'t a Kotori, since Kotori is always trying to accept everyone\'s opinions, even when hers are being rejected.  Hanamaru is a Rin-like character, except she isn\'t Rin; she always says ""zura"" except of ""nya"", but she has a lot of character development and I can understand her character a lot.Art and Sound 10/10As always, Love Live delivers colorful art along with beautiful music. The animation is fine, thanks to Sunrise.  All performances look gorgeous and the girls look pretty.Enjoyment 8/10The anime is pretty dramatic and funny, so you will always get a lot of laughs and tears.  There aren\'t many plot twists, so it loses a lot of Enjoyment, since you know the girls are going to make it eventually.Overall 8/10With repetitive characters, mediocre story writing, but beautiful music and sound, Love Live Sunshine!! will be loved by LoveLivers but it lacks the spirit the first anime had. repetitive.

We find ourselves once again in idol territory and what a good time it's been! As always we're working from the dubbed version (sorry guys, I don't dislike subs by any means, I just default out to dub if there's a version available) and this will be dealing with season 1 only. The quick of things is while Sunshine is slightly inferior to the original Love Live! (you never forget your first loves I guess) it's still more than worth your time to watch. Let's see how brightly we can all shine!Note: instead of constantly referring to seasons,...I'm going to break this down reference-wise to dealing with the idol group names. I'll refer to seasons 1 and 2 as Muse, this season as Aqours. Saves me some writing, you some reading, and hopefully keeps the confusion to a minimum.Story: 7There's an immediate and obvious knock against the story, that being the group is so much similar to Muse in looks, behaviors, and such that it was hard for me to keep up at first with who was who in Aqours. Every time I saw gray haired You in Aqours I had immediate expectations for her to be the airhead of the group, the same as Kotori from Muse. Of course there is a world of difference in character between the two, but because appearances are somewhat similar, early on, I kept associating Aqours members with their Muse lookalikes. This was dispelled fairly quickly, but was somewhat irksome at first. It doesn't help when there are characters like Aqour's Chika who even in motivation and personality resembles Muse's Honoka. An expected complaint I'm sure, but still one worth noting.The big knock for me on the story was the ever-present plot device of 'omg our school will close down if we're not successful!' How many times do we have to beat this dead horse in anime? Is there a single anime school that *isn't* on the verge of closure and reorganization? It's a tired trope that I'm frankly just sick of. And in this story it's even more irritating as Muse had to deal with the same problem in their story as well. So we do have similar looking characters, some with similar personality traits, with the same total members by the end of the show's run (9), and once again the school is facing closure. This loops back around on my 'too similar' complaint. But please, anime creators who I know troll through MAL's review section reading reviews with only a few 'likes', drop the school closing act. We've been there, done that too many times.While once we accept the plot device and move on with the story, we find a nice little tale of the girls coming together and working hard to fulfill their dreams. This is another well worn idea, but is still fun and inspiring when done right, and Aqours mostly gets it right. They are also more realistic than Muse in their goals, deciding that making Love Live! competition is enough, and that instead of saving the school, they just want to see an increase in applicants, see that their efforts has inspired others. Sure, shoot for the moon, but understanding one's limitations can be important too. They also score a victory in getting the 3rd year girls on stage after they miss an important opportunity in their freshman year. Winning Love Live! would surely be an acceptable outcome, of course, but part of their victory is just getting there, and getting attention for their cause.The story in this first season of Aqour's story wraps up nicely, and we can see they were obviously planning a sequel because they leave the story open ended. They do give us strong clues to the resolution of the plot points, but also leave inroads for further adventures with the girls. It's really hard to find a good balance between closing out a storyline in a way that is acceptable just in case there's no sequel season, and leaving the story open enough not to feel forced if there is. Aqours does this perfectly. Just enough satisfaction to leave me pleased, but enough mystery to make me want to see more.There is however, another huge problem we have this time around, and its the same as last time: the opening theme. While the theme is in place for the entire series, we have characters that are openly hostile to the idol program at first singing and dancing in full costume in the opening number. Its a very self-spoiling thing. There's a point where a character basically is saying there's no way in hell she'd become a school idol, yet there she is at the beginning of the episode in full costume dancing and singing onstage. This irked the hell out of me, though I must say Muse's first season did the same thing.Otherwise we get exactly what we're expecting to get from this story. If you liked Muse, you'll be right at home, as the concepts are so similar, the characters are likable, and the slice of life parts of their coming together are fun. If you've not seen Muse's story, I would recommend starting with them, however, even though Aqours is a strong entry, I still feel Muse slightly edges them out of the top spot. Again we get singing and dancing teen girls laying down sugary sweet J-pop type tunes and just being overall silly yet coming together and working hard for their goals. Felt like slipping into comfortable grooves yet new enough to make it fun.Art: 9The art is gorgeous but that's to be expected. Muse looked damn good, and these girls do too. Lots of nice detail in the art, and the girls are cute as buttons. The costumes are intricate, and perhaps border on too busy at moments, but I think they pulled it off without going too far over that line. The girls are all recognizable whether in their idol costumes, their workout clothes, or their school uniforms. The eyes are beautiful done in this series and little details are attended to nicely. I personally love the look of this entire series a great deal.Sound: 9Again we have several songs in the show, as is expected from the idol genre. There's not as many as there is in other shows, thinking of the Idolmaster series in particular, but there's more than say, K-On. The music that is played is lighthearted and fun, and fits the girls and the group perfectly. The opening theme is almost as good as Muse's, which is high praise, as I'll listen to Muse's opening in my general playlist. The closer is really great as well, and I found myself humming along many times.The dub voice actors are all pretty well chosen, none of them knocking too close to annoying. There is a few quirks among the group, including a country girl who says 'zura' nearly every sentence. At least no one 'nyans' in the series. From what I understand, the 'zura' girl doesn't say that with any conscious thought, that its kind of like saying 'yall' for us Southerners, we often forget we're even saying it unless someone points it out. In fact, 'zura' girl actually asks another girl to poke her and remind her to quit saying it while they are in Tokyo, visiting the big city. So I think it's a rural thing, this 'zura' saying, and that makes it a bit more understandable than the aforementioned annoying meowing cat girls.Character: 8There are some very interesting characters this time around, especially as we get used to the new lineup for Aqours. The primary 'leader' girl is kind of what you would expect, the hard working, determined type, but that's natural I think, as that's the type that usually *is* the leader in these situations. The 3rd years are all extremely well played, Dia standing out really well in my mind. There are moments between the 3rd years when shocking secrets come out, and a couple of 'holy shit, did she really just do that!?' moments to be had as well. In this regard I think they actually played it up better than Muse did. Muse had it's share of twists and turns, but they were rather softball pitches, and not as attention grabbing as some of the private moments between the 3rd years this time around.The rest of the girls are well played, if a little stereotypical. There's the shy girl of course, and the rich girl, though moneybags isn't pointed out anywhere near as often as Muse's was. This time around we even get sisters in the group, and their dynamic is pretty interesting. There's also relationship issues in Aqours that didn't exist in Muse, at least not in the same context. These new takes on how the girls related to each other is another thing that does set the show apart from its predecessor.There is an awesome comic relief girl that is even more attached to an alternate personality than Nico was in Muse. This girl goes around saying she's a fallen angel and carrying on in this silly supernatural/occult manner, speaking of demons and falling from heavens and calling on dark powers to aid her and all. So we do get some nice variety between the personalities we are served up.Enjoyment: 8I did really like Aqours' journey towards the Love Live! competition, and I'm eager to see where the next season is going to go with their story. The show is a lot of fun, whether the girls are fixing thousand dollar plates of food at the snack bar they run on the beach (rich people and wasting money, argh) or if they are gasping in awe as they go around the big city and take in life from the fast lane. Their adventures never got stale, the music was good, and the personalities featured played well off of each other.If you have watched Muse's story, just be ready to realign your brain around the Aqours members varying personalities. The gray-haired girl is no longer the airhead, the blonde isn't the hardass, the purple-haired 3rd year is no longer the sage source of wisdom for the group. Once you can get everyone sorted in your mind, you're going have a great time, I believe.Best Girl: Tsushima Yoshiko, or as she's known in her 'fallen angel' persona, Yohane. If I can't have a tsundere girl, give me the weirdo every time. With Yoshiko's insistence on being a fallen angel rising from the ashes or falling from grace or what have you, I just couldn't help but be smitten. She's also the primary comedic relief for the group, and is always pulling antics that made me laugh out loud. Dark forces, I call upon you to protect my beloved Yohane!Again, I think Muse is the better idol group, but only by a hair. Aqours is very close on their heels. I found this to be a wonderful show with lots of flair and style. This one does beat out Muse in the drama department, and the secrets of the past that the 3rd years carry isn't life shattering, but they do put enough of a twist on things to really demand attention. As long as you can put up with the whole 'school closure' thing, I think you'll be entertained as you watch the girls rise up and chase their dreams. No new RTLR pictures as I'm basically out of space now, but Yoshiko is making the shelves of little demon figures. So rise from the underworld, oh ye servants of darkness, and help me thumbs up Love Live! Sunshine! I'm going to break this down reference-wise to dealing with the idol group names. I'll refer to seasons 1 and 2 as Muse, this season as Aqours. Saves me some writing, you some reading, and hopefully keeps the confusion to a minimum.Story: 7There's an immediate and obvious knock against the story, that being the group is so much similar to Muse in looks, behaviors, and such that it was hard for me to keep up at first with who was who in Aqours.

So rise from the underworld, oh ye servants of darkness, and help me thumbs up Love Live! Sunshine!"", 'I give this 9 ? Really ? A school idol story with being shadow by u\'s and i give it 9 ?Here my opinion about this series :1. StoryProtagonist, Chika, willing to form a school idol group in her shool because she like u\'s and want to be them. Following then with same problem with series before, school will be closed out because not many student come to study in their school. After all, Chika get 8 other girls and form Aqours to compete in Love Live.Well, the story itself make you wonder ""is it copy paste from first Love Live series ?"". But, they...make good story in this series. The school closed case give more logic in this series, because they\'re live in small city and many family want their child to study in prestige school. Their recruit system also good, not forced like in First Love Live.And what are supposed they do ? They compete in Love Live like we know, but hey the result was not good. And they\'re not give up (like Honoka, sorry to mock you but i still hate you), still doing their job to getting better and paid off in the end. I also love their passion, not to win Love Live for first, but just get 1 vote and enjoying their performances.Standard but good story telling after all.2. ArtFor first impression (not in anime), I\'m not like it. The first love live had more good looking girl like Umi, Maki, and Kotori. But after one episode, i\'m getting used to the art, and make me like it more. Art style was same like first love live, but sunshine\'s art feels more real for me.3. SoundSoundtrack was great, i like all the song.4. CharacterI love all character. Chika being the great leader is most improvement from this series. And other character was lovely too. They even often make a joke about other member, like Yoshiko and Riko antics. I hope i can see Hanamaru read a book again if they plan to make 2nd season.5. EnjoymentThis series is my most beloved from Summer 2016. I can\'t describe my enjoyment waiting one week just to watch this series. It\'s kinda sad I couldn\'t see Yohane any more now.Overall, this series was my great pleasure. They are embodied that title ""Sunshine"", they are bright like a sunshine and keep thier enjoying life. make good story in this series.

EnjoymentThis series is my most beloved from Summer 2016. I can\'t describe my enjoyment waiting one week just to watch this series. It\'s kinda sad I couldn\'t see Yohane any more now.Overall, this series was my great pleasure. They are embodied that title ""Sunshine"", they are bright like a sunshine and keep thier enjoying life.', 'Love Live Sunshine is the second installment of the very popular Love Live franchise. There were people when this anime was announced were unhappy this even existed and couldn\'t come to grasp that Muse was officially over. The anime has officially wrapped up so the question is, does it live up the expectations set by its predecessor?MINOR SPOILER WARNINGStory: 8One of the bigger complaints when this anime was first announced and what was shown in the first few episodes is the copy/paste of the plot from the original Love Live. Such moments include the student council president forbidding a school idol club, a girl...who\'s good at the piano but initially refuses to be a part of the idol group, the ""Start Dash"" moment of the first performance, etc. The main ideas of those plot points are in there but are executed differently. For example, Dia\'s reason for not allowing a school idol club makes sense (although selfish) instead of Eli\'s reasoning of trying to save the school her way and not something as silly as a school idol club.In all honesty, I think the story was one of the better parts as they handled the plot portion better and there didn\'t feel as if there was forced drama. Now let me explain. In the original Love Live, most of the story was just forming the group, practicing, having some cute moments and preparing for Love Live. Somewhere down the line Sunrise figured they needed to add in a drama part so the last 3-4 episodes involved Kotori\'s decision on going to Los Angeles for fashion. In Sunshine, the drama involved the past of Kanon, Dia, and Mari and why Kanon/Dia were against school idols which was a sub plot up until episode 9 when the full group is formed. Other characters had their drama moments but this was the ""big"" one of the season which I liked.Overall, I felt that even with the plot points of the original present, the full plot was executed better.Art: 10The CGI looks lots better here. The 2D art makes the girls look really cute and the CGI makes them look really pretty (the performances are probably one of the high points of this show). The scenery and other characters look really well drawn and a pleasant treat for the eyes. Probably one of the best parts of this show for me.Sound: 8Now one of the big things about an anime about music is...having good music. The music here is good but it lacks the ""wow"" factor of the original (granted the original Love Live existed for 3 years prior to the anime so they had a selection of music available) but none of the music in Sunshine compared to listening to Bokura wa Ima no Naka de or No Brand Girls for me. Having said that, Young Dreamer is probably my favorite song from Sunshine. Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (the ED sang by various combonations of Aqours) is pretty good too.Character: 8The best parts of the Love Live franchise are the music and characters. I feel that, compared to the original, the characters here are worse (I do not like Kanon at all) but they\'re still enjoyable overall. They kind of fill the cliche\'s from the original (leader, loyal best friend, girl who thinks she doesn\'t fit as a school idol, shy girl) but how they act and interact with each other is enjoyable. Just like the original, you will probably find a character you really enjoy and take part in the waifu wars for Sunshine.Enjoyment 8:This was the one anime I was looking forward to this season so when the weekend came I was ready to watch Sunshine. I liked the anime and enjoyed watching the ups and downs the characters faced in the show and the adventure they went on to become school idols.Overall 8:Sunshine\'s story is better executed and the art looks better than the original but the music and characters are less enjoyable than the original. Having said that, the girls of Aqours are a good replacement to Muse and can only expect good things in the future from them.

Not only do they heavily reference SIP in sunshine, but they also purposely make thematic differences that only really are meaningful if you know what happened in the first one. This is shown literally in the first episode, as the plot for sunshine kinda just starts with Takami Chika deciding that her life is simply too boring and that she\'s too normal to which she refers...to herself as a normal kaiju. Chika ends up stumbling upon an ad on a building for love live (the in universe idol competition) and the winners of the last one which was the main cast of SIP μ\'s. Chika instantly falls in love with μ\'s and their music and decides that\'s how she\'ll stop herself from being boring and ultimately how she\'ll keep busy, she\'ll just be a school idol.Easier said than done, as she can\'t just do it by herself, so she asks her best friend Watanabe You to help her with starting her very own school idol club at Uranohoshi Girls High School. The next few episodes are spent introducing the individual characters such as Sakurauchi Riko, Kurosawa Ruby, Kunukida Hanamaru, and Tsushima Yoshiko- Yohane who each get an episode to explain who they are and how they end up joining the club/ at the time unnamed idol group. They reuse the same plot point from SIP where the school idol president, Kurosawa Dia, doesn\'t approve of them being idols, especially since her own little sister Ruby would be taking part in this. This time though, rather than with how Ayase Eli simply just thought they weren\'t very good and shouldn\'t be idols, Dia has, in my opinion, a better reason. Dia also thinks that Chika is being a little too confident in their abilities, but this stems from the fact that Dia, along with the last two girls Ohara Mari and Matsuura Kanan, who by this point have made their appearance here, and two years prior to the events of sunshine also tried being school idols and ultimately failed at it.It was discovered that Uranohoshi has had a very large decline in applicants and is now facing closure if they don\'t get enough new students. This is mainly due to the fact that they live in a small coastal town called Uchiura. Chika, who has been idolizing muse this entire time, sees this as a chance or almost an omen, she has to do what muse did and save her school from closing just like μ\'s did. This leads to Chika and the other 5 members of what\'s at this point now named Aquors travel to tokyo to try their hand at the Love Live qualifiers, where they meet what is the rival group of this series, Saint Snow, which is just composed of two sisters, Kazuno Sarah and Kazuno Leah. Excited to follow in μ\'s footsteps, they get the results of how many people voted for them in this qualifier only to discover that they got dead last with not a single person voting for them: 0.Why haven\'t the 3rd years joined them yet? To dive deeper into this, we get what I think is a really nice explanation to why Dia was so opposed to any school idols at the start. Dia, Mari, and Kanan, who were the original Aquors, tried being idols for fun but this ended after Mari hurt herself, causing Kanan to quit as she didn\'t want to see her friend get hurt any further. Mari was studying overseas for two years before the events of sunshine; she didn\'t do this on her own accord, however, she did this entirely because Kanan encouraged her to not lose a good opportunity. We learn that Mari didn\'t want this and felt that she missed out on something more important which was to spend time with her two best friends. We get a decently drama-filled episode where Mari and Kanan finally come clean to each other after all this time and learn that they both care about each other more than they initially thought. This strengthens the friendship a lot between the 3rd years and eventually causes them to join Aquours and complete the 9 member group with the shared goal of winning Love Live and saving the small school in their small town that they all love so much.With Aquors complete and a goal in mind, the girls start preparing for the Love Live preliminaries. We get a few episodes of this, but an important thing is that Chika decides that they shouldn\'t try to be like μ\'s, nor should they be trying to follow in their footsteps. Chika realizes that what made μ\'s so special wasn\'t that they won or they were the best; what made them special is that they were able to make something out of nothing. Essentially, μ\'s made a miracle happen. Chika decides she wants to ""find her own shine"" and that they shouldn\'t aim so high with their ambitions and that simply getting more than 0 votes at the preliminaries is a step forward. If it has to end, she at least wants one vote. As a group, Aquors main goal has become to just turn 0 to 1.Aquors performs at the Love Live preliminaries, prefacing their song to the audience with their story and how they came here. They leave the prelims with their only hope being that they surpassed 0, that they shined even a little and they did. 0 was turned to 1, and they now feel as if there\'s a light at the end of the tunnel; it\'s not impossible, if they work towards it enough, if they try hard enough, if they put in enough effort, they\'ll turn 1 to 10 and 10 to 100. They might even find they\'re own shine which makes them special and hopefully win Love Live and prevent the closure of their school.In season 1, we\'re told that the school is facing consolidation, and in season 2 they start going deeper into this by presenting us with the information that if they don\'t get at least 100 new applicants Uranohoshi will close. The goal now is to win Love Live and hopefully with the publicity gained from it they\'ll get the applicants needed. The next few episodes mainly give the viewer more character screen time and interactions with each other with nothing too serious happening. I enjoyed these episodes a lot as they spend most of season 1 introducing the characters but not really fleshing them out, so now we get to see a little deeper into their personalities along with watching them interact with each other in various funny scenarios.We then get to one of my favorite episodes being season 2 episode 6, which is the ""Miracle Wave"" episode. It starts with them wanting a new dance to try and progress further into Love Live, they find one that Kanan Mari and Dia tried but gave up on with it being too difficult for the center who was Kanan back then. Kanan is very against it and doesn\'t want to see Chika hurt herself so asks her to stop which of course Chika won’t. Chika decides she doesn\'t care how hard it is and feels if they want to win they need to give it their all, so she decides to dedicate herself to learning it. Progressively getting more and more injured, she doesn\'t care, she keeps pushing herself until all the way at the end of the episode she sticks the landing on the move and they perform with this routine in the competition. A nice attention to detail that I liked was after Chika lands the move on stage, they show tears of joy come out of Kanan\'s eyes. Through sheer hard work, Chika learns the move and they make a miracle happen hence ""Miracle Wave""Mari\'s dad calls and informs them that the deadline for applicants is approaching. That isn\'t fair, the Love Live finals haven\'t even happened, they didn\'t get the chance to attract as many people as possible. They stay up all night on the last night before the deadline, slowly watching the counter go up until times up. 98. They got 98 out of the 100 needed, and with that Uranohoshi Girls High School is set to close. They don\'t take this lightly and it\'s honestly a tragedy to them. They\'re heartbroken for the rest of the episode, and Chika contemplates giving up until the rest of the school encourages them to keep competing. The girls come to this decision that they will keep competing and they\'ll try extra hard to win, because while they can\'t save their school literally, they can mark the school’s name in history as a Love Live winner. This ties in nicely with what I said about Chika choosing to find a silver lining or a light at the end of the tunnel instead of just giving up or being pessimistic about the things life hands her.We get to see more Saint Snow which I like. In my opinion they\'re the best rival group so far in Love Live. Aquors travels to Hokkaido to watch them perform at their regional that they lose due to Leah falling during their performance which is followed by two episodes that flesh out Sarah and Leah a bit and makes them pretty likable to me. We also get to see some welcome character development out of Ruby. Ruby and Leah bond over their similarities about being shy and their overdependence on their older sisters, and we get a nice little arc with the 4 first years that ends with a song as per Love Live standard.From this point on is the beginning of the end where it starts with the girls spending time with each other since the third years will all be leaving after they graduate. They follow this with a nice episode where they have a school festival as kind of a goodbye send off to the school. The whole episode is upbeat and fun until the end where the whole student body basically accepts that it\'s over for the school.The girls perform Water Blue New World (a song I really like) and win Love Live with it. They did it, they achieved their goal. Except they didn\'t, they didn\'t really feel like they won, they didn\'t save their school, which is what they really wanted to do. We get one of my favorite scenes in the show which is where it fast forwards a few months later after the school is closed and the 3rd years are graduated and gone. Chika revisits the school and we see that everything that they left as a goodbye is gone and cleaned up. Chika visits all of the places they frequented a lot in the school and gets rushed with memories about all of them. Finally, she reaches the roof and, after promising to keep her head up, breaks down and finally cries (as did I). She hears some voices call out and follows the sound to the gym where everyone including the third years are. They sing wonderful stories which is a wonderful song that recaps the whole show, and, after all of this time, Chika discovered that the shine she was trying to find was every second she spent with her friends working towards their goal.So I talk a lot about Chika in this review. This is partly because she\'s the main character and partly because I feel she\'s a very good character. The big thing I took away from her character is that she tries to be positive in every situation thrown to her, as well as digging as far as she has to find the light at the end of the tunnel and if there isn\'t one waiting then she makes one. This being a huge thing when it comes to them winning Love Live yet still having their school close. It\'s not that nothing bad happens to her, but because of her outlook on things: instead of life being unfair and you having to accept that, you can instead not accept that and spin it to a positive light.Now this show is absolutely not for everyone, honestly if someone watches SIP and wasn\'t that into it, this won\'t be any better.I love all 9 main characters in this show, however, I can admit that the cast is a little too large and doesn\'t really have the run time to fully develop them all, so some of them really get like an episode or two of screen time away from the whole group.On a more positive note though I absolutely love the soundtrack in this show, whether it be just  the background music or the actual insert songs they’re all great. I especially love the second opening “Mirai wo Bokura wa Shitteru yo” and the lyrics of it well reflect the second season of the anime.Overall I really fell in love with ""Love Love Sunshine!!"", and it is one of my favorite anime at the time of writing this. to herself as a normal kaiju.

Sunshine took a very large inspiration from the first Love Live! cast. I could probably write the characters they're most similar with :Chika = HonokaYou = KotoriRiko = MakiRuby = HanayoHanamaru = RinYoshiko = NicoDia = EliKanan = Umi...Mari = NozomiThe characters seemed very forced to be like the first Love Live! cast which was very unfortunate because there is a lot of ideas of the girls to become unique from the first Love Live! cast.The story was deffo a Love Live! part 2. Because both of the main plots are about their school closing down due to low student count except this one is more forced. It also doesn't make sense how a character in the series (Riko) was introduced and how she was able to get into the school.Compared to the first Love Live! series, the animation here improved, but it looks weird one and then with the CG.The music of Love Live! Sunshine was a lot better than the first series. It is a more diverse music concept and the music quality is better.In m opinion, the anime is alright. The first Love Live! series was a lot better though. It's just like Mean Girls, the original is a lot better than the second one. except Love Live! Sunshine is quite an okay series Mari = NozomiThe characters seemed very forced to be like the first Love Live! cast which was very unfortunate because there is a lot of ideas of the girls to become unique from the first Love Live! cast.The story was deffo a Love Live! part 2.

It\'s one of those lighthearted animes that you can re-watch over and over again, and sound like a total weeb retard by singing all of...their songs.The new group, Aqours started out a bit shaky at the start and it seems like the general consensus for this anime was that it was simply a rehash of the original series. However, I want to try and change that perspective.Story: 7Story isn\'t really the main focus of this series, so if you\'re looking for something deep, insightful, and heart clenching, you probably won\'t find it here. The story starts off similar to the original series, people coming together to form an idol group. However, it\'s meant to be a story of new beginnings. Unlike μ\'s, Aqours has to start off against a much harder, and competitive Japan for school idols. School idol popularity has spread all throughout the nation of Japan, and Aqours is starting out at 4999th place.Aqours is constantly trying to follow in μ\'s footsteps in order to save their school.This is the part where most people closed their internet browser and went on to drop the anime, and I can see why. However, for me, I kinda like that sort of thing. It\'s applicable to everyday life. When you look up to someone, because they\'re so amazing, you want to try to understand how they got to that point, so you follow them endlessly. It seems more realistic of a plot for me compared to μ\'s just straight up stomping every other idol without any actual   competition. I mean... even Arise said ""This Love Live will be determined in the prelims.""The drama was also a bit shaky and awkward, while the humor was mostly meme spam... but at least they were good memes.....!!!!!! Kappazura PRETTY BOMBER HEAAADD SHIINNYYYY YOSOROO DAATEENSHII fafbvcArt:10The art is nothing short from amazing. (Of course, it was drawn by Sunrise, they can draw ****ing Gundams and crap) But the main improvement here is of course... THE 3DCG DANCING. Honestly, the 3D parts of the original Love Live made me want to gouge my eyes out, and it\'s really nice to see that they\'ve improved so much on Sunshine. Uchiura looks pretty nice for a setting out in the boonies. The sea looks amazing, and the 2nd and 3rd insert song\'s art gave me an eyegasm from the amount of sparkling lights there were.Sound:9Honestly, I would give it a 10/10, but I know there\'ll be people tossing Start Dash into my face if I do. I honestly really love all of the insert songs, especially Daisuki Dattara Daijobou. Which is the Aqours equivalence of Start Dash... After listening to Start Dash about 2000 times on loop everyday, the song gets tiring. Aqours provided me with brand new songs, that are all pretty catchy. All of them just... eventually grow on you, you learn to love them... (Not to mention Daydream Warrior, because it wasn\'t in the anime, but still made me like Aqours more.)Characters:10The Love Live series is completely centered around their characters, and Sunshine definitely didn\'t skimp on the memes.... I\'ll boil down each character to how I see them.Chika: The generic af leader type girl. I don\'t think you can really avoid a character like this, she\'s kind of a necessary evil. Though to be honest, I liked her more than Honoka due to the faces she makes being hilarious (Sometimes annoying af when I see her "":D""ing my ass when I get 1 SR from a 10+1 pull)You: She seems to be the favorite of the Aqours bunch, for good reason. She has the memes, she looks pretty cool, and her drama subplot was honestly relatable for me. You\'re childhood friends with someone, but here comes all these other people that seem to easily drag your friend away from you. You feel kind of... betrayed, but it\'s something you\'d never bring up anyways... Also You is kinda gay.Riko: She\'s the Maki + Umi of the group. She\'s great at playing the piano and feels like she\'s just a plain girl, which is true. Her redeemable factor is that... she\'s gay.Hanamaru: The meme machine. ZURAAAAAA.... I like the way she looks, and how she\'s not Rin. Because I hate Rin. She also has some pretty hilarious scenes... that\'s it.Ruby: The slightly worse meme machine. She\'s the far superior Hanayo of the group. Also she\'s the small little demon, and I\'m going to dote on her.Yoshiko: She\'s the slightly autistic fallen angel. She\'s funny to watch, and she knows when to show how much she cares about her friends... (Episode 11 redeemed her a lot honestly) So she\'s kind of a... fake autist??Kanan: She\'s super athletic and edgy to start off with. She also has a meme of popping off her boobs in a diving suit... so yeah. Her drama subplot with Dia and Mari was pretty nice because it finally showed how she\'s not actually an edgy b****, but rather, a caring friend. She also likes to hug people.Mari: Okay, honestly I\'m not going to be able to convince people who\'ve seen her to feel any different. If you hated her, you\'re going to hate her forever, and if you liked her, you\'ll like her forever. So instead of listing any actual information on her, I\'m just going to spam her memes. (If I forget one, I\'m genuinely sorry...) NIII NEN BURRY DESUKA, SHIINNNYY, ITS JOOKE, PRETTY BOMBER HEAAAD, IM HUNGRRY, OH MY GOD... OH MY GOD.... OHHH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.Dia: I kinda had a feeling that she\'d turn out to be a kind of... Eli clone. Except... not really. The difference for her is, Dia planned out basically all of the events from episodes 1 to 8. She also gave Chika and co. their group name. Initially, I didn\'t really like her, but after I saw how well she straight up played them... god.TLDR; lul i totally had legit reasons to liek them 100% no Kappa hehe ""xddd"" this is gud review ty for reeading lulEnjoyment:10I can\'t stress how much I love this series. It\'s really easy to re-watch this over and over again. Their constant comparison to μ\'s is most likely a setup for season two. (And guess what, Season 2 has been announced today..) I can\'t help, but root for Aqours at this point. They actually have some adversary and difficulties to go up against, unlike μ\'s. Even their rival group is garbage compared to the top level idols at this point.Overall, I give this series a 9. It has some really funny scenes, amazing art, fantastic songs, and danker memes.

(and some actual issues compared to μ\'s just roflstomping the competition..)', ""Update: I initially wrote my review after having watched the first 6 episodes. In the time since then, I went and finished the anime. While I do think I was perhaps a bit too harsh at the time, I stand by the issues I complained about. The first 6 episodes of this are rough due to being a blatant copy of many story beats and character traits from the original series. There is significant improvement after the first 6 episodes, and that quality is maintained for the rest of the series, but the first half of this season does hurt it significantly.------------------------This review includes spoilers...up to episode 6, as well as various parts of the original Love Live series.After watching and thoroughly enjoying both seasons and the movie of the original Love Live series, I was excited to start Sunshine and experience a new setting, characters, and story. Unfortunately, after 6 episodes, it has become very clear that there is nothing new to be experienced here.First of all, the characters. They have different names and faces, but make no mistake - they are clones of the girls from the first series. Chika is Honoka, You is Kotori, Riko is Umi, Ruby is Hanayo, Hanamaru is Rin, Yoshiko is Nico, Dia is Eli, and Mari is Nozomi. The only one I can't comment on would be whether Kanan is a Maki clone. She hasn't been shown in much detail up to this point, so it's hard to say. I would be very surprised if she ended up NOT being a clone, though. I could go into detail about how each of these characters end up being a clone of another, but I think if you watch even one episode it will become very clear that this is the case.Next, the plot. Guess what, it's just copied and pasted from the original series yet again, only done worse. The series starts out with no actual motivation for the girls to become school idols - they just want to. That's weak and uninteresting, but in episode 6 it's revealed that the school is set to be closed due to lack of interest from students. Hey, at least they addressed the lack of motivation for the girls, but they did so by literally reusing the same plot as before!Another thing that really rubbed me the wrong way in the plot was the girls' first concert. If you remember μ's first concert, the curtain opened to reveal that no one showed up. It was a powerful scene that served the purpose of telling the girls that their goal wouldn't be easy to achieve, and they wouldn't be instantly successful. In fact, this scene is probably my favorite scene in the entire Love Live anime. Sunshine attempts to copy this scene, but it messes it up to an incredible extent. Instead of leaving it at no one showing up and using that to show the girls that it will be hard, it turns out everyone is just late to the concert! It sets a precedent that the girls cannot and will never fail, unlike μ's who actually DID fail on multiple occasions and grew from it. If you're going to copy a scene, at least do it right instead of completely undermining the entire purpose of the scene.I know some people might be upset because I only watched 6 episodes, but it became very clear to me in those 6 episodes that I was in store for nothing more than a clone of the original series with much worse execution. up to episode 6, as well as various parts of the original Love Live series.After watching and thoroughly enjoying both seasons and the movie of the original Love Live series, I was excited to start Sunshine and experience a new setting, characters, and story.

I missed the friendly bond among the characters, the simple yet endearing story, the colorful and likable cast, and the unforgettable music. Like the original Love Live, Love Live Sunshine has all that. This anime is nostalgia to me, especially the fact that they looked up to Muse, cementing them as legends not only in the Love Live universe but also in my heart.Story (6/10) :Admittedly, Love Live Sunshine (LLS) is very similar to Love Live School Idol Project (LLSIP)...in a lot of ways. The characters are based off of Muse; the story regarding the school as well, the traits and personalities, and a little bit of the looks too. I understand why people may dislike it, why they may want something new. Some would say that if it had an original story it would\'ve been better. I agree to a certain extent but I believe that what we have in Sunshine is just fine.I also believe Sunshine made use of that foundation better than School Idol Project did-for the most part, at least. I do not dislike the fact that the overall story is similar to SIP. Simply because it is nostalgia to me, and the fact that these girls also looked up to Muse is all the more reason to compliment what is being done in terms of pattern story (if that makes sense). Now it may not seem fair to do that since it is very similar to SIP\'s original story, but it was clear that they were also going in this direction and I think they did it better.The one thing that confuses me though is the ending. Did Aqours win Love Live? I don\'t really know lol.Animation (9/10) :The animation is quite spectacular. It is bright, lively and colorful. The background designs are beautiful and it really feels like you\'re living near the sea. I felt some Nagi no Asukara vibes too. The character designs are pretty and adorable, but nothing new. These girls were inspired by LL SIP so they look alike to a certain degree. The ""antagonist"" of the show (Saint Snow) look interesting. The dark eye colors give off the ""antagonist"" vibe, unlike A-RISE (SIP). The CGI is also significantly better. To sum it up, if there is one word to describe the animation here, it would be ""Sunshine"".Music (9/10) :The songs are good, but not better than SIP\'s. Not all of the songs resonated in me. Don\'t get me wrong, I still loved all of them but nothing really impacted me. The only ones that I really enjoyed are Aozora Jumping Heart, Yume de Yozora o Terashita and Mijuku Dreamer. My favorite Love Live song to date is still START: DASH!! It was fun to hear Yume no Tobira as well.As for the voice acting, obviously very well done. The thing with Aqours though is that their individual voices are hard to differentiate. Yes, you can probably tell who is singing a certain part of a song individually (during a solo part), and yes they sound more ""one"" (more harmonious even) when they sing as a group, more so than Muse, but it is hard to tell which voice is which during the those group moments. Muse had powerful and distinguishable voices in both solo and group song parts. This is why I belive that Muse is better than Aqours.Characters (8/10):As for Aquors, they were all lovable. It was very easy to like them all in just a few eps. While some characters only got little screen-time (Kanan) or had lesser time as the show progressed (Ruby, You), I still feel like this isn\'t the show\'s fault necessartily because its only 13 eps. The most impressive thing for me is that they were able to give them some story in just 1 season. SIP didn\'t manage to do that as Nozomi and Eli had little time in S1 (compared to the others), Kotori\'s departure scene was forced, and Umi had not much of a story for herself at all. When you compare it to Sunshine, then Sunshine \'shines\' more: Riko\'s intro and story was well-executed, the \'story-book recruitment\' story of Ruby and Hanamura-zura was entertaining, the occultic episode with \'Yohane\', the struggles of You, the struggles of Chika and most especially the senpai-arc of Mari, Dia and Kanan-which I believe is the best story arc in any of Love Live. It just had a better story imo. Saint Snow is the weak character link that I don\'t like though. They didn\'t feel like a rival, unlike with A-RISE. Maybe its just me. One last small thing, we actually know some other characters here outside of Aqours that provide support to the main cast (relatives, classmates,etc). We didn\'t get much of that in SIP.Here\'s my list of most fave to least fave: Riko, Dia, Mari, Hanamaru, Yoshiko, Ruby, Chika, Kanan, You. This was actually kinda hard because I don\'t have a clear-cut fave unlike with Maki in SIP. Either way, I didn\'t really dislike any of them and as usual only the MC got kinda annnoying.Enjoyment (10/10):I had a blast. Like I said earlier, this anime was pure nostalgia. It brought back the happy moments and feels that I had with Love Live SIP. It\'s everything that I wanted and more.Overall (8.4/10):In terms of animation and story- Sunshine was better. Everything else, SIP is. I guess it\'s not fair because its not an original story but I still feel like it was done better. As of this moment, I feel like Love Live Sunshine is better than Love Live School Idol Project SEASON 1. BUT! I still believe that Muse > Aquors by a mile. That\'s it for Sunshine! Would definitely listen to their music and watch more should there be an S2 and a movie! Keep shining, Aqours!To those who read this review, thank you very much.This is my second one, and I hope it was at least remotely helpful.If you have yet to see this anime, then I highly recommend it. Although it would be better if you watched Love Live! School Idol Project! first. There won\'t be a problem if you want to watch this first though, and that may even make for a unique viewing experience.If you have finished this anime and maybe trying to find an anime similar to this I recommend K-on! and Idolmaster. I haven\'t really watched any idol shows outside of the Love Live franchise but these two have been heavily requested to me.Have a good day! :D in a lot of ways.

Sunshine is a spin-off of the μ\'sLove LIVE! , its a story of a group of girls who wants to be an idol and fulfill their dreams. It was fun to watched this anime, if you love listening to some idols kinda musics  like ""JPO"" then i hardly recommend this, same goes with love live.Characters are quite the same with  μ\'sLove LIVE! their personality are also the same , like the  μ\'s. the energetic Chika. and the leader of  μ\'sLove LIVE.The plot of the story is somewhat the same as well. its like a ""copy-cat"" of...Love LIVE! and how they build up their group. it could have been more interesting if the personality of each character was different, like their styles and how they react. cause it seems like its just copying the first Love Live..voice actors were good as well, not bad for a newbies. and its good to know that their ages are almost the same.total rate: 7/10.

I was kinda disappointed because I thought there will be a cameo of muse somehow it was the school only being exposed.Well anime is great and enjoyable, if youre a fan of Love Live you should really watch this just like what I did, I recommend this...for everyone.. for everyone..', 'Love Live Sunshine! has ALOT to live up to from the original Love Live, can these new characters be the ""new shiny *cough*"" characters to fill our Love Live cravings...well let\'s get right into it by talking first about...The characters, at best, well LA will pullout LA\'s notes for this one. BULLETPOINTS TIME!..ohh and some SPOILERS here and there you have been warned*Chika Takami (voiced by Anju Inami), appearance-wise looks like Rin Hoshizora, has Honoka Kousaka\'s genkiness and is the character to start it all which also has shades of Honoka.*You Watanabe (voiced by Shuka Saitou), appearance-wise looks like a short-bobbed Kotori Minami and is...also friends with the main character and wants to get the idol activities started. You parallels Kotori even further as she along with Ruby are costume designers in Aqours as Kotori did in the original. Come her character development episode, she became LA\'s second favourite character.*Riko Sakurauchi (voiced by Rikako Aida), appearance-wise is a more longer haired Maki Nishikino and on speaking of Maki, Riko is ALSO a piano player, though Riko\'s position to Chika is more for Umi Sonoda who does the lyrics for every song, as such Riko is one of the lyricist for Aqours.*Kanan Matsuura (voiced by Nanaka Suwa), appearance-wise looks like a ponytailed Nozomi Tojo and with that Kanan pretty much embodies Nozomi for the most part (though groping is omitted), her athleticism is also from Rin.*Dia Kurosawa (voiced by Arisa Komiya) appearance-wise looks a bit like Umi Sonoda, however her personality is completely different with an amalgamation of Eli Ayase (for being the student council president) as well as Nico Yazawa\'s prideful attitude and Hanayo Koizumi\'s obsession with idols (though Dia is closeted, her idol obsession, not her prideful attitude). Dia parallels Eli in terms of personality and role as the biggest resistance in forming Aqours, her parallel personality to Eli is even lampshaded at one point.*Ruby Kurosawa (voiced by Ai Furihata), appearance-wise she\'s a red-headed vers. of Nico Yazawa but has Hanayo Koizumi\'s shyness, though her work for needlework pretty much makes her the costume designer for Aqours thus has shades of Kotori Minami, but her personality parallels Hanayo ALOT and is even lampshaded in the series.*Mari Ohara (voiced by Aina Suzuki) appearance-wise looks like a short-bobbed Eli Ayase (or to be precise a near exact Arisa Ayase, Eli\'s younger sister with a braid) and Mari even has the mixed descent (Eli being of Russian and Japanese, while Mari of Italian and  Japanese), let\'s also add in the shades for Eli Ayase as she\'s has a higher position than Dia (thus giving Mari and Eli the highest position in the student body), lastly she has Nozomi\'s groping tendencies as well as her personality, she\'s also the composer of Aqours thus she has shades of Maki.*Yoshiko Tsushima (voiced by Aika Kobayashi), appearance-wise looks like Umi Sonoda, however her personality is VERY much like Nico Yazawa, though the only things unique about her is her chunni-personality and her extremely bad luck...Yoshiko is actually LA\'s favourite character from Aqours as besides Yoshiko ""YOHANE""\'s similarity toNico, she is probably the most unique character in Aqours\' roster.*Hanamaru Kunikida (voiced by Kanako Takatsuki)  appearance-wise looks like a longer-haired Hanayo Koizumi, however she has shades of Nozomi Tojo as her family runs a temple like Nozomi. Hanamaru is also the main lyricist of Aqours similar to Umi however Hanamaru\'s most defining trait of her shyness and self-confidence issues parallels Rin Hoshizora\'s character development (it\'s even lampshaded), Hanamaru\'s parallel to Rin goes deeper as her friendship with Ruby (the Hanayo counterpart), the two even joined Aqours similar to Rin and Hanayo. Finally Hanamaru has a verbal tic similar to Rin (just that Hanamaru uses a variety of Shizuoka verbal tics, while Rin just uses ""~nyan!"".)What LA is trying to say is, this new cast of characters feels like the original Love Live cast members personalities and subtle appearances split and mixed into each other and put into this new cast of Aqours and that really isn\'t a bad thing, it\'s liven things up actually. By that even if the character\'s have shades of the original cast, well guess what, their character and group dynamic were very solid very much like the original cast, the group dynamic helped with especially Chika, You and Riko have some of the best group dynamic together, from their banter to their actions together (aand the obvious yuri undertones throughout the Aquors cast). Outside from Aquors as a group, the individual characters themselves and their developments they personally grow from their own obstacles or griefs, thus as a group they are pretty solid, as individual characters they are of the same caliber as they\'re group.Sorry for constantly comparing Sunshine to the original but LA will point out that where the original formed the idol group to save the school, Sunshine on the other hand, Aqours is formed for their own personal growth. If there was something new that Sunshine!! took was the characters motivations, from a Love Live franchise point of view, it\'s refreshing. As for an idol genre point view, -sigh- iDOLM@STER already did it...Some of the flaws in this spinoff is that the it has the near same plot beats to the original (from their formation to their idol group to LA\'s comprehensive character look to their obstacles into forming Aqours), but Love Live Sunshine!! still has it\'s own flair to make it worthy to it\'s original even if it uses the same plot beats and somewhat rushed character developments to some of Aqours to the original. The biggest problem with Sunshine is that it places the original season up on a pedestal, thus ""worship and imitates it"", thus it can never surpass or be it\'s own thing, this is in-universe portrayed through Dia and her resistance to Aqours, thankfully Sunshine became it\'s own to it\'s ties to the original season with the homages being nothing but ""Love Live fanservice"" as it did start to focus more on in-characters failures and how they overcome that failure to see it as nothing but a stepping stone to success as well as using previous storyline plot points from the original but even making that their own, really Love Live Sunshine!! just needed a while before it could do it\'s own thing and stopped fawning over the original cast and thus Sunshine\'s ties and fangirling to the original cast do sever and becomes it\'s own and in a more meta-textual way is VERY different from the original series.Quite simply, it\'s HOW Sunshine focuses on a certain element in comparison to the original series, the original series was focused more on the ""group"" and ""their goals to save their school"", Sunshine\'s cast does differently by focusing on it\'s character\'s personal problems before facing their failures and the Love Live tournament and yes it\'s hypocritical that LA noted in LA\'s character section that Sunshine\'s cast have personalities and appearances melded together from the original cast, but it\'s because of the characters having their own struggles instead of the original\'s ""group goals"".LA still enjoyed Sunshine even with these flaws as Aqours\' in both individual and group dynamic still helped bring in it\'s bubbly vibe that the Love Live series is known for.The animation done by Sunrise as the original series did, well LA has nothing but praise LA can say about the animation, yes even from the integrated CGI dance scenes as it\'s even more smoothly animated with the traditional animation. The character designs are vibrant and poppy very typical of this franchise and it\'s even better as there a several background material the characters do while other characters are talking at times, on speaking of which, the backgrounding of the ocean in contrast to the originals cityscape, well that makes Sunshine have a better edge with this kind of scenery scenario. The animation overall was very well done across the board.In terms of voice acting, we have your typical bubbly moe vocals throughout but it becomes quite obvious who LA\'s voice actors were, Aika Kobayashi who voiced the eccentric chunni Yoshiko as LA clearly saw that Aika was having soo much fun voicing her and ""getting into character and keeping it up"", she was a barrel of genkiness and aloofness, the other was Shuka Saitou who voiced the ace You, her ""catchphrase and posing"" was memorable and Shuka like Aika embraced her role as You. It\'s not like these two voice actors were the ONLY best voice actors in this series, the rest of the cast were brilliant and needs praise, sure moe vocals but still.The ending was overall satisfying by all means and rounded up the anime quite nicely. By the end of this ending, Sunshine became it\'s own. Though the ""cliff notes of the entire anime"" as the characters performances were slightly tacky but heartwarming at the same time. The ending was a nice send off to Sunshine and LA actually hopes for a second season as Sunshine has potential to do something entirely different from the original series.Love Live Sunshine!! had a rather similar start to the original series\' plot beats and the obvious similarities to the original characters, but with this rocky start, Sunshine finally opened up into being it\'s own and quite frankly be different from it\'s original counterpart, is Sunshine better  or worse than the original series?...well it\'s up to how you see the Sunshine, LA on the other hand, LA was annoyed by the over-exaggerated homages to the original but still liking Sunshine paying homage to it\'s original predecessors, but by the halfway mark is when Sunshine really turned into something different instead of being overshadowing and fangirling to it\'s original and LA is truly thankful for making these new characters though similar in appearance and personality to the original cast, be different both in terms of characters AND plot. Sunshine for LA because of this...isn\'t better than the original, but can rival it by being different AND still paying homage to it\'s original. also friends with the main character and wants to get the idol activities started.

Further more...the story itself is told more consistently and doesn't rely much on filler content. the story itself is told more consistently and doesn't rely much on filler content."", ""Basically just a slightly worse carbon copy of school idol project. Honestly not worth watching if you've seen school idol project, but as a stand-alone it isn't bad. It definitely made me realize I don't really want to watch any more shows in this universe, even though I liked school idol project a lot. The characters are extremely similar to School Idol project, and some of them even have the same one-note personality traits. If this one had a different premise or number of girls or personality of those said girls, I would have given this a higher score. In the end, however, its nothing...more than a worse version of the original. more than a worse version of the original."", 'Love Live! Sunshine!Art/Characters: The interesting thing about this new season of Love Live! is how similar things are. While the art is almost identical, there is a more modern feel to it and the character designs at least feel somewhat original. Unfortunately, It is just a little too similar when it comes to the characters together. For a lot of the first few episodes, I had trouble keeping up with which character was which, and I wouldn’t say that it an uncommon issue. But aside from that things were fluid and fun to watch. The other thing that I loved to see is what the...costumes and the dances that Aquorus would perform. Something interesting to note was that the frame rate picked up quite a bit and that was a little weird from time to time. The characters themselves were actually pretty much the same character concepts as Muse from the previous season. Primarily Chika, the lead, felt like just a carbon-copy of Honoka from the previous season. There were a few other characters that felt like this as well, but Ruby, the character I expected to be like Niko (this was actually Dia), was a very cute and shy character that I don’t quite remember seeing anyone like her in the other seasons of this show. The rest of the girls are pretty dull, but there is some good development and their chemistry together is a lot of fun to watch and play out; specifically near the end of the series when two characters grow in an unexpected way.Music/Sound: Being a show primarily focused on music, it could be inferred that the music was going to be good. A lot of the time, there was good and catchy songs that I am sure to play over and over again, now that the season has concluded. I have to say this; the songs from Aquorus are great, but the songs often sung by competitors are also fantastic,  and it shows that the songs were really a focal point for the show, much more than the story (but we can get to that in a minute). The sound here was also pretty well done. Being able to hear the waves of the ocean and the wind blowing through the hair of the girls gave the world life. There was sound that we hear all the time in our daily lives. The idle chatter of people in a busy restaurant and the crash of someone falling on top of other people; It made me laugh at things I hadn’t even seen yet; and I like that.Story: Have you seen “Love Live! School Idol Project!”? Well if you have, you’ve seen most of this show. Almost all of this shows story is taken from the previous setting. But for those who haven’t seen that or want to know the subtle differences, tune in. Chika, our main character, sees a billboard advertising Muse (the idol group from the previous setting) and the Love Live! Competition. Inspired by their story from normal to idols she gathers up some friends to try and form an idol group and be just like Muse! Unfortunately not everyone is as excited as she is when it comes to singing and dancing on the stage. But when the school is in danger of being closed due to under-enrollment, Chika must gather up her friends and inspire them to sing, dance through the pain of failure and rejection so they can save the school by winning Love Live (sound familiar?)!Personal Reflection: It sounds like I am giving this show a bad rep for taking a lot from the original show, but even after I say all that stuff about the story, I still get excited when I watch them because the characters are super lovable and so much fun to watch. Is it pretty much just a re-brand? Yeah, kinda, but it doesn’t make it any less fun to watch. Sometimes I felt like they tried to push a story where there really didn’t need to be one, and it falls flat before the 10 minute mark of an episode, and it just seems unnecessary. I was able to have fun with this show because I love the concept and I think they did a great job coming up with new songs. Is it the best show I’ve ever seen? No, but it certainly isn’t the worst. If you watched the original Love Live, you will probably enjoy this, as long as you don’t mind the story getting too repetitive.Overall Rating: 7/10 costumes and the dances that Aquorus would perform.

What I don\'t get is why it\'s shoved in your face 5 times every episode. Chika\'s thought process for everything she does related to the idol group is ""WWMD?"" (What would muse do) and it ruins the show. I wanted to see some original story line, but I couldn\'t really find it. The characters get more equal amounts of screentime/development, which makes it harder to determine a best girl, which is a huge plus for me. Overall, the sequel is always worse than the original holds true here. ', 'This was honestly one of the most painful anime -no, TV show experiences I\'ve ever had. Sunshine to me is just a much lazier copy of the first series, except with more forced emotional scenes.That\'s really my only problem with Sunshine: the story and the ""drama"". The animation? Great. The Characters? Pretty good. The music? Bangers. Sunshine had all the elements it needed to be great - but it wasted them.There was so much unnecessary drama. From episode 3 or so, it felt like somebody cried/sobbed/teared up at least once per episode. The third-year subplot is the worst offender here. All they did was...cry about the past and their friendship and chasing their dreams and blah blah blah. It worked in the first Love Live series because we got to know those characters first before it decided to get emotional. But, in Sunshine? I don\'t know jack about Mari. ""Haha funny anime girl speaks engrish and touches boobies"" is all I get from her. Dia at least gets more character time, so I can kind of feel bad for her. And then there\'s Kanan, who\'s just gone for most of the season. They really expected me to care about these girls when I hardly know them?On the topic of the characters: I like them all. Some are more boring/basic than others, but I like that they aren\'t (individually) exact copies of Muse, save maybe Chika. We see different personalities getting mixed with different tendencies and habits. I genuinely like Aqours as individual characters and as a school idol group. Their songs are great and their singing voices are overall a step above Muse, though nobody can ever beat Rin\'s or Honoka\'s voices in my opinion.But, my goodness, this show takes itself way too seriously. All it needed to do is relax on the emotions and ease up on drama. This might seem like a small nitpick, but, trust me, every single episode is filled with it. Sunshine is the first anime I\'ve seen since Fairy Tail that I refuse to continue after episode 13. It hurts me to give this anime a 4. I wanted to like Sunshine, but I just couldn\'t.If you\'re really THAT interested in the Love Live universe, fine, go watch this. Otherwise, you\'re better off not watching Sunshine. Chances are you\'ll probably find a 10-minute video on YouTube with all of the good moments anyways. cry about the past and their friendship and chasing their dreams and blah blah blah.

Love Live Sunshine.. the successor to Love Live... being a fan of the original, I have to admit I was pretty skeptical yet excited about this new project surrounding the Aqours girls. I have to say.. I was sort of disappointed..Story: 5/10Nothing special! The same old save the school plot.. And there was only one episode I loved, Episode 11. My most hated episode was Episode 13 and Episode 12. I somewhat managed to like all the other episodes.Art: 8/10Now I really LOVED Sunshine's art! I think it's even better than the original! The CG has improved a bit, not much. However I'm not...overly fond of Mari and Riko's design, ESPECIALLY Mari's.Sound: 10/10The music is awesome! It's on par with the original music, in my honest opinion~ there are some songs I didn't like, but overall it was awesome. The background music during emotional scenes was well done!Characters: 5/10I originally intended to give this a 4 but I realized that the girls are 9 but the total score is 10, so I thought it would be unfair so I ended up giving them an extra point. Yep, many may disagree. But I honestly don't care about Mari, Yohane, Maru, Kanan, Riko that much. They are all my worst girls. I love the other four girls though.My ranking? Would go like this:You > Dia > Chika = Ruby > Maru= Kanan >>> Yohane = Mari >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> RikoSorry Riko.Enjoyment: 9/10I always thought Muse was less comedy and more seriousness. However with Aqours I think the girls are more goofy and used for comedic purposes.Overall: 7/10I think it was a decent successor to the original. But this is all just my opinion~ overly fond of Mari and Riko's design, ESPECIALLY Mari's.Sound: 10/10The music is awesome! It's on par with the original music, in my honest opinion~ there are some songs I didn't like, but overall it was awesome. The background music during emotional scenes was well done!Characters: 5/10I originally intended to give this a 4 but I realized that the girls are 9 but the total score is 10, so I thought it would be unfair so I ended up giving them an extra point. Yep, many may disagree. But I honestly don't care about Mari, Yohane, Maru, Kanan, Riko that much. They are all my worst girls. I love the other four girls though.My ranking? Would go like this:You > Dia > Chika = Ruby > Maru= Kanan >>> Yohane = Mari >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> RikoSorry Riko.Enjoyment: 9/10I always thought Muse was less comedy and more seriousness. However with Aqours I think the girls are more goofy and used for comedic purposes.Overall: 7/10I think it was a decent successor to the original. But this is all just my opinion~"", '[DISCLAIMER: This review is written on the assumption that you\'ve already watched ""Love Live! School Idol Project"", ""Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season"" and ""Love Live! The School Idol Movie""]I was really let down by this one, I was expecting more from the continuation of Love Live.The story feels like a carbon copy. The events are almost the same, with a few tweaks here and there. All the events that occurred with μ\'s, somehow came back to happen again in Love Live Sunshine. This made it extremely boring to re-watch what had already happened. They could\'ve continued it with Honoka and Er\'s younger sisters....Maybe how they feel like they have to live up to μ\'s expectations or something like that.The art is an improvement from Love Live. The 3D animation was a world of a difference. I have to give credit where credit is due because the art went a step up and the style was (in my opinion) cuter.The songs were still good, and so were the voice actors but nothing out of the world.Along the same lines as to how the story felt almost the same as Love Live so did the characters. The girl who doesn\'t feel like she\'s cut out to be a school idol, the upbeat center protagonist that originally had the idea of school idols, the girl with prior knowledge of dance, etc etc. Once you\'re re-watching the same character with essentially only the design is different. Like, please get some creativity.I genuinely don\'t know how I got through the anime, for the sole reason that it was so similar to the original anime. I would recommend to not ruin your view on the anime and stop at the movie.

How could you make and entirely new show, based on the same premises with a different cast of characters? Unfortunately, these questions I asked myself after watching the original series, before watching sunshine, took awhile to answer.And that is because Love Live Sunshine has an extremely weak introduction. Right from the first episode, Sunshine doesn't leave much of an impression or...leave you wanting or craving for more. Chika's ideas and intentions were scattered, and you can tell that this is the kind of person she is. In what possible, non-forced, way could Chika develop in a way that compares to the predecessor's series' leader of μ's, Honoka? What trials would Chika face, like the ones that left Honoka devastated beyond her own imagination in her time as a School Idol? Chika's extreme obsession with μ's was also a huge block in the show that was difficult to ignore or get over. The case of a weak introduction is also the case for every time one of the new members of Aqours is introduced. Every time a new character was introduced, my initial impression was that these characters would react and develop linearly. Would Ruby always hold back and be shy? Will Hanamaru always be so reserved? Is Kanan ever going to drop her Tsun side? To my surprise, much like the original series, all these developments in the show progressed in a way that didn't feel like the plot stretched to achieve (other than arguably Yoshiko's, but I think it was okay), which was my biggest concern while watching Sunshine.As the series progressed, I came to think that the reason this show works is because it has a predecessor. If it makes sense, the problem with the show was actually the fact that they tried too much to be like μ's, but Chika comes to realize that, along with the rest of Aqours. To me, the fact that they realize this, and DEVELOP off of it was unexpected. With my initially weak impression of Sunshine, I didn't have high expectations for the rest of the episodes, but it is because of the fact that the show developed in such an unexpected way, that I felt like it made up for everything I didn't like about the beginning of the series.Continuing on the point that the second half of the series is exponentially better than the first half, the character balance in the show is very good. I felt at least, that none of the characters were underdeveloped for the amount of time the first season had. Dia probably probably had the least things happen to her character development-wise, but I'm hoping season 2 makes up for that. The show is funny at the right times, and when it wants to be serious, it can be very heart-warming. There is also a very real contrast between characters, like the scene in episode 11 where Mari told You that she should be honest with her feelings with Chika, because of her whole previous dilemma with Kanan. To me, the fact that a character LEARNED from her mistakes, and is able to tell her friend the same thing so she doesn't make the same mistake, to me, is a very well thought out and resonating scene. It makes the entire atmosphere of the show feel more realistic.That's what reality is. You make mistakes, and things don't always come as easy as you think. Just because you put your mind to it, just because you work hard, doesn't mean your results will come to show. Chika learns this the hard way during her first live in Tokyo. Through that, she gained experience, and the motivation to continue and try harder. The Zero to One metaphor is a metaphor that resonates with the plot of the show very well. This makes me come to believe that Chika's development with the cast of Aqours is actually extremely heartwarming, and well-thought out. Morally, this show has theme that I can very well agree with, and loved to see develop. That's why I ended up loving this show, despite some of the character linearity (GANBARUBI, ZURA, DATENSHI -COUGH COUGH) in the show.And Mari's broken English......... Well.... I'll let you be the judge of that one... leave you wanting or craving for more. Chika's ideas and intentions were scattered, and you can tell that this is the kind of person she is.

I'd also strongly advise against watching Sunshine if you haven't seen first LL yet.Chronologically, action of this story takes place some time after original one and there are many (too many) mentions of µ’s. It’s clearly aimed at people who already know franchise. This makes main and the most noticeable flaw in this anime even worse: for some reason someone thought it will be a good idea for whole story to follow same plot points as first Love Live. Maybe it was supposed to be some kind...of service towards fans, but turned into lazy copy-pasta. One could say that authors simply took skeleton of story and covered it with different girls. To make it funnier, LL story isn’t some masterpiece worth copying. It’s cheesy and predictable - fitting for this show, but also easy to replace with another thing of similar level. Now, if someone actually started with Sunshine, they wouldn’t be bothered by this part, but it’s pretty much a sequel, so that wouldn’t work either.Generally speaking, LL Sunshine is much stronger in SoL/CGDCT department than original. As much as I liked µ’s girls, Aqours feel more polished and fitting for anime. Girl’s quirks don’t feel forced or annoying, cast is balanced and, at least for me, there are no obvious best and worst girls.We also get a lot more (and funnier) comedy, great reaction faces and meme worthy moments.Sadly, nothing is perfect. What Sunshine gained in comedy and cuteness, it lost in drama and idol focus. While the problems that girls have to overcome aren’t what I’d call “forced drama”, they aren’t that good or deep either. Another thing this anime didn’t deliver is this feeling of overcoming odds and doing the impossible. Yes, they keep talking about making miracles and stuff, but it just doesn’t have the bang original had, it lacks the inspiring feeling I got when watching µ’s.When talking about Love Live, obvious topic to discuss is music. Let me say that, despite playing School Idol Festival mobage, I’m not really a fan of µ’s music. From Aqours songs I’ve heard so far, personally, I like them more. On the other hand, they are all just nice, while first LL had few of those “special” songs that were way above others. Obviously it's matter of preferences, but for me it feels like Aqours' music, despite generally sounding better, lack some kick.tl;dr: if you are here for idols, you might be disappointed compared to first LL anime. But if you also like cute girls SoLs, then you probably will like it. of service towards fans, but turned into lazy copy-pasta.

It is so far the only anime which has made me cry... multiple times. I was hoping for the same sort of experience with Sunshine, and I kid you not, actually abandoned the show halfway trough the first episode. I was already losing faith in the show at this point, but Mari’s first line was in such broken Japanese that I couldn’t bear it. It took me a few weeks to decide to give Sunshine another watch, only to again drop the show due to Mari, specifically...the infamous “It’s joke” scene. She defies explainantion! Her English is horrible and her Japanese isn’t that much better, bringing in the question as to how she communicates with other people. I finally rejoined the show again and made it through episode 12 when I realised I would never like the show and abandoned it.It’s taken me quite a while, but I realised why I instantly connected with Honoka in School Idol Project. After a pretty catchy prelude, episode 1 of School Idol Project literally begins with ‘Hi, I’m Honoka, oh no my school is going to be shut down, I have to do something!!!’ Her goal wasn’t fame or notability, it was to save the school that was so deeply engrained in her family. Not to mention that Honoka fails. She works her butt off to make Muse’s first little concert happen and nobody showed up to it except for core characters, which acted as the catalyst for their inevitable union.Contrast this with Sunshine’s opening. Chika is immediately met with the world of school idols and is entranced by it. She wants the fame, but doesn’t understand what actually drove Muse. Aqours’ first concert was also a raging success, which kind of took away from Dia’s words. When Eli criticised Honoka in SIP, it’s powerful because despite the horrible failure she just endured, Honoka proves she is not willing to give up. Dia criticises Chika in a very similar way, but the scene loses its significance when the crowd is packed.Another thing that greatly put me off Sunshine was the characters. If I’m honest, I could probably write down the character traits of Muse members on strips of paper, shuffle a few around a tiny bit, and end up with pretty accurate descriptions of Aqours members. Unfortunately, Sunshine also added extra character traits that just make the characters downright annoying. While I certainly liked some characters in School Idol Project better than others, I never once hated any of the characters. With Sunshine, I only liked 2 characters; Ruby because I like cuteness, and You because she really is a jack of all trades. However, I also have hatred towards 2 of the main characters; Mari and Yoshiko. Mari steals the ‘rich girl’ title from Maki, the desire to grope the other girls from Nozomi, and has the worst voice of all of Aqours. It is almost exactly like nails on a chalkboard, complete with sharp screeches. Yoshiko, on the other hand, suffers from chronic chuunibyou (8 grade syndrome) which leaves her believing she is a “fallen angel” named Yohane. In all honesty, I like chuunibyou as a concept and I actually fell victim to it when I was, fittingly, in 8th grade. Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions pulled the idea off incredibly. Yoshiko is just out of place and much more annoying to the point where I can’t stand her. The other characters are decent, but they none of the Aqours members hold a flame to Muse’s members.With the gorgeous animation and interesting small town setting, I’m disappointed that I could never get into Sunshine. I wanted more of the emotions that School Idol Project gave me and held Sunshine to that standard. In fact, I likely would have enjoyed this show if the writers never called back to Muse. If they separated the two, I would have as well. It’s because of all of the callbacks to Muse that I find myself comparing these two shows; one that repeatedly caused me to cry and another that was just too similar. the infamous “It’s joke” scene.

This alone is what brought me to the point of putting time into reviewing yet another Love Live! series and made me patient with its flaws as I enrolled into, at most, an alternative setting that does make a lot of remarks about the previous series and to be precise, from the character standpoint, μ's.From a subjective standpoint, there's a lot of things I could say about Love Live! Sunshine! (and the whole series in general but let's keep it at this since this is aimed at first season of Sunshine anyway) which are nice and...I could at least say that I am very emotionally engaged with it for the small amount of time I've been into it, since reviewing requires me to be as objective as possible, which I'll get to right now.However, as much as I love one series, I cannot avoid putting up a proper review for the sake of anime viewers and especially Love Live! fans who want to see more from the series just because of personal bias.If you've seen the first Love Live! then don't expect things to be completely different here, because they are not. One could say this is a re-run of the first series but with a different main cast & setting but, Sunshine has some points that make the series special & appealing on its own and it does have connections to the first Love Live! after all.The part that is, honestly, a shame is that Sunrise has managed to not only draw in the elements from the first season of the first series to Sunshine, but also the flaws. I truly did hope they've learned something from the brilliant second season of the first Love Live!, but that's not the case here. The plot-line here is almost the same, the pace is displeasing and there's, again, a whole lot of characters who don't give you a lot of reasons to like & care for them because they aren't & don't have the chance to be developed enough for a ~260 minute run, and 9 main characters are already be too much for one season if I do say so myself but, having the idea of how Sunrise works as much, most of this will be dispelled during the second season.I feel like the artstyle is much better this time, the CGI in particular. Not distracting compared to the first season and Sunrise really works their way around how the environment and characters look in a good & fitting way.What I like is how the first season of Sunshine is on-point with the level of drama going on. It isn't something more or different than what it really is even though the theme is basically the same and something that can be found in a lot of bitter-sweet series that don't have to be similar to Love Live!. Sunshine really hit the spot there.The character cast is rather interesting and by that I mostly mean Saint Snow, Aqours' rival group. Since you could say they are the counterpart to A-RISE in the first season, compared to them, Ria and Seira don't start out as the biggest idol group and are the performers or characters you'd expect them to be if you know what A-RISE is like. Though Aqours faces the same issue as in the first season of the first series, I find them to be quite lovable and special on their own subjectively. I do believe they should reach peak development in the second season.As expected, Sunshine continues to milk out outstanding idol music that's another reason to why I find Aqours to be special on their own. ''Snow Halation'' and ''Start:Dash'' have been quite the songs but I listen to a lot of Guilty Kiss (I have been doing so way before I got into LL actually) and as I go by more episodes, I can see Aqours clawing themselves in my playlist here and there.I find myself to be comparing the first Love Live! to Sunshine a lot but it's not like the series isn't doing so itself. It isn't disconnecting itself by any means and, as a matter of fact, the series pays homage to μ's often and, to be precise, from the character standpoint, Aqours.Overall, I can get the low scores for this series because of varying tastes of other people. This doesn't exactly appeal to every audience but if you're willing to give Love Live! a try, watch the first series + the movie and come back here. If you want to see more from the series then certainly watch this! If you can get past the recurring flaws, you're in for a good ride.

Am i  too absorbed by the older generation maybe but it doesnt hide the fact that this anime was good in its own way but lacking in some.That they created a new story in the same world as love live was great it was something i looked forward to watch and that the anime did well. They also brought forward what was great about the school idols through the different characters. So in that was enjoyable...enougSo i wrote that what did i feel was lacking and why did i not give it the review many thinks it deserves. Well to be honest the consept might be what to be expected of the anime but it still doesnt hide that they did almost the exact same thing as what came before it. The character might have been original in their own ways but thats about that. The pace of the story felt rushed and jumbled and at times it felt that there wouldnt be any progress with it. I did like the music to a certain regard but i didnt enjoy as i have had with other idol animes excluding the previous love live series. The songs felt ordinary and i just couldnt say that this was great. The only song i found myself liking was the one that their rivals created while the main characters songs sounded like normal idol songs with nothing special about them.What i advice the ones that read this is that they watch this with an open mind and also without thinking much about what came before since maybe that would help you like it alot more but even as an individual anime i wouldnt give it any better than what i gave it. Its easy on the eye its fun at times to watch but it feels too much as if i had seen it all before. It has its moments of good but it also has it downs which i wont gloss over and say that was nothing. enougSo i wrote that what did i feel was lacking and why did i not give it the review many thinks it deserves.

That\'s pretty much it with the story.Art: 6/10- There is a great progression from the one of muse. However, I still can\'t stand the CGI.

The story follows a group of girls who come together to form a school idol group in order to save their beloved school from shutting down. Not only is the storyline incredibly heartwarming, but the music is absolutely wonderful.The songs in Love Live Sunshine are truly a highlight of the show. Each one is beautifully composed and performed, and they perfectly capture the emotions of the characters and the themes of the show. From the upbeat and energetic ""Aozora Jumping...Heart"" to the emotional and poignant ""Mijuku Dreamer,"" every song is a joy to listen to and leaves me feeling uplifted.But Love Live Sunshine is more than just great music. The characters are all incredibly likable and relatable, and their struggles and triumphs feel genuine and heartfelt. Watching them come together as a team and work towards a common goal is both inspiring and heartwarming.Overall, Love Live Sunshine is a truly special anime that has brought me more happiness than I ever thought possible.

Sunrise knew how to market the girls of Muse through anime, and it shows. Muse is now one of the popular idol groups in Japan, at the same level of even AKB48.So now, why was Love Live! Sunshine!! so badly marketed? It seems as if Sunrise didn't know how to sell Aquors. The anime doesn't help either. It is almost a REQUIREMENT to watch the first 2 seasons of Love Live! to understand several references and jokes that the girls make in...the show. Girls are like carbon copies of Muse, with the exception of You. Sunrise didn't have a direction for this show, and it tried to pander to fans and ignore the masses. They have a great concept, and I wish they can do better if a 2nd season is green lit.Sunshine!! isn't really an anime to begin in the franchise. For fans, its an ok show with ok humor and rather great songs.

Sunshine!! struggled with its first season, at least mostly for the first half. The first half of this season is all over the place. It starts off promising enough but gets really confused with what it wants to be. It obviously wants to be a good successor to the original Love Live! So much so that they mention how great µ\'s is so many times you\'ll get sick of it after Episode 6. It\'s as if the writers thought that if they didn\'t keep bringing up µ\'s, it would alienate original fans and get them mad, but it really takes a toll on...the early episodes. Personally, I think all the µ\'s praise could\'ve been left in the first episode or two and slightly mentioned later. There are sometimes it actually helps the story to mention µ\'s like the hilarious intercom scene with Dia, but it mostly hampers the show. Great character moments are not only limited by all the ""µ\'s is so great"" speeches but by the plot which felt like it was sometimes just forced sometimes just to add tension where there wasn\'t any needed. I\'m talking about a specific plot they add a bit towards the mid of the 1st half (you\'ll know when you see it). It\'s lazily done and the show would\'ve been improved with less plot, which was the least fun part of the previous Love Live! too. The first half of the season isn\'t unwatchable thanks to the fun characters but it will turn a lot of people off and almost turned me off of the show if it weren\'t for the previously mentioned characters and music.What is fun about Love Live! is the characters and the music. And where Love Live! Sunshine!! completely fails at story (at least at first), it succeeds in making lovable characters you care for and really great and catchy musical numbers. The characters and the music really carried me through the first half. As for the second half, this is where things get better and the reason why I didn\'t give story a 1. It seems halfway through the show the writers remembered how to do pacing and after the really good Episode 7 and 8, Love Live! Sunshine!! slows down for once to give us more character-focused episodes and fun moments that let the members really shine and it\'s because of these moments that I was still able to enjoy the show a lot (Yohane is best girl).Anyway, in conclusion, Love Live! Sunshine!! starts out rough but if you stick through it, you\'ll find a really enjoyable show that gets better as it continues. Season 2 isn\'t finished yet but it has already surpassed my expectations and is turning out to be as good, if not better, than the original Love Live! Season 2 so I\'ll leave it to you but I\'d still recommend it to people who like slice of life, character-centric shows, with good music. the early episodes.

Love Live Sunshine wasn't anything great, but it was still enjoyable.The only downfall of this show would have to be the story. The story felt a bit too similar to the original.

It felt like Sunshine was just a cheap spin off of the original instead of being its own show.

The original had a conflict established in the very first episode and gave us much more time to get to know the characters, but while I was watching Sunshine I never really cared about the cast or felt like I knew them.During the original Love Live I was entertained throughout, but Love Live Sunshine just didn\'t appeal to me as much. A lot of the characters in Sunshine feel very gimmicky compared to the original series, especially Yohane. To be fair, there were a few characters in the original series that I...didn\'t grow to like until the second season, but even in the first season there were a lot of fun scenes that let me get to know and like the cast. Nico alone was entertaining enough to make the whole series worth it. There aren\'t really any characters that appeal to me as much in Sunshine.I mean, Mari can be pretty entertaining, but she barely even shows up for half the show and most of the time she\'s just filling the role of this show\'s Nozomi equivalent. Her fun moments are very sparse and short. Wooby and Zuramaru are qt, but not enough to keep me invested in the show. Sunshine was just tiring to sit through, because I didn\'t get enough time to get to know the characters before they became idols, there weren\'t enough fun character moments to keep me entertained, and there wasn\'t enough interesting conflict to keep me interested in their rise as idols.Aqours\' rise in popularity overall feels too sudden. It just doesn\'t feel as significant as in the original series. By the time Aqours has entered the preliminaries, we\'ve only seen them actually perform in the ""real world"" of the show twice, and in their first performance they were able to fill a whole gym, unlike μ\'s, who barely got anyone to come at all. Even though within the show we\'re told that things have gotten much more competitive since μ\'s competed, the fact that we don\'t really see the struggle as much makes Aqours\' rise in popularity seem much easier and less significant as an audience member.One thing I will say is very good about Sunshine is the art. Everything in this show is very pretty looking, with the exception of a few of the 3D dance shots, which were a bit jarring in the original as well. However, good visuals can\'t make up for lack of interest in the characters and conflict of a show, so I can\'t say that I enjoyed Sunshine overall. didn\'t grow to like until the second season, but even in the first season there were a lot of fun scenes that let me get to know and like the cast.

In short, it wasn\'t even worth watching. If you want a summary just watch any other generic cute girl show and imagine them saying ""Zura"" at the end of every fucking sentence. It was very slow moving, the characters were mostly pretty dull, and it was frequently annoying. The dance portions were somewhat well done, so I can recommend looking them up on youtube instead of bothering to watch the rest of the show. Since I didn\'t watch the original show, it was...infuriating to hear them never shut up about the ""Mu\'s"". Why not try to make your show stand on its own? Definitely skip this show. infuriating to hear them never shut up about the ""Mu\'s"". Why not try to make your show stand on its own?

Spoilers ahead!)Have you ever thought about how important sunshine is?Sunshine heats you up. It gives you nutrients like Vitamin D. It even lights your way during the day, keeping darkness at bay with many a ray.Sunshine, the anime, is not like regular sunshine. But, as it shows, it took some inspiration. Bringing warmth, goodness, and a path worth following.STORYSunshine stars Chika Takami, a second-year high-school girl who has never been a part of something special. Upon learning of a not-so-unknown group of girls who go by the name of μ’s, she aims to take part in...the world of school idols, hoping to find happiness and fun alongside everyone else.It’s no question that Sunshine is a fun slice-of-life comedy. Chika and You singing about song lines, Hanamaru impressed by computers, and Mari double-checking that Kanan has grown up prove its comedy chops well enough.It’s no question that Sunshine is a musical of sorts. Not in the Hollywood sense where the characters literally break out into song and dance during their scenes, but it does have the occasional dance number. Complete with fancy outfits, harmonized singing, and various musical compositions.It’s no question that Sunshine is a drama. Aquors do not form their group all at once, and, during their time together, it doesn’t always go according to plan.If one wants, these three aspects – comedy, musical, drama – can simply be the extent of the anime. And that’s fair. Like any story, Sunshine’s is there to entertain, and, for the most part, those comedic and music and dramatic parts achieve this necessity.However, should one look deeper, the anime has a strong, underlying message that it relays.Sunshine is very much a classic follow-your-dreams tale. Chika, You, Riko, Yohane, Ruby, Hanamaru, Kanan, Dia, and Mari work together, through the good times and the bad, accomplishing goals both big and small, as they steadily make their way through the school-idol universe. The different monologues on changing that zero to a one, or the show focusing on their aspirations, make this direction evident enough.Yet dreams aren’t the only end goal.One of the show’s biggest elements is its spiritual succession to the original Love Love seasons. μ’s does not ever show up in person, but their presence is certainly felt. Posters of Honoka and the gang. Snippets of videos taken of their performances. Constant references to their accomplishments and popularity.Sunshine goes so far as to have Aquors visit the same locations that μ’s did. From the shrine at the top of the stairs to that beach where emotions run high, the narrative makes μ’s a vital part of the Aquors process. Even the plot – Aquors’ in danger of losing their school – matches that of its predecessor.Before diving into why this direction is important, it’s arguably done to a fault. That the show spends too much time on μ’s, distracting itself from what really matters. Namely, Aquors and their journey. At the minimum, Chika fawning over μ’s for the umpteenth time does not exactly inject a whole lot of variation in the dialogue.Even if such overreliance is the case, what Sunshine does with it, the purpose behind doing so, more than makes up for any problem it may be.The best way to understand this thinking is through Aquors’ opening line in their opening track: “Chasing down the path of a dream I’ve never seen.”The girls of Aquors are following their dreams, but, clearly, they also look up to μ’s. In a meta sense, these idols are following in the footsteps of their idols. And that’s what’s shown. They do the same training regimen, they go to Tokyo to gain inspiration, and they believe they can conquer Love Live if they give it everything they’ve got.So, looking up to one’s role models becomes Sunshine’s main directive. That is, their “never seen” dream is the one that μ’s made real.But, the more that Aquors experience the troubles of keeping and forming a group, as well as the different difficulties of following μ’s step-for-step, it becomes obvious that they cannot. Not only because they aren’t as talented or as strong as μ’s (which is true at this point in the narrative) but also because this directive isn’t the right way to go about “chasing down the path.”Their first foray as school idols does not go as smoothly as they hoped when almost nobody shows up to see them. When they try to gain popularity by being something they’re not, it backfires in their ratings. Their first shot at a promotional video doesn’t capture what makes them and their town special.Over and over, Sunshine shows that μ’s is out of Aquors’ league, but it’s episode eight that hammers home just how far down on the ladder they currently are. Earning zero votes, Aquors (still with only six members at this point) are handed a huge reality check. That, no, it’s not enough to just emulate those that they idolize.It’s a tough situation to watch, but it’s needed. For, thematically, it not only challenges that emulation but also their resolve. To this end, their seniors help, growing Aquors both in size and in mindset through the seniors’ own idol-based troubles.With the group fully assembled, they start to realize that they can’t just copy μ’s and hope for the best. They make a trip to the school that μ’s saved, hoping to understand what made μ’s different. Chika has that realization: μ’s is special because they are nobody else but themselves.So, Aquors join hands (fingers, really) and come together with the right directive in mind. They won’t just blindly follow μ’s. Rather, they’ll chase down that path towards their own dream, in their own way, while remaining inspired by the girls that came before them. In Chika’s own words, “I’m not going to follow you, I’m going to run forward, in search of my own place. With everyone. Someday. Someday…”Beyond Sunshine’s thematic presence, the performances are also noteworthy, for they each serve a clear purpose. For instance, when the third-years join, their dance incorporates their transition from their old group into the new one. Or take their qualifiers performance. The duality between Aquors’ song and Riko’s piano playing emphasize the other.While these parts make up the highlights of the anime, Sunshine is not without faults.At least early on, it has too many loud screams into panned-up shots. It’s done with comedy in mind, and it is funny, but hearing Chika scream treads into repetitive territory.The anime also has a hard time conveying how well they are progressing as a group. Not in gaining members because that’s an obvious indicator of their growth. Rather, something as simple as showing them practice. They all just sing well and dance well without it being shown how.Granted, and arguably, Sunshine cares more about its comedy, slice-of-life, and drama, meaning it would rather show off these than “waste” time on depicting Aquors improving themselves. Still, when part of the anime is about them becoming top-tier idols, actually having that sense of progression is almost required.Furthermore, most of the drama itself leans towards problematic. Chika trying to touch Riko’s hand or Yohane running away from the others inflates the current conflict or issue unnecessarily, reducing the drama’s overall impact.Despite these problems, Sunshine’s personable theme on idols as well as its purposeful performances give this certain set of sunny school girls a stronger start than perhaps at first perceived.ANIMATIONSunshine does not have the most elaborate art. Especially when it comes to its locations and its backgrounds. While lighting can sometimes play a part in its scenes (most often a setting sun of some kind), the unassuming school, Chika’s home, and the nearby beach do not give the anime a whole lot of chances to strut its stuff. Bustling Tokyo may be an argument against this thought, but it’s not a place that the cast visits often.Still, the anime does very well in one specific area: the musical performances.Considering that Sunshine is about school idols, it’s important that its musical performances are given their due attention. Thankfully, they are.One of the cooler techniques is the show’s blending of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional art. The previous iterations in the series used a similar technique, and it works well here again. The three-dimensional parts do not look overly stiff, avoid drops in detail, and provide the two-dimensional segments more breathing room than if the performances were wholly as such.(Granted, if the creators had infinite time, money, and resources, these performances would most likely ditch the three-dimensional art since it does not look as crisp as the two-dimensional parts. But, sadly, such bottomless supplies do not exist.)Where lighting is normally acceptable for what it is during the regular parts of Sunshine, the performances step it up. Firework displays, floating lanterns, and multicolored spotlights dazzle the stages and, in turn, dazzle the audiences (both in and out of the anime).Such lights light up Aquors’ outfits which are very pretty and, if nothing else, quite detailed. Each performance changes what they wear: prom-night dresses, traditional-yet-modern pieces, and polka-dotted, frilly creations. The styling, colors, and accessories further make the performances a treat to watch.And the choreography of the dances within the performances are also worth praising. Aquors do not just stand around and sing a song. Instead, they are moving around and interacting with each other. Hand flourishes, winking eyes, pointing, small jigs, and special actions. In short, the girls are a playful bunch while onstage, injecting a lot of fun, a lot variety, and a lot of purpose into every performance.Sunshine is not always showcasing a performance; there are about six in total. So, for most of the anime, Aquors are in a more realistic setting. Here, the anime does well, too.On an artistic level, the show creates many expressive faces that get at its comedy. Dia buzzing when the girls are wrong, Yohane trying to play off how hurt her legs are, and Ruby shying away from everyone are just a few examples of the show’s clear aim at detailed reactions.On an animation level, the characters are almost always moving. Usually within their own space. Mari running hard in the rain. Riko “flying” over to her balcony. Hanamaru chowing down on some Stewshine. While the performances easily have the more involved animated sequences, the downtime portions of Sunshine are certainly not without their own moments.Finally, the character designs are what they need to be: cute, simple, and not overly specialized. Ruby gets at that cuteness with red twin-tails and a shorter physique. You gets at that simplicity with short hair and charming blue eyes. And Dia gets at that specialization through the beauty mark on her chin.Of course, the girls are not just one of these details but some combination of the three. And, while they each (besides Hanamaru) wear the same school outfit – grey skirt, yellowish cardigan, and a bow on top – their color symbolism continues the strength in their designs. Yohane’s dark-teal symbolizes her “corrupted” yet sweet side, Chika’s orange symbolizes her contagious happiness, and Kanan’s purple symbolizes her inherent beauty.If nothing else, their bright, jewellike eyes are enough of an eye-catch to make the designs worth talking about.CHARACTERSWhile Sunshine’s characters are not the most complex, they are at least given their own time to, well, shine. Considering that it has nine different cast members of high importance, it’s nice to see them all get something.Not counting You (since she was there from the beginning), Riko is the first person to join Chika on her school-idol quest. Their initial meeting left them floundering in the ocean, but it gave them the opportunity to speak with each other alone. Riko talks about wanting to hear the sound of the ocean, and Chika describes how she’s “…a normal person born on Planet Normal.” Chika’s words on her normalcy, and how μ’s let her know that even someone as normal as her could go far, encouraged Riko.But not enough courage to switch to the world of school idols. For, despite going to Chika’s school and hearing her pleas, Riko staunchly refuses to join the club. She has her song-writing background, but she doesn’t want to give up on the piano despite the psychological block she has encountered.Chika and You help her out. They take her out diving where she discovers the sound she has been searching for. Their small outing together enlists Riko into their group – but to write songs only.To her, switching from all that she knows and has practiced – playing the piano – would be disingenuous both to Chika and to herself. Even if she currently views it as not “fun” and “nothing changes.”But, as Chika says, she can just try, and, if nothing else, she’ll put smiles on people’s faces. Especially Chika’s. Because that’s “…what a school idol is about. And that’s a wonderful thing.” Thus, Riko officially joins.However, unlike the other girls (besides Chika), she gets even more attention. Later, when the group has fully assembled, she finds herself partially regretting not following through with the piano. It’s always been a part of her, and it’s something that she has always known. So, understandably, the new direction her life has taken, a direction that doesn’t involve piano, does not sit all too well with her.Chika, being the good leader and the even better friend that she is, pushes Riko to continue playing. While she may not take part in one of Aquors’ performances, Chika knows that the piano is a part of Riko. That, by following through on the passion she has always had, and beating that brain block that has plagued her for far too long, Riko will come out the better for it. And, as expected, she does.Discussing every girl to a similar depth would take up a lot of time; there are nine of them after all. However, it’s clear that they each go through some type of conflict that they eventually overcome.Ruby doesn’t let her sister’s (current) feelings on idols dismay her. Hanamaru moves away from her lonely time with nothing but books and into a group filled with both old and new friends alike. Yohane doesn’t let go of her chuunibyou antics just because they are a little strange. You gets rid of her jealousy. Chika lets her frustration out rather than keeping it all bottled up. Dia, Mari, and Kanan mend their relationship circle after discovering that they have simply been looking out for one another in their own roundabout way.On top of their more dramatic developments, each girl of Aquors has her own distinct personality. Some of the more notable ones include Hanamaru’s “zura” vocal tic, You’s obsession with outfits and saluting, and Mari’s feeble attempts at speaking English. As Chika puts it, “Each of us has our own personality and charm.”While it’s almost a necessity that the characters define themselves separately from each other (because having two protagonists who match in behavior would almost always make for quite the boring story), it’s nice to see Sunshine put effort into all of them so that the group is not just a lot livelier but also the audience can have many different idols to root for.Again, and technically, these girls do not have much going for them besides their kindness and their quirkiness. And, once their respective episodes have finished, they do not contribute a great deal to the overall story except for the usual comedic actions and banter.However, like said story, looking beyond these superficial traits reveals something interesting.The easiest example is Yohane. Her entire episode revolves around keeping her “fallen angel” self. She tries to resist it, and Aquors try to conform to it, but, in the end, only Yohane and her “little demons” can “descend” upon others.How about Riko’s conflict again? She reconciles with her past, the part of her self, that she had just about given up on.The senior girls are the most intriguing. Kanan “couldn’t sing” which forced the original Aquors group to disband, giving Mari a chance at the future she deserved – but not the one that she wanted. Mari didn’t want to study abroad because she was worried about Kanan and wanted to help her. And Dia, in support of both, foregoes her adoration of all things idols. So, the girls gave up their own selves to protect each other.To put it differently, just as the story deals with Aquors as a group maintaining their sense of self, the characters, on an individual basis, also deal with maintaining their sense of self. This parallelism boosts the strength of the characters by giving them something more than just a bit of development and cute personalities.SOUNDIn a show like Sunshine, music must aim higher than usual. It is, after all, one of its selling points. As such, what’s given is respectable.Most notable are the songs sung during the performances. They each have the same approach, with the girls switching on and off in individualized and grouped fashion, and the songs don’t extend too much beyond the pop genre. But they do try for something new each time.The first official song – with just You, Riko, and Chika before they are school idols – uses the constant “hand in hand” and “wow o wow” lyrics as a motif that carries the piece. St. Snow’s song takes on an unconventional, edgier direction when compared to other school idols. And Aquors’ first song as a full group takes advantage of slowness, simple guitar strings, and a cultural presence that turns it into arguably the best of the songs Aquors perform.At least within the plot of the anime. For the opening track stands above the rest. It’s a cheerful, optimistic, and exuberant song due to the harmonizing of the group, the quickness of the beat, and the loud yet light instrumental work. Plus, it’s just catchy to listen to.The original soundtrack also deserves its own praise. While the performances are obviously more complex, and the tracks themselves are nothing too fancy, they get at the sincerity and hopefulness that Sunshine strives for. In particular, the OST’s use of trumpets, flutes, pianos, acoustic guitars, and chimes create, if nothing else, a set of thoughtful pieces.Returning in this iteration of Love Live is the eponymous transition. It’s a small, albeit expected, inclusion, but it brings back the charm of the series with ease.The ED isn’t awful, but, again, this anime is a musical one, so it needs to bring it. But not much was brought. It gets points for switching up who is singing the song almost every time (meaning there are as many as thirteen variations) and for the slight shift in composition near its tail end. But it lacks the oomph necessary to make it a memorable piece let alone a comparable one to its other offerings.As for voice acting, Sunshine has one too many have-the-girls-make-an-audible-sound-to-indicate-inclusion moments. But since the women who portray the girls of Aquors are each in their first-ever major role in an anime – an impressive feat to have nine simultaneous newcomers fitting their characters – it could have been a whole lot worse.ENJOYMENTThis series is one that I watched early on in my writing career. It wasn’t one of the very first anime that I reviewed, but it was when I was still learning the ropes and establishing myself as a critic.Years later, I find myself reviewing a part of the series again. And, thankfully, it was just as entertaining – if not more so.One of the biggest positives is the cast. While I don’t value them all the same, I do like them each to some extent. They bring their own flair and their own comedy, providing many chances for me to find something funny (which I almost always did). To put it differently, I did not find myself disliking any member of the cast.I thought that was going to happen for some of the plainer members like Chika, Mari, and You. But it didn’t. Chika’s unending determination, Mari’s silliness, and You’s need to salute the others made them fun in their own way.If I had to choose my top three favorites, they would be Yohane, Hanamaru, and Kanan. Yohane because of her chuunibyou, Hanamaru because of her reactions, and Kanan because of her attractiveness. Again, I like them all, but these three are ahead of the rest.Some of the funniest scenes to me were when they were depicted in their childhood. They occasionally appeared, but they were hilarious nevertheless. Kanan’s way of pronouncing “hug” when first meeting Mari, Dia getting a phobia of Tokyo, and Hanamaru’s “It’s the future!” exclamation when first encountering a nighttime spotlight each made me smile.I even got emotional near the anime’s final couple of episodes. When the group declared that they would follow their own path and not μ’s, and their closing song where they recapped how they got to where they are now, I was happy to see them going for and succeeding at accomplishing their dreams.And I really liked the performances. More so than I probably should. Their exaggerated moves were cute to see and fun to watch. I even found myself mimicking them here and there. (And no, there’s no video of that.)Basically, I had an awesome time yet again with this series.Love Live! Sunshine!! sings with all its heart. A strong theme on following one’s idols, a diverse cast of characters, and both nice-looking and well-sounding musical performances add up to equal a strong start for the girls of Aquors. Come rain or shine, their future is a sunny one indeed.SUMMARYStory: Fine, while the more dramatic conflicts miss the punch and some of the finer details lack finesse, a theme on being inspired by one’s idols provides a strong foundation for Aquors to begin their own journeyAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, well-crafted performances, above-average actual animation, expressive faces, and nice character designsCharacters: Good, the girls of Aquors each get time to shine, carrying its theme on maintaining one’s selfSound: Fine, good OP, bad ED, okay OST, okay VA performances, and good insert songsEnjoyment: Great, fun characters, nice comedy, emotional moments, and entertaining performancesFinal Score: 7/10 the world of school idols, hoping to find happiness and fun alongside everyone else.It’s no question that Sunshine is a fun slice-of-life comedy. Chika and You singing about song lines, Hanamaru impressed by computers, and Mari double-checking that Kanan has grown up prove its comedy chops well enough.It’s no question that Sunshine is a musical of sorts. Not in the Hollywood sense where the characters literally break out into song and dance during their scenes, but it does have the occasional dance number. Complete with fancy outfits, harmonized singing, and various musical compositions.It’s no question that Sunshine is a drama. Aquors do not form their group all at once, and, during their time together, it doesn’t always go according to plan.If one wants, these three aspects – comedy, musical, drama – can simply be the extent of the anime. And that’s fair. Like any story, Sunshine’s is there to entertain, and, for the most part, those comedic and music and dramatic parts achieve this necessity.However, should one look deeper, the anime has a strong, underlying message that it relays.Sunshine is very much a classic follow-your-dreams tale. Chika, You, Riko, Yohane, Ruby, Hanamaru, Kanan, Dia, and Mari work together, through the good times and the bad, accomplishing goals both big and small, as they steadily make their way through the school-idol universe. The different monologues on changing that zero to a one, or the show focusing on their aspirations, make this direction evident enough.Yet dreams aren’t the only end goal.One of the show’s biggest elements is its spiritual succession to the original Love Love seasons. μ’s does not ever show up in person, but their presence is certainly felt. Posters of Honoka and the gang. Snippets of videos taken of their performances. Constant references to their accomplishments and popularity.Sunshine goes so far as to have Aquors visit the same locations that μ’s did. From the shrine at the top of the stairs to that beach where emotions run high, the narrative makes μ’s a vital part of the Aquors process. Even the plot – Aquors’ in danger of losing their school – matches that of its predecessor.Before diving into why this direction is important, it’s arguably done to a fault. That the show spends too much time on μ’s, distracting itself from what really matters. Namely, Aquors and their journey. At the minimum, Chika fawning over μ’s for the umpteenth time does not exactly inject a whole lot of variation in the dialogue.Even if such overreliance is the case, what Sunshine does with it, the purpose behind doing so, more than makes up for any problem it may be.The best way to understand this thinking is through Aquors’ opening line in their opening track: “Chasing down the path of a dream I’ve never seen.”The girls of Aquors are following their dreams, but, clearly, they also look up to μ’s. In a meta sense, these idols are following in the footsteps of their idols. And that’s what’s shown. They do the same training regimen, they go to Tokyo to gain inspiration, and they believe they can conquer Love Live if they give it everything they’ve got.So, looking up to one’s role models becomes Sunshine’s main directive. That is, their “never seen” dream is the one that μ’s made real.But, the more that Aquors experience the troubles of keeping and forming a group, as well as the different difficulties of following μ’s step-for-step, it becomes obvious that they cannot. Not only because they aren’t as talented or as strong as μ’s (which is true at this point in the narrative) but also because this directive isn’t the right way to go about “chasing down the path.”Their first foray as school idols does not go as smoothly as they hoped when almost nobody shows up to see them. When they try to gain popularity by being something they’re not, it backfires in their ratings. Their first shot at a promotional video doesn’t capture what makes them and their town special.Over and over, Sunshine shows that μ’s is out of Aquors’ league, but it’s episode eight that hammers home just how far down on the ladder they currently are. Earning zero votes, Aquors (still with only six members at this point) are handed a huge reality check. That, no, it’s not enough to just emulate those that they idolize.It’s a tough situation to watch, but it’s needed. For, thematically, it not only challenges that emulation but also their resolve. To this end, their seniors help, growing Aquors both in size and in mindset through the seniors’ own idol-based troubles.With the group fully assembled, they start to realize that they can’t just copy μ’s and hope for the best. They make a trip to the school that μ’s saved, hoping to understand what made μ’s different. Chika has that realization: μ’s is special because they are nobody else but themselves.So, Aquors join hands (fingers, really) and come together with the right directive in mind. They won’t just blindly follow μ’s. Rather, they’ll chase down that path towards their own dream, in their own way, while remaining inspired by the girls that came before them. In Chika’s own words, “I’m not going to follow you, I’m going to run forward, in search of my own place. With everyone. Someday. Someday…”Beyond Sunshine’s thematic presence, the performances are also noteworthy, for they each serve a clear purpose. For instance, when the third-years join, their dance incorporates their transition from their old group into the new one. Or take their qualifiers performance. The duality between Aquors’ song and Riko’s piano playing emphasize the other.While these parts make up the highlights of the anime, Sunshine is not without faults.At least early on, it has too many loud screams into panned-up shots. It’s done with comedy in mind, and it is funny, but hearing Chika scream treads into repetitive territory.The anime also has a hard time conveying how well they are progressing as a group. Not in gaining members because that’s an obvious indicator of their growth. Rather, something as simple as showing them practice. They all just sing well and dance well without it being shown how.Granted, and arguably, Sunshine cares more about its comedy, slice-of-life, and drama, meaning it would rather show off these than “waste” time on depicting Aquors improving themselves. Still, when part of the anime is about them becoming top-tier idols, actually having that sense of progression is almost required.Furthermore, most of the drama itself leans towards problematic. Chika trying to touch Riko’s hand or Yohane running away from the others inflates the current conflict or issue unnecessarily, reducing the drama’s overall impact.Despite these problems, Sunshine’s personable theme on idols as well as its purposeful performances give this certain set of sunny school girls a stronger start than perhaps at first perceived.ANIMATIONSunshine does not have the most elaborate art. Especially when it comes to its locations and its backgrounds. While lighting can sometimes play a part in its scenes (most often a setting sun of some kind), the unassuming school, Chika’s home, and the nearby beach do not give the anime a whole lot of chances to strut its stuff. Bustling Tokyo may be an argument against this thought, but it’s not a place that the cast visits often.Still, the anime does very well in one specific area: the musical performances.Considering that Sunshine is about school idols, it’s important that its musical performances are given their due attention. Thankfully, they are.One of the cooler techniques is the show’s blending of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional art. The previous iterations in the series used a similar technique, and it works well here again. The three-dimensional parts do not look overly stiff, avoid drops in detail, and provide the two-dimensional segments more breathing room than if the performances were wholly as such.(Granted, if the creators had infinite time, money, and resources, these performances would most likely ditch the three-dimensional art since it does not look as crisp as the two-dimensional parts. But, sadly, such bottomless supplies do not exist.)Where lighting is normally acceptable for what it is during the regular parts of Sunshine, the performances step it up. Firework displays, floating lanterns, and multicolored spotlights dazzle the stages and, in turn, dazzle the audiences (both in and out of the anime).Such lights light up Aquors’ outfits which are very pretty and, if nothing else, quite detailed. Each performance changes what they wear: prom-night dresses, traditional-yet-modern pieces, and polka-dotted, frilly creations. The styling, colors, and accessories further make the performances a treat to watch.And the choreography of the dances within the performances are also worth praising. Aquors do not just stand around and sing a song. Instead, they are moving around and interacting with each other. Hand flourishes, winking eyes, pointing, small jigs, and special actions. In short, the girls are a playful bunch while onstage, injecting a lot of fun, a lot variety, and a lot of purpose into every performance.Sunshine is not always showcasing a performance; there are about six in total. So, for most of the anime, Aquors are in a more realistic setting. Here, the anime does well, too.On an artistic level, the show creates many expressive faces that get at its comedy. Dia buzzing when the girls are wrong, Yohane trying to play off how hurt her legs are, and Ruby shying away from everyone are just a few examples of the show’s clear aim at detailed reactions.On an animation level, the characters are almost always moving. Usually within their own space. Mari running hard in the rain. Riko “flying” over to her balcony. Hanamaru chowing down on some Stewshine. While the performances easily have the more involved animated sequences, the downtime portions of Sunshine are certainly not without their own moments.Finally, the character designs are what they need to be: cute, simple, and not overly specialized. Ruby gets at that cuteness with red twin-tails and a shorter physique. You gets at that simplicity with short hair and charming blue eyes. And Dia gets at that specialization through the beauty mark on her chin.Of course, the girls are not just one of these details but some combination of the three. And, while they each (besides Hanamaru) wear the same school outfit – grey skirt, yellowish cardigan, and a bow on top – their color symbolism continues the strength in their designs. Yohane’s dark-teal symbolizes her “corrupted” yet sweet side, Chika’s orange symbolizes her contagious happiness, and Kanan’s purple symbolizes her inherent beauty.If nothing else, their bright, jewellike eyes are enough of an eye-catch to make the designs worth talking about.CHARACTERSWhile Sunshine’s characters are not the most complex, they are at least given their own time to, well, shine. Considering that it has nine different cast members of high importance, it’s nice to see them all get something.Not counting You (since she was there from the beginning), Riko is the first person to join Chika on her school-idol quest. Their initial meeting left them floundering in the ocean, but it gave them the opportunity to speak with each other alone. Riko talks about wanting to hear the sound of the ocean, and Chika describes how she’s “…a normal person born on Planet Normal.” Chika’s words on her normalcy, and how μ’s let her know that even someone as normal as her could go far, encouraged Riko.But not enough courage to switch to the world of school idols. For, despite going to Chika’s school and hearing her pleas, Riko staunchly refuses to join the club. She has her song-writing background, but she doesn’t want to give up on the piano despite the psychological block she has encountered.Chika and You help her out. They take her out diving where she discovers the sound she has been searching for. Their small outing together enlists Riko into their group – but to write songs only.To her, switching from all that she knows and has practiced – playing the piano – would be disingenuous both to Chika and to herself. Even if she currently views it as not “fun” and “nothing changes.”But, as Chika says, she can just try, and, if nothing else, she’ll put smiles on people’s faces. Especially Chika’s. Because that’s “…what a school idol is about. And that’s a wonderful thing.” Thus, Riko officially joins.However, unlike the other girls (besides Chika), she gets even more attention. Later, when the group has fully assembled, she finds herself partially regretting not following through with the piano. It’s always been a part of her, and it’s something that she has always known. So, understandably, the new direction her life has taken, a direction that doesn’t involve piano, does not sit all too well with her.Chika, being the good leader and the even better friend that she is, pushes Riko to continue playing. While she may not take part in one of Aquors’ performances, Chika knows that the piano is a part of Riko. That, by following through on the passion she has always had, and beating that brain block that has plagued her for far too long, Riko will come out the better for it. And, as expected, she does.Discussing every girl to a similar depth would take up a lot of time; there are nine of them after all. However, it’s clear that they each go through some type of conflict that they eventually overcome.Ruby doesn’t let her sister’s (current) feelings on idols dismay her. Hanamaru moves away from her lonely time with nothing but books and into a group filled with both old and new friends alike. Yohane doesn’t let go of her chuunibyou antics just because they are a little strange. You gets rid of her jealousy. Chika lets her frustration out rather than keeping it all bottled up. Dia, Mari, and Kanan mend their relationship circle after discovering that they have simply been looking out for one another in their own roundabout way.On top of their more dramatic developments, each girl of Aquors has her own distinct personality. Some of the more notable ones include Hanamaru’s “zura” vocal tic, You’s obsession with outfits and saluting, and Mari’s feeble attempts at speaking English.

This parallelism boosts the strength of the characters by giving them something more than just a bit of development and cute personalities.SOUNDIn a show like Sunshine, music must aim higher than usual.

A strong theme on following one’s idols, a diverse cast of characters, and both nice-looking and well-sounding musical performances add up to equal a strong start for the girls of Aquors. Come rain or shine, their future is a sunny one indeed.SUMMARYStory: Fine, while the more dramatic conflicts miss the punch and some of the finer details lack finesse, a theme on being inspired by one’s idols provides a strong foundation for Aquors to begin their own journeyAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, well-crafted performances, above-average actual animation, expressive faces, and nice character designsCharacters: Good, the girls of Aquors each get time to shine, carrying its theme on maintaining one’s selfSound: Fine, good OP, bad ED, okay OST, okay VA performances, and good insert songsEnjoyment: Great, fun characters, nice comedy, emotional moments, and entertaining performancesFinal Score: 7/10', ""This is my favorite anime so I think I'll give it my first review. If you know about Love Live, you must know that Sunshine takes place after School Idol Project. While some people say you can actually watch it without SIP, I strongly recommend you to do so.Story and plot, 09/10: To make it short, there's nine girls aiming to be school idols, seeking the path of µ's, the main objective does not start with saving the school, but with finding their own radiance instead. The downside I find with it is that it feels a bit rushed and it's a bit...hard to follow the story at the same rhythm as the characters. Probably because it's hard to tell a story like this with so many main characters in just 13+13 episodes and the movie.Worldbuilding, 10/10: It takes place in Numazu, a real place in Japan that shares a deep bond with the real life Aqours and franchise. The series continues the events in SIP and we see the consequences of µ's' success.Characters 08/10: The strong point of this series is creating great characters, every girl of the group carries with some regret or something to overcome and change their lives. Specially if I talk about Chika, she's the best fictional character I've ever seen, I can write a whole text about it but it would become an analysis rather than a review. Sadly, there's some characters that are not equally developed.Art, 08/10: The animation is smooth and very expressive, the scenery here is outstanding and highly detailed. The CGI used in the performances has improved a lot since the first Love Live. It's not an incredible animation though.Sound, 10/10: As you know, Love Live is a music franchise so almost every song here is excellent. Not only that, I find the soundtrack here as the best soundtrack I've ever heard in any anime.Entertainment, 08/10: It's pretty catchy and fast paced, so it's hard to find a boring or filler moment. It's good at keeping you hooked to the screen.Meaningful, 10/10: Some people may not expect it but there's some deep messages and things that you'll probably relate to. It actually changed my life. hard to follow the story at the same rhythm as the characters. Probably because it's hard to tell a story like this with so many main characters in just 13+13 episodes and the movie.Worldbuilding, 10/10: It takes place in Numazu, a real place in Japan that shares a deep bond with the real life Aqours and franchise. The series continues the events in SIP and we see the consequences of µ's' success.Characters 08/10: The strong point of this series is creating great characters, every girl of the group carries with some regret or something to overcome and change their lives. Specially if I talk about Chika, she's the best fictional character I've ever seen, I can write a whole text about it but it would become an analysis rather than a review. Sadly, there's some characters that are not equally developed.Art, 08/10: The animation is smooth and very expressive, the scenery here is outstanding and highly detailed. The CGI used in the performances has improved a lot since the first Love Live. It's not an incredible animation though.Sound, 10/10: As you know, Love Live is a music franchise so almost every song here is excellent. Not only that, I find the soundtrack here as the best soundtrack I've ever heard in any anime.Entertainment, 08/10: It's pretty catchy and fast paced, so it's hard to find a boring or filler moment. It's good at keeping you hooked to the screen.Meaningful, 10/10: Some people may not expect it but there's some deep messages and things that you'll probably relate to. It actually changed my life."", 'Sunshine feels like they wanted to redo school idol project and fix everything that was wrong, and when viewed from this perspective it absolutely blows school idol project out of the park. You can recognize a lot of character traits in current members of Aqours to Muse, but their dynamic is much more enjoyable compared to Muse in my opinion. It certainly isn\'t afraid to be cheesy or really embrace it\'s subject of just how stupidly silly it sounds. ""T-That\'s why I wanna be a school idol! To make everyone smile!"" stuff like this usually just makes me roll my eyes but it\'s enjoyable. If...you can move past the usual genre tropes that it pulls I think it\'s a very enjoyable series and possibly the best of the Love Live series thus far. you can move past the usual genre tropes that it pulls I think it\'s a very enjoyable series and possibly the best of the Love Live series thus far.', 'Please note that the original Love Live! School Idol Project will be referred as Love Live/ original and Love Live Sunshine will just be called Sunshine in this review.I\'m sorry to say but this was garbage compared to Love Live! School Idol Project.Let\'s start with the story: The show is about a girl who decided to become a school idol in order to stop her school from closing down. Sounds familiar? Well yes, it\'s the same fucking plot of the originalThere was absolutely nothing new. They tried to create drama and tension when Riko\'s piano recital coincidentally happened to be on the same...day of the Love Live Qualifiers but even that did nothing to splash some excitement. They even tossed in a lesbian fanservice ""suki suki moe moe daisuki"" that did absolutely nothing for the anime.This show is trying so hard to become Love Live and they are not even trying to hide it.The story doesn\'t grip you. I remember on the original, when Muse first had their live and no one showed up and when all of them sang Start Dash together for the first time. There were goosebumps, there was joy. And when their classmates helped them get in time for their performance in the middle of a snow storm so they can can sing Snow Halation. I felt a lot of emotions unlike while I\'m watching Sunshine.Also, what the FUCK was that cringey monologue at the end? If you were going to monologue the entire story on the last episode then I shouldn\'t have bothered wasting my time on episodes 1-12!Moving on to characters, like the fucking story it was a copy cat. The character designer could have made characters with more original features. Chika is Honoka, You looks like Hanayo, Riko is obviously Maki, Mari is Alice chan and Eli, Dia is a mix of Umi and Eli\'s personality. Aside from that, the characters failed to make the viewer (ME) give a shit about them. There was no emotional attachment to these characters what so ever. They were very dull and unrelatable. Overall the characters are flat flat flat!Lastly, the music. Now, I\'ll be honest, I\'m not really musically inclined. But, Sunshine\'s soundtrack didn\'t really stay with me unlike Love Live. The lyrics were not very good and it felt like it didn\'t fit with the melody. Speaking of melody, their music was not catchy at all. I didn\'t find myself repeating the songs in my head. I was so disappointed because the music was one of my favorite part about Love Live.Overall, Sunshine was a pathetic copy cat of the original that was made to milk in more money from the die hard Love Live fans. day of the Love Live Qualifiers but even that did nothing to splash some excitement.

Have I fallen too far?Stop me if you\'ve heard this one before. Die-hard school idol fan goes around trying to recruit other girls for her school idol group. Over time, thanks to the help of those around her, she grows that group and in doing so, saves her school from being shut down. There are dramatic tensions between members along the way, but by the end the whole group is closer together than ever.Yeah, Love Live! Sunshine is really about as direct as a Love Live! reboot can get.Okay, it\'s not a direct copy-and-paste. By the end of the...season, we\'re not sure if they\'ve saved their school or not. I\'m guessing we\'ll get an answer in S2, but it\'s interesting that they left things ambiguous.Also, rather than chasing after an image of faraway school idols, the girls of Uranohoshi are chasing after the image of Muse. Oh wait, we only got teasers for Muse members this season. So I guess that point\'s pretty similar too.Alright, for as much as I\'d like to harp on how similar the structure of this story is to the OG, there\'s a lot of things within said story that are done quite differently. Firstly:The characters. Overall, they feel a bit more intentionally gimmicky.You have Chika, the can-do naive but passionate lead who\'s a huge fan of school idols, and the ringleader of the group. You have Riko, who plays piano and has a bit of a softer heart.There\'s You, who speaks a lot in ship terms and is constantly there as Chika\'s third wheel- uh, I mean, second mate. There\'s Hanamaru, who ends all her sentences with ""zura"" because she\'s a ditsy, out-of-touch country girl.Mari, a regular Engrish speaker, opportunistic pervert, and general go-getter. Ruby, the adorably shy imouto whose sole job is to up the moe value of this series by a solid 11, with catchphrases like ""Ganbaruby!"". Dia, who I guess acts as this season\'s idol tsundere, but instead of shyness or embarrassment the reason for her non-transparency is watching her school idol friend group falling into shambles. Kanan, who lives and dies for Mari but is otherwise a bit reserved.And then, of course, there\'s Yohane, the chunibyo who just can\'t control her inner teen edgelord sometimes. Her drawing satanic circles, followed by calling everyone her ""little demons"" and then promptly cringing inside is probably my favorite gag from this season.Beyond these initial premises, though, we don\'t get too much substantial on the development side this season. Sure, everyone gets their chance to shine, but part of me is left wishing we had a bit more time. Nine characters in thirteen episodes is a tall order, to be sure, but it doesn\'t change the fact that a lot of changes feel kind of abrupt. First of all, when exactly in the process did Chika become such a dependable leader? Like, what exactly changed after her big cry in front of the rest of the girls? I guess it\'s after showing off her vulnerable side and throwing away her facade that she\'s able to operate full force. Don\'t get me wrong, I absolutely love this change in character, and it led to one particular shining moment where she lets Riko perform her heart out in Tokyo, but there\'s just such a clear line before and after she becomes competent. (Side note: Rip You. You should know by now that childhood friends with shorter hair never win. At least she had her moment, then gracefully bowed out of the love triangle. I respect that shiz.)Also, Mari and Kanan\'s fallout then mending back together felt a bit too fast. If it took two episodes to resolve a conflict that was lingering over two years, then what was the point of the conflict hanging for so long? Again, the story beats were great, but there was barely any time allotted to let the emotional impact sink in. Like, right after the emotional climax they just immediately cut to song. Come on man, let these two almost-lovebirds bask in the feels for just a few more minutes.Actually, now that I think about it, why didn\'t Dia say anything about the whole situation? Like, girl got her dreams crushed from end of freshman to senior year because of a silent misunderstanding between her two friends. Not too much of a criticism against the series, per se, since well, high schoolers aren\'t exactly the best at talking things through, but I do feel kinda bad for her. At least these three seniors love each other too much for there to be any lasting conflict from here on out.While we\'re on the topic of these six, though, I will say that the parallels that connected Riko and Chika to Mari and Kanan were nicely done. Seeing Chika be the bigger person, learning from the mistakes of her senpais and immediately having a heart-to-heart with Riko was such a huge sigh of relief from yours truly. Even if it did cost Riko her chance to sing with the others onstage during the final episode (wait, wait huh? She did sing onstage with the others despite the rules saying that she clearly couldn\'t? ...Oh. Okay, I guess.), it was a heartwarming moment regardless. Having her sent away to Tokyo only to come back stronger than ever really demonstrated the resiliency and acceptance of the new Aquors.Acceptance seems to be the central message of this season. The girls learn to accept each other for who they are, quirks and flaws. Every other girl\'s main arc and introduction to the team deals with this lesson, and while it\'s nothing groundbreaking, it\'s definitely satisfying to watch the team slowly assemble again for the second time. When the girls get their first burst of momentum with a viral PV, they have to accept that quick views aren\'t a ticket to victory insomuch as developing their skills are, and continue training on their song and dance over polishing their looks and personas. Even in the idol world, being flashy is still second to building a firm foundation in terms of how to achieve lasting success.One of my favorite moments in this season is right after Aquors gets a lucky break when everyone from Chika\'s older sister\'s workplace shows up to support her. It seems almost too good to be true, and Dia makes it very clear that in a way, it is. It\'s only by the good will of the townspeople that Chika was able to fill up the gym. No matter how brightly they may shine, they\'re still big fish in a small pond at the end of the day, and that realization really hammers home after Aquors receives a clean zero votes at the Tokyo competition. Good stuff.And finally, Aquors accepting that they shouldn\'t try to be Muse, even as much as they idolize them, was a nice conclusion to wrap up the season on. Really, though, this season could have used a lot less comparisons to Muse. It was nice seeing the poster of them in Chika\'s room the first couple of times, but after quite a few teasers where we didn\'t even get to see our main cast interact with the current Muse, it was kind of unfortunate to see nothing really come out of it. Where\'s my Nico man?Animation-wise, this series was an ever-so-slight improvement over the first two seasons. I love seeing the quality of this show slowly rise up in real time, even if the CG is still clearly noticeable when it does appear. At least it\'s well-integrated.Music-wise as well, it\'s pretty solid. While this season didn\'t quite have any standouts, all of the songs were consistently good. I didn\'t have an issue with any of them, really. That being said, the OP is probably the only thing that\'s gonna make it on my playlist. Maybe this\'ll change with time, but that\'s how it is right now. As for the background music, it did tend to get a bit too dramatic at times, but it\'s good old orchestral backing. How can I complain? It just makes the show that much more fun.Overall, this show was definitely an echo of its predecessor, but one that rang clear and is on the verge of carving its own direction. Here\'s to hoping S2 really shines its own light!Story: 6/10 | Characters: 7/10 | Art: 8/10 | Sound: 8.5/10 | Enjoyment: 8/10 | Overall: 7.3/10P.S. Oh, I forgot to mention that they really turned up the yuri pairings this season. Forget just being good matches for each other, at least half of if not the whole cast is in love with someone else here.P.P.S. Some of the subtitled lines in this season truly went hard. Makes me want to watch the dub for this season. My favorite line by far being ""I did my rubest!"" I want to see how many Love Live fans I can make cringe with this iconic catchphrase. season, we\'re not sure if they\'ve saved their school or not.

However, you must keep in mind this is a ""recap"". Most Recap episodes in anime are always overlooked or low rated since-Well, its just recaps.So why give this one such a high score? Because this is EXACTLY what I feel like a recap should be!It isn\'t just a bunch of episodes edited into one with a narrator, they made it into a new thing!! Adding a story behind it, and even editing some of the anime scenes with funny new content!Mob psycho 100 is not your typical series, so...why should the recap be a typical recap?They went full swing and you could really feel the fun everyone must of had working on this.If you\'re more of a casual fan your opinion may vary.However, as someone who loves the series I had so much fun and laughed throughout.And for a ""Recap"" episodes thats saying A LOT.So yes, judging it as a RECAP I feel like it deserves a 10/10 why should the recap be a typical recap?They went full swing and you could really feel the fun everyone must of had working on this.If you\'re more of a casual fan your opinion may vary.However, as someone who loves the series I had so much fun and laughed throughout.And for a ""Recap"" episodes thats saying A LOT.So yes, judging it as a RECAP I feel like it deserves a 10/10', 'Reigen. Mob Psycho 100\'s most beloved character, perhaps even surpassing the titular character himself. So what is this special about?Well, the Mob Psycho 100 Reigen Special is about Reigen writing a book about his ""experiences"" with the supernatural. But as we all know Reigen is the biggest con in the entire series, and so are most of the recaps.I think this special has truly opened my eyes to how damn good Bones is at animating recap episodes and keeping them fresh (I think the only thing that beats this recap episode is that one back in Re:Creators).Retelling the events in the series from Reigen\'s...perspective, or rather the perspective he wants everyone to see it from, we are allowed the opportunity to see subtle changes in the story that makes Reigen look like a wise and noble main character, and dare I say IT IS FUCKING HILARIOUS.I think the biggest thing going for this recap episode is noticing the subtle change in detail from the first season. There are many times where Reigen obviously photoshops himself over other characters in the story, changes dialogue or includes himself in scenes he wasn\'t in, just so he can have a say in the narrative he\'s trying to push to get sales.That said, by the end of the special, all the other characters revise the book, making it essentially about Mob instead of Reigen, and his ""Fabrication level"" of his story goes from a 100 to nothing a big ol\' donut.One thing I also found interesting is how Mob also changes some of the story too when he gets the chance to write his own chapter, which actually gives a bit of insight into how he sees some of the events that unfolded. That said, it was still much closer to the truth than any of Reigen\'s bits.In the end, the Reigen special is a must-watch for all Mob Psycho fans, and it should be for the upcoming second season announced at the end of the episode. And that announcement was fucking golden, from how the episode built up to it the entire time, and how gratifying it was to see as a Mob Psycho fan.But I guess not everyone will like this for the simple fact that it is a recap episode, that said, no matter if you like it or not, there is one thing we can all say at the end of the day:Everybody loves Reigen. perspective, or rather the perspective he wants everyone to see it from, we are allowed the opportunity to see subtle changes in the story that makes Reigen look like a wise and noble main character, and dare I say IT IS FUCKING HILARIOUS.I think the biggest thing going for this recap episode is noticing the subtle change in detail from the first season.

Basically if you like re watching anime this is your cup of tea. On the other hand if you're like me you won't enjoy this that much. The anime was great but this just feels like a lazy way to announce season 2. They used the same animation and music for almost the whole special so there isn't much to say. The parts that are original to this special are of good quality though and...the twist at the end is pretty funny in my opinion. One thing is sure, I would fully recommend this special as a recap for anyone who hasn't seen the anime. It's complete and misses some details but the overall plot and important details are there making it a very good recap.  That is all. :) the twist at the end is pretty funny in my opinion.

That is all. :)"", 'Let me be frank, this is essentially a recap episode (and we all know now well those go down in the anime community!), a 60min recap episode at that.The gimmick here is that it is a retelling of the events of the 1 season from the perspective of Reigen, embellished for the purpose of making some profit. I call it a gimmick because it doesn\'t take very long for it to wear on the nerves. Reigen\'s manipulation of Mob is an essential aspect of the story...but an entire episode of it is far more than I can take.Regarding all other aspects, apart from few additional...scenes to move the recap along, it is a highlights reel of all the best fights from season 1, nothing more.I\'m a big fan of Mob Pyscho 100 but a would strongly recommend seeing the highlighted scenes from this recap in context, they certainly suffer from being ""retooled"" in this episode.Easter Egg...apparently Reigen has a Saitama screen saver on his mobile phone. scenes to move the recap along, it is a highlights reel of all the best fights from season 1, nothing more.I\'m a big fan of Mob Pyscho 100 but a would strongly recommend seeing the highlighted scenes from this recap in context, they certainly suffer from being ""retooled"" in this episode.Easter Egg...apparently Reigen has a Saitama screen saver on his mobile phone.', 'Story: Recap of season 1 but in a whole new twist~ HILARIOUS! I won\'t tell spoilers but haha.. those ""encounter"" stories.. a little delirious but hey, who wants to just see a boring recap when you can have Reigen\'s version of it instead? 10/10Art: No changes there. So.. yeah.Character: Reigen is hilarious as always, telling the whole season 1 recap his own way.Enjoyment: 10Fantastic! Hilarious OVA! They did well on it! I recommend people to watch this if they wanna see a summary but hilarious version of Mob Psycho 100.Not a spoiler, but like, one time, Reigen\'s phone was edited to show Saitama as his...picture cover for his phone. Nice edit! Hahaha! picture cover for his phone. Nice edit! Hahaha!', ""Man, do all of these sick psychic fiction draw me in, you say more of Mob, I say hell yeah, before we start, at the end of the special, there was a moment that I looked for in a long time, in which they announce the second season of the anime coming up soon, and man, that was such a great way to do it.- Story (7.5/10):Fascinating, this is in some form a summary of the original series, but it has a unique touch of itself too, how you say? well, our main cast, Reigen, and Mob are writing a book, in order to get...tons of sells and gain money of course (That's so Reigen), they went ahead and rephrase the events of the story to make it as if Reigen was the one with the extraordinary psychic powers, so they basically retold the story in an hour span, but with the focus on Reigen and him being the lone protagonist, it was all centered around the humour more than anything else, and it was hilarious.- Art (8/10):I always love Mob Psycho 100's art style, looking very retro, the animation is just as delicious to the eye as your favorite candy as it melts in your mouth, the abstract backgrounds, and everything syncs very well, just like in the main show, you can't move your head away from the screen on the big animation moments, the fights and everything, It was just great to relive the action once again.- Sound (7/10):I've always wondered at how amazing the soundtrack is, I like how fast-paced it is, it suits the action on the screen very well, and the voice acting is just so on point, I'm always glad they had the classic Mob Psycho 100 opening on this one, got a fair reminder of how awesome it was.- Character (8/10):Oh man, if anything this series got right is the verity of characters, all are great and likable, I couldn't complain about anything a character does, always keeping you on your toes with their decision and humor, Dimple, Reigen, and Hanazawa are just the best man.- Enjoyment (7/10):I didn't enjoy this as much as I expected I would, mainly because it was a 90% recap of what happened, so knowing what would happen all the time removed that layer of suspense to the experience, the humour, on the other hand, was just great, had a great sum of giggles along the way.- Overall (7.5/10):For a recap, this was amazing, I thought an hour long of content was going to be boring, but surprisingly enough, I never had to check the time constantly being for this ordeal to end, I had a great watch, and would definitely recommend watching this before the second season airs to sort of catch up rather than going ahead and rewatching the whole first season. tons of sells and gain money of course (That's so Reigen), they went ahead and rephrase the events of the story to make it as if Reigen was the one with the extraordinary psychic powers, so they basically retold the story in an hour span, but with the focus on Reigen and him being the lone protagonist, it was all centered around the humour more than anything else, and it was hilarious.- Art (8/10):I always love Mob Psycho 100's art style, looking very retro, the animation is just as delicious to the eye as your favorite candy as it melts in your mouth, the abstract backgrounds, and everything syncs very well, just like in the main show, you can't move your head away from the screen on the big animation moments, the fights and everything, It was just great to relive the action once again.- Sound (7/10):I've always wondered at how amazing the soundtrack is, I like how fast-paced it is, it suits the action on the screen very well, and the voice acting is just so on point, I'm always glad they had the classic Mob Psycho 100 opening on this one, got a fair reminder of how awesome it was.- Character (8/10):Oh man, if anything this series got right is the verity of characters,

fun goofy premise of Reigen writing a book and some new bits of animation sprinkled in.The sound is reused and they certainly cut a lot of corners, but you can see there was a lot of love put in to it by the amazing cast..you can see the Seiyuus are excited about reprising their roles (the Blu-ray MP100 Minis serve as an even better example of this)The highlights are definitely the Claw Arc with Reigen's face badly photoshopped onto some scenes and the ending...segment- That announces the new Season (YEAH BABY) and gives a slight hint on one of the upcoming Arcs: The Separatiion Arc.So get on the hype train and brace yourselves for the extremely well-animated depression that the next season will bring! segment- That announces the new Season (YEAH BABY) and gives a slight hint on one of the

enjoy this. That's pretty much it. It's a retelling of the first season through Reigen's very altered point of view, so if you like Reigen and can get past the fact that he manipulates kids (as I can) then you'll enjoy the special. Because this is very much about Reigen and how he attempts to manipulate people. It's also a recap, so if you don't want to go through a reconstitution of season one, don't bother.I enjoyed this. I love Reigen; he's my favourite character in the series. I also needed a recap on this (I...don't have the best memory) so I was fine with it. Again, it's really about personal taste. If you don't like Mob Psycho very much, you're not gonna like this.

So Reigen narrates over clips from the previous 12 episodes as Mob is supposedly writing all this down, for the book. In the end, Reigen doesn\'t like what Mob wrote, because ""it\'s all about Mob and it just makes Reigen look like a con artist"". So they give up on the book, the end. Nothing of consequence happens.

So... blah blah blah...', '""if you\'re making a recap episode, this is the way to go about it"" -- the comments on Crunchyrolltl;dr This recap has a story that informs a bit more about the depth the characters may have. If you watched 1st season a long time ago & wanna recap, you may watch and enjoy this. ""I watched season 1, and what\'s in this one for me?"" --> see the spoiler section below.The memory afterwards: This is the one recap episode (or rather a movie, given it\'s length) that I WILL remember for it being a recap, as it gives something from itself, not merely stiching the...scenes together & (maybe) giving some commentary. It\'s a recap with it\'s own plot, and yes, it can have very minory minor spoilers because of that.The animation keeps the quality known from the first season, there is nothing to complain about and it\'s decent all along, but lacks the new action to feed your eyes with (NOT counting the scenes from original season, which are shown) or I\'m just forgetting something here.The story is told with humour specific to the series, playing off of its\' characters really really well. It\'s done to the point, that even though this is a recap or in-between story, it actually lets you know the characters better, showing the depth to which they may commit to their certain tendencies (mainly Reigen and Mob), thus showing how strong those tendencies are within them & what they may lead them to.Length & construction: as I watched it perhaps just a week after finishing the 1st season if not less, while watching it I wished it would be about 1/4th shorter, but by itself it\'s well paced and not much can be taken away from it without hurting its\' quality, the story told or the story recapped. It weaves the series\' story with its\' own bits gracefully, well put and without hiccups a story within a story might treat you with due to one more layer of complexity (but I\'m not even aware of any example of this in the wild, just saying).If I may sound a bit corny, when Mob 100 is involved & you have dedicated, experienced team animating it: you can (not) just recap.If you would like to recap the 1st season of the series after watching it a time long ago sufficient to make you forget its\' parts: you will be happy to watch this instead of the longer series, and it will even entertain you a bit more beyond just reminding you what\'s happened in the story up to about the point before the season II.If you\'ve just watched the 1st season: I wouldn\'t recommend watching this right now, but it won\'t hurt you a lot if you can afford the time & the feeling it could be a bit shorter (unless you really dig the clips of the events from the series). But I *may* have a bit different standards than you, as to what wastes time or what clips to dig.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS (minor minor) SPOILERS BELOW,but they apply mainly to the construction & resolution of the plot, not specifics, although the end result equal to ""some kind of resolution"" can be suspected from it being ""just a (decent) recap episode"".For those who watched the 1st season of Mob 100 and wonder if they should be/would enjoy watching this, the recap:-  show-lights the annoying Reigen even more and basically lets him go on the loose for extended period of time (thought the season 1 finale redeemed him? nah!)+ but makes things very right in the end, cleansing you from any bad taste & feelings of injustice towards any involved characters you may worry it may leave you with for life (it may give you a small satisfaction even)+ while recapping the whole 1st season well= and the plot is resolved in a reasonable, balanced way, so all remains without change, coming full circle, as it should be (for a recap episode) scenes together & (maybe) giving some commentary.

Maybe peeping if you're curious. It's just a recap of Season 1, but it's framed as Reigen using it as a plot to write his book. This results in him narrating the story and inserting himself in scenes or even over characters (say, if they're doing cool fighting stuff) to make it about him. It's definitely a funny twist for a recap  (especially when it's just Reigen's giant head superimposed over other characters') and it's entirely befitting of Reigen.However, it's not ENTIRELY Reigen-ified. There's much more...time where the anime is the exact same (even down to characters' thoughts being heard), so I was skipping ahead a lot until there was a Reigen or two, then went back to skipping. Eventually I stopped because the juice wasn't worth the squeeze.I guess you can watch it just to see what Reigen does to the recap yourself, but don't expect to strap in for the whole thing unless you want to rewatch Season 1 in an hour. time where the anime is the exact same (even down to characters' thoughts being heard), so I was skipping ahead a lot until there was a Reigen or two, then went back to skipping.

I got reintroduced to the characters, their personalities and relationships, the overall vibe of the show, and definitely Reigen's schemes. I couldn't tell truth from fiction for a large portion of the film since my memory wasn't great, so it was entertaining to revisit these scenes and try to decypher the details. I got to experience the film as if I was one of the very customers Reigen would try to impress with his dramatizations and smooth talking.Now I'm ready to see more of Mob Psycho. "", 'The Mob Psycho 100 movie caught my attention as I finished season two and its OVA and moved onto the third season. Crunchyroll has a way of doing that sometimes. I knew there was a movie but didn’t think it would be provided on the site. Apparently it’s meant to be watched directly after season 1, so that was my bad but I’ll act as if I haven’t watched it yet. It was delightful to hear/watch the season 1 OP and getting to know more about Reigen and his weird experiences. He’s a strange character, both lazy and incredibly hard-working, and this movie paints that...for its audience. Like some other OVAs, the movie restates a lot of season 1 under a new general plot: Reigen is trying to write a book in order to be famous. While Reigen takes credit for all of the exorcisms that Mob performs, he lets Mob write the book and even talks about him in multiple chapters. My favorite bit of this short film/OVA was when Reigen has Mob write a chapter about whatever he wants. It’s been a while, so pardon my memory, but I remember his writing about his brother. Mob’s little brother is easily cooler than Mob in every way; where Mob is socially awkward, his brother is the vice-president of the student council; where Mob has a bowl-cut hairstyle, Ritsu has dynamic hair. However, Mob had one thing over Ritsu, he was an esper. And it wasn’t until halfway through the show so far that Ritsu expressed his feelings of anger about Mob being better than him and more telekinetically inclined that he became an esper himself. To see Mob look up to his younger brother for at one point being a normal human who was just less socially inept than him made me emotional. Like the first season, I give this movie an 8 (Very Good). I’m writing this after having already seen season 2 and partially into season three, but this series is amazing. for its audience.
