Tennis no Oujisama: Another Story II - Ano Toki no Bokura,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10573/Tennis_no_Oujisama__Another_Story_II_-_Ano_Toki_no_Bokura,"[""Story I rated an 8 since it really is not an addition to the main story it does touch on a few characters traits where you might have thought why does he do that, after watching you get that oh I see sort of feeling.  The first episode was just funny to me. The other 3 touched on characters from other schools. Watch this if you liked the main story, you won't miss anything important if you head over to prince of tennis II.Art I gave an 8 same art as original story.Sound 8 leaves room for improving.Character 9 I love all...the different personalities in this anime.Enjoyment 9 I rated the original anime a 10 this didn't have enough episodes to build excitement like the first series, these 4 are basically just add ons to the first 200 something episodes.Overall I rate this a 9. If you enjoyed the first couple hundred episodes why not watch these for before going into Prince of Tennis II.  Hope this was helpful. the different personalities in this anime.Enjoyment 9 I rated the original anime a 10 this didn't have enough episodes to build excitement like the first series, these 4 are basically just add ons to the first 200 something episodes.Overall I rate this a 9.

The iDOLM@STER: 765 Pro to Iu Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11889/The_iDOLMSTER__765_Pro_to_Iu_Monogatari,"[""The iDOLM@STER: 765 Pro to Iu Monogatari, which is also known as the Idolmaster Special, is a 26 minute OVA of sorts that was released with the iDOLM@STER Blu-ray disc. It is essentially a compilation of short, quick stories revolving around everybody within 765 Productions. If you have a favorite character from the original Idolmaster series, don't worry; there is a high chance that they're in this episode somewhere. (Yes, even the members from Jupiter are in this episode.)The stories themselves maybe short and presented in a slice-of-life kind of way, but they are still very humorous. You'll be able to dig a little deeper...into the more trivial aspects of the idols' daily lives in a way that is much different from the original series. However, if you're looking for some intense drama (as with 961 Pro in the original series), character development, or anything of that sort, unfortunately, you won't find it here at all. This is just one episode after all.The sound, as with the original Idolmaster series, is arguably the strongest point of this episode. There is plenty of music presented throughout the Idolmaster Special. It never ceases to amaze me the amount of effort that people put into the creation of these songs.The art is very similar to that of the original series too. More importantly, there are no glaring inconsistencies. All of the characters, settings, and objects all share the same style of artwork. Furthermore, everything moves quite fluidly as a whole.Overall, the Idolmaster Special was definitely funny and worthwhile, but don't expect anything overly meaningful from it. into the more trivial aspects of the idols' daily lives in a way that is much different from the original series.

Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34480/Shokugeki_no_Souma__Ni_no_Sara_OVA,"[""Well these two ova were fun to watch and the enjoyment is guaranteed.The first ova is your typical hot springs trip, where a lot of misunderstandings happen. Beside the top notch fanservice our characters also have a little cooking contest where Erina fulfills her duty as the God Tongue . The comedy is also good i found myself laughing at the end of it so it's worth a watch.The second ova is really a must watch because it's the premise before season 3 and it will help you understand what happened if you haven't read the manga. It focuses on the introduction of the...Elite Ten and the start of the Moon Festival. Despite creating a little tensioned atmosphere between the characters it also doesn't forget its light-hearted  comedy to entertain its audience and depict the characters personality traits and quirks.It explains also a lot of stuff about Elite Ten and their influence in Totsuki Academy so it's damn interesting and you don't wanna miss that.

Not only do they have a lot of character development and foreshadowing (especially the first episode), the second one introduces the Elite Ten in a much more well-paced way. The first episode takes a few scenes from the OVA and doesn't linger too much on it, this OVA goes in much more depth.Story-wise, as I said, it's an essential watch in order to fully grasp some characters and motivations...(especially Momo-senpai who sadly had 0 character development in the first cour of the third season while in the OVA there are a few scenes where she is more fleshed out).In the other aspects like art, animation, sound, etc. it's consistent with the second season.Also, in the second episode the best character in the whole series appears for the first time: Kobayashi Rindou, so that's a 10/10 by itself in my book.

It's a little late to be reviewing these two episodes, but I'm gonna give it a quick go.I had a lot of fun watching these episodes. One of them was the classic hot springs episode you often get with this type of genre, and that'll always be something I'm happy to watch. Food Wars! has an amazing cast of characters written into it. Each one of them comes off as so unique and colorful, so getting to see an episode where everyone could just hang out, relax, compete with each other, and have an all around good time...was refreshing. I don't have too much to say about the second episode besides the fact that it's a great precursor to the third season. It's got some interesting moments that make it worth a watch.As usual, the art and sound within Food Wars! is awesome, so there's no inconsistency there. I don't know if you could say there was a story to these episodes as one was for fun and the other was a bit of a sneak preview of what's to come, but regardless, it'll get you pumped for the following season for sure. was refreshing.

In a show already dominated by fan service scenes of characters getting their clothes blown off and climaxing on the taste of some food they ate, I guess seeing them in a normal situation like an outdoor bath just isn\'t all that special. I am however really a fan of the phrase ""Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga"" showing up on screen whenever something entirely unrelated to cooking is happening, and it should probably be there from now on during the aforementioned clothes exploding off scenes.The second episode...I think serves as an actual continuation of the story and a prologue to the next season, picking up right where season 2 left off. We get the first glimpse of the much talked about Elite 10, aside from the few we\'ve already met, and as of now they serve as a sort of final boss for the narrative. The subversion that their leader, rather than giving off the typical intense personality of a shounen final boss character, is actually a timid dude who has trouble talking to people was pretty funny. It\'s not surprising at all that none of the Elite 10 seem to get along, that\'s pretty typical for groups like this in shounen that all by necessity have big personalities to make them stand out from each other. They seem to be divided into the upper and lower 5, and Souma is characteristically unfazed by how much influence they supposedly have.I\'m looking forward to seeing how he manages to get all of them on his side by the end of next season, which of course he will because he\'s the protagonist.

The first episode is just a common episode: termal baths. I loved that trio and Takumi, so funny! The characters are always well-rounded and faithful to themself, reacting in a realistic way. And the second episode is a plot's episode, cuz it introduce all the 10 best students in the Totsuki and an important battle start. So, both OVAs must be seen. You will enjoy them because are also beautiful and funny. Good art style. "", ""The OVA for the second season of Shokugeki no Souma has two episodes that should be watched in between the second and first season. The first episode is a hot springs episode but the second episode is about the meeting between the autumn election winners and the elite 10. This event is referenced in later seasons so the second episode is a must watch and should have been included in the main anime.The story in the first episode isn't amazing but it's interesting enough for an OVA hot springs episode. The story for the second episode is very relevant to the main anime since...it details the meeting between the autumn election winners and the elite 10. On its own the episode has no significant story but it plays a relatively big deal in season 3.The characters are still the same as in season two but in episode 10 the entire elite 10 is revealed as well.The art, voice acting and music are all the same as in the main anime except for the relatively long post-credits scene in the first episode. This post credits scene is about the time Souma made an egg dish for Erina in the first season but this time with purposefully bad animation and I'm unsure as to why it was added.Overall this OVA and particularly the second episode is worth watching and highly relevant to the storyline. If you want more content even if it isn't relelvant to the main story then the first episode can also be fun to watch. it details the meeting between the autumn election winners and the elite 10.

Shuumatsu Train Doko e Iku?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53356/Shuumatsu_Train_Doko_e_Iku,"[""A man-made creation that has warped the world into a hellish placea phenomenon that transforms humans into something other than human when they reach a certain agea journey of a group of girls on a train through a post-apocalyptic world to find their friend.this anime combines three plot points that could each stand alone as separate stories, yet remarkably, it works.The story revolves around an accident where a 7G network warped reality, turning Earth into a post-apocalyptic world. In the subsequent years, the same accident also caused some humans to transform into animals that can talk. On the other side, a group of...girls discovers that their friend, who is essentially the one responsible for the accident, is still alive. Determined to find her, they embark on a journey by train.The plot sounds like a fever dream, it's basically feels like when you are asleep and having a weird dream yet nobody wakes you up so it goes on and on and on,which also make this anime a very great mystery anime, because not only we don't know what the fck is going on,the characters also don't know what the fuck is going on, and the fact that it's an original story makes it even better.The music and animation add depth to the viewing experience. The portrayal of the world's end in this anime is hauntingly beautiful, conveying a sense of serenity tinged with underlying dread.An original show with a genuinely unique plot, it's definitely worth watching. girls discovers that their friend, who is essentially the one responsible for the accident, is still alive.

Train to the End of the World gives me that feeling, and I haven't felt that in a long time.  This show toes an interesting line because I'd say at this point that it's still...fairly family friendly - but there are a lot of dark undertones, the most obvious in the first episode being the bloody handprints and bullet holes in the armed caravan vehicles.  The art, animation, sound, voice acting - all are superb.  Practically every scene in the first episode would make for a great desktop background.It is dialogue heavy - like Monogatari levels of dialogue heavy.  All of the conversations feel natural and have great flow, and I think they are important for establishing the atmosphere the show is going for, but I know people that cannot handle that.  If there were any reason to dislike the show this would probably be it.I'm very interested in seeing how this goes.  There's a lot of potential for it to go to a very dark place - the clues are certainly there - but even if it doesn't I'm still on board. fairly family friendly - but there are a lot of dark undertones, the most obvious in the first episode being the bloody handprints and bullet holes in the armed caravan vehicles.

In this world, a group of girls take control of a train so that they might travel this ""wonderscape"" and find a lost friend of theirs. As they ride the train from stop to stop, they experience one weird and dangerous encounter after another, seeing what has occurred to the citizens of this altered world. Furthermore, as the plot progresses, the girls slowly learn more and more about the dark secrets behind how-and-why the world has come to be as it is.Now, this premise sounds like a really fun and technically quite simply structured adventure. The show offers the viewers a sorta ""monster of the week""-style story (but with a focus on one or more oddities rather than monsters as such). This is however where problems start to show with the series. The pacing of the show is generally quite fast, which I acknowledge doesn\'t have to be a bad thing, but in the case of ""Train to the End of the World"" it constantly feels like the show is rushing itself from one conversation to another or from one oddity to the next. The show almost never allows itself to settle and truly explore its odd ideas. And when the show occasionally does try to take its time with a scenario, it often does this with some of the least wacky of its ideas (such as spending two episodes on a town of tiny people).This really ""rushing pacing"" also frequently hurts the show\'s emotionally complex scenes. The show very clearly wants to be something more than just a wacky adventure, and thus it often attempts to have deeper scenes, especially in flashbacks to before the ""end of the world---if you will."" And these scenes are indeed also some of the times when the show shines the brightest, but even still, they are rarely allowed much room to breathe before we have to rush on to the next scene----be it serious or silly.Thus, if people will forgive me a reference to a show outside of anime for a moment, it feels like ""Train to the End of the World"" is trying to be something akin to the show ""Adventure Time,"" a show that masterfully balances both serious and silly scenarios. However, it is also a far longer show than ""Train to the End of the World"" is, so I can\'t help but wonder if the problem deep down simply is that the show is too short? Would it have benefited from having a 24-or-so episode run? It is hard to say.In conclusion, ""Train to the End of the World"" is not a bad show in the slightest, but it is a ""busy"" and ""messy"" that seems to struggle with where to put its focus and time, a lot of the time. The show has had a lot of promise since its beginning, something that it has struggled to live up to during the majority of its runtime, but even still it does still seem to be building towards an interesting ending. However, even if the show manages to stick-the-landing, viewed as a whole, I would still only consider it a decent experience.I hope these thoughts have been helpful to any potential reader. strange phenomena.

After all, who doesn't want to connect to the 7G, and warp reality right?Story and characters: 7For starters, I will say that the show at first does take a moment to get used to. You might be thinking 'what on earth' is going on? Why am I watching this? But as the show progresses, you'll want to stick around to see more of it. Which is mainly done by it's pacing, and sweet characters, each layered through their personalities, and what drives them. Even if they don't come across as super amazing characters, but they don't need to be. They're...fit for purpose, and that's all you need to be a good anime. While it's not a stand out by any means. But because of those elements, it then expands the story out more for you, and you'll want to learn more about the mystery of WHY this is happening, and WHY this happened. Something we grasp and learn bit by bit as each and every episode progresses. Our four girls aren't the only main characters however, they're also joined by a mix of wild bunch, and sweet characters that fill out the casting quite nicely.Art and sound: 8This is where the true meat and potatoes of the whole production comes in for me. While we've got a stellar story to follow, and be invested into. here we've got quite a creative direction in terms of it's quality, and production. It's as if throughout it's mystery, they wanted to produce such a weird and colourful world, that much like other shows, you'll remember for it's aesthetics, and pallet more than anything. Wich isn't a dig at the story, but more there is a lot of creative juices with it's production of art style. Matched with a great sound quality, that really blends all well together.Shuumatsu Train is quite an experience venture, filled with wonder and interest. With cute girls to boot. What's not to love?

Give it a go!"", 'A cute anime of girls doing things in a strange world filled with strange things like a society of beastmen hmm... it reminds me of ""Blue Archive"" from this season but luckily it is much better, although not as good as people say....📢 The story takes place in a world ravaged by ""7G"", which deformed everything we know and made it a mixture of various things. In this world there live young girls who are one of the few who are still human.One day, they track down their missing friend and use the train to set off on an adventure to find her....It is mostly a very loose story with anime girls who, in a post-apocalyptic world, in the most extreme situations, behave and look as if they just went somewhere on vacation and forgot to take off their school uniforms, little girls left with animals even though 2 years after the start of the apocalypse they should not  be obvious how people turned into animals will behave xDBut from the beginning...We start the story with the scene of the beginning of the 7G apocalypse, then we fast forward 2 years and we have a very quick and somewhat bland introduction to the actual story, where, using exposition in dialogues, everything that happened is explained to us in a rather naive way.  after the launch of 7G, the creators set a very fast pace in the first episode just to send the girls as quickly as possible on the journey that this anime is about, i.e. the strange place (train station) of the week.After the first episode, we set off on an atmospheric, mysterious and chaotic journey into the unknown in a world full of various strange things.But as I mentioned, the plot is a strange story and place of the week, most of the stories seem to have an interesting general idea but the execution is worse, where the stories are more or less written in a stupid way, and the pace of these stories increases more and more from episode to episode,  the worst thing is when we arrive at a new place where we rush as fast as possible, as if the author had an interesting idea but didn\'t want to develop it and wanted to move on to the next station where there would be similar chaos and haste.The mentioned stations, like the levels of the abyss in Made in Abyss, have their own quirks, as if the landscapes through which our heroines come are so completely different from each other, very creative and thanks to the fact that 7G has deformed the world, everything can be explained, the author can go to the limits of absurdity  and all these things don\'t have to be consistent, but just diverse and strange.This is also a minus because in MiA everything was logical and it was better to watch because you saw the sense in it all and it was dosed appropriately so as not to make you immune to new amazing things, which made it more pleasant to discover the world and here, hmm... just with time.  it stops making an impression and the next random thing is acknowledged with a simple ""OK"" xDBut in fact, despite so many strange and creative things, this anime mainly decides to explore the most clichéd motifs, such as zombies, and ignores the most unusual ones, as if it didn\'t have some more interesting idea for them, apart from the fact that it was supposed to be strange, it was much more interesting  to know what\'s going on with these goats in the grass than zoombie, i.e. an ultra-creative anime but not entirely.The characters... are very cool, characteristic and have a lot of funny interactions, they often talk about seemingly unimportant things, which allows you to get more into the stories BUT ultimately they don\'t fit into this world, in general, the character relationships sometimes seem to be an unnecessary addition and in this strange world, as if  in the world of secrets and all this, we get something so ordinary, their relationships are ordinary, as if taken out of an ordinary school anime.I think that a post-apocalyptic series in which the characters are no different in terms of relationships, conflicts and behavior from the regular school series makes little sense and seems stupid, e.g. the characters will allow their offended friend to go somewhere in the middle of the night, forgetting that it is ultra-dangerous  world.I think this anime has a lot of problems, but unlike the crap this season, it tries to be something special.Rating:⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❌❌❌❌ It is mostly a very loose story with anime girls who, in a post-apocalyptic world, in the most extreme situations, behave and look as if they just went somewhere on vacation

dosed appropriately so as not to make you immune to new amazing things, which made it more pleasant to discover the world and here, hmm... just with time.  it stops making an impression and the next random thing is acknowledged with a simple ""OK"" xDBut in fact, despite so many strange and creative things, this anime mainly decides to explore the most clichéd motifs, such as zombies, and ignores the most unusual ones, as if it didn\'t have some more interesting idea for them, apart from the fact that it was supposed to be strange, it was much more interesting  to know what\'s going on with these goats in the grass than zoombie, i.e. an ultra-creative anime but not entirely.The characters... are very cool, characteristic and have a lot of funny interactions, they often talk about seemingly unimportant things, which allows you to get more into the stories BUT ultimately they don\'t fit into this world, in general, the character relationships sometimes seem to be an unnecessary addition and in this strange world, as if  in the world of secrets and all this, we get something so ordinary, their relationships are ordinary, as if taken out of an ordinary school anime.I think that a post-apocalyptic series in which the characters are no different in terms of relationships, conflicts and behavior from the regular school series makes little sense and seems stupid, e.g. the characters will allow their offended friend to go somewhere in the middle of the night, forgetting that it is ultra-dangerous  world.I think this anime has a lot of problems, but unlike the crap this season, it tries to be something special.Rating:⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❌❌❌❌', 'A mesmerizing blend of breathtaking visuals and an intriguing storyline that defies expectations. This anime, with its fever dream animation style, transports viewers into a world where reality bends and twists in the most captivating manner imaginable.At its core lies an extremely interesting premise that immediately draws you in. The concept of this, sort of,  ""time reversal"", when it comes to city turning back to nature and the transformation of individuals into animals is both fascinating and thought-provoking. It\'s a narrative direction that feels refreshingly original and can be very relevant if we are looking into what has come of our technology, even in...the span of the last 5 years and how fast it\'s evolving. A scary, but an interesting thought.It\'s a thematic journey full of melancholia that echoes the sentiments of acclaimed series like \'A Place Further Than the Universe\' and \'Girls\' Last Tour, yet maintains its own unique identity.Moreover, I find myself eagerly anticipating the further development of the story. the span of the last 5 years and how fast it\'s evolving.

The main characters embarked on an unprepared, resource-scarce journey, yet they still joke and chatter like regular school girls. Maybe that’s the side effect of a 7G as well? lolAfter 3 episodes, the world gradually revealed, and viewers were allowed - or guided - to speculate the metaphorical aspect of the story. Like most road movies, the journey is...an instrument for MC’ encounters and growth. Each station has its own way of mutating local people (as depicted in the map shown in ep.2), and these mutations seem to represent a form of lifestyle. The MC’s task is to be observers and experience each stations’ lifestyle. Each episode feels like an essay by the creators, making comments on different attitudes towards life, which were exaggerated by the end-of-world situation. It still felt very realistic - I’m sure most people can think of someone around them living in a similar way, even in our modern world.The character visuals weren’t the best; the design looked simple and movements are often weird since ep.1. But it didn’t bother me, as apparently visual is not the focus here. Background visuals are beautiful; who would hate a deserted but colorful rural view?Where will this anime go? So far the metaphors were very straightforward, which was somewhat unsettling. After all, I don’t want to watch a creator monologue preaching obvious ideas. However, according to director Mizushima Tsutomu, the first 3 episodes were designed to be simple on purpose; starting from ep.4 it will head towards chaos - really looking forward to it!

The reality-warped post-apocalypse setting serves the absurdist elements of the narrative really well. While our bubbly, young leads feel fairly archetypal, there are enough inklings of further character growth etched out through fun banter and some contextual gags that flesh out the world a bit. (The train conductor who\'s granted five minutes of sanity a day is a genuinely ""wtf"" concept that warrants a good laugh.) The...journey to find a missing friend feels appreciatively familiar. Plus, the anime\'s lighthearted, almost ""slice-of-life"" tone, already distinguishes this from most other post-apocalyptic media that tend to view the characters and setting through more cynical eyes. Everything, from people turning into animals to braindead fungi, feels like a fun mashup of past concepts within the genre. All of it rolled into a cutesy, wholesome package that has you solidly along for the ride. journey to find a missing friend feels appreciatively familiar.

Sugar Apple Fairy Tale,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49980/Sugar_Apple_Fairy_Tale,"[""I have arrived in defense of one of my favorite releases of the season. Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is dramatic, angsty, beautiful and SO shoujo.As someone who is a massive shoujo consumer, be it in manga or anime form, I can with confidence say that it has been a while since we got a shoujo adaptation that had a big budget and where the studio didn't seem to give up on it halfway through the season. This is a massive plus in my book because shoujo deserves GOOD adaptations as much the shounen and seinen demographic (don't even get me started on josei because we...live in the trenches).The story of Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is very dramatic but at the same time also very slice of life. Personally, I think that they balanced these two very well. There are some extremely annoying characters in this (Bridget, I hate you so bad), but also some very lovely characters. Our MC Ann is a flawed protagonist; she's a hypocrite at times, she's idealistic and she's very stubborn. These characteristics, however, are what make her interesting and multidimensional. We still have a lot to learn about Shall, as of now he's mostly a mystery to both the audience and Ann. I'm excited to see more of him in July. The side characters are less developed, but they all have their own quirks and motivations that we slowly see throughout the season. Mythrill Lid Pod might have been my favorite character of this series, his presence is delightful, and he brings lots of happiness to the show.The art and color palette are beautiful. The animation is smooth, and it is one of the best we have had for shoujo in recent years, J.C. Staff did an excellent job.Certain aspects of this show, such the slavery, are for sure problematic. Nevertheless, there's also commentary on these topics and they aren't just brushed off and never brought up again. Most characters are very flawed and the villains are sometimes just too corny. I do like how the story touches on e.g. sexism and misogyny, even if it is a fantasy setting.[SPOILERS FOR EP 12] The finale was definitely bittersweet, I may or may not have shed a few tears. This just shows that I have grown to really love Ann and Shall these past few months. I'm going to be honest, if this show didn't receive a 2nd cour it would have affected my opinions on it a lot. For now, I'm hopeful and look forward to their reunion. Based on what we have seen from Ann we can definitely expect her to not give up on Shall!Overall: I can 100% recommend this to fellow shoujo & josei fans and if you are new to the demographic, I hope you can watch this without bias. I'm so happy that the shoujo demographic has received a worthy adaptation, and I can't wait for the return of this show! live in the trenches).The story of Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is very dramatic but at the same time also very slice of life.

Even if it packs a good number of punches to boot.Story and characters: 7Lets put it this way. What if Shield Hero was more light and colourful, then you've got Sugar Fairy. While also still having some heavy elements, and badass moments through out. But what really makes things shine, is the relationship of the characters that is within the show.It's the glue that holds the whole story together. Even ones that are more loud, really add more to the whole atmosphere, so...it doesn't come off as a bore fest at all. As if the active direction and chemistry, really pushes it forward. It's very smart, and well done.You've got Ann, a girl who is very determined in her goals, and is very sweet. You've also got Shall, whom is very stand offish, all coming from his natural warrior spirit, and dislike for the current system. Only leading to him getting ahead on Ann. A connection and relationship, that'll keep you wondering if they will ever fully get along. Or even further, if the series goes in that direction.It's why I stated it feels like a really good up and company adventure,like one you'd play in a RPG. Where you see your party grow, and develop. They bond with each other, even if it takes a long while in order to achieve such. It really makes you want to see what happens next. Will Ann finally achieve her dreams, that we now root for. Will Shall finally accept her properly. Or is a further twist in store. It's the kind of writing for our characters, and story progression, that really ticks things along. If you're looking for a good adventure anime with a sweet goal in mind, then you're in the right place.Art and sound:9The biggest highlight for me when it comes to the show, is the incredible art design, and quality of how it looks.The fairy wings just look so well animated and pretty.Not to mention the mix of sounds and looks when it comes to more intense scenes, night scenes, the works. A lot of care of detail that has gone into the whole product. Even the look of the characters looks really well detailed, and colourful. Great to look at.Sugar Apple Fairy is as sweet as it sounds.

Let me tell you, as someone who has actually read the released light novels and has been following this story closely, you are in for a treat!!Is it anything revolutionary? No. Is it still a wholesome story of growth, resilience, grief, friendship, love, survival...yes!! Also...does it glorify slave owning? Absolutely not. From the first episode/chapter Anne has numerous conversations with others and herself on the reality of the world - humans have enslaved fairies. She always...voices her discontentment of this, and has always come to bat for fairies when no one else would...risking her safety in the process. She does purchase Challe, a fairy, though is firm on giving him his freedom once he escorts her to the city. Even so, she does not treat him as a slave, and in later parts of the story Challe reassures readers that he never felt as such while working for her. Still, Anne detests that she had to employ Challe. I just wanted to clear that up. This story is everything BUT a glorification of slavery.STORYAnyway...while the story has some darker themes to it, I would consider it pretty light & fluffy for the most part. I don\'t think the author ever intended to create something super complex or melodramatic. This is important going into it, and why certain things may not receive the fleshing out that you would like. In the light novels the plot goes by pretty quickly, and the anime is following suit.It is pretty heartwarming and wholesome. I have enjoyed all the bits I\'ve read/seen so far. I will say the anime follows it decently, with some tweaks here and there (so far). I definitely recommend picking up the novels though, because you get to see more of what Anne and Challe are thinking in certain situations - swapping POVs at times.Upon first glance, an anime about making candy seems pretty boring but I found the candy making aspect of it to be interesting! I can\'t say I\'ve seen anything that has the same concept as this one.CHARACTERSLove love love!!! Anne is super cute, independent, reliable, hardworking, strong, intelligent, everything I love in a MC. Challe is your typical, ""black hair stoic and stone cold"" type but it\'s always fun to see that trope warm up as the story progresses. His personality also makes sense once you learn more of his backstory, and the reality of fairies in this world. Mithril would normally be sorta annoying in other stories, but I love him!!ARTThe art is pretty good! The animation isn\'t anything amazing, but it still respects the original artwork and is exactly how I pictured it to be.I can\'t say much else because the anime isn\'t finished yet and I\'m unsure how far into the novels they will cover for season 1, but I really do recommend this one.

I will edit this review once season 1 finishes.', 'This show was a colourful and vibrant fantasy that had some good ideas, but also showed us another shoujo series where the romance just isn’t all that interesting. Sure, I could go for the low-hanging fruit and criticize the slavery themes, or the age gap in the romance, but I’m not going to focus on that. Instead, I want to highlight how modern shoujo anime follow a very similar formula that just isn’t all that engaging.Granted, I’m not very familiar with shoujo anime, so if you disagree with what I say, feel free to enlighten me on the subject, but from the ones I have...seen, there’s always a somewhat ditzy female protagonist, who ends up liking a “pretty-looking” male protagonist. Now, I get the aim of shoujo anime is to get us to “squee” when there’s a bit of fan service, but sometimes, I feel that the fan service is quite over-done, to the point where it just detracts from the fantasy elements and world building that the time could have been used to do instead.Another problem that it has is incredibly shallow villains, whose very existence is just to trip the protagonist up with no real substantial reason whatsoever. For example, in this show, for anyone who has watched it, knows that Jonas is a very hated character by many. The reason why he became the antagonist was so dumb and shallow, which only made it worse. The other villains just don’t have motives other than being discriminatory or rude for no apparent reason other than sexism.The other problem I find with modern shoujo anime is the contrived misunderstandings, as many of times, the “drama” revolves around the protagonist seeing their love interest in an “out-of-context” situation, and get down in the dumps because of that, even though they have no idea what is going on. It just doesn’t feel like drama that goes anywhere, rather, it gets solved quickly, and doesn’t feel fulfilling when it inevitably gets solved. This show has these issues as well.With the problems out of the way, I also found this show to be quite rich in world-building and creative in some ways, with building sugar confections as the main theme. Ann Halford, the main protagonist, strives to be a silver sugar master, like her late mother, and seeing her improve her craft and believe in herself while facing hurdles was nice to see. The backgrounds and colour palettes really give a sense of a fantasy atmosphere, and it had some beautiful shots. Some of the animation was a bit limited, but it didn’t take away from the plot. Overall, the production was not bad at all. I do wish the soundtrack was a bit more noticeable though.There were some questionable themes around slavery that I must mention, but I won’t dwell on it. In this kingdom, for many years, humans enslaved fairies by keeping one of their wings. The other main protagonist, Shall Fen Shall, is a warrior fairy, and gets bought by Ann to be her bodyguard. As you can expect, there were some romantic developments as well. I’m glad the slavery aspect became less of a theme as we went along, and it was more of a fantasy/adventure show more than anything else.Overall, there were some highs and lows, with the animation and world building being the highs, and the characters being a bit of a weak part, especially the antagonists. It’s as sweet as its namesake, but my only wish is that future shoujo anime get a little more creative with how the drama unfolds. seen, there’s always a somewhat ditzy female protagonist, who ends up liking a “pretty-looking” male protagonist.

This is a show of suffering. It should be called Sugar Apple Fairy HellThe show sells itself as quite a laid back and feel good anime, but at the end, I feel everything but this. I'm writing the review because it was a bitter ending, not sweet in the slightest, nor warranted.To start, characters who had committed irreperable deeds had been kept relevant throughout the show. There were constant feelings throughout of revenge and vengeance, but by the very people who were the perpetrators. Even the MC, who had suffered throughout the show,...never showed signs of revenge, and if they were even slightly sane, probably a few annoying characters might be dead or in jail.The main character is extremely spineless when it comes to others, she battles to save them from simple situations, yet when she is in peril herself, overcomes insane feats, (maybe because she has the support of many and can't do anything alone)Anyways, the show has some nice points throughout, but one would expect it to mainly leave people feeling bitter never showed signs of revenge, and if they were even slightly sane, probably a few annoying characters might be dead or in jail.The main character is extremely spineless when it comes to others, she battles to save them from simple situations, yet when she is in peril herself, overcomes insane feats, (maybe because she has the support of many and can't do anything alone)Anyways, the show has some nice points throughout, but one would expect it to mainly leave people feeling bitter"", 'I’m not really good at writing reviews, so I made a little list of factors, which made me fell in love with this anime:-\tinteresting and deeply developed world-\tyou want to keep learning more about fairies and the art of silver sugar-\talso the anime explains everything you might want to know-\tmain character, Ann Halford, is very likeable and watching her makes you cross your fingers whenever she faces difficult challenges-\tcharacter designs are pretty, especially main characters-\tbeautiful art style, fitting fantasy vibe – sometimes there are lower quality drawings/anatomy proportions moments, but it happens in majority of anime series and I don’t feel bugged by this-\timmersive fantasy...atmosphere-\tyou’re not bored, but also not overwhelmed by the plot – good relaxation optionYou may want to watch it, if you liked: Akagami no Shirayuki-hime.

Without spoiling anything, alongside the main storyline, there is some rather deep commentary on the relationships between the Humans and the Fairies of this world, as well as some surprisingly hard-hitting backstories for a couple of our main characters. Not one scene so far...has felt forced, and even if the overall story isn’t the most original thing I’ve seen, the characters and artwork in this show are more than enough to make up for its weaker points.Even with just 6 episodes out as of now, I can tell that Sugar Apple Fairy Tale will become one of my favourites from 2023.

They hardly get any decent adaptations of recent properties and really have to either get into manga or settle for less then stellar works. But SAFT is really bad, to the point of being indefensible. Yes, Im talking about the slavery shit.Its an unwritten rule in these types of fantasy shows that if for some reason there is slavery its very downplayed or the slavery feels nothing like real world slavery. However, SAFT goes out of its way to present slavery in a very realistic way with the fairies being an underclass, the property...value that's assigned to it, the violence inflected against them, the way in which even decent humans can end up embodying the society's privileges when certain situations arise... Its uncomfortable. In a better show this would be fleshed upon and make for an interesting fantasy show about prejudices and societal hierarches. But here its played dead fucking straight with no meaningful commentary. To the point they just end up treating the situation as mundane, and inadvertency condones slavery through its carelessness.While this show is not going to being back slavery, this is the kind of show that alienates communities and ethnicities that still feel the effects of slavery, specifically black anime fans. Yes, the fairies are not a one to one analogy for black slaves in the US but how are black fans supposed to feel safe and welcome when this show just shits on the system that they still feel the echo's of in their everyday life?In conclusion, the anime community needs to be harsher on these kind of shows. This kind of explicit depiction of slavery while not challenging the system it presents shouldn't be expected. And for the anime industry, we deserve better shoujo then this. There is no shortage of great fantasy shoujo out there, and the market is ready for it. But do better.2/10 value that's assigned to it, the violence inflected against them, the way in which even decent humans can end up embodying the society's privileges when certain situations arise... Its uncomfortable. In a better show this would be fleshed upon and make for an interesting fantasy show about prejudices and societal hierarches. But here its played dead fucking straight with no meaningful commentary. To the point they just end up treating the situation as mundane, and inadvertency condones slavery through its carelessness.While this show is not going to being back slavery, this is the kind of show that alienates communities and ethnicities that still feel the effects of slavery, specifically black anime fans. Yes, the fairies are not a one to one analogy for black slaves in the US but how are black fans supposed to feel safe and welcome when this show just shits on the system that they still feel the echo's of in their everyday life?In conclusion, the anime community needs to be harsher on these kind of shows. This kind of explicit depiction of slavery while not challenging the system it presents shouldn't be expected. And for the anime industry, we deserve better shoujo then this.

I like how she actually has a goal and isn't just another passive character.

The existence of the upcoming season 2 here in a couple months is the only reason why I\'m giving this show a 9 and not giving this show a 1.The reason for this is that the last episode p much ends in the worst way possible without outright just killing all the main characters. It\'s too jarring and too forced a breakpoint. I don\'t have so referred to as ""PADS"" after watching this, I feel like finding a pitchfork.Everything else is a roller coaster of ups and downs. People you thought were one way...completely turning inside out. Many times. It goes both ways at least.I enjoyed watching the mc overcome adversity that unfortunately comes her way constantly the entire show.

The coloring is gorgeous, the fantasy aesthetic is immaculate, and the promise of a healthy dose of drama simmers underneath. Romance! Fairies! Candy making! Surely a winning formula.However, this deceptively pretty candy apple is laced with some less-than-sweet flavors. Do they enhance the flavor, or make the dessert unbearably bitter? The answer is ultimately personal and not one-size-fits-all(-tastebuds).Story: 3/10It took me several tries over a few seasonal cours to make it to the end of <i>Sugar Apple Fairy Tale's</i> scant 12-episode run, because the protagonist never catches a...break. And I mean never: every instance of Ann finally attaining her goals is immediately countered by a biting setback. Before long, I found myself wincing with every instance gone right, because it meant something else just went horribly wrong.Some viewers eat up this kind of melodrama, but I find it very difficult to continue watching when there is no emotional catharsis. Ann is never allowed to celebrate in her successes, and it becomes a painful watch when failure is waiting around every corner with a sledgehammer.It's unbelievable how dead-set the world is on making Ann's (and Shall's and Mythrill's) life miserable, from obvious plot beats to contrivances, right down to the gradually-revealed world building of the tradition of silver sugar makers. There's a word for this kind of story: misery porn.Despite this, pacing is fine.I'd also be remiss not to mention the slave-to-lover trope present in this story. It is an ick to many, and something the audience deserves to be informed of.Art: 9/10I was right about one thing in my initial assessment: the art never did disappoint. The characters have gorgeous colors, and the backgrounds even moreso. And the sugar confectioneries! One point knocked off for lack of sakuga (the animation is never particularly brilliant), but the consistency of the show is nevertheless impressive.Sound: 7/10The opening is everything I wanted from this show and more. The ending is a bit more generic. I didn't make much note of the in-show background music. The voice acting is well-casted.Character: 5/10This show goes out of its way to make you despise much of the supporting cast. The world of silver sugar confectioneries is ruthless, and so too are characters not above doing absolutely anything in the name of getting ahead of the pack. This specifically means fucking over Ann and her companions 90% of the time, but honestly? I respect it. I respect the commitment to writing characters who are willing to get their hands dirty, characters willing to weaponize any tool, characters who are full of vile intent and willing to be horrible people to get their way. They are infuriating, but they make the show happen.Unfortunately, Ann herself has little going for her. Outside her primary goal of becoming a silver sugar master like her late mother, she herself is quite bland once you take away the endless setback parade. I feel like I know more about Shall's personality than Ann's, and he's the resident mysterious guy of few words.I would have liked to see more time spent on Ann and Shall (either together or separately) outside the constant melodrama.Enjoyment: 4/10This was a deceptively difficult watch. The production value is good, but each episode is an emotionally infuriating affair. There is no catharsis. The ending felt on-point to me as a microcosm of the show as a whole: bittersweet, with resolution in name only (though there is a season two that I have not yet watched; are you feeling lucky enough to watch 12 more episodes for a chance at resolution roulette?).Who should watch <i>Sugar Apple Fairy Tale</i>?If this review hasn't put you off the show yet, you're likely to find more deliciousness in this sugar apple than sourness.If you like the tropes I've outlined so far, you'll love this show.If you're only here for the shoujo vibes, this show is going to emotionally drag you across the ground like a sack of bruised apples.Overall, 6/10. break.

I have been hyped for this show ever since I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint, it\'s easily my highlight of every week and I get so excited to see the newest episode every Friday. So why do I think this show is so awesome? Well, a few reasons~Art/Animation: An absolute 10/10 for me. I...was a bit worried at first when I heard that JC Staff was animating this since they\'re kind of a shit studio but they really knocked it out of the park here, the colors are bright and vibrant, and the character designs are all great, plenty of pretty guys and girls to look at, and the backgrounds look very painting-like, it reminds me of something from a storybook or fairytale, which is very fitting with the theme of the show.Story: I am familiar with this story somewhat because I have read the manga, and so far it hits all the beats perfectly and brings the story to life very well. It\'s a simple plot, nothing exactly mind-blowing, but it keeps me interested and every new episode has me excited for the next. The idea of candy making might sound boring to most, but the adventure and fantastical elements helps keep it enjoyable to watch. I love the mix of cute and sparkly with a darker and deeper layer of more complex themes beneath, because I enjoy shoujo with a little bit of bite.Characters: Anne is a cinnamon roll, Shall is a badass, Jonas is an incel that deserves to burn in hell. Going beyond that, all of the characters are good and serve their roles well. The dynamic between Anne and Shall is great, and I\'m very much looking forward to seeing how their current relationship will evolve into a closer friendship, and eventually romance~Also I want to address one of the stupid criticisms I see a lot, that being that this anime glorifies slavery. How on earth did that conclusion happen? Did we even watch the same show? It\'s incredibly obvious that glorifying slavery is far from what the anime is trying to do with the way it is portrayed. Anne treats Shall as an equal despite everyone else\'s pushes to the contrary, and while she is a bit idealist, it\'s obvious that she doesn\'t view the fairies as slaves, and wants them to be considered equals with humans. So yeah, anyone claiming how this anime ""glorifies slavery"" is just plain ass stupid imo. Besides, no one seemed to have an issue with the slavery themes in Shield Hero which was handled a lot worse, so I don\'t see why this all of all things is suddenly a problem. Shoujo anime are allowed to tell darker stories and show darker themes, not every female-targeted anime has to be uwu fluffy high school romance.In conclusion, I fell in love with this show from the start and I strongly recommend it to fellow shoujo lovers, fantasy and romance enjoyers, or those who are looking for something different from the usual seasonal bloat of battle shounen, isekai, and school rom-coms. was a bit worried at first when I heard that JC Staff was animating this since they\'re kind of a shit studio but they really knocked it out of the park here, the colors are bright and vibrant, and the character designs are all great, plenty of pretty guys and girls to look at, and the backgrounds look very painting-like, it reminds me of something from a storybook or fairytale, which is very fitting with the theme of the show.Story: I am familiar with this story somewhat because I have read the manga, and so far it hits all the beats perfectly and brings the story to life very well.

Maybe this will help you a little more to determine whether to watch this series or later to even continue it. (But warning, really heavy SPOILER alert!)Story 6.5/10The fact that I watched this series within 2-3 days says a lot about the quality (for me that’s basically binge-watching, since it usually takes me more days or even a couple of weeks to complete a show). Right when it started I was wondering why I didn’t...watch it earlier. I’ve seen bits here and there on social media (mainly fanarts) but no spoilers (compliment for the fanbase for that because it’s usually not that way) but I didn’t really know what I would get myself into and starting it I genuinely enjoyed it to a point it became addictive. Does this anime use a lot of cliches and common tropes (which may or may not made me roll my eyes too?). Yes, but I don’t mind because of the way it’s included and the setting. Unfortunately nowadays you have two options when it comes to shoujo 1.) not at all because it seems to be dying or 2.) trash. It’s been a while an anime made me actually feel something and you could tell a lot of love went into the writing (not that it’s perfect or flawless but I’ll get to this). There were some parts that were unnecessary but I’ll take it because I truly enjoyed the story (mostly) because of the world-building. It’s such an interesting concept. Especially how the fairies are born, how it is connected to their powers. And I didn’t even mind they were touching some darker themes (such as slavery) but sometimes I wish they would have explored it further or even handled it better (Anne was basically the only one speaking up against it. Not even the royal family seems to care despite their background with fairies). So that’s something I’d wish for the next season rather than all the other political stuff (and the misogyny which came out of nowhere. They should have hinted at it more in the beginning).That’s where I have to express some critique because if it wouldn’t have been for the ending of this season I would have at least rated the story one point higher. But as much as I hated that it happened and how it made me feel, I’d have felt it’s a perfect cliffhanger. My problem, however, isn’t about the fact the story took this turn, it’s more about HOW they did it (it would have messed with me so much watching this and not knowing if there was a second season TT___TT). That’s where I couldn’t overlook the flaws and plot-holes the writings had at times. Up to this point I didn’t mind because the enjoyment was still there. Until they messed up (although it might be like this in the source material as well). Because they made sure we would know how fairies would be able to distinguish the silver sugar based on how it’s made and who made it. It was even demonstrated in the last episode. Why didn’t Challe simply go to the most obvious suspect and try his silver sugar? I’m well aware no one would have believed them but every other character gets away with doing stuff behind their backs but they can’t retrieve Anne’s sugar any other way? Also the fact how quickly Challe gave in to Bridget (or the fact he even suggested it) didn’t make any sense. Yes, I’m well aware they wanted to demonstrate how much he cared for Anne and wanted her dream to come true, but come on! It wasn’t like they were really backed into a corner so there was no other way out. Also very convenient for Bridget that she witnessed the crime and knew exactly who took it (also they even stated there’s a chance the culprit would have gotten rid of it but they didn’t know. It’s also the other way around. How did Bridget know that? Therefore to Challe this deal could still have meant Anne would lose her chance at the competition). Here is what would have worked slightly better: That Bridget was behind this all along and therefore would have been able to threaten Challe because she made sure no one would be able to find it without her help except for it being close at hand at the competition (now that I think about it there’s still a chance she was part of it but it wouldn’t change the sloppy execution). It would have made more sense since Challe would have foreshadowed it when he told Bridget she’d need to steal his wing to get him. Not to mention how much it bothered me that all the people who knew about Anne’s talent didn’t vouch for her. Too easy and flawed. Again not because of the fact it had to happened, but the execution was done poorly in my opinion.Characters 7.5/10Let’s start with our protagonist Anne. She’s nice, sweet, kind, hard-working, talented and what I value a lot in main characters: determined. Sure, sometimes she can be a little naive too but she clearly has a heart of gold and I mostly adore her. Personally I don’t understand how anyone can be annoyed with her. While her reasons and actions are not always understandable at first glance, I think it makes it even more refreshing. And we really need more female protagonists who are stronger in a different sense than simply for their physical strength. Aside from her talent she is relatable and never gives up and most of all: she cares about others and her actions prove this.Challe, on the other hand, might be the complete opposite of her. At first I was skeptical with him. Then again, given the circumstances and the fact he had been enslaved for 70 years makes it understandable. And he slowly warms up to Anne and they become friends and even develop romantic feelings for each other. Personally I don’t even mind their age gap. Mostly because I think fantasy always makes it easier to swallow especially when we consider how different the time frames are for both: humans and fairies (as shown by the fact some of the fairies only live for a couple of years). If we’d compare this to their life span maybe they are not that far apart in age. I really like their dynamic and chemistry and there are many cute (but also earnest) moments between them. The pace of the romance itself is slow but while I enjoy watching them together I would have wished for us to see more of their bonding instead of the kind of sudden shift we got. It’s probably due to a big time skip of 9 months. That’s the only aspect that might have needed more attention (even if the story wouldn’t have moved forward). It would also have made the ending more effective and emotional (it still was in a way but personally I feel like they could have done better in this regard as well).The supporting characters are either great (like Cat, Keith, Benjamin and I’m not sure about Hugh), while others are annoying (like Thriller… ehm Mythrill Rid Pod – how do you NOT want to get a nickname for that?). And then there are the characters you absolutely have to dislike. Such as Cathy, Sammy and Bridget – with the latter one being unreasonably full of contempt for Anne (because she’s hardworking in a craft usually only men pursue) and she falls in love with Challe at first sight for his looks (while having a finance. Not that he’s any better though). But who really takes the cake (and I swear having to see him like every episode really tested my patience) is Jonas. I didn’t like him in the beginning and I was right for that. Still I didn’t expect him to backstab Anne (like he attempted to KILL her). I didn’t see this coming and I have to give the writes credit for this because just WOW... If I ever make a list of the “Top 10 worst anime betrayals” he’ll be in my top 3. Even the fact his uncle is a unlikable character as well and prefers his student over his nephew doesn’t change the fact that Jonas is spineless, horrible and even worse. Which makes me conclude the characters are written well enough to be considered on their own. At times they could be fleshed out even more but it’s a solid basis.Animation 9/10It can’t be denied that the animation is pretty, especially when it comes to the silver sugar sculptures. Also with the setting you really feel like you could get absorbed into this fantasy world. It kind of reminded me of some high quality otome games I’ve played (or would like to play…).Overall 7/10While the anime is predictable at times there were moments that really caught me off guard. Not many shows manage to pull me in like this right from the start. It’s especially hard to find good and well written fantasy romance animes. It has all the ingredients it needs so something beautiful can be created (much like with the silver sugar). Especially the world-buildig is pretty good. However, this might be the problem since sometimes it seems like the writers focused too much on that instead of developing characters or their relationships further. But a good story needs both equally balanced. Personally I don’t mind the use of cliches if implemented in a refreshing way. The anime did that. At the same time causing some misunderstandings and using common tropes without really thinking it through or considering its own lore. But I’m not blaming it on the writers since it’s still pretty good. The focus of it, however, might be subjective. You can never please everyone but at times it felt it’s exactly what the story tried to do and therefore it could feel more mediocre than it actually is. If it wouldn’t have been for the execution of the ending I feel like l’d have given it a little higher rating. It’s still a beautiful anime and I’m excited to watch the second season. The last fantasy romance anime that pulled me in like this was probably “Hakushaku to Yousei” so I have much anticipation for what’s to come. I’m not sure if I could recommend it to everyone but if you want to watch a cute romance with two main characters pretty much starting out as enemies (or kind of), with an excellent world-building and a dreamy look then you’ll enjoy this. Now enjoy your (un)healthy dose of “Sugar Apple Fairy Tale”. watch it earlier.

Sure, sometimes she can be a little naive too but she clearly has a heart of gold and I mostly adore her. Personally I don’t understand how anyone can be annoyed with her. While her reasons and actions are not always understandable at first glance, I think it makes it even more refreshing. And we really need more female protagonists who are stronger in a different sense than simply for their physical strength. Aside from her talent she is relatable and never gives up and most of all: she cares about others and her actions prove this.Challe, on the other hand, might be the complete opposite of her. At first I was skeptical with him. Then again, given the circumstances and the fact he had been enslaved for 70 years makes it understandable. And he slowly warms up to Anne and they become friends and even develop romantic feelings for each other. Personally I don’t even mind their age gap. Mostly because I think fantasy always makes it easier to swallow especially when we consider how different the time frames are for both: humans and fairies (as shown by the fact some of the fairies only live for a couple of years). If we’d compare this to their life span maybe they are not that far apart in age. I really like their dynamic and chemistry and there are many cute (but also earnest) moments between them. The pace of the romance itself is slow but while I enjoy watching them together I would have wished for us to see more of their bonding instead of the kind of sudden shift we got. It’s probably due to a big time skip of 9 months. That’s the only aspect that might have needed more attention (even if the story wouldn’t have moved forward). It would also have made the ending more effective and emotional (it still was in a way but personally I feel like they could have done better in this regard as well).The supporting characters are either great (like Cat, Keith, Benjamin and I’m not sure about Hugh), while others are annoying (like Thriller… ehm Mythrill Rid Pod – how do you NOT want to get a nickname for that?). And then there are the characters you absolutely have to dislike. Such as Cathy, Sammy and Bridget – with the latter one being unreasonably full of contempt for Anne (because she’s hardworking in a craft usually only men pursue) and she falls in love with Challe at first sight for his looks (while having a finance. Not that he’s any better though). But who really takes the cake (and I swear having to see him like every episode really tested my patience) is Jonas. I didn’t like him in the beginning and I was right for that. Still I didn’t expect him to backstab Anne (like he attempted to KILL her). I didn’t see this coming and I have to give the writes credit for this because just WOW... If I ever make a list of the “Top 10 worst anime betrayals” he’ll be in my top 3. Even the fact his uncle is a unlikable character as well and prefers his student over his nephew doesn’t change the fact that Jonas is spineless, horrible and even worse. Which makes me conclude the characters are written well enough to be considered on their own. At times they could be fleshed out even more but it’s a solid basis.Animation 9/10It can’t be denied that the animation is pretty, especially when it comes to the silver sugar sculptures. Also with the setting you really feel like you could get absorbed into this fantasy world. It kind of reminded me of some high quality otome games I’ve played (or would like to play…).Overall 7/10While the anime is predictable at times there were moments that really caught me off guard. Not many shows manage to pull me in like this right from the start. It’s especially hard to find good and well written fantasy romance animes. It has all the ingredients it needs so something beautiful can be created (much like with the silver sugar). Especially the world-buildig is pretty good. However, this might be the problem since sometimes it seems like the writers focused too much on that instead of developing characters or their relationships further. But a good story needs both equally balanced. Personally I don’t mind the use of cliches if implemented in a refreshing way. The anime did that. At the same time causing some misunderstandings and using common tropes without really thinking it through or considering its own lore. But I’m not blaming it on the writers since it’s still pretty good. The focus of it, however, might be subjective. You can never please everyone but at times it felt it’s exactly what the story tried to do and therefore it could feel more mediocre than it actually is. If it wouldn’t have been for the execution of the ending I feel like l’d have given it a little higher rating. It’s still a beautiful anime and I’m excited to watch the second season. The last fantasy romance anime that pulled me in like this was probably “Hakushaku to Yousei” so I have much anticipation for what’s to come. I’m not sure if I could recommend it to everyone but if you want to watch a cute romance with two main characters pretty much starting out as enemies (or kind of), with an excellent world-building and a dreamy look then you’ll enjoy this. Now enjoy your (un)healthy dose of “Sugar Apple Fairy Tale”.', ""The best way to describe this series/season is sweet with a bitter aftertaste. A classic story of a girl desperate to achieve greatness in a sexist society and finds a reluctant ally in the form of a fairy slave which they form a genuine bond. It's sweet, fluffy, and more than often cliche. To understand this series, we have to break it down by its individual parts.Part 1: This is the part that was the best of the three. Its classic take on the reluctant warrior protecting the rambunctious and strong-willed love interest is a tale as old as time. What I liked about this...is that at no point during the first few episodes did any chemistry between the two seem to take place. By the time feelings formed it felt genuine and earned. No love at first sight, no awkward nonsense, but only Anne's commitment to earning Challe's respect. Jonas was an excellent third wheel up to the point of his eventual and obvious betrayal. Even how they introduced Hugh Mercury was a nice touch leading to the reveal of his prominent role in the kingdom. It was a slow burn leading to an emotionally fueled betrayal, heartbreak, and resolution before we reached our climax. To say the least, a near perfect story. If the show ended there, I would have given the series a higher rating.Part 2: Let me start off by saying while this part was very emotional and heartbreaking, it was weak in numerous ways. It started off with an interesting side story as we are introduced to Keith and his shop. From a storytelling perspective it was a good way to break up the acts with a minor but still important story after the emotional rollercoaster of the first act. It was afterwards when we enter the Duke's story that things take a sour turn. The story relied heavily on recycled story elements from numerous other works and itself. Jonas once again being a jerk felt unneeded in this act and could have easily been replaced by a stronger newer character. The introduction into the kingdom's politics felt out of place rather than interesting world building. The only strength in this act was the heartbreaking tale of the duke and his lover whom he was obsessed with reunited with. I cried but was also unswayed in my opinion that this act was exceptionally weak.Part 3: More drama surrounding Jonas and the Radcliffe clan. To the series credit, Jonas was a minor character in this act and even began on the path to redemption which would have been stronger if he hadn't sunk so low in the previous act. This act's strength came from the world building. This time we got good world building as the kingdom's sexism is now on full display as well as some interesting and tragic lore surrounding the human's relationship with the fairies. Unfortunately, the story again relies heavily on villainous cliches and eye-rolling romantic drama now that Anne and Challe are one step away from being an official item. Misunderstandings and betrayal abound and while each were resolved quickly and painlessly, their inclusion in the first place does hurt the story overall. The ending was the most bitter of all with a cliffhanger that only feels justified knowing that the story continues onward.While the story was the weakest part of the show, the animation was the best. Beautiful watercolor backgrounds, gorgeous sugar sculptures that I only wish could be real, and the subtle strokes of animation during the crafting scenes that show how much care went into the creation of the sculptures as well as highlighting their importance to the plot. Anne and Challe were the other highlights of the series. Both strong characters with a romantic relationship that felt earned and nurtured over the course of the show that is only strengthened by their rough beginning. Enemies to lovers may be a frowned upon trope among many critics but I personally will never tire of it when done well. The other characters range from okay to great to cringey at best. What the show needed was a strong antagonist because the ones we saw were as fragile and dull as the sugar sculptures they created.Final thoughts, not the best fantasy romance but it was one that I watched from start to finish solely to watch Anne's dreams come true and to watch her and Challe's relationship continue to grow and blossom. is that at no point during the first few episodes did any chemistry between the two seem to take place.

The lead character is likeable and very similar to Tohru from Fruits Basket, and the love interest is a classic brooding heartthrob - the characters aren’t particularly original but the imagery, storyline and world building are fairly unique. I’m happy to see that scale figures of Challe and Anne were announced at WonFest this year too!Much of the complications between the characters could be solved with simple communication, but that’s a standard for all drama/romance anime isn’t it? ', 'Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is good!Is it deep? No, not at all. However, it is imperative not to conflate the two.If you need a sweet, heart-rending travel story of love and hard work in an unjust world, look no further.Mild spoiler warning for themes mentioned under plot and themes.With that out of the way, I will be giving a brief review of Sugar Apple Fairy Tale.I watched cour 1 and 2 when they were airing and rewatched cour 1 just before I wrote this review. Therefore this review will be written through the lens of someone who knows about the additional world-building...and character development that appear in the sequel to this series.Visuals and voice actingOne of SAFT\'s strongest qualities is its beautiful visuals. It really holds true to its title of ""fairy tale"" as you are welcomed into a world of sparkly confections and pretty fairies yet juxtaposed by a classic, slightly gritty pseudo-medieval fantasy land.Most importantly, the characters are designed and brought to life beautifully. Although it is clearly framed through both dialogue and ""camera""work who and what are to be considered eye-catching in-universe, the viewer will have no shortage of eye-candy themself even outside of what is canonically beautiful.The voice acting work in SAFT for both main and side characters was nicely casted and well done too. Shall\'s voice is low and smooth befitting of his idealized tall, dark and handsome appearance. Ann on the other hand has a higher voice and audibly shows quite a lot of emotion which can sound a bit shrill at times, but nothing over the top considering her personality.Points of meritSome notable attributes of SAFT are things that are often found in women\'s media and at times makes an appearance in seinen manga/anime too.One is the selective close-ups and attention to detail in certain areas. There appears to be such an emphasis on the eyes of the characters and the way they engage in physical contact with one another. The way he holds her, a brief touch of their fingers, or even just the way their eyes shine and tremble with anticipation or fear, all of those moments of intimacy are highlighted to make you fall in love with the characters and their dynamic. If you are a person who is easily swayed by gorgeous 2D men, you will love the way Shall especially is portrayed in this story.Closely entwined with this is the emphasis on emotion. The dialogue is nothing special per se, however the subjects that are overexposed in SAFT are often of a strong emotional nature. Sadness, nostalgia, frustration, longing, joy and of course love are all very much represented in this series. This is also why this series may feel a bit slow at times, yet unbelievably high-tension the next moment.Overall plot and themesThe plot of SAFT is nothing special. It\'s a fantasy series that deals with themes such as slavery, sexism and discrimination on a fairly elementary level. These themes are well incorporated into the universe of SAFT and may even make you shed a tear at the realness and brutality of it. Meanwhile, loss also seems to be a recurring theme as Ann, Shall and even the people they meet along the way are constantly chased by shadows of their past and loved ones lost to time.The characters are more or less easily divided into pro-Ann or anti-Ann. There are some that are bound by duty and thus fall into a grey area or some that do show some matter of change over time. In that sense, this series is fairly formulaic since Ann has some goals to achieve and some side quests to complete along the way. Every time Ann takes a step forward, someone else makes sure she takes two steps back. As such, a lot of characters will lack real depth aside from recurring characters whose motivations and personal struggles become clearer over time. Both the plot and the characters suffer from common tropes and cliches found in fantasy and/or women\'s media in addition to obvious tendencies in anime in general. Be it plot armour, the main character being well-liked despite not showing a lot of on-screen interaction with the cast or having a comedic relief character.I personally did quite enjoy SAFT\'s portrayal of sexism. Sexism can be silent, judgemental, often hurtful and based on archaic beliefs. SAFT highlights how even though perspectives differ from person to person, you cannot simply work hard and expect the entire world to start spinning the other way for you.Finally, the ending. The ending sucked. Big time. At least it did when it first came out, because cour 2 was yet to be released.This season builds up its next big conflict, then the season ends before the resolution even begins. Good thing that you can just chase it with Sugar Apple Fairy Tale 2 to get rid of that frustration.ConclusionDespite its lack of real depth, Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is very enjoyable.If you view it as a travel story with one larger goal, a charming cast and romance budding along the way, you will surely enjoy it! and character development that appear in the sequel to this series.Visuals and voice actingOne of SAFT\'s strongest qualities is its beautiful visuals.

I love the dynamic between all the characters and the work ethic and the care the main character has for those around her. The story strives to be one of kindness against the background of harsh events. It is one of the few anime I wish to watch many times over,  as was Fruits Basket and FMAB. The...music throughout is beautifully done and the delicate craft the main character undertakes is also a pure and noble pursuit leaving me really rooting for Anne Halford and the beauty she leaves behind. And because I don't come across anime of this sensibility of sensitivity very often I give this a 10 also due to the feeling it leaves me with. I really hope the characters face all the adversities they have been tasked with.

And imma say that this anime is not bad and not great at the same time. Animation-wise is decent, there are times that Anne looks like a malnourished sprout of some sort, but its not so bad. The designs and the colors are very nice and very ""soft-looking"", if that makes sense. In terms of story/plot, it\'s not that special compared to other animes out there, it\'s very decent. NOW, THE CHARACTERS?I HATE JONAS WITH...ALL MY FRICKIN BEING, LIKE WHY DOES HE KEEP APPEARING ON SCREEN LIKE BRUH NO ONE IS ASKING MORE OF HIS SORRY ASS. Next, Anne is nice and all but she\'s too goody-two-shoes and is literally treated like some doormat by the animes\' antagonists (like Jonas I swear---), but I admire her perseverance. Shall fen Shall is decent, very beautiful, but not that special of a character too. Mithril Lid Pod is also decent, he can be very noisy at times (IN MY OPINION), but ehhh.And the concepts of slavery/racism was just completely removed and the show towards the end kinda lost its spark, so it just went downhill :((Overall the anime isn\'t for everyone\'s taste. I wouldn\'t rewatch this anime nor miss it (besides missing Shall fen Shall) as much as AOT or Haikyuu. This anime really varies depending on its audience. And I swear the ending was very bittersweet and I wasn\'t satisfied especially with that green bark-looking goofy ahh of a woman who stole Shall at the end >:(( ALL MY FRICKIN BEING, LIKE WHY DOES HE KEEP APPEARING ON SCREEN LIKE BRUH NO ONE IS ASKING MORE OF HIS SORRY ASS.

If you don\'t like shoujo don\'t watch it. It\'s a bit dramatic at times and I was surprised with the blatant show of sexism towards the female lead from some antagonist characters but that\'s what made it a little more different than other shoujo I\'ve seen. Usually shoujos are all about happy endings, the male lead always ready to rescue in every adversity, and not taking things ""too far"" which I feel like this anime toned the fairy tale-like aspect of shoujo down to an extent. But it\'s still there so don\'t go in thinking that\'s not going to be there. I...have a tiny problem with the pacing of the love developed between the FL and the ML, since the setting is rather sad and dark (slavery) in the beginning, I feel like the ""warming up"" process should have been longer given how they met, and the story could have been stretched out more, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Some situations could have been handled better and I also wish they elaborated about the world since there are so many political dynamics going on, but I digress, the politics and rules of the world comes in bits and pieces, here and there, when it\'s relevant to the plot.

It has a pacing problem, where they condensed a whole arc into 5 episodes, and I felt rushed through the character development, making most of it less meaningful. I hope the second arc is a bit slower.Also, I'm tired of isekai slavery, can we do something else now?The plot and setting reminded me a bit of spice and wolf, but spice and wolf is better. They don't show enough of the craft, and I started it mainly to learn more about sugar candy making. I'm hoping this is fixed soon.The characters are standard, and some of them are too noisy and...annoying.

SAFT is a lovely tale about a girl honing her craft in a field that is largely dominated by men. And yes, while the slavery trope is very overused, in this scenario I believe it works with the fact that Anne bought the fairy because in that moment she didn\'t exactly have a choice. He was in excruciating pain and she was told that the only way to make it stop was to buy him from the slave owner. And not only that, but she ultimately freed him unlike most anime where the MC never frees...them. And their romance is developed at a slow enough pace that we can fully see their relationship and dynamic together. Anne may be somewhat stupid but she works with what she has and tries her best at things she\'s looked down on for doing. I personally think this show, while not the best anime of this season, is doing its job perfectly find and people should give it more of a chance before chalking it up to ""Slavery anime go brrr"" them.

In one sitting. It was bad.TL;DR: This show is pretty and had promise, yet the heroine is brainless and the romance is tiresome. MY watching experience was not as enjoyable as I would have liked it. Like at all. I had high expectations and the is story just made me facepalm and roll my eyes numerous times.Let\'s get what I liked out of the way first: visually, it was appealing. It seriously looked edible. I honestly thought the colors were cute and suited it nicely. Also, I think the concept was...solid enough for an anime to watch while multi-tasking. Oh also, I like fantasy themes and liked the inclusion of fairies in the story. Oh and my friend and I thought Shall was hot.Now, let\'s get into the bad. Oh boy.......where to start.........Anna. Anna has to be one of the dumbest and most annoying protagonists I have ever had the displeasure of following in an anime. No, seriously, she made me actively angry and I had a scowl on my face every time she ignored the obvious facts and situations around her. She, like so many of the boring anime protagonists before her, follows the trope of the ""heroic heroine that believes friendship is magic"". She keeps saying how she is ""an adult woman"" (even though she is FIFTEEN), then proceeds to be so ignorant. Like, I know it\'s set in the whole time period of ""marrying your 14 year old neighbor would be my honor"" and the ""bang your cousin to keep our line pure"", but this show\'s protagonist doesn\'t get a pass for being insufferable. She irritated me BECAUSE of how they try to paint her as this mature girl that would ""ripen in three years time"", yet every time something didn\'t work out for her she bawled her eyes out like that guy from Rent-A-Girlfriend. This guy Jonas was awful to her and yet she seems to almost forgive him at the end. Like, hahaha....no. She barely got any character development at all and she is such a mary-sue to the point that it pisses me off. Every single person (that isn\'t either a horny female or misogynistic male) is always viewing her so highly and it just makes me roll my eyes. Also, can I ask? Why the fuck does she take on ""Kat\'s"" task of to make up for something she didn\'t even do? I would have told that guy to fuck off if he kept on insisting I perform manual labor when I didn\'t do anything wrong and even tried to HELP HIM OUT. Oh, what\'s that? You said it\'s because otherwise he wouldn\'t have seen her ""not like other girls"" charm and end up with her befriending a master sugar artisan? Yeah, you\'re right. Also, she is genuinely kind and taking the side of that William guy who LITERALLY IS THREATENING HER LIFE IF SHE DOESN\'T LIVE UP TO HIS STANDARDS. Wtf. WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT HOW HE FEELS HE IS LITERALLY TRYING TO IMPRISON YOU BECAUSE YOU CAN\'T DO SOMETHING SUPER NITPICKY AND TO HIS LIKING. This girl for real reminds me of the protagonist from Diabolik Lovers whereas they are both ignorant and so very, very lackluster. Oh and I just remembered how this girl seriously followed that dimwit Jonas\' demand of sending Shall away for the wing of that annoying fairy sidekick that is always yelling in every scene he is in. She SHOULD have told Shall ""Hey, this blond pissbaby and his fairy side hoe threatened to crush the wing of my friend if I don\'t do their bidding, go rock their shit and get it back for me, because, you\'re you know, A WARRIOR FAIRY"". But no.....this bitch continues to disappoint me more than my midterm test scores.Just as an extra nitpick, but seriously, the pacing is confusing. At the end of episode four she finishes her first contest, then in episode eleven she finishes the second contest a whole year after. This feels like a waste of potential to show us the development between Anna and Shall\'s relationship. We also don\'t get to know all that much about the backstories of the main two: Anna whose mother died and was a supposed great artisan, we don\'t get to see it much and even though she was ""so skilled"" (enough for that blond guy to steal her krabby patty formula) as a sugar artisan. So lazy.Now let\'s discuss the romance aspect. First off, is Kat in the harem? Because if so, I would like to dial 9-1-1. You cannot tell me he is anywhere near young enough to justify potentially being romantically involved with a 15 year old. He is a master artisan and I\'m pretty sure he like graduated from that school or something like years ago. Feel free to correct me if I got it wrong but the show didn\'t indicate to me otherwise so I\'m rolling with what I said. Now, onto Keith. He is so clearly meant to be the ""soft boy"" option and is seemingly the human alternative. I honestly couldn\'t help but cringe at how I swear I have seen this kind of pairing in almost any romance anime ever. We see the ""not like other girls"" protagonist and the ""soft second lead boy"" and it made me want to skip any scene they were in together. Now onto Shall. He was probably the most sensible character (well compared to the others at least). Which is why I would never believe, in any universe, that he would fall in love with this stupid and pushy girl. I was hysterical when he described his first love as someone completely opposite to Anna because I literally said right before it that she is the complete polar opposite to someone he SHOULD like. Their ""romance"" felt so forced and I could not STAND the wattpad-self-insert-esc vibes these two always gave off. Such an unbelievably laughable romance.Now onto the ""villains"". They were laughably awful. I don\'t even mean in the morally awful way either, just terribly written. Jonas is our supposed first antagonist, yet he is more akin to the bully boy in second grade that throws fries at you because he doesn\'t want to admit he has a crush on a ""stupid girl"" (cough- tsundere- cough). And that annoying ass fairy sidekick of his was so cliche I couldn\'t believe what I was seeing; this bitch\'s whole personality is having googly eyes over her slave owner and doing anything for him, regardless of who else is involved. These two were trash, but not nearly as awful as the next antagonists: those misogynists in the workshop. Oh. My. God. Was all I could think when watching them on screen. I have never, in my LIFE, seen such a blatant female empowerment agenda in an anime. And as a girl myself, I would like to say that this is such a horrible way to show female empowerment on screen. Making the antagonists so one-dimensional to portray misogyny only to make our mary-sue female protagonist look nearly as strong as the hype squad around her paints her out to be made my brain melt. I honestly thought I was watching Supergirl on crack with that slipped in social commentary. Also, if they want to actually make her a competent woman, don\'t show her struggling to move the big spoon a centimeter. Dear god.....women can stir spoons.......and there are scrawny men there too so they shouldn\'t be making it seem like having a penis makes you a demigod at moving above-average sized objects.Also, as for the history of fairies, it was so vague. I mean, they didn\'t explain how Shall is a big sexy man and that little sidekick is reserved to being a Tinkerbell sized nuisance. There is so much about fairies that I was questioning, like ""can they reproduce without having to magically manifest?"" ""can they reproduce with humans?"" ""what determines how big they will be?"" ""why does being a water fairy make your life expectancy short compared to a dewdrop fairy?"" etc. Also, do all fairies know that ""ancient highlander"" language, or is it only reserved for hot love interests? Well, I\'m not watching season two, so I doubt I\'ll find out.Thanks for wasting almost as many braincells as I spent watching this show on reading this too-long review. solid enough for an anime to watch while multi-tasking.

Even though girl is already best at this craft almost from get go, story still revolve around making her best effort. Nonetheless, conflicts present in story are more relatable than you might expect....Generally here it all about sexism, slavery and ""hard work"". Mostly ""hard work"" though.

But it\'s often a taboo to have inequality in the world, such as masters and slaves, tradition vs. modern, and gender equality. Such is the case with novelist Miri Mikawa\'s completed 17-volume LN that is Sugar Apple Fairy Tale from 2010 to 2015, it sure took over a decade to finally have an anime adaptation, courtesy of J.C.Staff.  But with every Shoujo-esque work that\'s clearly targeted...at the female demographic, the Shonen or Seinen in us (if you\'re a young teenager or adult male) will definitely have something to say about a Shoujo show, in both good and bad ways.In this season, there\'re quite a few ""master and slaves"" types of shows, such as Vinland Saga\'s Farmland arc (which is the immaculate kind) and this show, which true to be honest, raises some red flags. In Sugar Apple Fairy Tale, the kingdoms are treated in such a way that there are both humans and fairies, but that the fairies are controlled by the humans with one side of their wings as collateral. No matter how good or bad the human master is, the fairies are slaves to their work and bidding, and just like any abusive person, would lash out at them by using their given wings to forcefully torment them.And one fairy would like to change that perception, thanks to someone that he would meet along the way. The main female Protag-chan Anne Helford has quite the dramatic life: the daughter of a beloved Silver Sugar Master (the title only bestowed by property), she passed on before Anne could ever mature and make her dream of becoming a Silver Sugar Master known to her. It\'s with that purpose that she sets on the long and winding journey to become just that, but with the kingdom\'s regulations that every human has a choice to affiliate themselves with fairies, Anne decides to purchase a fairy to act as her protector on her long travels. But what she got in return was a matter of pride and constant mutant understanding: the warrior fairy in the form of Challe Fen Challe who is more than meets the eye.Essentially, Anne\'s journey of becoming the Silver Sugar Master is a road that filled with thorns and backlashes, as many as it could fill. Starting with the fairies that she affiliates herself with, Mythril Lid Pod is the small water fairy that she saved from a ruthless fairy hunter, and despite his childlike innocence plus the hatred of humans from how he was treated, he honours Anne saving him as a repayment of favour, eventually being a travel companion and a friend along the way. The main fairy in question, Challe Fen Challe is a warrior fairy serving as Anne\'s bodyguard, and although he hits the mark of the typical Ikemen being very handsome and beautiful, he has a sharp tongue that\'s not afraid to say what\'s on his mind, and with his master in toll, Challe constantly teasing Anne by calling her ""Scarecrow"" is the hallmark of a possible romance, because you can\'t take the romance out of a Shoujo work, as much as she works hard to bring out the best in her. Challe once had someone that was close with him but got killed thanks to the whole human-fairy enslavement rule, and eventually like Mythril Lid Pod, distrusts humans to an extreme degree. Though with Anne, both human and fairy take a while to get used to each other\'s quirks, and for the human who dislikes the gap between humans and fairies for slavery, promises something that is unheard of: letting one part of the wing that\'s reserved for the human masters, be returned to him on the basis that he doesn\'t run away from her willy-nilly, and as much as the warrior fairy himself gets a lot of scorn, he becomes trustworthy and protects her in the line of her dream enough for her to fall in love with him as time passes...because I must stress this again, the story would fall flat if there isn\'t any semblance of a relationship.I don\'t know what it is about this show that likes to glorify inferior superiority, but there must be a hook, and this comes in the form of Jonas Anders. The former friend turned rival; Jonas is simply put: a man in agnostic denial. Once a friend that was as happy-go-lucky as he is to spell out that both him and Anne were going to be a married couple, ultimately, Jonas is a jerk of many proportions, using his past to anchor his present, like steal Anne\'s beautiful sugar confections and make it as his own. The reason for his inexcusable behaviour, is that he is the nephew of the Radcliffe Workshop under Marcus and owing to the school\'s hack-of-a-job inferiority complex to teach budding sugar artisans like Jonas, the biblical saying of ""The Devil is here to seek and destroy"" is as real as it could get. The unrepentable young man constantly in bickering against Anne, he is the epitome of selfishness. But, to talk about the Royals here, it would definitely taste even more sweeter. The Silver Sugar Viscount Hugh Mercury is a talented sugar artisan and knows when works like Anne\'s can be praised to high regard for the quality work that she has put out with all her heart. The same can be said for Alph ""Kat"" Hingley, who is also a Silver Sugar Master and respects Anne\'s hard work as well, at the cost of misunderstanding and a no-nonsense front if anyone tries to accuse Anne of unfairness. Last but not least, there is Keith Powell, the son of the previous Silver Sugar Viscount, who is affiliated with Kat and Anne\'s mother through surrounding his entire life with sugar confections, but never competes due to favouritism. And most certainly, he sees Anne like a legit, worthy rival, instead of Jonas and the others of the Radcliffe Workshop. Overall, the side characters support well, that is all except Jonas and his band of thieving rascals of the Radcliffe Workshop.This show produced under the reins of J.C.Staff, it looks pretty, beautiful and whimsical from the fantasy standpoint. It\'s a lot of bright and vibrant colours to add to the allure of wonderful sugar confections that almost looked like it wasn\'t hand-made, but from the hard work of its artisans. A good job on that front. The OST complements the light-hearted show with Minori Suzuki and Sumire Moroboshi\'s OP and ED respectively, and that\'s all I can say about the other aspects of the show.Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is both sweet and savoury. It can get sour from the many little things affecting it, from the slavery to the kinda-forced romance that most Shoujo shows tend to get plagued with for a moving story plot badly. But above all, it\'s light and delicate, and must be taken with a dose of fluff and air to properly enjoy and appreciate the show for what it is.This is a love-hate show, and enjoy this or not, Sugar Apple Fairy Tale is a tale of the light and airy type. Who knows, you might like it...that\'s if you can muster the Shoujo tropes, which to me, this is yet another mediocre showing. at the female demographic, the Shonen or Seinen in us (if you\'re a young teenager or adult male) will definitely have something to say about a Shoujo show, in both good and bad ways.In this season, there\'re quite a few ""master and slaves"" types of shows, such as Vinland Saga\'s Farmland arc (which is the immaculate kind) and this show, which true to be honest, raises some red flags. In Sugar Apple Fairy Tale, the kingdoms are treated in such a way that there are both humans and fairies, but that the fairies are controlled by the humans with one side of their wings as collateral. No matter how good or bad the human master is, the fairies are slaves to their work and bidding, and just like any abusive person, would lash out at them by using their given wings to forcefully torment them.And one fairy would like to change that perception, thanks to someone that he would meet along the way. The main female Protag-chan Anne Helford has quite the dramatic life: the daughter of a beloved Silver Sugar Master (the title only bestowed by property), she passed on before Anne could ever mature and make her dream of becoming a Silver Sugar Master known to her. It\'s with that purpose that she sets on the long and winding journey to become just that, but with the kingdom\'s regulations that every human has a choice to affiliate themselves with fairies, Anne decides to purchase a fairy to act as her protector on her long travels. But what she got in return was a matter of pride and constant mutant understanding: the warrior fairy in the form of Challe Fen Challe who is more than meets the eye.Essentially, Anne\'s journey of becoming the Silver Sugar Master is a road that filled with thorns and backlashes, as many as it could fill. Starting with the fairies that she affiliates herself with, Mythril Lid Pod is the small water fairy that she saved from a ruthless fairy hunter, and despite his childlike innocence plus the hatred of humans from how he was treated, he honours Anne saving him as a repayment of favour, eventually being a travel companion and a friend along the way. The main fairy in question, Challe Fen Challe is a warrior fairy serving as Anne\'s bodyguard, and although he hits the mark of the typical Ikemen being very handsome and beautiful, he has a sharp tongue that\'s not afraid to say what\'s on his mind, and with his master in toll, Challe constantly teasing Anne by calling her ""Scarecrow"" is the hallmark of a possible romance, because you can\'t take the romance out of a Shoujo work, as much as she works hard to bring out the best in her. Challe once had someone that was close with him but got killed thanks to the whole human-fairy enslavement rule, and eventually like Mythril Lid Pod, distrusts humans to an extreme degree. Though with Anne, both human and fairy take a while to get used to each other\'s quirks, and for the human who dislikes the gap between humans and fairies for slavery, promises something that is unheard of: letting one part of the wing that\'s reserved for the human masters, be returned to him on the basis that he doesn\'t run away from her willy-nilly, and as much as the warrior fairy himself gets a lot of scorn, he becomes trustworthy and protects her in the line of her dream enough for her to fall in love with him as time passes...because I must stress this again, the story would fall flat if there isn\'t any semblance of a relationship.I don\'t know what it is about this show that likes to glorify inferior superiority, but there must be a hook, and this comes in the form of Jonas Anders. The former friend turned rival; Jonas is simply put: a man in agnostic denial. Once a friend that was as happy-go-lucky as he is to spell out that both him and Anne were going to be a married couple, ultimately, Jonas is a jerk of many proportions, using his past to anchor his present, like steal Anne\'s beautiful sugar confections and make it as his own. The reason for his inexcusable behaviour, is that he is the nephew of the Radcliffe Workshop under Marcus and owing to the school\'s hack-of-a-job inferiority complex to teach budding sugar artisans like Jonas, the biblical saying of ""The Devil is here to seek and destroy"" is as real as it could get. The unrepentable young man constantly in bickering against Anne, he is the epitome of selfishness. But, to talk about the Royals here, it would definitely taste even more sweeter.

The plot is an excuse for a romance between an edgy bishounen fairy and the self-insert lead. However, Sugar Apple possesses a lot of self-awareness. The show makes an effort to frame slavery as an evil act, and that our heroine is only doing this because she absolutely must—that she definitely wants to treat him well and free him (eventually). Her artificially good natured personality feels like an act, and her moe character design seems engineered to manipulate your expectations. She’s not a bad person,...she’s just ordering her slave because that’s what the rules say! It’s similar to when a person acts overly nice to you, but they’re secretly writing an anime about a cute slave owner.At the very least, it's intriguing from a meta level! Seeing the writers struggle to evade criticism provides entertainment. On the bright side, the series looks and sounds good so far. J.C. Staff are working within their limits, which means minimal animation to maintain consistent art quality. The water-color background art, expressive character designs, and vibrant colors are really all it needs. On the music side, it’s solid as well. Good OP and relaxing ED. The composer’s use of chimes for transitions and magic effects really suits the fairy tale aesthetic. If you're immune to slavery apologia, this could make for an entertaining and relaxing watch.Shoujo is a genre deserving more recognition, this is not the way to do it.

If you painfully survived season 2 and you're wondering if you should continue then congrats because it gets better.This season and the next one are a lot more packed with action than the previous one. A lot of antagonist are introduced, many of them with little importance which can be a problem for some. But what I really like about this season is that you truly start to realize how big the world is and how minor the last season was.The fighting itself is pretty good, a lot better than last season.I won't go into too much...details cuz that would be spoilers but one minor warning: Some people felt that the power-ups of Qin Yu seemed more forced than in the 1st season and didn't feel like it rewarded hard work. You may feel the same thing in this season, but there are 2 reasons for that. The first is that Qin Yu has been following an already existing technique while he had to do it by himself in season 1. Plus the start of cultivation is a lot harder when you come from a mortal kingdom with zero knowledge. Qin yu has been eating jin dan of beats he killed which helps a lot.The second reason in this season specifically is time skip. It might be hard to follow if you're unfamiliar with cultivation stories but the lifespan of cultivators is a lot. I think Qin Yu is Late Yuanying at the start of the season (Mortal->Xiantian->Jindan->Yuanying) which means his lifespan is in the thousand years. 5s in the anime might be equivalent to several years.TLDR ~ It gets a lot better, you should give it a try.

Xiao Lu He Xiao Lan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38250/Xiao_Lu_He_Xiao_Lan,"[""From what I understand, Beryl and Sapphire are two actors. I’ve never read the manhua they come from, but this show does not depict their real lives. Instead, it showcases their roles as characters within the movies/shows they act in. This series is essentially a catalogue of their acting careers, but it's not necessary to know that going in, as you get a feel for what the show is after just a few episodes.What's unique and captivating about this Chinese animation is the fact that different storylines gradually build and are told simultaneously, so one episode will follow Beryl and Sapphire in one story, and...the very next episode then picks up where another Beryl/Sapphire story left off. IT'S THE SAME FREAKING CHARACTERS EVERY TIME AND I LOVE IT, although they are actually different characters in each story... Or are they really.?.?.?.. We get to ship, we get to cry, we get to be angry, we get to think about profound ideas, and we are present while Shao-lan and Shao-lu experience sci-fi, drama, romance, and real-world problems.Most episodes are about 5 – 7 minutes, with longer episodes occurring about once every five or six episodes. Most, if not all the main storylines in the series get at least one long episode.The series flirts with a lot of different sci-fi concepts that are difficult to use well in anime. Whether it's the short-story nature of this series that gives it the freedom to execute these ideas so smoothly and in a creative way, the chemistry between Beryl and Sapphire, or just good writing, it's clear that Beryl and Sapphire is not afraid to tackle a wide variety of plots and genres. The show is able to shift, very smoothly, between a light-hearted mood to darker, more serious tones when needed.The music is very nice, and fits the show well, especially during emotional scenes. Certain episodes really tugged me when those beautiful piano pieces started playing. There is one piece in particular I looked so hard to find, to no avail.The artwork/animation, despite characters often reverting to bald, blank-faced figures at appropriate times, is colorful, detailed, and consistently pretty to look at.Few episodes (of the one-off episodes/narratives) reached a little far in order to portray original or comically relatable content, and it was incredibly irritating watching Sapphire unable to function around Beryl for the entirety of at least one or two different storylines, but most of what this show offers is consistently entertaining and fresh.It's worth mentioning that this series is shounen-ai, although I'm guessing that's how most people came across it. While the bl isn’t exactly subtle, I wouldn't say it's excessive either, and is also not present within every storyline. This relaxing and light sci-fi slice of life was definitely worth the watch, so I suggest you give it a chance, and I know you'll be entertained by this lovely ship. the very next episode then picks up where another Beryl/Sapphire story left off.

I thought the premise seemed intriguing enough and I didn’t have high expectations for it… I was wrong.To say this show is different is most definitely an understatement. The first and most blatant thing you will notice from either the title of the show or watching episode 1 is that it is in Chinese. This kind of threw me off, but I decided that I would watch it anyways. Another cool thing that I enjoyed is that they are comprised of a bunch of different stories rather than just one...long story. I think this approach was very effective as it connected the commonality of characters to different stories which gave it a unique feel. One last unique thing I found is that the episodes are divided into groups of 6. This is comprised of 5 - ~6 minute episodes and 1 - ~25 minute episode as a “weekend special” when it aired. I thought this idea was cool and it gave something to people who like the different types of shows so you don’t need to say “this would have been better as a short” or “man, I wish these episodes were longer”. This issue is tackled well and I can guarantee you will not walk away disappointed in regards to that issue.With that out of the way, it takes more than just “uniqueness” to make a show good. As you can see, I scored all categories with at least a 9 because I truly felt like it exceeded and performed well in all the categories.Story: 10/10 - The story was a bit hard for me to score as there are multiple stories to follow as I mentioned before, but I think the two main characters being a “pivot role” if you will helped keep it interesting in a fresh way (although I will touch more on this in the character section of my review). Using the characters as pivots allowed the stories to feel like the same show, but different in their own respects. I gave it a 10 because I haven’t seen another show tackle it like this show did and I thought it was very effective.Art: 9/10 - The art looked great and they did something that I think seems lazy at first glance, but I think it helped the focus of the show. Almost all background characters and occasionally the main characters would go from having a “normal” animated face to just a simple round head with eyes and a mouth. For the background characters, this allowed social scenes to feel like real life. You don’t recognize faces and it allows you to focus on the important characters at hand. As far as the main characters, it would generally do this to help with the emotions of the characters. I never found it out of place when they would switch to the round heads. Also, small last side note, CGI animation is used at some points of large crowds moving. It looked weird, but it wasn’t important to the show and it was probably much easier on the team making the show, so I chose to let that one slide.Sound: 9/10 - The OST wasn’t memorable but it wasn’t bad either. I can’t think of any particular tunes standing out as great or awful. I just thought during the show that it always fit well (which can’t be said for all anime). The OP and ED are pretty catchy too I might add. I’m usually pretty big on music, but this music just felt right and I just walk away with a “good job, it worked” feeling. Not much to say unfortunately, but it was good.Character: 10/10 - As far as the characters go, the show generally revolves around two main characters: Beryl and Sapphire. Not matter what personality or arc is being played on any given episode, there is some sort of relationship between these characters that brings them together (whether a romantic relationship or not). These stories take place in a multitude of different demographics. You have them either in the work place, in school, or just out in public. The best part is that they all work and manage to keep a basic outline of the characters. It felt right in each of the roles that they were playing. Although I don’t think I would take a singular Beryl or Sapphire to my top 10 character list, the interactions between all of them has to be up there in some of my favorites (but MAL doesn’t have a place for that… RIP Hibike Euphonium interactions). I think having this level of interaction value isn’t something a lot of anime can do this well so hats off to the team.Enjoyment: 10/10 - Not much to say about enjoyment that hasn’t been said already. What I can say is that I knew I was hooked after the first block of 6 episodes. I’d say give the show about 1 to 2 cycles of the 6-episode cycles to see if it’s a show you should continue. I think that there is definitely something for everyone in this show which makes me think the enjoyment of this show is something that can be shared among a lot of people in the community which is why I put it in such high regards. I could easily recommend this to a lot of people.Overall: “It just felt right” 10/10 long story.

Fortunately, Beryl and Sapphire is not just a collection of independent one-shot episodes; some storylines get revisited in later episodes giving the series the opportunity to flesh out the world and characters. Which is great because some of the stories gain a real depth with more exposition. While most episodes are just short 5mins mindless entertainment, some episodes (especially the 30 mins long weekend specials) can be truly unique and thought-provoking. I especially found the...themes of episode 30 really intriguing.Regarding the titular Beryl and Sapphire, their dynamic can be either hilarious or heartwarming (or heartbreaking) depending on the episode. Overall, it was a very cute watch.

Overall, it was a very cute watch. Would recommend."", 'This is my first review. I wrote this in Feb 2020 and never got around to sharing it.Beryl and Sapphire (Xiao Lu He Xiao Lan) 小绿和小蓝 is a comedy-gag donghua (Chinese anime) based off of a web-comic written by Ocarina. In this web-comic, the main characters Beryl and Sapphire, to my knowledge, are genderless stick-figures. It\'s a very character-oriented series that has accumulated widespread love in China. I\'m very happy I managed to stumble upon this series now, because the impact this show has left on me is greater than I originally thought it would.The animation in this series is, at first, really simplistic. And...that works in its benefit. Adapting from a source material that is quite literally just stick figures, the animation team really brought their A-game in bringing Beryl and Sapphire to life. The art direction is simplistic when it needs to be during the light-hearted comedic moments, and the animation is seemless (and, sometimes, breathtaking) during the emotional or action-packed moments. The background characters retain the simple stick-figure shape as seen in the webcomic, because, the show isn\'t about the background characters. The show (with exemptions to quite literally only, maybe 2-3 characters) only revolves Beryl and Sapphire. The art is cute as well. If you have seen any other donghua, then you know that some of them struggle with art/animation greatly (though this has now changed, seeing as how booming the animation industry has become in China within the past 2 years), but none of this is shown in B&S, as its\' shorter episode run-time (5 minutes to 30 minutes) is easier to manage.Now to move onto something much more important. If you\'re reading this review, there is a chance you\'ve seen the tag ""Shounen Ai"" on B&S\'s MyAnimeList page. I noticed that too, which to be honest, got me to check out the show. However, while this is applicable greatly to the show, I feel the need to explain. Ocarina (as stated in her interview for Western fans) has confirmed that Beryl and Sapphire are soulmates. Each episode revolves around them in a different universe (they are technically ""actors"" playing all of these parts, but I find it much easier to dictate them as separate universes entirely) and each universe is centered on their relationship.Do they hate each other? Do they love each other? Are they strangers? Classmates? Coworkers? Businessmen? Demon King and Knight? Robots? Secret Agents? Are they both male? Is one of them female? Will one of them confess to the other? Will one of them die?I am unironically stating that this stupid comedy-gag anime is incredibly philosophical. There are direct references to literature such as Flowers for Algernon and 120 Days of Sodom. It subtextually questions its audience about how technology has (and will) irrefutably change our lives forever, or about how we misconceptualize the perspectives of villains, or how greed can corrupt our perspectives of the people we care about, or how easy it is to let go of the importance of our pasts in favor of what could be a temporary future.I experienced such a wide array of emotions with this show. This is supposed to be a gag anime, yet I found myself tearing up countless times. It knows when to be stupid and when to be serious. When that slow music sets in during some of the most emotionally climactic scenes in the series, and the credits begin to roll as the lyrics blared from my speakers, you just feel the need to curl up and hug yourself.This probably isn\'t the show for you if you want some grand, over-arching narrative with intuitive world-building and a grounded setting. This is a character-centric show, and it won\'t be for everyone. It also probably won\'t be for you if you can\'t handle listening to Chinese or if seeing two boys kissing isn\'t your thing. I just needed an outlet to express my love for this show. Thank you for reading this review. that works in its benefit.

From one episode to the next, it will jump from one story to another. Many of these stories only last a single episode or less, focusing on perhaps a single gag, or a touching moment. But other stories last multiple episodes, but are spread apart...in episode order. The thing that unifies the stories is that they all involve some close relationship between the two main characters, Xiao Lu and Xiao Lan.The short episodes are mostly very lighthearted and comedic, but the long episodes can often bring the waterworks.An overarching theme is how new technology affects our lives and specifically our relationships, though sometimes there's some supernatural phenomenon that affects relationships. It gets surprisingly philosophical, but the philosophy never gets in the way of the story telling.Also, it's very gay. Not every story puts them in love with each other, but quite a few do. And since there are many different worlds, you get to see them confess their love over and over. So if you don't like that, this is not for you. But it's super cute, and definitely a big draw for this show. There's no ecchi, it's all very innocent.It's hard to explain how cohesive this feels, when the structure is so disjoint.

Hehe.""SPOILERS FREE""So Yowamushi Pedal: Spare Bike Movie is made from 3 stories from Makishima, Yuusuke and Toudou, Jinpachi past when they were first years.So first part is about when Makishima joins Souhoku\'s cycling club. Makishima was already noticeable by his green hair, but when the seniors saw his ""dancing"" they thought they had to do something about it.....Second part is about Toudou, Jinpachi past. When he was in middle-school everyone seemed to think that he is cool and all. He thought that riding a bicycle was nothing out of ordinary, but then he tried joining...his friend for a race competition...Third part is also about Makishima, but this time it\'s about his struggle with his bicycle and his secret from others..So this is end of my review...

Although if you wait for the credits to finish, we do get a nice short clip of Arakita with a cat....This made me simp more for Makishima, so it was pretty great. One thing that I AM concerned about is how Kinjou came to be so serious even though he wasn't all about that 2 years ago.And also why are Toudou's eyes so soulless????

But while the characters are certainly cute, they lack any real depth or personality, making it difficult to care about their relationships or the events that unfold around them.The animation in...Acchi Kocchi is decent enough, but it's not enough to make up for the lack of substance in the story. Even the attempts at humor fall flat, relying on tired tropes and predictable gags that are more likely to elicit a yawn than a chuckle.Overall, I'd give a Score of 6.3/10. While it might appeal to fans of the slice-of-life genre, it's unlikely to win over anyone looking for a more engaging and entertaining anime.--------------------------------------Selamat malam, para wanita dan pria, dan selamat datang di anime yang sebosan menonton cat mengering. Ya, saya berbicara tentang Acchi Kocchi: Place=Princess, sebuah anime yang mencoba menjadi lucu dan menyentuh hati, tetapi gagal total.Premis dari Acchi Kocchi cukup sederhana. Protagonis kita, Tsumiki, menyukai temannya, Io, dan anime ini mengikuti kehidupan sehari-hari mereka dalam format slice-of-life. Namun meskipun karakter-karakternya lucu, mereka tidak memiliki kedalaman atau kepribadian yang sebenarnya, sehingga sulit untuk peduli pada hubungan mereka atau kejadian yang terjadi di sekitar mereka.Animasi di Acchi Kocchi cukup baik, tetapi tidak cukup untuk mengimbangi kurangnya substansi dalam cerita. Bahkan upaya untuk humor juga kurang, mengandalkan trope yang sudah usang dan lelucon yang dapat ditebak yang lebih cenderung memicu kantuk daripada candaan.Secara keseluruhan, saya akan memberikan skor 6,3 / 10. Meskipun mungkin menarik bagi penggemar genre slice-of-life, anime ini tidak akan memenangkan hati mereka yang mencari anime yang lebih menarik dan menghibur.

Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16005/Zettai_Karen_Children__The_Unlimited_-_Hyoubu_Kyousuke,"[""When I first started watching this series, I originally thought, “Oh, it's just another anime with cool guys and girls using superpowers and flying around like Superman-wannabees.”. Of course, that was before I watched its parent story, Zettai Karen Children. But more so, it was before I fully embraced the  spinoff known as Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke. This new piece of work that Manglobe is presenting here could be defined as their latest line in their evolution of supernatural phenomenon. In fact, Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited takes supernatural with a world of super powers and transforms it into profound...psychic tale starring....The one and only Hyoubu KyousukeZettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke is a spinoff the original Zettai Karen Children. It is presented by Manglobe, a Japanese anime studio, who is known for some of its other works involving supernatural such as Deadman Wonderland, Ergo Proxy, and The World That God Only Knows. And now here we are with their latest presentation. Now, this series can spell out a lot of questions for potential fans. One of most common ones may be something along the line of, “Do I need to watch the original Zettai Karen Children?” From my perspective, it is not necessary but I would say that it can open some insight as well as background to this spinoff. But of course, this isn't the parent series. This is UNLIMITED featuring Hyoubu Kyousuke as the star of the show.The way the series is adapted is quite a peculiar one from my point of view. Even from the starters, we can clearly see that Hyoubu Kyousuke is not your typical hero. Rather, he can be seen as an anti-hero with the way he dresses, the way he acts, the words he speaks, and the action he commits. With his silver jet hair and floating around the city, he is a man of many mysteries especially behind that devious smile. Even from the beginning, he seems to have devious plans from his head. For example, he has himself taken prisoner on purpose for the reason to save one of his own partners in crime. He often thinks before he acts and is calculating toward his goals. Additionally, Kyousuke seems to be a man with a brilliant mind and often plans strategically in order stay ahead of his adversaries. As the leader of the mysterious organization, P.A.N.D.R.A, Kyosuke shows why he is the leader with his ruthlessness when events calls for it. He really is a star of his own show here folks.Having seen the original series, Zettai Karen Children, this spinoff originally put me on odds side with Kyousuke. In fact, he is an antagonist from the original title. Here, he is portrayed as a protagonist. (although I see him more as an anti-hero) I found out the easy way during the first few episodes when Kyousuke is able to pull off his plan in his own 'heroic' effort. With that, he even meets a new friend by the name of Andy Hinomiya. He has a mysterious power of his own that can be compared to a certain unlucky protagonist from another series. I won't spoil here so watch more to find out. At any rate, he is introduced as an anime original character who joins  P.A.N.D.R.A. His friendship with Kyousuke seems to be based on both fear and respect. Yet, they do work hand-in-hand and often times gets the job done. Speaking of anime original, there is the cute Yuugiri. She is a strange girl with the ability to read minds but that often puts her at odds with society. She is even viewed sometimes as a 'monster' for just being an esper. This isn't surprising though as the world often sees those who are special regarded as being a threat to society. Among others of the team includes includes some returning characters from the original series such as You Fujiura, Momiji Kanou, and Shirou Magi. They make up the firepower of the team and gives  P.A.N.D.R.A a reason to being so feared and dominant.So, this spinoff takes the setting in a more dark city atmopshere as opposed to the 'family oriented' atmosphere that the original Zettai Karen bought to us years ago. Honestly, who remembers that stuff anyways? In most of today's anime series, the market often aims at viewers for fan service, gore, and those romance subplots. Thankfully, this series avoids most of that and aims directly towards the story along with its strong cast of characters. With his name being set as the title, it is no surprise that Kyousuke gets the most attention even through the flashback scenes we see in later episodes. The other characters aren't omitted either as they all get his or her own little spotlights.The story focuses mainly on the organization that Kyosuke sets up. His idea is to save Espers of his own kind because the way society ostracizes them. In fact, Espers in this spinoff are not seen as saviors of the world but as harbingers of destruction. It can easily be taken the fact even from the pilot episode given Andy's treatment behind that prison. It's cruel for them just because they are “different” from others. The way I see this though is an utter misunderstanding. In fact, some of the people who treats the Espers themselves can be seen as the real monsters to society. It's irony at its very best. However, this shouldn't be entirely be blamed on such trivial accusations that Espers are evil. There have been facts which proves the existence of espers to be a threat in the case of criminals in the series. As a matter of fact, Kyosuke's father ran into a case many years ago that changed his outlook on espers forever.The series seems to lack the ultimatum for its plot. I guess the long story short here is that this spinoff contains way too many mysteries. It starts off fast and keeps its pace here and there. As mentioned before, Kyousuke acts with a plan through his head and cunning strategies. But most of the time, I find that this is almost redundant. The guy is nearly unstoppable and presented as being a boss. His powers of flight, telekinesis, and super strength is overpowered as he takes the skies and dominates in most of his fights. Even from the original series, Kyousuke is calculating and manipulative with his actions. In this spinoff, he is no different and often plays his plans like a chessboard. The pieces are his organization but rather than using them, Kyousuke plays the role of a leader leading them through missions.The action of the series is also full throttle and packed with explosive warfare. It doesn't run through egoistic dialogues and strange gags but gets straight to the point. Otherwise, it does occasionally lack a bit of flavor as it just seems stale. Additionally, I find the characters' designs to be a bit generic. With the lack of fan service, the characters' clothing makes its impression through..generic designs. Their seemingly lack of attractiveness in their outfits also makes their stance a bit dull. The result often leads to a repetitive fight scenes and in general, a lack of flavor. If they were so 'badass', why not go all out and make the skies your God?Oh wait, they don't need to do that since being OP does all that for them already.In terms of overall visuals, I thought the series did a great job here. Taken on the opposite side of the original series, Unlimited makes its way of with more of a cutting dark age background. It's not on a dystopian level but gets its point across in that the world the espers live in is not a paradise. The artwork of the city in fact reflects more of a 'gotham' like atmosphere, one where there are criminals and people who prejudices against others just based on personal outlooks.The characters' design in particular Kyousuke show that they are indeed not normal. I mean, look at that silver hair and you tell me if you see that often in real life. It's definitely not something you see every day.The soundtrack of this spinoff makes a strong impression on me. Its organ plays and style of choice in using more of a dramatic tone enhances the theme of a dark series as opposed to the family-oriented Zettai Karen Children. In other words, most of the soundtrack is serious because the series makes its way of being darkier, edgier, and sexier. (in that Unlimited way) The OP song LΛST RESOLUTION (for some reason performed both in English and Japanese), shows the revolution in which Kyousuke sets towards those who are a threat to espers. Oh and those various ED songs? Pleasure to my ears.Overall, this underrated series gets a score of “8” from me. I don't know about you but Unlimited sure got my attention. No, it's not because I watched the original series so I can get a taste of the spinoff. But rather, the characters, setting, and the general mood of the story gives a more defined way of the psychic world. Despite having some generic/shounen fight styles, I feel that this series pulled it off right. It doesn't seemed to be forced and balances itself well between its subplots. Hell, even the flashback arc was an entertaining watch. Ultimately, I would like to ask people to give this series a shot. It's not perfect but a definitely a way to make your time pass by. At least it did for me. After all, time isn't unlimited so make use of it wisely. This series right here is something you should spent that time on. psychic tale starring....The one and only Hyoubu KyousukeZettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke is a spinoff the original Zettai Karen Children.

Yes, I know that it\'s only winter season, but I don\'t care, I am going to steadfastly stand by that declaration. I have been watching anime for quite some years now, and I\'ve seen some really good ones and some really bad ones. I\'ve seen some that touch my heart and some that make me cringe. However, I have never had one that has consistently from beginning to end, roped me in and...had me anticipating each and every episode with such excitement. I could literally feel the adrenaline rush while watching each episode, and held on to every moment.The plot, the story, the characters, the development amongst them all, all top-notch.The animation was great, action scenes superb, and the music phenomenal, even the hidden messages within are thoughtful.What\'s this show about? It involves an alternate world where there are humans that are normal, and humans that have somehow evolved to the point of having ESP (telepathy, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, etc). Those super-powered people are known as ""espers"". However, as always, humanity has a hard time adjusting to things and people who are different and strange, and so espers have been treated with prejudice as monsters and freaks of nature the world-over. One such esper, with powers even beyond that of other espers, has been ravaged and scarred by such a bigoted society. His name is Major Kyosuke Hyobu and he has, in answer to the injustices against his people, formed an organization that strives to protect espers and their rights as human beings by any means necessary. This organization is known as PANDRA. However, when Major Hyobu meets a peculiar esper named Andy Hinomiya who has secrets of his own, dark storm clouds may soon be in the horizon for PANDRA.One thing to know, is that I love X-Men, and as you can tell, the synopsis sounds very similar to the world that the X-Men live in. Hyobu is often compared to Magneto in many ways, with PANDRA alike to the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. However, I like Hyobu even more, as the man is more powerful, but also more complex, having layers to his psyche and to his character. The other main character of this show, Andy, is the stand-in for the audience and he plays his part well, as one of the most interesting and likable characters in the show.This series is 12 episodes long and while the ending was quite satisfying, I cannot deny that I deeply wish for a sequel. This show was so underrated because of the fact that it is touted as a ""spin-off"" show from a under-performing less-popular 2008 anime, known as Zettai Karen Children or ""Psychic Squad"" in the States. However, this show can stand very well on its own and does not need the other show for exposition. It is completely different in tone and style and the only thing really similar is the setting and characters that have now been transferred to a completely different plot line. Many thought that you had to watch the original series in order to watch this one, and as the original series is 55+ episodes, no one was truly willing to go through that. However, I am here to tell you that I started this show without ever having even heard of Zettai Karen Children. You DO NOT need to see the original show to see this one. You can easily understand everything without having read or watched any original material.Okay, I think I have droned on enough, but I can\'t stress more how awesome this show is. I loved every minute of it and I hope that anyone who looks at it as well will get as much enjoyment out of it as I did. I sincerely hope there will be a second season as 12 episodes just isn\'t enough.Now get out of here and go WATCH IT! had me anticipating each and every episode with such excitement.

Literally not one person i know has even considered it.I've not watched much of the original Zettai Karen Children, the age of the cast, and tone of the show, suggested i wasn't going to get remotely near 50+ episode interest levels.But both short comings are now gone, the show is an appealing 12 episodes, the original cast are all several years older and supporting characters, with a significantly older cast put in place, and the tone seems far more serious. Think the difference between Fate Zero and Fate/Stay Night.Any prior knowledge of the franchise seems completely...optional, I've had no trouble following the events and characters to this point, the pacing is fast and entertaining, the art is reasonable enough, people regularly die, and most of the main cast seem less than indispensable. Theres a reasonable story going on, with the character loyalties remaining up in the air, and lots of morality themes.Not unmissable, but far more people should give this show a try, any fans of action shows, or anything with espers/power users should find this a good watch. optional, I've had no trouble following the events and characters to this point, the pacing is fast and entertaining, the art is reasonable enough, people regularly die, and most of the main cast seem less than indispensable.

It\'s fast paced with lots of action scenes, sarcastic moments, sad moments, pretty much everything. When i first saw the first episode i knew i was going to enjoy this anime.

It\'s fast paced which i like especially for a short series. The plot makes sense, and the pace is very smooth.Art 10/10The art you see in this anime may remind you of the newer animes, like...Hamatora or Jormungand.

It\'s so filling, with every battle scene the background music is insane! Legit hype. Definitely lives up to having one of the best OST\'s out there.Character 7/10The character development is fairly decent. At first you have your Main character, (DONT WORRY NO SPOILERS!) Who\'s trying to find his power. How do they go upon this? Well...he meets new people, and blah blah blah. . It goes on from there!

One of the nice things about this series is while it does have the Zettai Karen Children name slapped to this series, you don\'t actually have to watch the original Zettai Karen Children to understand the story. I certainly hope that didn\'t deter anyone from watching this series, because it nearly deterred me since I originally had no interest in the series. I originally thought you had to watch the first Zettai Karen Children to...follow the plot...and after hearing about how mediocre that series was, I wasn\'t looking forward to it. As I said, you fortunately don\'t have to sit through Zettai Karen Children to understand it since this is more an alternative setting that\'s connected to that series.The story follows the story of a powerful anti-hero esper named Kyousuke Hyoubu that leads PANDRA, a band of espers against a society that generally doesn\'t accept espers equally. Espers are commonly imprisoned or used by government organizations for their own personal gain. The story begins with Kyousuke breaking into an esper prison to rescue one of his PANDRA members that had been imprisoned there. While in the prison, he receives assistance from an inmate named Andy Hinomiya. After successfully accomplishing the prison break, Andy decides to join PANDRA and assist Kyousuke with his goals of recruiting espers and trying to bring an end to humanity\'s rule over espers. However, it turns out Andy has a different goal in mind when he joins the group. Overall, I found the story to be fairly good and the plot itself to be outstanding. I was intrigued by the plot and found it to be an interesting set piece on how unforgiving society can be towards people that can be considered different.The strongest aspect of The Unlimited was its animation. I found the animation to be downright gorgeous. The character designs were precise, clear cut, and reflected the personalities of each character rather well. However, where this series really shined was the atmospheric animation when an esper was releasing their power, like when Kyousuke or Yugiri were releasing their powers. It really did a great job of creating a feel that espers are all-powerful beings and provide a reason why they are feared in a normal human society. My jaw dropped at how gorgeous the animation was when Kyousuke turned off his limiter. I have to give credit to Manglobe, they are on their A-game when they create dark, atmospheric anime like this one. This is not a sunshine and rainbows series. The animation is dark, gritty, and can get downright graphic at times. While I wouldn\'t put it in the same category as a Deadman Wonderland for its grittiness or Ergo Proxy for its dark atmosphere, it seems to do a nice job of balancing the two. It\'s actually impressive considering Shishou Igarashi (Director) and Jun Takagi (Chief Animation Director) aren\'t the most experienced in anime directing. This was definitely a good stepping stone for their careers if they can continue to create animes as polished as this one from an animation standpoint.The music and voice acting was also incredibly strong as well. The music really knew how to set the mood and I have to give a ton of credit to Koutarou Nakagawa for creating such an excellent soundtrack. Personally speaking, I have a lot of respect for his prior works that include Code Geass, Gosick, and Scryed to name a few. He brought out his best for this series as well and it paid off. The seiyuus were also remarkably well-cast, with most of the original Zettai Karen Children cast returning to their roles for this series. Kouji Yusa returned to his role of Kyousuke, which I must be glad for because he seemed to play the role of a mysterious, all-powerful esper perfectly. Junichi Suwabe played the role of the eccentric, but naive Andy quite well and the young, up-and-coming Nao Touyama\'s portrayal of Yugiri was downright adorable. I even got a laugh at how dynamic the castmembers were. Aya Hirano played both Kaoru from The Children AND a young Kyousuke from flashbacks...and the scary part was I couldn\'t even tell she was playing both roles until I read the cast listing. Just more proof that Aya Hirano is one of the best in the business. I will give Manglobe one thing, they do excellent cast work and even I have to admit, I got a chuckle out of the subtle Nostalgia Critic and Angry Video Game Nerd reference in one of the episodes.Where The Unlimited fell a little short in my opinion, with the pun intended, was the length. Considering how detailed the plot was, it felt like there wasn\'t enough time to hash out the characters. It was slightly difficult to get attached to the other PANDRA members besides the leads because their exposure was limited and the supporting cast aboard the Catastrophe didn\'t get a whole lot of development. Although, perhaps they received that development in the original series and I just wasn\'t exposed to it, but it felt a little difficult to become attached to PANDRA\'s team dynamic. Considering the feel of the series, plot elements seemed slightly rushed at times. The team sort of jumped from one plot point to the next with little rhyme or reason. I also found the flashback back story to be a little out of place and slightly mundane. I didn\'t feel as though it added a whole lot to the story...or rather its focus didn\'t add much. It did play a big role in the story as it wore on, but I felt its focus was a bit off since it didn\'t seem to portray Saotome\'s character motivations very well. The way segments were edited during the series, it seemed as though this series was longer, but editorial mandate required things to be cut altogether. ""Cut-and-paste"" is really the best way I can describe this series at times. It didn\'t completely ruin my Unlimited viewing experience, but it was quite noticeable.On the whole, The Unlimited is a REALLY good series to watch if you\'re looking for a supernatural shounen series. It has an awesome plot and an interesting cast of characters (albeit somewhat underdeveloped) with excellent animation and a very nice, atmospheric soundtrack. While I wouldn\'t call The Unlimited an amazing series, I would call it a rather pleasant surprise. I got a lot more than I expected when I started to watch it. It\'s a shame this series just wasn\'t a tad bit longer because there was quite a lot of material to work with. This series certainly had a ton of potential. I did feel this series ended on a pretty good note since it had a satisfying ending. It concluded rather well, but also left enough open to continue if Manglobe does decide to do so. If nothing else, this series certainly did a wonderful job of advertising for its predecessor. I am somewhat intrigued to watch Zettai Karen Children now despite it being considered a somewhat mediocre series by the general public. Perhaps if these two series tie in well together, it might alleviate some areas of mediocrity both series might have had. I would highly recommend this series if you enjoyed animes like To Aru Majutsu no Index or Deadman Wonderland. It has similar psychic elements compared to Index, but also has the beautifully atmospheric animation and social commentary comparable to Deadman Wonderland, although not as gritty. Overall, the Unlimited isn\'t an amazing series, but is still a fun watch for those that enjoy some exciting psychic-powered action. follow the plot...and after hearing about how mediocre that series was, I wasn\'t looking forward to it.

The studio behind this adaptation of the series was handled by Manglobe, the studio behind Deadman's Wonderland, Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, along with a bunch of things I haven't seen. I have no idea what to expect from this one. I'd describe that as intriguing, but the last time I expressed excitement at watching something completely unfamiliar I ended up watching Cheesesteak Suppository. Let's just take a look.The story of Zettai Karen Children: Unlimited, henceforth referred to in this review as ZKC:U for the sake of...brevity, opens with a silver-haired character named Hyoubu Kyousuke using ESP to wreck everything before allowing himself to be captured. He's taken to a prison camp for espers where he meets up with a young man named Hinomiya. The two start bonding and Hyoubu gives Hinomiya some of his food, which happens to be poisoned. Consequently, Hinomiya is taken to another facility. Hyoubu follows and the two escape along with a captured girl known as Yuugiri. Hyoubu offers Hinomiya a position in his organisation,  P.A.N.D.R.A, which is accepted. But Hinomiya has a secret which could threaten Hyoubu and his organisation. The story mainly focuses on Hyoubu, his organisation and their goals. There are some things it does well and some it doesn't. Let's start with the latter. The pacing in this is pretty bad. they put some flashback episodes that don't serve much purpose directly in the middle of the series, which interruptsthe much more interesting action that's going on in the story's present and leaves less time to flesh out the ending. As a result the ending ends up rushed and kind of weak. On the positive side, the world they create is pretty interesting and the story is mostly effective. With everything following a logical progression.The characters in this, with the exceptions of Hyoubu and Hinomiya, aren't particularly well developed. Most characters tend to get either really obvious arcs or be archetypal characters without much to set them apart. That being said, the character interactions are really well done. Hyoubu and Hinomiya are also really interesting characters. Although Hyoubu has some moments that make him seem kind of creepy and make you wonder if he likes little girls in an inappropriate way. Particularly during his dealings with Kaoru. To ZKC:U's credit, it's vague enough that that may or may not be what's going on, but you should never have valid reasons to suspect that your protagonist is a pedophile when they're portrayed in a generally sympathetic way.The art in this is pretty impressive. The character designs look good. The effects when certain espers use their powers are pretty flashy but they never cross into the realm of the ridiculous. The action sequences are, mostly, well done. With the exception of one in particular that happens later on in the series and features antagonists with worse aim than the Stormtroopers in Star Wars. That one just comes across as kind of stupid.The voice acting in this is pretty well done. Suwabe Junichi, Yusa Kouji, and Hirano Aya in particular. The one real weakness is Touyama Nao, who doesn't have any depth of emotion. Although, to be fair, her character is supposed to be emotionally stunted. The music is quite good.The yuri factor is a 1/10. This has no yuri.My final rating for ZKC:U is going to be a 6.4/10. It has some really interesting elements, but Hyoubu's semi-creepy scenes and the pacing do make it quite a bit less enjoyable than it could have been. With all things considered, it's still a decent series but not quite good.Next week I'll look at Gunslinger Girl: Il Teatrino. brevity, opens with a silver-haired character named Hyoubu Kyousuke using ESP to wreck everything before allowing himself to be captured.

Since this is a pretty good show, evidenced by the average high score by the reviews at myanimelist.netMaybe viewers avoided this show due to the name ""Zettai Karen Children"". An anime with a more kiddy style, aiming for a lower age group. From what I have seen from ""Zettai"" (which isn\'t much to be honest). ""The Unlimited"" could almost be a separate anime itself, Art style, Pacing, Character Design and Music are all different. Maybe the action sequences are similar in that the battles are...really well animated and fluid.Story (8/10)The story revolves around 2 protaganists ""Hyoubu Kyousuke"" and undercover investigator ""Andy Hinomiya"". Hyoubu Kyousuke seems to be a major villain from the ""Zettai Karen Children"" anime, and seems his popularity was so high, he now has his own anime series!Story\'s pacing is well done, introducing the massive personality that is Hyoubu and then slowly showing us more and more of this villain\'s life. Stories written around villains are very very rare, this is one of those that probably depicts a tragic hero turned villain.Art (8/10)The art style in ""The Unlimited"" is widely different from the more kiddy ""Zettai Karen Children"". The tones, colour and style is much darker and moodier, very fitting as Hyoubu and his organisation commits mass murder and destruction.... The emphasis was on the ""Cool"" factor of the characters and the battle scenes.Sound (8/10)Voice acting is superb, Hyoubu really sounds like the cool, powerful, confident villain that he is. The voice acting of all the P.A.N.D.R.A terrorist members are well done too. Everyone of them sounds cool and composed, butchering tens and hundreds of enemies like its just another day in the office. Andy Hinomiya sounds exactly like a unconfident, but heroic self sacrificing investigator, and Yugiri sounds like a pure loli trap.Character (9/10)Like my opening statement said, ""Hyoubu Kyousuke"" is so cool, that I think he is the coolest anime character I have ever seen."" Hyoubu sits relaxed in his chair, calm and uncaring, eyes half closed with a half smile on his lips. He lazily snaps his fingers, and suddenly everything and everyone around him blows up in a vortex of psychic powers.... At the end of it all, Hyoubu still sits, eyes half closed with a half smile on his lips, untouched......""The above scene personifies Hyoubu and this anime, dangerous, cool and confident of his powers. Hyoubu could probably dominate many girls\' wet dreams, his aura of danger, confidence, and intelligence combined is massively alluring. He also shows compassion and humanity, adding to his dark charm and charisma that just oozes from the screen.Andy Hinomiya is the exact counterpart of Hyoubu. Unsure of his enemy,but noble and self sacrificing. Self sacrificing enough to go undercover into a terrorist organisation of mind reading psychics who can kill you with a snap of their fingers.Andy\'s character design is slightly weak in my opinion, maybe he will feature more in the later stages. However Andy\'s lack of confidence and flaws work to emphasize Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s coolness.Overall (8/10)Overall a highly enjoyable action anime. It is rare to see animes with murdering villains as their protagonist, and ""The Unliimited"" pulls this off perfectly. From the lack of reviews my guess is that due to the Zettai Karen Children label, viewers aren\'t even checking out episode 1. I highly recommend action anime fans to check this out. This anime is cool, action heavy with fluid battle scenes. Viewers don\'t need to have watched ""Zettai Karen Children"" to enjoy this anime.This anime could be the sleeper hit among the spring 2013 anime season releases.Being bad now seems oh so cool...... really well animated and fluid.Story (8/10)The story revolves around 2 protaganists ""Hyoubu Kyousuke"" and undercover investigator ""Andy Hinomiya"".

Despite the somewhat lack of depth in plot, character development and just not exploring all the settings to the full extent, there\'re a few things I really like in this series.First the protagonist is ideally imperfect, strong and likable. His character is significantly enriched through the 2 episodes about his past as well as throughout the entire anime where he takes on a lot of burden to protect his crew. Here, the flashbacks are...used perfectly for the purpose of augmenting the understanding of his motives. There\'s a lot of potential to this character yet he somehow puts all of his hope in the ""Queen of Catastrophe"". It is a mystery whether he is a true prophet or just a fool. On the other hand, his powers (and the other characters\') and mission plans (especially in the first half) are not explained at all. Although this is not necessary the fault of his character, the quality of the show as an independent piece is quite reduced due to the confusion caused by the lack of explanation.The newly added protagonists are not too thoroughly developed to my disappointment. Especially, the whole set up of the protagonist, Hinomiya, is made to seem like a coincidence and a farce with his superb naivety. It\'s not like he fully trusts his organization in the first place and yet, as fishy as the orders sound, he still goes and does something unwarranted. Also, him being not really ESPer and not completely Normal would\'ve added more depth on his part but wasn\'t delved into at all. Yuugiri\'s role is also not fulfilled for the majority of the show despite being a main character. It is another mystery how she ended up in the prism in the first place.Regarding the story, I really expected much more than what it delivers. The unraveling of the climax is too straightforward and predictable. Also, I find the ending somewhat vague. On a grander look, there\'s not enough light shed on the future where the ESPers and Normals will hold together. I think the main set-back of this anime is the narrow minded psyche as well as the isolation in settings especially since it focuses on a social, cultural and political revolution for the ESPers and for *peace of humanity. Whatever that is.With consideration of the topic\'s complexity, it\'s understandable that the development is unsatisfying. This aspect is similar to X-Men from Marvel.Secondly, from a director\'s standpoint, the pacing and scene cuts are really well done. The op really gets me hyped up and the hue changes depending on the content of each episode. The graphics is standard and character designs are somewhat interesting.Compares to the original, the spin-off is a lot less childish and contains somewhat sophisticated elements such as war, human rights, experimentation... Although I still feel that the anime is aimed for 12 year-olds with the avoidance of exploring gore and death, lousy scientific foundations, flashy action scenes. and weak military defense.Despite its obvious flaws and lack of exploring its full potential, perhaps it has been a little underrated. I would watch it for Kyousuke\'s awesomeness and for a good kill-time but don\'t expect it to be mind blowing. used perfectly for the purpose of augmenting the understanding of his motives.

An esper by the name of Andy Hinomiya with the power to negate esper powers winds up joining PANDRA during one of Kyosuke\'s missions, being a secret agent sent to infiltrate the organization and finding his loyalties to come into question as he becomes more acquainted with PANDRA\'s familial environment and...operations.With Unlimited\'s more serious bent and the focus shifted on Kyosuke, it is more focused on exploring the hostility between espers and humans from his perspective as we come to learn more of the operations and treatment of his fellow espers that our lead is committed to with his organization. This creates some nice intrigue throughout the first half of the series as Kyosuke and PANDRA butt heads with the Children and BABEL at points, serving as nice foil to the differing ideologies that both organizations have regarding the treatment of espers since both sides would be justified in their actions due to the differing circumstances that both groups arose out of. A couple episodes in the second half of the series even provide back story into Kyosuke\'s past with how he developed his beliefs against humans during World War II. The addition of Andy to the mix lends more to the story as well where we see his character\'s internal conflict over whether or not to back Kyosuke\'s cause as he performs his mission due to feeling neglected by both humans and espers due to his negating abilities. Still for those who did enjoy Zettai Karen Children, the Children do pop up alongside the members of BABEL at points throughout this series and there are occasional comedic bits to lighten the mood which don\'t detract too badly from Unlimited\'s more darker storytelling.In spite of my praises though, the series does have its flaws. The final quarter of the series does take a hit a bit quality-wise when the fun gray moral storytelling crosses into more typical ""save the world"" territory when an enemy from Kyosuke\'s past makes his emergence felt in spite of no explanation being provided as to how he survived against Kyosuke decades earlier during the war. The ending felt like a bit of a cop-out as well where the series teased of some dire problems that Kyosuke was facing toward the second half of the series yet the final episode to Unlimited hand waves this issue aside to maintain much of the status quo that the series had from its start. Also, Unlimited isn\'t really breaking any new ground for an anime as there have been a decent number of titles made in recent years depicting dark and serious storytelling mixed with morally grey implications, notable ones being Black Lagoon and Gunslinger Girl.Presentation-wise, Unlimited is an improvement over Zettai Karen Children as the series sports a bigger animation budget. Character designs and scenery shots sport more detail and the color shading is noticeably darker to compliment the title\'s more serious storytelling. In addition, the battle scenes are a treat as many of them feature fluid movement taking place as espers either fight one another using their powers or unleash them against fleets of military forces. There are occasions where the series cuts on some corners with its animation with shortcuts, but it is nowhere as frequent as what Zettai Karen Children did. To flow with the darker storytelling, Unlimited sports a mix of dramatic and J-rock tracks that do their part to compliment key scenes throughout the show\'s run, though the tracks lack much in the way of subtlety for the type of mood that it wants you to believe that Unlimited has.Overall, Unlimited Hyobu Kyosuke makes for a decent alternative to Zettai Karen Children as the focus on Kyosuke lends it some more morally grey implications and offers a solid amount of intrigue over both justifying whether BABEL or PANDRA\'s objectives are right on the esper-human conflict and new series character Andy becoming conflicted over whom he desires to ally with. It does have its bumps in quality for its second half and it doesn\'t break any new ground as titles with dark, serious and morally grey storytelling have been done before. But if you are looking for a psychic-action title that is a decent time killer, then Unlimited offers just that. operations.With Unlimited\'s more serious bent and the focus shifted on Kyosuke, it is more focused on exploring the hostility between espers and humans from his perspective as we come to learn more of the operations and treatment of his fellow espers that our lead is committed to with his organization.

In fact, having not watched the original may make this series all the more enjoyable to watch because everything will be new and you’ll be able to watch without previously formed opinions.The artwork is extremely visually appealing. It leaved the childish, overly cartoon-like appearance of the original Zettai Karen Children and enters a more realistic and alluring style. The characters are drawn with dramatic features that draw you in and...emphasize the mysteriousness of the storyline.The characters themselves are seriously one of a kind. Hyoubu, leader of P.A.N.D.R.A. and one of the main characters, is a bit silly, somewhat immature but adamant in his belief. He is strong-willed and cares deeply for his people. Andy is the newest member of P.A.N.D.R.A. his past is very mysterious. Andy gains a lot of attention either for his fighting or for being ridiculed. You’ll find yourself questioning him frequently. Yugiri is a child with abilities stronger than imagined. She provides a sense of innocence and a common ground for Hyoubu and Andy.The storyline is amazing. The main storyline leaves you wanting the next episode to come sooner. While they also present a side storyline, by constantly highlighting the mysteriousness of Hyoubu’s past and his life presently. The events of his past and childhood are tastefully revealed and weaved into the main plot carefully and thoughtfully. The series does not waste a single episode, and uses its episode frame effectively as to pack in everything without rushing the plot.

The description had sold me when it mentioned a silver hair, which for me Silver/white hair is my favorite color of hair. I had no idea what to expect when entering this series.So what I got was awesome. Hyobu is an extremely entertaining character who is not only OP he also tends to be a bit of a troll. Though his can character can be very serious at times in the later parts.The co-star of our story is Andy Hinomiya (a guy who looks strangely like Shun Asanaga from Endride), a character...Hyobu found in jail(presumably because of Endride) and adds to his crew of loyal followers and a cute little girl.the rest of the crew isn't really that important, except for the little girl Yugiri, whose the shy type. The other side characters are the main characters of the show this is a spin-off of, Zettai Karen Children or Psychic Squad. These characters oddly felt much more important than the other members of the crew(especially near the end).One thing I really liked in this anime was the music, I love this soundtrack. The opening is all forms of awesome, and the ending themes(yes I said themes) are spectacular, special props to Darkness Night, which sets up some of the darker tones. One problem I find with having multiple endings though is that unless your that you'd have to re-watch a bit, as there is one ending that lasts only an episode.The animation is also really good for an anime original. This anime, along with Kabaneri of the iron fortress, and a few other shows, is raising my hopes for anime originals.I can say that this show is a must watch, though there is some plot brought up that you would probably need to read the manga to view.

"", ""First things first:This is a standalone anime. By no means do you have to know anything about the original series to understand or enjoy this one. In fact, I never had even heard of the original series, and when I did look into it, it seemed totally out of my interest zones due to the Loli and little girl bullshit. I hate cutesy anime, and I don't even really like typical Shonen/fighting anime, so I don't plan on watching it anytime soon.The unlimited is, sadly, relatively unknown and therefore under appreciated.It's equal parts mystery, fighting and alternative history, and it does almost...everything right.A recent show that actually has gotten much hype and critical acclaim that I could compare The Unlimited to would be Bungo Stray Dogs- more the second season than the first, as the first season of BSD was riddled with randomness and unfunny jokes, while the second season was darker and more character oriented. This show is very character oriented, and towards the middle and end delves into particular characters history and psyche very admirably.Although it is sometimes seemingly episodic, there is a definite main story that never fails to entertain. Although much of the second half of the show is serious, and sometimes the show can even get quite dark, the family-like dynamic that builds between the characters always keeps things light enough to be enjoy as a casual show as well.The cliffhangers between episodes made it so I finished this show in just a few days. It's quite short, but it doesn't waste a minute, so the story is actually well rounded and doesn't disappoint near the end- like so many anime that are front-loaded with intriguing story, but fail to deliver and eventually feel like a waste of time.This show was obviously a labor of love for the crew behind it, and the quality of the show shines through in every episode.There are definitely some original X-men cartoon vibes here, but not nearly as much as some other reviewers have suggested. I'd go so far as to say this show outshines anything in the x-men universe anyway.Mystery, espers, WWII, modern day Japan, a magic ship 🚢 and some government agents, plus a tight knit group of friends - what do they have in common?The Unlimited, of course. everything right.A recent show that actually has gotten much hype and critical acclaim that I could compare The Unlimited to would be Bungo Stray Dogs- more the second season than the first, as the first season of BSD was riddled with randomness and unfunny jokes, while the second season was darker and more character oriented.

It is visually awesome, the story is pretty good and the characters are likeable for the most part. I have only just watched episode 7 so cant really say its great just yet as it could all go horribly wrong but the end of the series...I hope not.Its a bit of fun, nothing to take seriously and an easy watch - so far 8-9/10 ', 'I got about halfway through this before I had to bail.REVIEW NOTE: I only remember the name of our first main character, Kyousuke and didn\'t really bother to go back and look the rest up. I may edit this review to reflect that later.The show starts off really interesting, with one of our main characters being chased down by the military and taking down troops, tanks, and helicopters by himself with a barrage of psychic powers. This showed off the show\'s one truly great aspect- the animation good and the actions scenes are kickass. However, then this same guy turns himself in to a prison...specifically for psychics for reasons I don\'t even remember, and winds up recruiting our duertagonist of the series along the way- who reveals that he had PLANNED for this to happen as part of an infiltration of their organization. All before the end of the first episode.I literally shouted ""Bullshit!"" at my screen. This sadly happens a few more times when watching this show.I\'ve seen the ""undercover cop infiltrates a criminal organization"" plot before, but the way this one was set up was bizarre, inconsistent, left me with a lot of questions, and it didn\'t even have the decency to own how crazy and improbable the events of the first episode were- you\'re expected to take this completely seriously.Thankfully this is (mostly) the weirdest it gets plot-wise and most of the rest of the show up until the point I stopped watching is an interesting but somewhat weird show about a group of criminals who fight for the rights of oppressed psychics. Then the plot showed up and I spent the rest of the ride lost and confused and my issues with this show became a bit less annoying and more problematic:1) The actual plot apparently involves our two main characters nominally on opposite ends of a plot to raise the status of psychic people. I say nominally because they\'re rarely in actual conflict. Kyosuke\'s plan is to put in place a new world ruler with his chosen ""Queen"" being someone who wants absolutely nothing to do with this plan and how he plans to ensure her compliance is never explained at least as far as I watched. Anyone who\'s seen the show in full and knows details I don\'t is free to clarify this.2) The psychic powers this series revolves around aren\'t really well explained. The show does a great job worldbuilding and we see what a society with people with weird-ass psychic powers is like (X-Men comes to mind here) however we don\'t know why they exist, the details of how they work, or why Kyousuke and a few other characters are so much stronger than everyone else. There\'s limiters that exist to help psychics dampen their powers but they don\'t seem NECESSARY as the only characters who use them have very solid control over their powers already. The only time we see them in action is when Kyousuke wants to show he\'s being serious and gets a ""power up"" animation for very little adequate reason.3) This is probably the worst one for me. There\'s a small girl on the team (Somewhere around six or seven) with uncontrollable powers. She doesn\'t get a limiter despite the cast making it a huge deal about having them and how important they are. The majority of her screen time is split two ways between being an adorable child that exists to make sure the viewer knows these are, in fact, the good guys and being placed in mildly compromising situations so the show can crassly make loli jokes at the duertagonist\'s expense purely for the sake of it.Taken individually, these three things were annoying and distracting, but not show-breaking.

So don't expect a puella magi madoka magica. but it's actually not that bad, a little standard but also some little twists to keep everyone hooked.

The series has 9 endings if I counted correctly, so +/- 1 or so in real probably. the opening scenes also change but the song stayes the same. The music adds to the series and it's wonderfully done, but personally no real chill down the spine sound that caught my attention. Still, quality is amazing so way to go.Characters:it's a 12 episode series, so how deep can you go with character development.

The main characters, however, do get a proper background story and development on their part is surely not disappointing.

It's somewhat different to...the parent storys art, 'sharper' I'd say, but I really like it.The characters are what make this for me, Hyoubu being the main is much more interesting than the children in the main story, he has an interesting past and a goal, problems and personality and doesn't seem to stray far from what we saw of him in the parent story with maybe the exception of his strength. We also finally find out what Fujiyuras power is and the threes relationship to Hyoubu. The New character Andy also adds to the plot making it just that bit interesting with his own agender.As a spin off I actually much prefer it to the Parent story, probably because of the main character and the fact the 'children' are grown and, well frankly less annoying. For me it's one of those animes I really love and simply can barely contain myself waiting on the next episode.

For me it's one of those animes I really love and simply can barely contain myself waiting on the next episode. Those of you who dont have to wait, well...you lucky Buggers lol."", ""I don't think its blind fanatism, instead, I truly believe this is one of the best anime of all time, that. without a shadow of a doubt deserved way more seasons and an expansion to the story. The characters where incredible, the settings, the topics, everything the unlimited touched turned to gold. Its truly a shame to look back at it 6 years later and think of it as an abandoned project, when it could have been so much more. An amazing anime with very little appreciation or consideration. If you haven't yet, give it a watch, you won't be disappointed in any corner. I...hope someone gets to see this and responds because unlimited fans are on short supply and these days. Also one small detail, Last resolution may very well be one of the best songs produced for an anime, it's up there with 99.9 and other great themes like bloddy stream.

Moreover, Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s role as a protagonist in ""The Unlimited"" demonstrates why he is superior to Kaoru.(This review may discusses both ""Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke"" and its parent series for a more thorough analysis.)[Story]1. Deeper Exploration of Espers:""The Unlimited"" delves deeper into the lives and challenges faced by espers, those with psychic abilities, in a society that fears and discriminates against...them. This narrative focus on the espers\' struggles adds depth to the story, giving viewers a more comprehensive understanding of their world. In contrast, the parent story, while touching on similar themes, does not explore them as thoroughly.2. Morally Complex Themes:""The Unlimited"" presents morally complex themes through Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s actions. As an anti-hero, he blurs the lines between right and wrong, forcing viewers to contemplate the concept of justice. This moral ambiguity provides a thought-provoking layer to the series that the parent story lacks.3. Character Development:Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s character development is a highlight of ""The Unlimited."" He undergoes a significant transformation throughout the series, grappling with his past, his choices, and his role in the world. This evolution makes him a more dynamic and relatable character than Kaoru, who experiences growth but does not face the same level of moral ambiguity.4. Exploration of Power:""The Unlimited"" delves into the consequences of immense power, particularly through Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s abilities. This exploration of power dynamics and their impact on individuals and society adds a layer of intrigue that sets it apart from the parent story.5. Hyoubu Kyousuke as Protagonist:While Kaoru is a central character in the parent story, Hyoubu Kyousuke takes the reins as the protagonist in ""The Unlimited."" His character is multifaceted, with a traumatic past that influences his actions. His willingness to embrace morally gray areas, coupled with his charismatic presence, makes him a more captivating lead than Kaoru.[Character]While Kaoru, the main character of the original ""Zettai Karen Children"" series, is undoubtedly a vital part of the story, Hyoubu Kyousuke takes center stage in ""The Unlimited."" His character is more morally complex, which adds layers of intrigue to the narrative. While Kaoru\'s journey is one of growth and self-discovery, but Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s character arc is more dynamic and emotionally charged. He\'s an anti-hero who challenges conventions, and that makes him a standout protagonist.1. Complexity and Depth:Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s character is multi-faceted and complex. As the leader of PANDRA, a group of individuals with psychic powers, he grapples with the responsibilities of leading his team while pursuing his vision of a world where espers can live freely.

In contrast, Kaoru, while being protagonist of the series, lacks the same level of depth and complexity.2. Strong Motivations:Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s unwavering determination to protect and empower espers is a driving force in the series. His motivation is clear, and viewers can empathize with his desire for espers to live without fear of persecution. Kaoru\'s motivations are relatively straightforward, primarily centered around her friends and her sense of justice, but they don\'t carry the same weight as Hyoubu\'s.3. Moral Ambiguity:Hyoubu Kyousuke\'s willingness to employ morally ambiguous means to achieve his goals adds an intriguing layer to his character. He constantly challenges the boundaries of right and wrong, forcing viewers to question their own moral perspectives. Kaoru, by contrast, tends to follow a more traditional path of heroism, which, can be less thought-provoking.4. Screen Presence:Whenever Hyoubu Kyousuke is on screen, he exudes charisma and gravitas. His commanding presence captures the audience\'s attention and leaves a lasting impression. Kaoru, while a central character, doesn\'t possess the same level of magnetism.[Art/Animation]1.

Although there are plot twist, they are predictable and the character\'s boring, wish-washy nature made the dialogue sections long and skippable. The beautiful animation and battle scenes truly saved this show in my opinion.Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke is the spinoff of the anime, Zettai Karen Children. I will begin this review by saying no, you don\'t have to watch the original to understand what\'s happening in The Unlimited. This is pretty much a stand alone show. You can go in totally blind.For a 12 episode anime, the...pacing is decent. Although I did find that some integral information was revealed too early, and the dialogue sections were extremely long winded. After episode 8 or 9, I found myself skipping the majority of the episodes because I wasn\'t interested in the background and lore of our favorite anti-hero, Hyoubu.Without getting to into it and revealing any spoilers, Hyoubu\'s story isn\'t that unique. He\'s an esper who wants to seek revenge on all ""normals"" for how they treated him and his friends. This is a fairly common trope in esper fiction. I will say that Hyoubu felt like the only character with any real sense of motivation behind his actions. I found all the other characters to be severely lacking in this department.If you have ever watched or read the parent series, Zettai Karen Children"", you will know of the organization B.A.B.E.L. While Hyoubu is the leader of the villainous group, P.A.N.D.R.A, B.A.B.E.L is a pillar of justice and seeks to arrest the evildoers at any cost. Except...not really? From the moment they are introduced, you are to believe that their only goal is to arrest Hyoubu and his gang, and stop them from their rampage of destruction across the world. And while that is their goal, it is only something secondary to them. In actuality, they want to save Hyoubu from himself and they believe rapid fire missiles are going to do the job.Up until the episode where the writer\'s had to explicitly tell us such, I would have never known that was what they were trying to do. Their characters never tried to convey that sentiment through their actions. To me, it felt extremely disingenuous.This is my biggest problem with The Unlimited. Besides the characters lacking the general drive/motivation to take action, they also tend to be extremely wishy-washy with their convictions.  The biggest criminal of this would be Andy Hinomiya. I won\'t go into his origin, but, if you watch the first episode you will quickly find out. One second he thinks one way, another something else. Oh but, I can\'t do that. I must focus on my original task. But...It\'s like an never-ending cycle of indecisiveness that leads up all the way until the very end of the anime. I found it to be extremely vexing because in his indecisive daze, he ends up saving the day.Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke had a lot of potential to be something great. Yes, there were plot twist but they were all fairly predictable. However, besides the beautiful fight scenes and art, I would have probably ended up dropping this series half way. Besides Hyoubu, none of the characters were likable or memorable and the story was predictable enough that you could skim through episodes and would\'ve have missed a thing. I began writing this review with a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction. The ending wasn\'t exactly what I had been expecting.Although there was some good fights towards the end, nothing overly dramatic or awe-inspiring happened. I was left with the basic, ""It\'s the start of a new era,"" type of vibe. For me, this was especially disappointing because the few episodes prior made me feel like we ever on the homestretch the D-day. I was expecting the last battle to truly be the last, but eventually the sun broke through the clouds and ultimately we reached a happy ending. That\'s....okay, I guess.If you are interested in the anti-hero esper vibe that The Unlimited presents, I would definitely recommend you try out ""A Certain Scientific Accelerator"". pacing is decent.

Aikatsu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15061/Aikatsu,"['When I was first taught about ""idols"" as a child, we knew them as false gods. Then I started watching anime and I realized it\'s practically the same thing for Japan.*Original review of the first 50 episodes follows. For an overview of the rest, scroll down*Aikatsu! follows the idol trend of the past few years. These are shows about cute young girls singing and dancing that look like they\'re for young girls but are actually for grown men, only this time around it actually is for young girls (it has some periphery demographic, though). It follows a group of middle school friends led by Hoshimiya...Ichigo learning to become idols at Starlight Academy through various ""idol activities.""But what are ""idol activities?""Singing and dancing are definitely involved and, as one would expect, are the primary concern. But that\'s not all, oh no. Aikatsu! delves much further into the idol world than that which we see on the stage at concerts (and probably further than reality). These girls take long runs, chop down giant trees, scale mountains with their bare hands, and navigate trap-ridden haunted houses. I\'m not even exaggerating here, all of those things literally happen in the show. It\'s no thriller, but there are a few surprising times where you wonder where these girls get the strength and courage to face these obstacles.But being an idol isn\'t all about training your body, either. Being an idol is also an image and representation. When you become popular, you get fans, and you need to be sure you don\'t let those fans down; this fact is not ignored. There is a certain episode in which Ichigo becomes overly worried about making a good signature and being able to do it fast when it comes time for her to meet fans and sign things for them. The problem is that she forgets the ""meet fans"" part, and only focuses on the signing, a fact that is soon brought to her attention by a friend, making her realize that she had been letting fans down who not only wanted to get a signature, but also to simply see her face and talk to her a bit.Further, there\'s an image to maintain. This is a fine line that could have easily fallen into the territory of shaming non-perfect body types, and even arguably toes the line at best. When Christmas break comes and it\'s time for Ichigo to go home for a couple weeks, she can\'t resist her mother\'s cooking; she eats and eats and gets...big. The people around her are disappointed with her, but not because of her new shape; it is because of how she let herself go, how she allowed herself to be lazy and leave her idol activities at the door step when she came in.At 50 episodes, there\'s a lot of time to develop story and characters. As one might guess from the above, most of the story is episodic, but there is still a certain continuation to everything. New idols are introduced and have bigger roles in subsequent episodes, a lesson learned in one episode will continue to be put into practice throughout the show, and as our girls get ever more popular both in the academy and in the outside world, things get busier. There are times where we might see a string of slice-of-life episodes followed by a slightly more dramatic story arc, but these never come too suddenly to feel out of place. They start reasonably and end well, with the possible exception of one near the end where it seems as though idol units begin to grow on trees and the viewers are left wondering who belongs where and what this sub-group, should they actually exist, is even doing.Lead protagonist is Hoshimiya Ichigo, with main support Kiriya Aoi and Shibuki Ran. Ichigo is a cheerful girl, always happy, but not always very smart. She decides she wants to do something and she goes and does it, no hesitation. Sometimes things work out great. Other times they don\'t. She doesn\'t take these moments for granted, but she doesn\'t let them get her down; she bounces back, taking what she\'s learned and applying it for the future. She\'s the kind of character who just attracts other people to her.But she wouldn\'t be able to do that without such great friends. First up is Aoi, her childhood friend who showed Ichigo her first idol concert that made both want to be idols and convinced them to apply for Starlight Academy. Aoi is the ""idol professor."" She knows everything about idols. No, really. Everything. She\'s also an idol herself and Ichigo\'s #1 fan and as such, knows how to keep the peppy blonde in check...while occasionally succumbing to the craziness herself.And then there\'s Ran, the most mature member of the trio. She is first introduced as being popular around the academy for her cold, no-smile demeanor, having a confidence built up due to having years of entertainment experience under her belt before having even entered Starlight Academy. Getting her to warm up to Ichigo and Aoi was not easy, but when she finally allowed them to break the ice with her, we see what is really a very calm and caring personality and an irreplaceable source of confidence, even if she is sometimes the one who needs it the most.But there are a lot of characters here. Kanzaki Mizuki, the aloof and mysterious upperclassman and most popular idol at the academy who only very rarely shows a more emotional side (but don\'t worry, she does) is the most prominent support. She is the endgame, the goal everyone else is trying to reach, but a rival that always moving ever forward. A lot about her is left in mystery, but we\'re also given a lot of tidbits that show her to not be the 100% perfect being she\'s made out to be, and she never lets up, considering that, while she provides motivation for others, those behind her are also what motivates her to keep going.But again, there are a lot of characters, many of whom don\'t really get a chance to be fully realized. The extra idols with recurring parts, which include Otome, Yurika, Shion, Sakura, and Kaede, largely fall into this group. All of them at least an episode or two dedicated to their development, but afterwards they occasionally may make things feel too crowded and will largely stick to their base personality for the rest of the show without ever really being focused on again. It\'s a bit of a shame, but it was a trade-off for the extra focus on the show\'s main group.However, the show doesn\'t ignore any characters. There are multiple side characters who could easily have been left by the wayside but get their time in the spotlight, such as dance instructor Johnny Bepp (who, yes, does play a pirate in one episode) and Ichigo\'s mother, father, and little brother. These sessions are largely abrupt, but short and sweet. They really help to develop the relationships all around, giving all the characters more depth, all while not sacrificing the main focus of the show.And what is the main focus of the show? What do you think is the main focus of a show about idols? Music!Oh, we\'re definitely treated to music in this show. Every single episode climaxes in a concert scene. It\'s not a different song every episode, but it is changed up enough that by the time you begin to grow tired of a song, they start using a new one. Also, the first ED, Calendar Girl, is amazing and actually well portrays the show\'s eventual theme. Overall, though, while even Aikatsu!, like others of its kind, may seem to occasionally throw in more songs to advertise new singles, it never really feels out of place within the context of the show because most of what the characters are doing are related to their job as idols and leads up to the eventual musical piece.But speaking of those concerts and advertising...there are some weird things going on.One can\'t write a review of Aikatsu! without mentioning the forbidden fruit of commercial anime: cards. Aikatsu! too wants to sell you some cards. In the show, these cards are their outfits and are...generated?...in the Aikatsu machine for the concerts. Yeah, it\'s weird, but it doesn\'t tiptoe around it. Much effort is spent on matching up each member\'s outfit with everyone else and getting new cards for new outfits to fit a different occasion, including the special ""premium"" cards that are only given to the most worthy of idols. At the end of the day, it\'s hard to say if this was purely an advertisement gimmick, a legitimate-if-strange part of the story, or something in between.There\'s also this thing they do during concerts called ""special appeal."" It\'s hard to even describe what these are since it really isn\'t grounded in reality at all, but it\'s this mid-concert thing that typically only takes a few seconds to do and ranges from spinning around wildly to shooting a heart with an arrow. They\'re supposed to be these things that make a concert and performer more impressive in some way, but it\'s never made clear what the actual purpose of them is or why they exist at all. There\'s even an episode focused on them, but all we really learn is that most idols can only do 1 per concert while Mizuki can pull off 3. Around the halfway point of the show they\'re never really brought up again, but they still appear in the concerts.Things are very pretty (and pink) in Aikatsu! land, but a little rough around the edges. Character designs are distinct and animation is typically fluid, but at the forefront of every episode\'s concert is a sequence of re-used animation where the girls are inserting their Aikatsu cards into the Aikatsu machine. The concert scenes are all in CGI, which can be a bit daunting next to the 2d animation of the rest of the show (which sometimes even appears for the audience during concerts). A quick eye can see commonly re-used background characters, not really a problem in most cases since I also see the same people every day at school, but the worst offender is a particular scene where the headmistress is addressing an assembly of girls and the two halves, hair color aside, are mirrored, like each girl has a twin sitting in the same position but on the other side of the room.At the end of the day, Aikatsu! is just a happy show. Its run time is used very well, as it doesn\'t have to crank out material before its inevitable end and viewers are given plenty of time to get attached to the characters without having to leave them so soon. Certain episodes later on in the show really wouldn\'t have even worked without the kind of run time this show had; the impact they made just wouldn\'t be the same in a short series.Aikatsu! is also not for everyone. It is a kid\'s show and even fans who usually like idol shows such as Love Live and Idolm@ster may not be able to get the same enjoyment from this one. Feel free to judge this one by its cover; if a group of young girls in frilly dresses over a pink background doesn\'t seem like your kind of show, don\'t watch it. But if you do like this kind of stuff, or just feel like giving it a shot, you ought to like what you come in for.***The rest of it***And then there was more. And more. And then a little bit more. But I\'ll make this quick.Season 2 of Aikatsu, episodes 51-101, aka the dark ages of Aikatsu. Dream Academy, a rival school, is introduced, and with it the most frustrating time for Aikatsu fans. The new characters are poorly developed and seem to be way too talented right out the gate. Where the first season was fine with having characters lose, suddenly we see a bunch of ties happening. There are, however, good episodes in all this. Oozora Akari is introduced midway through and is immediately lovable, overturning everything bad in the rest of the season. Basically, any episode that doesn\'t have a great focus on Dream Academy characters is at least decent.Season 3 of Aikatsu, episodes 102-153 (somewhere around there, anyway), the Akari generation. There is a new protagonist, and while the old cast is still around, they are now side characters. The producers seem to have realized that everyone hated Dream Academy and more or less dropped them from the show entirely (they appear maybe 3 or 4 more times for the remaining duration of the show). The show goes back to its roots and, despite having a few more rough patches than before, is once again the Aikatsu we know and love (if you\'ve gotten this far, you must love it).Season 4 of Aikatsu, episodes 154-end, the...actually, it\'s just more of the Akari generation. Which is good! They didn\'t fall into the season 2 pitfall for the climax. And the actual climax itself was pretty great, being a story arc that lasted longer than any other since the one that capped off the first season and was a great way to end the series.Season 1, the first 50 episodes (and the movie, which was amazing), remains my favorite era of Aikatsu, but the last year and a half were certainly a worthy addition. At its best, Aikatsu was lovable, heartwarming, and maybe even a little tear-jerking. At its worst, I was shouting ""NO! NO! NO!"" at the screen in frustration. It had its ups and downs, but in the end it\'s become a series very close to my heart. I will miss the girls of Starlight Academy. Ichigo learning to become idols at Starlight Academy through various ""idol activities.""But what are ""idol activities?""Singing and dancing are definitely involved and, as one would expect, are the primary concern. But that\'s not all, oh no. Aikatsu! delves much further into the idol world than that which we see on the stage at concerts (and probably further than reality). These girls take long runs, chop down giant trees, scale mountains with their bare hands, and navigate trap-ridden haunted houses. I\'m not even exaggerating here, all of those things literally happen in the show. It\'s no thriller, but there are a few surprising times where you wonder where these girls get the strength and courage to face these obstacles.But being an idol isn\'t all about training your body, either. Being an idol is also an image and representation. When you become popular, you get fans, and you need to be sure you don\'t let those fans down; this fact is not ignored. There is a certain episode in which Ichigo becomes overly worried about making a good signature and being able to do it fast when it comes time for her to meet fans and sign things for them. The problem is that she forgets the ""meet fans"" part, and only focuses on the signing, a fact that is soon brought to her attention by a friend, making her realize that she had been letting fans down who not only wanted to get a signature, but also to simply see her face and talk to her a bit.Further, there\'s an image to maintain. This is a fine line that could have easily fallen into the territory of shaming non-perfect body types, and even arguably toes the line at best. When Christmas break comes and it\'s time for Ichigo to go home for a couple weeks, she can\'t resist her mother\'s cooking; she eats and eats and gets...big. The people around her are disappointed with her, but not because of her new shape; it is because of how she let herself go, how she allowed herself to be lazy and leave her idol activities at the door step when she came in.At 50 episodes, there\'s a lot of time to develop story and characters. As one might guess from the above, most of the story is episodic, but there is still a certain continuation to everything. New idols are introduced and have bigger roles in subsequent episodes, a lesson learned in one episode will continue to be put into practice throughout the show, and as our girls get ever more popular both in the academy and in the outside world, things get busier. There are times where we might see a string of slice-of-life episodes followed by a slightly more dramatic story arc, but these never come too suddenly to feel out of place. They start reasonably and end well, with the possible exception of one near the end where it seems as though idol units begin to grow on trees and the viewers are left wondering who belongs where and what this sub-group, should they actually exist, is even doing.Lead protagonist is Hoshimiya Ichigo, with main support Kiriya Aoi and Shibuki Ran. Ichigo is a cheerful girl, always happy, but not always very smart. She decides she wants to do something and she goes and does it, no hesitation. Sometimes things work out great. Other times they don\'t. She doesn\'t take these moments for granted, but she doesn\'t let them get her down; she bounces back, taking what she\'s learned and applying it for the future. She\'s the kind of character who just attracts other people to her.But she wouldn\'t be able to do that without such great friends. First up is Aoi, her childhood friend who showed Ichigo her first idol concert that made both want to be idols and convinced them to apply for Starlight Academy. Aoi is the ""idol professor."" She knows everything about idols. No, really. Everything. She\'s also an idol herself and Ichigo\'s #1 fan and as such, knows how to keep the peppy blonde in check...while occasionally succumbing to the craziness herself.And then there\'s Ran, the most mature member of the trio. She is first introduced as being popular around the academy for her cold, no-smile demeanor, having a confidence built up due to having years of entertainment experience under her belt before having even entered Starlight Academy. Getting her to warm up to Ichigo and Aoi was not easy, but when she finally allowed them to break the ice with her, we see what is really a very calm and caring personality and an irreplaceable source of confidence, even if she is sometimes the one who needs it the most.But there are a lot of characters here. Kanzaki Mizuki, the aloof and mysterious upperclassman and most popular idol at the academy who only very rarely shows a more emotional side (but don\'t worry, she does) is the most prominent support. She is the endgame, the goal everyone else is trying to reach, but a rival that always moving ever forward. A lot about her is left in mystery, but we\'re also given a lot of tidbits that show her to not be the 100% perfect being she\'s made out to be, and she never lets up, considering that, while she provides motivation for others, those behind her are also what motivates her to keep going.But again, there are a lot of characters, many of whom don\'t really get a chance to be fully realized. The extra idols with recurring parts, which include Otome, Yurika, Shion, Sakura, and Kaede, largely fall into this group. All of them at least an episode or two dedicated to their development, but afterwards they occasionally may make things feel too crowded and will largely stick to their base personality for the rest of the show without ever really being focused on again. It\'s a bit of a shame, but it was a trade-off for the extra focus on the show\'s main group.However, the show doesn\'t ignore any characters. There are multiple side characters who could easily have been left by the wayside but get their time in the spotlight, such as dance instructor Johnny Bepp (who, yes, does play a pirate in one episode) and Ichigo\'s mother, father, and little brother. These sessions are largely abrupt, but short and sweet. They really help to develop the relationships all around, giving all the characters more depth, all while not sacrificing the main focus of the show.And what is the main focus of the show? What do you think is the main focus of a show about idols? Music!Oh, we\'re definitely treated to music in this show. Every single episode climaxes in a concert scene. It\'s not a different song every episode, but it is changed up enough that by the time you begin to grow tired of a song, they start using a new one. Also, the first ED, Calendar Girl, is amazing and actually well portrays the show\'s eventual theme. Overall, though, while even Aikatsu!, like others of its kind, may seem to occasionally throw in more songs to advertise new singles, it never really feels out of place within the context of the show because most of what the characters are doing are related to their job as idols and leads up to the eventual musical piece.But speaking of those concerts and advertising...there are some weird things going on.One can\'t write a review of Aikatsu! without mentioning the forbidden fruit of commercial anime: cards. Aikatsu! too wants to sell you some cards. In the show, these cards are their outfits and are...generated?...in the Aikatsu machine for the concerts. Yeah, it\'s weird, but it doesn\'t tiptoe around it. Much effort is spent on matching up each member\'s outfit with everyone else and getting new cards for new outfits to fit a different occasion, including the special ""premium"" cards that are only given to the most worthy of idols. At the end of the day, it\'s hard to say if this was purely an advertisement gimmick, a legitimate-if-strange part of the story, or something in between.There\'s also this thing they do during concerts called ""special appeal.""

I will miss the girls of Starlight Academy.', 'Aikatsu! - Sigil of Second Wind (Updated 8/3/2022)You know the drill. As usual, this is not exactly a review in the conventional sense, as it mostly focuses on analyzing the series as a whole rather than acting as an advertisement or recommendation to entice somebody to try the series out.**This “review” is SPOILER-HEAVY and is recommended for those who have already completed the series. A large number of events will be referred to and may be used as examples in various ways.****This “review” will never be “complete” and I may be continually updating it in the future as I better collect more of my thoughts.**This...analysis may be somewhat messily written or seem to lack any sort of overarching structure. It is merely my personal thoughts and things I\'ve realized while watching the series. Everything is subject to change as my perspective towards the media I consume continues to evolve.Aikatsu! is unquestionably among the most refreshing titles that I\'ve encountered in a long time, shattering my expectations as for what I envisioned it would be as overall possibly the most enjoyable anime I\'ve ever completed. After stagnating in regards to anime consumption for quite some time, I felt that I had nearly entirely lost the ability to follow something continuously, though upon cleaning up my plan to watch list, I was struck with an epiphany in how only takes the correct title to get going again.Right off the bat, something of note is that while the series boasts neither the greatest visuals, nor the most complex narrative, the original Aikatsu!, standing at a colossal 178-episodes with the added bonus of movies and whatnot, is a rather ambitious title to say the least, originating on a much smaller scale as a simple rise-to-the-top story at first glance, following Ichigo and her best friend, Aoi, their embarkment on the road to become top idols, yet as the series progresses, the cast dramatically expands to include dozens of faces, the focus distributed between both the many main and side characters alike, nevertheless without ever compromising the journey of its primary protagonists. It\'s a children’s show that largely succeeds in impressing me, even in spite of my appreciation of other strong titles geared towards the same demographic, and hence being less impressionable.The series’s greatest strengths lie with its characters, their interactions and development over a long span of time. This isn\'t to say that Aikatsu! has the most complex characters, as many do not particularly stray from common tropes and archetypes, but over time, many have their individual struggles both highlighted and explored while remaining ever-present throughout its run. I found myself growing to enjoy the occasions when characters that I initially didn\'t even like were centered then upon to unveil a new side and hence create a new sense of appreciation. As follows, at this point, I don’t think there\'s any singular cast member which I can point to and say I dislike. Of course, not every character is explored to an equivalent extent, but most of even the secondary protagonists are given some spotlight and maintain their own following, if not already affecting the series’ universe in some notable way. Even characters as minor as Yuu, being Akari\'s initial roommate, have been utilized in multiple ways, an example being her exchange student experience playing a role in shaping her to become a travel idol, allowing both Miyabi and Kotone to come to Starlight as a secondary implication, with Yuu’s newfound motivation to further herself derived from the aforementioned experience of having Akari as her roommate. I essentially mean that even characters that appear uncommonly are hardly wasted, or at least feel like they could assume some believable position in the Aikatsu world. Once again, the cast is massive and the series does a fairly good job of using members to exemplify different potential paths for idols within the same industry, not even specifically limited to the type of idol they represent in terms of “cool” or “cute,” but in regards to the different branching routes sprouting from the same root, displaying a divergence between skillsets such as acting, modelling and comedy, and even specialties in regards to Sumire’s singing and Rin’s dancing being their emphasis or even having Yurika epitomize the idea of idols taking on a persona and sticking to it with utmost diligence. “Everyone moves at different paces” is a common motif present throughout, and additionally, everyone also comes to move in their own direction. The way that characters continue to evolve and how their screen presence slowly gains weight over the years are part of what makes the show work so well.The “journey’ of Aikatsu! is, in itself, much of the point, and by this, much of what appears as tangential manages to merge together in memory to formulate said journey, which in turn assists in fleshing out the characters’ own experiences. One could say that some loose ends arrive nowhere in regards to the long-term, bigger picture, yet it\'s precisely because Aikatsu! dedicates such a massive sum of episodes to focus on such a variety of activities concerning myriad characters and encompassing an array of messages and experiences that the journey is formed as a cohesive whole to begin with. There is an episode leading up to graduation which emphasizes the memorable experiences of the previous years as Ichigo and company are entrusted with the organization of pictures. This is only enabled by the abundance of seemingly one-off episodes and the multitude of experiences accumulated by this point to allow for recollection to hold weight, and this is even further supplemented by references to events which occur “off-screen,” allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks themselves as for how additional shenanigans would play out, adding to the believability of the immense stack of photos and mountain of experiences the cast has undertaken. Something as simple as Aoi composing a collection of the numerous pictures of Otome falling into the fountain for example, serves to illustrate the long span of time that has passed, given the lengths it would take to assemble such. Similarly, the way that characters are able to actively reminisce on past experiences underlines the gravity of this time to them. They themselves demonstrate a degree of self-awareness of both memories and the trails they have undergone, and experience isn\'t simply forgotten. It instead accumulates, much like the series\' good episodes do to form something larger than the sum of its parts. In this regard, Aikatsu! certainly isn\'t the only show which does this, as other works which manage to feel like an actual journey are composed mostly similarly, but I find Aikatsu!\'s entire attitude towards its progression to be particularly special. There are no tricks or traps here, no catches, simply large-scale, wholeheartedly straightforward, earnest progression and development.Characters are humbled, frequently acknowledging just how long of a way ahead they have yet to go, in turn, often being shown in situations in which they attempt to improve upon themselves, frequently taking drastic measures for even marginal advancements as with the case of Akari attending Aikatsu Bootcamp. The show never skimps on its training montages; characters are always given ample quantities of scenes detailing relevant preparatory work and exercises ranging from dancing and choreography to vocal practice to concert planning as well as physical exertion. There are also many episodes in which characters attempt to acquire premium dresses, sometimes going to great lengths for such given how Ichigo scales an entire cliffside without safety ropes to meet with Amane, revealing both dedication and desperation. Many struggle with even basic training from the get-go, but over time, one can note how much change has occurred, as formerly difficult tasks are longer a struggle and are instead natural integrated into a standard day\'s routine without breaking a sweat. At one point, Soleil notes that they instinctively all break into training upon meeting up with each another due to the sheer frequency of their practice. As a result, these numerous segments of characters improving their physical abilities really lend weight to their progress; after a while, the viewer can undoubtedly realize the impact of this progression, with character development simultaneously feeling earned and realized.There is a certain self-awareness of one’s own progress, a shared spirit if you will, of characters always seeking to further themselves, even in cases of where one has already seemingly risen to the pinnacle of what\'s conceivable in their profession as with Mizuki. Her role in the second season highlights the aforementioned desire to transcend, and after carrying the status of top idol for years on end, keeping up with her activities and continuously defending her position, she is motivated to move beyond prior accomplishments to not only be the current number one idol, but upstage past figures, namely Masquerade, for the spot of number one idol of all time, through executing an event on an even larger scale than her predecessors. This persistent desire to improve is once again shared by essentially every other cast member as well, characters almost never passing up any opportunities to get their name out and perform, taking every chance they can get in order to elevate themselves to the next level. Akari tries and succeeds at being a weather girl, and in this fashion, allowing her to shed the status of nameless rookie to become somewhat of a public figure, to the point where even elderly and non-idol enthusiasts are able to recognize her. Even in cases of skepticism regarding one\'s own ability to win a position or take on the role of an idol, as with Kii in her transition from holding a producer role to actually performing on-stage alongside her friends, characters are able to find their footing, Kii gaining confidence and passion through victory as the poster girl for Pon Pon Crepe, and take on tasks they previously wouldn\'t be motivated to attempt. This is a major factor from which enjoyment can be derived, the series more akin to a pseudo-sports show, characters competing against one another in what resembles a rivalry while also holding on to a sense of communal friendship, boosting each other up and wishing for others’ success even when it means they, themselves would need to try harder in response. In fact, this dynamic of having to work harder to catch up to the very individuals that one is pulling up is extremely significant as it creates massive chain reaction feedback loops in which characters are motivated and inspired by each other, resulting in a nearly boundless rise up the ranks for many.In line with the physical regiments that the characters undergo to improve themselves, I feel that Aikatsu! is at its best with its more reflective segments. Within most episodes, there is usually a point in time, be it a thoughtful conversation at the end after a performance, or a revelation that acts as a catalyst to bring upon newfound strength, which complements achieved physical development with psychological growth as well. The small epiphanies, lessons and conversations over the years pile up to gradually affect how characters\' behavior and outlooks, and in the same vein, these realizations are always diverse, tackling subjects that would be relevant and sensible for the characters to consider. Often, Aikatsu! may not necessarily give a clear-cut solidified answer to a specific problem, but its resolutions feel sincere and greatly assist in providing catharsis. There is usually a moment, frequently towards the end following a performance before cutting to the ending theme, in which everything just seems to click together smoothly and said catharsis is emerges. The feeling is in a similar vein to the small hints of beauty present in something like Aria, to which on that note, there are plenty of anime which may manage to provide similar catharsis at certain points over their run, yet something that separates Aikatsu! is how it manages this consistently on a seemingly regular basis. This ties back to what I mentioned before, of the “good” accumulating to form something greater, and the series is the prime example of a series that epitomizes this idea; its journey is composed of the combined experiences and everything gained along the way.Something else that Aikatsu! excels at is capturing the passage of time. The show has a special talent for having time pass in a matter of seconds with that time still holding a real sense of weight behind it. Even short montages of the cast training or playing around over a matter of seconds are able to communicate far more in terms of how much time would have elapsed. The series has habitual performances nearly every single episode, and if not at the end of the episode like most often, they could take place in the very beginning. With this in mind, Aikatsu! can consistently illustrate endeavors spanning matters of days within the same singular episode, the act of establishing the conflict to begin with, exhibiting all the preparation work that comes with what has been established and display then the conflict or event itself in how it turns out. There were many cases where I would expect events to take on more of an arc structure to be spaced out over the course of multiple episodes, they do occasionally such as with the Starlight Queen Cups or other important concerts, but generally, Aikatsu! wastes no time in cutting straight to the chase, largely having everything wrap-up within the episode that it\'s established in, even Star Anis\'s tour passes in a flash without at all sacrificing its relevance. The fact that Aikatsu! can cover entire days in a single episode is something that I feel is crucial for conveying the aforementioned gravity of their activities, to where the audience can really feel that time is moving by. The calendar itself also plays into the passage of time, very fitting for a show with an ending called ""Calendar Days."" Considering that it seems to have been airing in real-time, the series has four distinct Christmas episodes and a nearly equal number of episodes dedicated to New Years’ yet none of them ever feel wasteful nor redundant. By establishing these sort of landmarks as well as how seasons and semesters pass on a regular basis of every 2-cours or so, it causes the viewer to feel as if they actually been watching the show for four years even if they happened to binge it over a few weeks in actuality, and this also contributes to making the show feel absolutely massive in terms of scope and scale. This too, serves to make the journey feel even more like an actual journey.This far into the review already and I haven\'t even discussed specifics regarding the protagonists themselves. Ichigo and Akari are both excellent protagonists who undergo significant development throughout the show, albeit Ichigo’s may be less immediately noticeable as she juxtaposes Akari in certain respects. The most significant of disparity is her seemingly natural affinity for being an idol, as sniffed out by Aoi in the first episode where she recommends Ichigo to join her in applying to Starlight. With the blood of a former Masquerade member running through her, Ichigo feels almost superhuman in comparison to Akari, and while she does still struggle, she does so in different ways and a lot of it may be a bit less blatant, often touching more on the mental side of the implications of becoming an idol and progressing on that front rather than being limited by baseline physical abilities. This is not to say that Ichigo does not demonstrate any physical struggle whatsoever, as episode eleven highlights her difficulty of staying in shape and restraining herself, but much more plays into as previously mentioned consequences of both her aspirations and those surrounding her. The core of her character remains one in the same as her spirit and energy shines through in her every action, but by the end of the saga, it is evident that Ichigo has matured and grown. Comparing Ichigo from episode one and episodes following the first movie, there are noticeable changes in demeanor and confidence. She has risen to achieve many feats, becoming memorialized as a legendary figure in the industry, eventually dethroning Mizuki and claiming the prestigious position of top idol for herself. She has also continued to influence the myriad people around her, reaching the point where characters essentially worship her, the most obvious example being Akari of course, and the effect of this legacy is felt all the more because the viewer has accompanied her throughout her rise to the top.It\'s an interesting sensation to reach the third season since many works more or less come to a standstill when characters achieve their primary goals, yet to go beyond that and see how their achievements have influenced things from thereon out is fascinating, and with this, Akari, the second main protagonist, is one swept up in the whirlwind that Ichigo initiated, definitely falling into the camp of worshipping of her, specifically being motivated to become an idol after watching her on television, and going as far as to introduce herself as Ichigo while applying to Starlight for the second time. Unlike Ichigo however, Akari lacks the natural idol affinity of her predecessor, something that Johnny Bepp outright explains to Ichigo in the second season, resulting in her significantly lower baseline abilities which calls for drastic improvements. Akari demonstrates far more in terms of physical struggle, forced to completely work herself into shape from nothing, practicing running single everyday, her singing and dancing abilities leaving much to be desired while also taking an eternity to be able to perform a special appeal. Akari showcases a fair amount of doubt regarding her self-confidence, quickly skeptical as to whether she was actually making any meaningful progress. She certainly eventually does, but over a believable amount of time with many tribulations. Akari slowly eases her way into being an idol and in the process learns to “shine with her own light” and not simply copy her mentor. Being influenced by Ichigo, Akari is without a doubt similar in terms of attitude, though without apparent the initial extraordinary ability to jump into and succeed at seemingly anything, she is forced to face things with pure resolve and determination, a characteristic noted by her parents at a young age. While never coming to officially dethrone Ichigo (even if she does surpass her in some way in the final episode), Akari’s ascension also comes with a uniqueness of knowing that she began at rock-bottom and has climbed such a long way. There is incredible emotional weight behind having both protagonists reach their landmark aspirations and by these points, the payoff always feels deserved.The other characters also add flavor to interactions and, disregarding exaggerated elements, feel real enough to empathize with; for example, Johnny Bepp will likely stick in viewer’s minds with his trademark broken English and over the top attitude, but he even manages to have some episodes dedicated to him, and he, along with other characters, provide the show with a very specific flavor of energy. Given his goofiness, it may be easy to forget that Bepp is actually a master of his craft; he is fleshed out his own past as a choreographer and teacher for Masquerade, Mizuki and the many students at Starlight, as well as formerly being part of a dance group with Sonny. Orihime is fleshed out with her past being rooted in being part of Masquerade and moving on to raise idols to populate the idol scene as the headmistress of Starlight, her approach and philosophies contrasting Tiara’s with the formation of Dream Academy in raising only the selected few on a strict path towards being an idol as opposed to the openness of having even options to become a producer or designer open to anybody, even those who normally wouldn\'t meet the minimum skill bar. The majority of the main cast is largely populated by numerous idols who of which provide unique directions for the show to focus on while adding some semblance of spice in their own way, with much in the way of character chemistry. Most of the time, even while embodying common tropes, characters stick to grounded struggles and have secondary attributes and circumstances, for example Mikuru pursuing gardening on the side, which causes them to feel more believable as characters to sympathize with. On the other hand, various family members and supporting cast members provide much needed, well, support, for their respective idols to further help them feel closer to believable people with actual lives rather than machines that exist in a vacuum. The many top designers also assist in making the universe feel more like a living, breathing entity, featuring the diverse tastes and sensibilities that various brands would tackle, even showcasing the struggles of an upward climb towards being a top designer in the case of Sena, and labors to continue to churn out great work in the case of Amahane. The show dedicates a number of episodes to these designers, who many of which reappear in locations designers would logically go to seek inspiration, and in this way, they too feel like actual people to an extent even despite the spotlight being put on the idols themselves.I feel that eventually allocating the original cast to supporting roles in favor of raising new protagonists is one of the most interesting writing decisions the franchise has taken upon itself. The dynamic between the original and new cast comes with the former acting as mentors for the younger generation in a baton pass-esque manner. For the old Starlight students, this forces both those who they mentor, as well as themselves to continue growing to even further heights, with Ichigo substituting the role of Mizuki to Akari just as Mizuki had been a model to herself. Akari is hardly only new  character who benefits as, sharing the same brand, even Mikuru acts as a sort of mentor for Hinaki to some extent towards the end of the series leading up to the finale. There is a sort of ""giving back"" on part of the original cast who have by this point succeeded, in helping the new blood rise up, just as they themselves had been supported by others. Another implication of designating the old cast to side characters though is that it increases the “weight” lent to their screen time going forward. It\'s easy to get used to the original protagonists being onscreen after following them for over a hundred episodes, experiences all they have gone through alongside them, to which, by that point, viewers should reveal some level of attachment to them. Having less frequent appearances causes the times when they actually do emerge onscreen again to feel like special occasions. I could distinctly feel the weight of characters’ appearances as this was an extremely rare case in media where I genuinely missed the old cast. The distance makes all the difference and having them continue to exist in the background though simply provides the show with an extra weapon in its arsenal that it can utilize to enhance episodes and reward viewers later down the line. It\'s just such an interesting choice to have the series move in this direction as most shows would essentially stop and conclude upon having their protagonist finish their main story, yet Aikatsu! runs with it and decides to keep going.Another facet of Aikatsu! that I greatly appreciate lies in its continuity and general tendency to remember itself. The show manages to capitalize on the most minor details, leaving them to be referenced on later occasions or in some cases further expanding upon them in meaningful ways. One standout example is the first Aikatsu8 selection, a real poll which also takes votes from actual fans of the show, in which Ichigo cements herself a position, but both Aoi and Ran are excluded in favor of other Dream Academy participants. I found it particularly interesting that the show remembers this detail as it resurfaces in an episode of season three, used to reinforce the aforementioned idea of how everyone moves at their own pace in having Luminas’ situation somewhat mirror what happened to Soleil, and in turn simultaneously provides unexpectedly greater catharsis when the other members of Soleil are finally able to take part in the Aikatsu8 later on, all within the same episode. On another occasion, a scene where Sumire is shocked at the sight of dead fish, something easily blown off as a mere comedic reaction, suddenly becomes a relevant detail when the show loops back around to reference it in yet another later episode as something that Akari and Hinaki take advantage of in an attempt to surprise Sumire on their hidden camera show. Milestones such as the Pon Pon Crepe audition, an achievement that Mizuki had previously won and one of the first trails that Aoi undertakes and succeeds in are brought back with Kii, and later with Akari, who manage to participate in them as well; with this, a sense of continuity over a long period of time is achieved. Another example is the Angely Bear, which Ichigo stars in an advertisement for. Vieweing the first season standalone, one would think the episode to work as a simple little one-off; Ichigo stars in a commercial and furthers herself by doing so, to which it does. However, the bear in the commercial is later linked to an episode of season four, where Akari and company work with Dandai (real-life Bandai) to produce a new line of toys, Akari herself influenced by the Angely Bear commercial that Ichigo starred in, inspiring her to create idol dolls as well as have Dandai include the bear in the commercial. Akari’s experience derived from engaging in a talk show with Maguro is referenced again as she attempts comedy upon encountering Nina, and Maguro himself appears more than once accompanied by Ichigo. There are countless examples of show the remembering small bits of itself, and these moments demonstrate the chain of influence between characters as well as the show’s self-awareness of itself, and the fact that characters and their actions continually come back, serve to better establish the Aikatsu universe. Mikuru’s promise to Mizuki isn\'t forgotten and neither is Ichigo’s statement of “waiting” for Akari in the first film. I love the ever-present self-consciousness in the show being able to remember itself, to where even things that seemingly go nowhere on the surface have opportunities to be tied back to, in contrast to how other titles may have events play out and then simply move onto the next thing.On a similar train of thought, there are myriad small instances and recurring gags that the show seems to continue, further demonstrating its capacity to remember itself and all in all just act as a nice touch. The axe becomes a running gag after being used in episode twelve to fell a Christmas tree, and from there it is brought up four more times in reference, with Akari assuming Ichigo\'s mantle and even in the final episode marathon. In fact, the idea of cutting and bringing back a tree for Christmas is transformed into somewhat of a tradition in how in the third Christmas episode directly builds upon the first. In a similar manner, there is a specific smirk that Ichigo keeps making in her performances, initially established somewhere in the second season, which pervades throughout the show to also appear in the final episode while performing Calendar Girl.There are also the nicknames that Bepp uses, “Starmiya” being incorporated into the “Great Starmiya Ichigo Festival” and more specifics like a conversation between Rin and Madoka towards the end of the final season where the two end up playing shiritori, a Japanese word game in which the player has to say a word which matches the final kana of the previous player’s word, to which previously established catchphrases are assimilated and entire passages of dialogue between the two still manage to follow the rules of the game, even after it seemingly ending. These are just a few examples that come to mind of course, but the show is chock full of stuff like this upon closer inspection.Moving on, Aikatsu! is far from the visually strongest work out there, but I wouldn\'t say it looks terrible either. On one hand, some of the backgrounds, especially indoors when there are particularly dull-looking stock-image-esque walls, can be rather unappealing, though there are cases when characters are outdoors where backgrounds can look more vibrant, colorful, and even storybook-esque, though of course it\'s largely dependent on the given location and surrounding scenery. On the other hand, characters themselves and foreground can look rather solid with lines dark enough and thick enough to stand out, though sporadically appear off-model such as with episode 51. CG performances can be a mixed bag, as earlier ones leading up to around episode nine can look cheap and downright atrocious. From thereafter however, Aikatsu! demonstrates a willingness to attempt to improve upon itself, the overall quality of models and expressiveness of even minute gestures cause said performances to drastically improve over time. To the show’s credit, characters go through an abundance of costumes, which are all showcased in their respective performances. In terms of animation, Aikatsu! isn\'t the strongest candidate, many scenes more on the static side as characters talking with fluid full-body animation being less common when the show is in 2D, unless we\'re talking about one of the movies, where some sakuga is present. However, Aikatsu! supplements limited animation with character expressiveness, applying facial expressions, smears and constant reactions shot to its interactions to never feel truly boring.I feel Aikatsu! to be tonally perfect, straddling the line between lighthearted and austere, wholly unafraid of diving headfirst into jovial character interactions and routine chaos, but simultaneously holds itself to also having its cast sincerely consider their own circumstances and self-improvement in a serious manner just as often. The show feels like a nearly equal split between both, with numerous episodes dedicated to acting out plays or movies with everything going crazy serving to balance out the segments with heavier emotional weight, most notably in the Imaishi space mecha episode and magic card movie production which are both absolutely insane. It does things such as reference Ichigo/Akari\'s introduction lines at the beginning of each episode as a joke, and continues to do things in the similar vein throughout. Typically though, Aikatsu! maintains its positive upbeat attitude in some form throughout, regardless of what type of episode pops up next. Just as much enjoyment can be derived from observing the casual banter between individuals and how effectively they rhythmically ricochet off one another as it can from watching over the cast as they work towards and achieve their goals. With this, the series offers the best of both worlds without compromising in either respect once again.Surely, for a show centered on idols and their performances, music should be a rather important element, and while I don\'t love every single song (looking to the song used at Johnny\'s sister\'s wedding), I would say that Aikatsu!’s music is generally very pleasant. The performances themselves have some degree of variance in terms the style of music chosen, slower songs to contrast faster ones, rock to juxtapose pop and whatnot. Some of Yurika’s and Sumire’s songs take on a more ominous feel while Madoka’s are bouncy and upbeat. Anyhow, the point stands that Aikatsu! doesn\'t fully embody or stick to any singular brand of music, though generally much of its score pushes for its underlying positive energy. I actually love the general soundtrack outside of the show’s actual performances even more, which generally do a great job in enhancing the emotional intensity of key scenes, aside from a few instances in the second season, playing the appropriate piece during important moments and providing much needed catharsis. The background music goes hand in hand with its character interactions to greatly influence the tone of its scenes, a component that can\'t be understated in regards to making the show function.Overall, Aikatsu! may as well be the most worthwhile experience I\'ve had with anime, a joy to watch as a character journey over such a massive span of episodes. The accumulation of not only good episodes, but of these small albeit thoughtful elements, are what makes Aikatsu! such a memorable show. It is admirable to observe not only the characters within the show attempting to improve themselves, but show itself doing the same, especially concerning its presentation. Even the characters who I didn\'t originally care for, I grew to appreciate, and even episodes that I had expected to be boring based on the episode preview came out of surprisingly enjoyable with what managed to be accomplished. Though not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, Aikatsu! is a series that offer a lot and impresses me with its ambition and genuineness. analysis may be somewhat messily written or seem to lack any sort of overarching structure. It is merely my personal thoughts and things I\'ve realized while watching the series. Everything is subject to change as my perspective towards the media I consume continues to evolve.Aikatsu! is unquestionably among the most refreshing titles that I\'ve encountered in a long time, shattering my expectations as for what I envisioned it would be as overall possibly the most enjoyable anime I\'ve ever completed. After stagnating in regards to anime consumption for quite some time, I felt that I had nearly entirely lost the ability to follow something continuously, though upon cleaning up my plan to watch list, I was struck with an epiphany in how only takes the correct title to get going again.Right off the bat, something of note is that while the series boasts neither the greatest visuals, nor the most complex narrative, the original Aikatsu!, standing at a colossal 178-episodes with the added bonus of movies and whatnot, is a rather ambitious title to say the least, originating on a much smaller scale as a simple rise-to-the-top story at first glance, following Ichigo and her best friend, Aoi, their embarkment on the road to become top idols, yet as the series progresses, the cast dramatically expands to include dozens of faces, the focus distributed between both the many main and side characters alike, nevertheless without ever compromising the journey of its primary protagonists. It\'s a children’s show that largely succeeds in impressing me, even in spite of my appreciation of other strong titles geared towards the same demographic, and hence being less impressionable.The series’s greatest strengths lie with its characters, their interactions and development over a long span of time. This isn\'t to say that Aikatsu! has the most complex characters, as many do not particularly stray from common tropes and archetypes, but over time, many have their individual struggles both highlighted and explored while remaining ever-present throughout its run. I found myself growing to enjoy the occasions when characters that I initially didn\'t even like were centered then upon to unveil a new side and hence create a new sense of appreciation. As follows, at this point, I don’t think there\'s any singular cast member which I can point to and say I dislike. Of course, not every character is explored to an equivalent extent, but most of even the secondary protagonists are given some spotlight and maintain their own following, if not already affecting the series’ universe in some notable way. Even characters as minor as Yuu, being Akari\'s initial roommate, have been utilized in multiple ways, an example being her exchange student experience playing a role in shaping her to become a travel idol, allowing both Miyabi and Kotone to come to Starlight as a secondary implication, with Yuu’s newfound motivation to further herself derived from the aforementioned experience of having Akari as her roommate. I essentially mean that even characters that appear uncommonly are hardly wasted, or at least feel like they could assume some believable position in the Aikatsu world. Once again, the cast is massive and the series does a fairly good job of using members to exemplify different potential paths for idols within the same industry, not even specifically limited to the type of idol they represent in terms of “cool” or “cute,” but in regards to the different branching routes sprouting from the same root, displaying a divergence between skillsets such as acting, modelling and comedy, and even specialties in regards to Sumire’s singing and Rin’s dancing being their emphasis or even having Yurika epitomize the idea of idols taking on a persona and sticking to it with utmost diligence. “Everyone moves at different paces” is a common motif present throughout, and additionally, everyone also comes to move in their own direction. The way that characters continue to evolve and how their screen presence slowly gains weight over the years are part of what makes the show work so well.The “journey’ of Aikatsu! is, in itself, much of the point, and by this, much of what appears as tangential manages to merge together in memory to formulate said journey, which in turn assists in fleshing out the characters’ own experiences. One could say that some loose ends arrive nowhere in regards to the long-term, bigger picture, yet it\'s precisely because Aikatsu! dedicates such a massive sum of episodes to focus on such a variety of activities concerning myriad characters and encompassing an array of messages and experiences that the journey is formed as a cohesive whole to begin with. There is an episode leading up to graduation which emphasizes the memorable experiences of the previous years as Ichigo and company are entrusted with the organization of pictures. This is only enabled by the abundance of seemingly one-off episodes and the multitude of experiences accumulated by this point to allow for recollection to hold weight, and this is even further supplemented by references to events which occur “off-screen,” allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks themselves as for how additional shenanigans would play out, adding to the believability of the immense stack of photos and mountain of experiences the cast has undertaken. Something as simple as Aoi composing a collection of the numerous pictures of Otome falling into the fountain for example, serves to illustrate the long span of time that has passed, given the lengths it would take to assemble such. Similarly, the way that characters are able to actively reminisce on past experiences underlines the gravity of this time to them. They themselves demonstrate a degree of self-awareness of both memories and the trails they have undergone, and experience isn\'t simply forgotten. It instead accumulates, much like the series\' good episodes do to form something larger than the sum of its parts. In this regard, Aikatsu! certainly isn\'t the only show which does this, as other works which manage to feel like an actual journey are composed mostly similarly, but I find Aikatsu!\'s entire attitude towards its progression to be particularly special. There are no tricks or traps here, no catches, simply large-scale, wholeheartedly straightforward, earnest progression and development.Characters are humbled, frequently acknowledging just how long of a way ahead they have yet to go, in turn, often being shown in situations in which they attempt to improve upon themselves, frequently taking drastic measures for even marginal advancements as with the case of Akari attending Aikatsu Bootcamp. The show never skimps on its training montages; characters are always given ample quantities of scenes detailing relevant preparatory work and exercises ranging from dancing and choreography to vocal practice to concert planning as well as physical exertion. There are also many episodes in which characters attempt to acquire premium dresses, sometimes going to great lengths for such given how Ichigo scales an entire cliffside without safety ropes to meet with Amane, revealing both dedication and desperation. Many struggle with even basic training from the get-go, but over time, one can note how much change has occurred, as formerly difficult tasks are longer a struggle and are instead natural integrated into a standard day\'s routine without breaking a sweat. At one point, Soleil notes that they instinctively all break into training upon meeting up with each another due to the sheer frequency of their practice. As a result, these numerous segments of characters improving their physical abilities really lend weight to their progress; after a while, the viewer can undoubtedly realize the impact of this progression, with character development simultaneously feeling earned and realized.There is a certain self-awareness of one’s own progress, a shared spirit if you will, of characters always seeking to further themselves, even in cases of where one has already seemingly risen to the pinnacle of what\'s conceivable in their profession as with Mizuki. Her role in the second season highlights the aforementioned desire to transcend, and after carrying the status of top idol for years on end, keeping up with her activities and continuously defending her position, she is motivated to move beyond prior accomplishments to not only be the current number one idol, but upstage past figures, namely Masquerade, for the spot of number one idol of all time, through executing an event on an even larger scale than her predecessors. This persistent desire to improve is once again shared by essentially every other cast member as well, characters almost never passing up any opportunities to get their name out and perform, taking every chance they can get in order to elevate themselves to the next level. Akari tries and succeeds at being a weather girl, and in this fashion, allowing her to shed the status of nameless rookie to become somewhat of a public figure, to the point where even elderly and non-idol enthusiasts are able to recognize her. Even in cases of skepticism regarding one\'s own ability to win a position or take on the role of an idol, as with Kii in her transition from holding a producer role to actually performing on-stage alongside her friends, characters are able to find their footing, Kii gaining confidence and passion through victory as the poster girl for Pon Pon Crepe, and take on tasks they previously wouldn\'t be motivated to attempt. This is a major factor from which enjoyment can be derived, the series more akin to a pseudo-sports show, characters competing against one another in what resembles a rivalry while also holding on to a sense of communal friendship, boosting each other up and wishing for others’ success even when it means they, themselves would need to try harder in response. In fact, this dynamic of having to work harder to catch up to the very individuals that one is pulling up is extremely significant as it creates massive chain reaction feedback loops in which characters are motivated and inspired by each other, resulting in a nearly boundless rise up the ranks for many.In line with the physical regiments that the characters undergo to improve themselves, I feel that Aikatsu! is at its best with its more reflective segments. Within most episodes, there is usually a point in time, be it a thoughtful conversation at the end after a performance, or a revelation that acts as a catalyst to bring upon newfound strength, which complements achieved physical development with psychological growth as well. The small epiphanies, lessons and conversations over the years pile up to gradually affect how characters\' behavior and outlooks, and in the same vein, these realizations are always diverse, tackling subjects that would be relevant and sensible for the characters to consider. Often, Aikatsu! may not necessarily give a clear-cut solidified answer to a specific problem, but its resolutions feel sincere and greatly assist in providing catharsis. There is usually a moment, frequently towards the end following a performance before cutting to the ending theme, in which everything just seems to click together smoothly and said catharsis is emerges. The feeling is in a similar vein to the small hints of beauty present in something like Aria, to which on that note, there are plenty of anime which may manage to provide similar catharsis at certain points over their run, yet something that separates Aikatsu! is how it manages this consistently on a seemingly regular basis. This ties back to what I mentioned before, of the “good” accumulating to form something greater, and the series is the prime example of a series that epitomizes this idea; its journey is composed of the combined experiences and everything gained along the way.Something else that Aikatsu! excels at is capturing the passage of time. The show has a special talent for having time pass in a matter of seconds with that time still holding a real sense of weight behind it. Even short montages of the cast training or playing around over a matter of seconds are able to communicate far more in terms of how much time would have elapsed. The series has habitual performances nearly every single episode, and if not at the end of the episode like most often, they could take place in the very beginning. With this in mind, Aikatsu! can consistently illustrate endeavors spanning matters of days within the same singular episode, the act of establishing the conflict to begin with, exhibiting all the preparation work that comes with what has been established and display then the conflict or event itself in how it turns out. There were many cases where I would expect events to take on more of an arc structure to be spaced out over the course of multiple episodes, they do occasionally such as with the Starlight Queen Cups or other important concerts, but generally, Aikatsu! wastes no time in cutting straight to the chase, largely having everything wrap-up within the episode that it\'s established in, even Star Anis\'s tour passes in a flash without at all sacrificing its relevance. The fact that Aikatsu! can cover entire days in a single episode is something that I feel is crucial for conveying the aforementioned gravity of their activities, to where the audience can really feel that time is moving by. The calendar itself also plays into the passage of time, very fitting for a show with an ending called ""Calendar Days."" Considering that it seems to have been airing in real-time, the series has four distinct Christmas episodes and a nearly equal number of episodes dedicated to New Years’ yet none of them ever feel wasteful nor redundant. By establishing these sort of landmarks as well as how seasons and semesters pass on a regular basis of every 2-cours or so, it causes the viewer to feel as if they actually been watching the show for four years even if they happened to binge it over a few weeks in actuality, and this also contributes to making the show feel absolutely massive in terms of scope and scale. This too, serves to make the journey feel even more like an actual journey.This far into the review already and I haven\'t even discussed specifics regarding the protagonists themselves. Ichigo and Akari are both excellent protagonists who undergo significant development throughout the show, albeit Ichigo’s may be less immediately noticeable as she juxtaposes Akari in certain respects. The most significant of disparity is her seemingly natural affinity for being an idol, as sniffed out by Aoi in the first episode where she recommends Ichigo to join her in applying to Starlight. With the blood of a former Masquerade member running through her, Ichigo feels almost superhuman in comparison to Akari, and while she does still struggle, she does so in different ways and a lot of it may be a bit less blatant, often touching more on the mental side of the implications of becoming an idol and progressing on that front rather than being limited by baseline physical abilities. This is not to say that Ichigo does not demonstrate any physical struggle whatsoever, as episode eleven highlights her difficulty of staying in shape and restraining herself, but much more plays into as previously mentioned consequences of both her aspirations and those surrounding her. The core of her character remains one in the same as her spirit and energy shines through in her every action, but by the end of the saga, it is evident that Ichigo has matured and grown. Comparing Ichigo from episode one and episodes following the first movie, there are noticeable changes in demeanor and confidence. She has risen to achieve many feats, becoming memorialized as a legendary figure in the industry, eventually dethroning Mizuki and claiming the prestigious position of top idol for herself. She has also continued to influence the myriad people around her, reaching the point where characters essentially worship her, the most obvious example being Akari of course, and the effect of this legacy is felt all the more because the viewer has accompanied her throughout her rise to the top.It\'s an interesting sensation to reach the third season since many works more or less come to a standstill when characters achieve their primary goals, yet to go beyond that and see how their achievements have influenced things from thereon out is fascinating, and with this, Akari, the second main protagonist, is one swept up in the whirlwind that Ichigo initiated, definitely falling into the camp of worshipping of her, specifically being motivated to become an idol after watching her on television, and going as far as to introduce herself as Ichigo while applying to Starlight for the second time. Unlike Ichigo however, Akari lacks the natural idol affinity of her predecessor, something that Johnny Bepp outright explains to Ichigo in the second season, resulting in her significantly lower baseline abilities which calls for drastic improvements. Akari demonstrates far more in terms of physical struggle, forced to completely work herself into shape from nothing, practicing running single everyday, her singing and dancing abilities leaving much to be desired while also taking an eternity to be able to perform a special appeal. Akari showcases a fair amount of doubt regarding her self-confidence, quickly skeptical as to whether she was actually making any meaningful progress. She certainly eventually does, but over a believable amount of time with many tribulations. Akari slowly eases her way into being an idol and in the process learns to “shine with her own light” and not simply copy her mentor. Being influenced by Ichigo, Akari is without a doubt similar in terms of attitude, though without apparent the initial extraordinary ability to jump into and succeed at seemingly anything, she is forced to face things with pure resolve and determination, a characteristic noted by her parents at a young age. While never coming to officially dethrone Ichigo (even if she does surpass her in some way in the final episode), Akari’s ascension also comes with a uniqueness of knowing that she began at rock-bottom and has climbed such a long way. There is incredible emotional weight behind having both protagonists reach their landmark aspirations and by these points, the payoff always feels deserved.The other characters also add flavor to interactions and, disregarding exaggerated elements, feel real enough to empathize with; for example, Johnny Bepp will likely stick in viewer’s minds with his trademark broken English and over the top attitude, but he even manages to have some episodes dedicated to him, and he, along with other characters, provide the show with a very specific flavor of energy. Given his goofiness, it may be easy to forget that Bepp is actually a master of his craft; he is fleshed out his own past as a choreographer and teacher for Masquerade, Mizuki and the many students at Starlight, as well as formerly being part of a dance group with Sonny. Orihime is fleshed out with her past being rooted in being part of Masquerade and moving on to raise idols to populate the idol scene as the headmistress of Starlight, her approach and philosophies contrasting Tiara’s with the formation of Dream Academy in raising only the selected few on a strict path towards being an idol as opposed to the openness of having even options to become a producer or designer open to anybody, even those who normally wouldn\'t meet the minimum skill bar. The majority of the main cast is largely populated by numerous idols who of which provide unique directions for the show to focus on while adding some semblance of spice in their own way, with much in the way of character chemistry. Most of the time, even while embodying common tropes, characters stick to grounded struggles and have secondary attributes and circumstances, for example Mikuru pursuing gardening on the side, which causes them to feel more believable as characters to sympathize with. On the other hand, various family members and supporting cast members provide much needed, well, support, for their respective idols to further help them feel closer to believable people with actual lives rather than machines that exist in a vacuum. The many top designers also assist in making the universe feel more like a living, breathing entity, featuring the diverse tastes and sensibilities that various brands would tackle, even showcasing the struggles of an upward climb towards being a top designer in the case of Sena, and labors to continue to churn out great work in the case of Amahane. The show dedicates a number of episodes to these designers, who many of which reappear in locations designers would logically go to seek inspiration, and in this way, they too feel like actual people to an extent even despite the spotlight being put on the idols themselves.I feel that eventually allocating the original cast to supporting roles in favor of raising new protagonists is one of the most interesting writing decisions the franchise has taken upon itself. The dynamic between the original and new cast comes with the former acting as mentors for the younger generation in a baton pass-esque manner. For the old Starlight students, this forces both those who they mentor, as well as themselves to continue growing to even further heights, with Ichigo substituting the role of Mizuki to Akari just as Mizuki had been a model to herself. Akari is hardly only new  character who benefits as, sharing the same brand, even Mikuru acts as a sort of mentor for Hinaki to some extent towards the end of the series leading up to the finale. There is a sort of ""giving back"" on part of the original cast who have by this point succeeded, in helping the new blood rise up, just as they themselves had been supported by others. Another implication of designating the old cast to side characters though is that it increases the “weight” lent to their screen time going forward. It\'s easy to get used to the original protagonists being onscreen after following them for over a hundred episodes, experiences all they have gone through alongside them, to which, by that point, viewers should reveal some level of attachment to them. Having less frequent appearances causes the times when they actually do emerge onscreen again to feel like special occasions. I could distinctly feel the weight of characters’ appearances as this was an extremely rare case in media where I genuinely missed the old cast. The distance makes all the difference and having them continue to exist in the background though simply provides the show with an extra weapon in its arsenal that it can utilize to enhance episodes and reward viewers later down the line. It\'s just such an interesting choice to have the series move in this direction as most shows would essentially stop and conclude upon having their protagonist finish their main story, yet Aikatsu! runs with it and decides to keep going.Another facet of Aikatsu! that I greatly appreciate lies in its continuity and general tendency to remember itself. The show manages to capitalize on the most minor details, leaving them to be referenced on later occasions or in some cases further expanding upon them in meaningful ways. One standout example is the first Aikatsu8 selection, a real poll which also takes votes from actual fans of the show, in which Ichigo cements herself a position, but both Aoi and Ran are excluded in favor of other Dream Academy participants. I found it particularly interesting that the show remembers this detail as it resurfaces in an episode of season three, used to reinforce the aforementioned idea of how everyone moves at their own pace in having Luminas’ situation somewhat mirror what happened to Soleil, and in turn simultaneously provides unexpectedly greater catharsis when the other members of Soleil are finally able to take part in the Aikatsu8 later on, all within the same episode. On another occasion, a scene where Sumire is shocked at the sight of dead fish, something easily blown off as a mere comedic reaction, suddenly becomes a relevant detail when the show loops back around to reference it in yet another later episode as something that Akari and Hinaki take advantage of in an attempt to surprise Sumire on their hidden camera show. Milestones such as the Pon Pon Crepe audition, an achievement that Mizuki had previously won and one of the first trails that Aoi undertakes and succeeds in are brought back with Kii, and later with Akari, who manage to participate in them as well; with this, a sense of continuity over a long period of time is achieved. Another example is the Angely Bear, which Ichigo stars in an advertisement for. Vieweing the first season standalone, one would think the episode to work as a simple little one-off; Ichigo stars in a commercial and furthers herself by doing so, to which it does. However, the bear in the commercial is later linked to an episode of season four, where Akari and company work with Dandai (real-life Bandai) to produce a new line of toys, Akari herself influenced by the Angely Bear commercial that Ichigo starred in, inspiring her to create idol dolls as well as have Dandai include the bear in the commercial. Akari’s experience derived from engaging in a talk show with Maguro is referenced again as she attempts comedy upon encountering Nina, and Maguro himself appears more than once accompanied by Ichigo. There are countless examples of show the remembering small bits of itself, and these moments demonstrate the chain of influence between characters as well as the show’s self-awareness of itself, and the fact that characters and their actions continually come back, serve to better establish the Aikatsu universe. Mikuru’s promise to Mizuki isn\'t forgotten and neither is Ichigo’s statement of “waiting” for Akari in the first film. I love the ever-present self-consciousness in the show being able to remember itself, to where even things that seemingly go nowhere on the surface have opportunities to be tied back to, in contrast to how other titles may have events play out and then simply move onto the next thing.On a similar train of thought, there are myriad small instances and recurring gags that the show seems to continue, further demonstrating its capacity to remember itself and all in all just act as a nice touch. The axe becomes a running gag after being used in episode twelve to fell a Christmas tree, and from there it is brought up four more times in reference, with Akari assuming Ichigo\'s mantle and even in the final episode marathon. In fact, the idea of cutting and bringing back a tree for Christmas is transformed into somewhat of a tradition in how in the third Christmas episode directly builds upon the first. In a similar manner, there is a specific smirk that Ichigo keeps making in her performances, initially established somewhere in the second season, which pervades throughout the show to also appear in the final episode while performing Calendar Girl.There are also the nicknames that Bepp uses, “Starmiya” being incorporated into the “Great Starmiya Ichigo Festival” and more specifics like a conversation between Rin and Madoka towards the end of the final season where the two end up playing shiritori, a Japanese word game in which the player has to say a word which matches the final kana of the previous player’s word, to which previously established catchphrases are assimilated and entire passages of dialogue between the two still manage to follow the rules of the game, even after it seemingly ending. These are just a few examples that come to mind of course, but the show is chock full of stuff like this upon closer inspection.Moving on, Aikatsu! is far from the visually strongest work out there, but I wouldn\'t say it looks terrible either. On one hand, some of the backgrounds, especially indoors when there are particularly dull-looking stock-image-esque walls, can be rather unappealing, though there are cases when characters are outdoors where backgrounds can look more vibrant, colorful, and even storybook-esque, though of course it\'s largely dependent on the given location and surrounding scenery. On the other hand, characters themselves and foreground can look rather solid with lines dark enough and thick enough to stand out, though sporadically appear off-model such as with episode 51. CG performances can be a mixed bag, as earlier ones leading up to around episode nine can look cheap and downright atrocious. From thereafter however, Aikatsu! demonstrates a willingness to attempt to improve upon itself, the overall quality of models and expressiveness of even minute gestures cause said performances to drastically improve over time. To the show’s credit, characters go through an abundance of costumes, which are all showcased in their respective performances. In terms of animation, Aikatsu! isn\'t the strongest candidate, many scenes more on the static side as characters talking with fluid full-body animation being less common when the show is in 2D, unless we\'re talking about one of the movies, where some sakuga is present. However, Aikatsu! supplements limited animation with character expressiveness, applying facial expressions, smears and constant reactions shot to its interactions to never feel truly boring.I feel Aikatsu! to be tonally perfect, straddling the line between lighthearted and austere, wholly unafraid of diving headfirst into jovial character interactions and routine chaos, but simultaneously holds itself to also having its cast sincerely consider their own circumstances and self-improvement in a serious manner just as often. The show feels like a nearly equal split between both, with numerous episodes dedicated to acting out plays or movies with everything going crazy serving to balance out the segments with heavier emotional weight, most notably in the Imaishi space mecha episode and magic card movie production which are both absolutely insane. It does things such as reference Ichigo/Akari\'s introduction lines at the beginning of each episode as a joke, and continues to do things in the similar vein throughout. Typically though, Aikatsu! maintains its positive upbeat attitude in some form throughout, regardless of what type of episode pops up next. Just as much enjoyment can be derived from observing the casual banter between individuals and how effectively they rhythmically ricochet off one another as it can from watching over the cast as they work towards and achieve their goals. With this, the series offers the best of both worlds without compromising in either respect once again.Surely, for a show centered on idols and their performances, music should be a rather important element, and while I don\'t love every single song (looking to the song used at Johnny\'s sister\'s wedding), I would say that Aikatsu!’s music is generally very pleasant. The performances themselves have some degree of variance in terms the style of music chosen, slower songs to contrast faster ones, rock to juxtapose pop and whatnot. Some of Yurika’s and Sumire’s songs take on a more ominous feel while Madoka’s are bouncy and upbeat. Anyhow, the point stands that Aikatsu! doesn\'t fully embody or stick to any singular brand of music, though generally much of its score pushes for its underlying positive energy. I actually love the general soundtrack outside of the show’s actual performances even more, which generally do a great job in enhancing the emotional intensity of key scenes, aside from a few instances in the second season, playing the appropriate piece during important moments and providing much needed catharsis. The background music goes hand in hand with its character interactions to greatly influence the tone of its scenes, a component that can\'t be understated in regards to making the show function.Overall, Aikatsu! may as well be the most worthwhile experience I\'ve had with anime, a joy to watch as a character journey over such a massive span of episodes. The accumulation of not only good episodes, but of these small albeit thoughtful elements, are what makes Aikatsu! such a memorable show. It is admirable to observe not only the characters within the show attempting to improve themselves, but show itself doing the same, especially concerning its presentation. Even the characters who I didn\'t originally care for, I grew to appreciate, and even episodes that I had expected to be boring based on the episode preview came out of surprisingly enjoyable with what managed to be accomplished. Though not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, Aikatsu! is a series that offer a lot and impresses me with its ambition and genuineness.', ""Although this anime has a bit of a slow start, the story is one of the better ones that I've seen. Although it is a fairly typical coming-to-fame story, it is well done and unlike most anime that feel unfinished it keeps going until the story reaches a proper end. One very interesting thing is the cast collecting in the anime to the point that the main cast actually switches about halfway through. There are around 100 different characters and they each have interesting personalities, although some of them have unfortunately short screen times.The art of the main series is well done with the girls...being very cute and are all modeled differently, which is important for such a big cast. In the beginning the dance scenes are a bit of a problem since they're bad enough to feel like carcinogens, but that is fixed later in the show. The dance scenes are actually held in virtual reality in the show and when past recordings of dances are shown on screen they have the same animation as when they were first shown so it may be that their own technology is improving making the bad dance scenes slightly more forgivable. The dances at the end have better CGI than pretty much any other anime I've seen.The music in this show is amazing. There is a total of over 70 songs and although there are both hits and misses the hits are amazing and many are top ten worthy, although partly due to the lack of insert songs in most anime. The voices were all outstanding. Oddly enough, the age gap between the seiyuu for the two protagonists is about the same as for their characters but in the opposite direction. All of the seiyuu do a good job and the ones who speak other languages add a bit of spice to the atmosphere. One character develops an even more cringe worthy version of Engrish, which is interesting to watch.With such a huge cast it's amazing that they gave every character an interesting and unique personality. There are even some characters who end up in the main cast who you wouldn't expect to because of their eccentric personality traits. The anime is about the characters and they all do a great job at making the anime fun to watch. There are sure to be some characters you won't like, but you can only hope that those characters won't get as much screen time. It's great to see the different characters from different places as they will often use this as a method for world development.With everything this anime does well it is incredibly enjoyable. As a kids show they try to decrease the character-viewer disconnect so anything the characters view as being good actually is good. There are some foods in the anime that just make you want to try them and some did have a limited availability in real life but none are available outside of Japan. Just like with anything it's more important who you're with than what you're doing so although this is just a really good rendition of a generic story the great characters and great music make it far better.With every considered this is a great anime that does not disappoint. There are still some questions unanswered, but they did a better job addressing the most probable questions than most anime do. Anime with futuristic settings are bound to have holes in their logic but this one does fit quite neatly. Whether if you like cute girls doing cute things, music anime, or even sports anime depending on your reason for doing so this should be a good anime to watch. As an original anime you don't have to worry about which episodes are filler even though the anime is on the longer side. being very cute and are all modeled differently, which is important for such a big cast.

I’m your ordinary first year middle school student. Back then, I would have never imagined that I, me, someone like me could become an idol!”Story (7/10)Aikatsu short for Aidoru Katsudou! (Idol Activities) is a collectible card game created by Bandai which revolves around using cards featuring various designer clothes to help aspiring idols make their dreams come true. The story tells of Hoshiyama, Ichigo as she slowly rises to the top with her best friend Kiriya, Aoi and new member of the group *drum rolls* Shibuki, Ran. I know what you’re thinking… “Not another anime about idols.” Which I can...totally understand, since we already have the second season of Pretty Rhythm out.  (Pretty Rhythm: Dear My Future) So I could totally understand if you decide to skip the whole entire series. However, to tell you the truth the anime isn’t half bad. To be honest, I truthfully enjoyed it since it contained a brand of pure innocence I haven’t seen in a shojo anime. When I watched the anime it felt as if I’ve been taken eight years into the past to when I fondly enjoyed cartoons like Power Puff Girls and Totally Spies. What a very nostalgic feeling it was. Anyway, if you’re looking for an anime that will make you feel like a seventy year old woman mesmerizing and remembering the glory years of her childhood than I highly recommend this anime to you. Overall if you plan on watching this anime I guarantee that bits and pieces of your childhood will start to sing.Characters (8/10)Ichigo Hoshiyama is your normal first year middle school student who has the aura of an idol. At first she didn’t have any big dreams like becoming an idol, no not at all, she only wanted to inherit her mother’s bento shop, but that all changed  when she went to Kanzaki Mizuki’s concert. The bright and blinding lights, the shouts and screams of fans everywhere, the garish attire of idols, and the beautiful melody coming from the speakers; a whole different world compared to Ichigo’s life. “Why is everyone cheering? Why are there so many lights? I’ve never seen anything like this before in my entire life!” Those were the thoughts of young Ichigo as she looked around the entire complex of the concert mesmerized by each and every angle. Everywhere she turned seemed to look like some strange machine she had never encountered before. She was dumbfounded.Kiriya Aoi, Ichigo’s best friend, is an idol expert in every way; she knows everything there is to know about idols including their history and their music. Aoi is the definition of a true friend and will do whatever it takes to achieve her and Ichigo’s dreams of becoming well known idols.Shibuki, Ran is a professional idol who has been in the industry at a young age. At first, she hides her true feelings and emotions in front of all her classmates through a mask that is haunted by the past memories of a former roommate and friend. With the help of Ichigo and Aoi, however, she is able to slowly open up her feelings and become very close friends with them in due time.There is a substantial and appropriate amount of character development throughout the series so far, which slowly help develop strong relationships between characters through particular meetings and events.  With only a matter of less than ten episodes you could easily tell that through each episode there is proof of a growing friendship.Art (8/10)A bit of sugar, spice, and everything nice (PPG reference) will brightly describe the cuteness of this anime’s art style. This art style grabs the watcher with its absolutely adorable appealing scenery, character design, and attire. The art style may be a bit irritating, however, since it switches from 2D to 3D very similar to the way Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream did. Hey, at least the anime does not pointlessly switch from 2D to 3D like The Best!! Extremely Cool Student Council President did with its awful art design and its pointless switches from 2D to 3D every few minutes. The way Aikatsu used 2D and 3D is a great way of adding a bit of POP to the singing and dancing of the characters. The anime also uses a variety of bright colors such as shades of pink and purple adding to the anime's overall light hearted feeling. Rarely or will it ever use any dark and shady colors in this anime since it's far from the anime's original intention of creating an innocent daily life of an idol.Music (9/10)“Hi Signalize! The answer lies on the other side of the sky…” The opening of this anime uses a bit of fresh elements of calming and yet POPPING rhythms. It uses its own unique characteristics which make the anime different from other shojo openings. “Sunday, Monday, Chu-Chu Tuesday. Everyday I’m flipping pages like a calendar girl”  The ending is absolutely amazing with an overall classic feel of a very old setting adding elements of the 1900s and cuteness using a gramophone record and chibi creations. Even the ending song uses an old pop feeling when I hear and see it making it one of my favorite anime endings. The voices of the characters are in no way dark and serious, these seiyuus do an excellent job of adding an innocent and cute atmosphere to the anime. One thing that best surprises me is that Morohoshi, Sumire a 12 year old seiyuu is voicing the main character. Overall she’s an excellent choice since she has the perfect voice for her.Enjoyment (7/10)The anime is so innocent in every way. It felt wonderful to feel like a youngster again just by watching this anime. It is so childish and so far it doesn’t capture the several harsh realities of the world which can be both a pro and con in its own way. I greatly recommend this anime to people who enjoy watching shows like Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream and who just want to escape the adult world and feel like a kid, rejuvenated by this anime’s childish and cute atmosphere. But of course this anime is also a good way to just unwind yourself from all the stresses and cruel gifts of this world. Grab a cup of hot chocolate milk with some of those adorable tiny marshmallows and watch this anime... who knows you might feel like your in Candy Land. totally understand, since we already have the second season of Pretty Rhythm out.

Also in the next episodes I am hoping that there will be some hints of romance in there because if they are thinking of something simillar to Pretty Rhythm Aurora Dream they will eventually put some romance in there but when I read the description for Aikatsu it said that it was originally a game where you produced idol and because I did not play that game I do not know if there will be romance but because I am such a big romance anime fan I hope there will be ^.^ I hope this was helpful >. up the story is sort of the same and because I like Pretty Rhythm Aurora Dream I really liked this one aswell I highly recommend this to those people who love to watch animes with music dancing , friendship and a bit of romance, its all girly and lovely so cute :D!!!!

This includes seeing the characters practice for concerts, facing problems and how they improve thanks to them, and seeing them participate in idol-related activities like TV programs, firming autographs (and all the awesome moments that come from seeing fans interacting...with them) or being actresses in movies/TV dramas among others things. This gives a very solid variety to the series and together with the nice comedy coming from the cast makes each episode so enjoyable to watch.It\'s worth saying that this anime has zero fanservice and has quite a lighthearted tone compared to others from the idol genre. Outside of some unique (and greatly executed) moments, the drama is never particularly big, being “rivals” is another way to say great friends to improve with, and damn if it\'s wholesome, it\'s hard to not smile all the time watching this! That doesn\'t mean that Aikatsu doesn\'t have emotional moments though, instead it actually delivers the hardest when it comes to payoff when seeing the characters succeeding and taking a step towards their dreams.A big theme of the series is finding the inspiration for a dream thanks to another person, with the own protagonist at the start of the series, Ichigo, being clueless about what she wanted to be until she was invited to the concert of the most popular idol of the moment and was so impressed with her performance that she wanted to become one as well.This is something that will happen many times in the future as we see the characters grow and how they end up inspiring the next students that join the school as the years pass with their actions (yes, years pass as the series progresses, leading to more focus on new characters progressively). That is such a satisfying feeling because we don\'t see the characters just in the “getting good” phase, but further than that.As it\'s to be expected of a long length series that has a dance scene (or more) in the majority of the episodes, Aikatsu uses CGI animation for them and, being honest, they don\'t look too good at first, but that changes fast with the pass of the episodes to the point they look fantastic. That together with the great songs the series has (help, my playlist is full of Aikatsu songs) makes those scenes so, so enjoyable.I will briefly talk about the three main characters at the start of the story:- Ichigo Hoshimiya, a cheerful girl with a heart of gold, absurdly likeable and a big eater, and damn if she can be badass too, nothing stops her!- Aoi Kiriya, a total expert when it comes to idols, she\'s more of the cool type and combinates so well with Ichigo, who is her childhood friend.- Ran Shibuki closes the main trio with a more mature personality, she has been working as a model since she was younger and is praised for her style.This is really just an introduction to the main trio, between the other idols who get the spotlight (who are a lot), the designers of the brands each idol uses, Ichigo\'s family, and all the other characters who have chances to shine, the cast becomes really big, but it\'s done in a well paced way and each character has a nice personality and actions that makes them stay memorable. And I haven\'t even talked of best teacher Johnny Bepp yet, yeah!In conclusion, do you like following lovable characters and seeing them grow over time in their journey to fulfill their dreams, inspiring future generations to do the same? Do you like great dance scenes with music that you will most likely add to your playlist to listen to again? Do you want to feel awful when you realize that you\'re halfway through the series and you don\'t want to see it end of how much fun you\'re having watching it?

Coming in at just under two hundred episodes, Aikatsu is a series that manages to do both, and there are so many ways to describe it; energetic, revitalising, and optimistic, to name a few. But the best thing about Aikatsu is that it's able to toss its target audience aside and create something able to entertain people of all ages. Unlike Hollywood family movies or shows like Friendship is Magic, there isn't...much dumbing down or simplifying of the content within—it's effective, straightforward, and surprisingly realistic in its presentation.So what makes it different?The premise is straightforward: A school for female idols named Starlight Academy exists to seek out and train its kin, be it through acting, dancing, singing, or some other form of entertainment. Aside from an exceptionally kind headmistress and a few spunky teachers, there is no supervision or management to keep the girls in check; much like college, the primary reason for their attendance is so that they can discover who they are as a person (or idol) whilst remaining in an open social setting. Thanks to its believability, the concept itself provides you with many dramatic writing opportunities. Who are the students? What are their reasons for attending? Why are they all so interested in living a monolithic public life? These questions are regularly asked and answered, and their answers further the countless possibilities of the universe time after time.To bridge the gap between idol and school life, the staff always provides students with opportunities to get their name out and/or obtain new apparel, resulting in a rush of motivation for everyone involved. Depending on their popularity, idols can even influence the work of prominent and rising fashion designers or brands at large. Once the characters' training cycle begins, the lurking element of surprise prevents you from taking your eyes off the screen. That's not to say it's all training and no action; the fun graces you one episode at a time, so the competitions, extracurricular activity, and other unspoilable events don't seem out of place for when their time comes. In other words, the occasional slices of life flow as naturally and beautifully as the show at large.One aspect I've found to be unique to Aikatsu is its painless and beautiful sincerity; the characters have natural unbreakable bonds between one another, be they incandescent rivals or shimmering partners. It shies away from the trends of melodrama and grittiness by keeping things light and sometimes funny, completely aware of the fact that the most powerful emotional stirs are naturally-occurring. The cake is topped with a sprinkling of internal conflict, often pertaining to the difficulty of meeting one's own expectations. For a cast made up of teenage girls, they're delightfully headstrong and angst-free. That maturity spares you the clichéd nature of most conflicts within Idolm@ster and Love Live, and often gives you the opportunity to ask yourself the same questions. I truthfully believe the series is ultimately sociological, as is any great drama.That said, the show's composition resembles western TV dramas much more than it does your typical anime; the supporting characters are constantly evolving, changing roles, and moving into the picture, whilst the main characters themselves aren't as prominent as you may believe. Such traits are definitely not suited to everyone, but for anyone searching for more complex development, they are a dream come true. The continuity put on display here is fairly amazing—things you may haven't seen for dozens of episodes can slowly begin to reappear, and they always have a graceful fall into place. It doesn't sound so surprising on paper, but the practical appropriation of older content happens when you least expect it to. You'll want to trust me on this one.For the sake of performances, a fun little wardrobe transition to 3DCG is made whenever an idol needs to be on stage. But don't hold your breath! While the CG starts out on rocky ground, it goes out of its way to make some vast adjustments every few episodes. By the time you're a third of the way through, all of your gripes with its appearance will disappear. Still, it never stops making improvements, and things become increasingly gorgeous as you approach the final episode. The beauty of the CG is best illustrated during group performances, yet it also has some interesting tricks up its sleeve like flying objects and wireframe views that liven up the stage experience. Some incredible on-stage camerawork does a great job illustrating the benefits of using 3D animation, and definitely proves why the show chose to use the medium in the first place. I'm not quite sure if the show could have retained the same energy without it.Finally, let's talk about the music. Some insert songs are impeccably composed and arranged,  others excel in one of those two departments, and the few songs leftover are straight-up bad. From a production standpoint, it's rather hit-or-miss, but the hits have the strength to absolve it of the misses. I even find the insert songs that are only okay to be a treat every once and a while, but due to the subjectivity of music, your personal results may vary. On the other hand, the background music is so subtle and relaxed that I doubt anyone could take issue with it. Heck, sometimes they're just little piano arrangements of prominent insert songs. It's definitely more consistent overall, and kind of sounds like something you'd hear from a modern Nintendo game or device. Kind of perfect to do work to.Point is, this review may make it sound like I think Aikatsu is exceptional and near-flawless. That's because I do. I find its weaknesses completely redeemed by the underlying strengths. I find it able to appeal to any demographic without a hitch. I find it to be of a standard that all other kids' anime should hope to achieve. If you're not sick of anime already, I would plead that you at least give it a shot. Otherwise, it's never anything remotely amazing, nor does it outright excel in any category; it was just enough to retain my interest in anime for much longer than I expected.And so as it decides to let go, I find myself doing the same. much dumbing down or simplifying of the content within—it's effective, straightforward, and surprisingly realistic in its presentation.So what makes it different?The premise is straightforward: A school for female idols named Starlight Academy exists to seek out and train its kin, be it through acting, dancing, singing, or some other form of entertainment.

I loved it. It is a typical Shoujo idol anime but it's entertaining.The characters here never fail to make me smile. Hoshimiya Ichigo being the main protagonist is extremely fun-loving and naive. Kiriya Aoi is the Idol Professor who supports her best friend Ichigo. Shibuki Ran is cold and hard to approach at first but later Ichigo and Aoi befriends her. All the characters here have special and lovable traits of their own.The music is enjoyable. There isn't even a single song I hate in this series.The animation is pretty nice and I loved the Shoujou-flavours in characters' designs.The...story is typical idol anime, dreaming of becoming top idol.

People who are looking for a lighthearted series will definitely enjoy this."", ""This anime usually gears to kids. As the time goes on, it goes less and less. Here is my review for Aikatsu. (I almost typed Aikatsu Stars)Story:Aikatsu is one of the anime that can be reference who is in the entertainment industry. As one watched longer, there are some quotes that everyone can find. It's a lesson that can be used to viewers as well. It showed how hard the work to be a top idol. Even it is a game adaptation (card adaptation), one must not deny that the way their doing can be a real life demonstration too.Art:As the story goes, the audition...gets upgraded and updated. The graphic of the auditions are getting real every season. The first audition came from a 3d graphics of a video game. This was not a problem to viewers who started watching the first few weeks of Aikatsu. As time goes on, it had changed a little by little. Now, at the end of the Audition, the graphics of it is like Anime version but more. (can't explain this part properly) therefore, the art is good enough and doesn't need anymore revisions.Sound:OMG the music :) the jazz music of the endings. Keep up the good work. As for the OST's, for first and second season, i like the music of the preview. Even the OST's are good, it did not feel any premium melodies embedded to the ost. Therefore, no complaints here.Character:These section is the time I need to be strict. Even though every idol in Aikatsu already is 100% pass, the downside of idols, maybe most of them to be exact, is their seiyuu. This is the reason why my rating did not become a full 10 mark. It's because I felt betrayed 100 episodes after that some other person did the voice for something else. My advice for this is before one make one of this anime's Music became their fav, know the singer first. Better yet, know the Seiyuu of ones chara before concluding right away. This is where i got betrayed. I looked up to Ichigo because she sings very good, and then when i looked up the profile here in MAL, it turns out Sumire did not sing in the anime. I did not even know there are two seiyuus listed :/Enjoyment:Full of enjoyment. When it's Akari's arc, it's starting to get less and less. One does not change gears that quickly to adapt Akari as the main character and leave out the previous main charas. So, when one watched the movie of Ichigo, nostalgia kicks in. I still enjoy Akari's arc. So yeah.Overall:I would not say masterpiece, but the plot, the storyline, the lines are amazing. I am surprised that some episodes after audition, one can give a good quote that can be used in real life. This is one of the reasons that inspired me to keep watchingAikatsu is very unique to begin with. Even it explains a little bit of how real life for idol industry works, cards are like the magic tools for each idol. I wish that Ichigo should've made another season in her story, but it still good in every way. Recommending is hard because it might get view as a kiddy girly anime. gets upgraded and updated.

First half focuses on Hoshimiya Ichigo and then second half with Oozora Akari.Characters as a whole are really well done with their character arcs and even the more supporting ones get episodes dedicated to them and show growth throughout the series.  Of course some are more fleshed out than others but as a whole they all come into their own natural roles and feels natural.  Some support characters do feel very 1 note even with their character arc they go through as they have...a gimmick and that\'s all they ever really amount to.Story is something I\'m a bit mixed on.  What I would call S1 which is 1-50 had the strongest story in general with a great climax.  S2 felt a bit aimless until near the end as it introduced concepts that would be explored better in future Aikatsu series and largely were just to push updates in the Aikatsu arcade game it felt like.  S3 which is ep 101 the MC switches and the whole of s3 is the MC\'s working towards building a name for themselves and moving out of their comfort zones and coming closer together.  S4 is honestly the weakest of them all in my books as they just split the main 3 for a good chunk of the season to form other units just as the main 3 felt like they meshed well.  It sorta comes back together near the end to form their iconic unit.Art is solid as a whole when talking about the 2D aspect.  Characters don\'t look bad and the color scheme of the series makes everything blend well.  CGI on the other hand was ever changing and you could tell.  First few ep looked like something out of a ps2 game but quickly did start to evolve.Sound as good as a whole but once again in aspects during the concerts like with the CGI it fails early on and in parts doesn\'t really ever improve.  Fashion show runway ""concerts"" would have the CGI character model dance but no real mouth movement would happen.  Coming from watching Aikatsu Stars! where the fashion concert parts had it look like they were singing just shows the evolution they took from this.Enjoyment while there were parts I really didn\'t care for as a whole I was hooked and couldn\'t stop watching.  Gave me 2 characters I absolutely adore and I can watch many episodes over and over again because I just liked them so much. a gimmick and that\'s all they ever really amount to.Story is something I\'m a bit mixed on.

That's pretty much the gist of it. Of course, you have to understand this series is supposed to be for kids. However, there's something about watching each episode that feels satisfying. If ever I'm having a bad day, or I'm getting tired of seeing other...shows that are serious and dark, Aikatsu! always brings a smile to my face.The characters is one of the aspects that makes it its own. There are a myriad of characters that we see, and they all have their own unique personalities. What's great about them is all of them have plenty of screen time to be able to get a good judge on them. With the roster they have, I'm sure there's bound to be a fanbase for each one, which is great.While the animation isn't all too special (and, likewise, there are times when we see a dip in quality), it's really more about the character designs. It's not just the personalities that make the character stand out, it's how they look. Just by looking at them, you will be able to tell who they are.Finally, we cannot forget about the music, for without it, it wouldn't be Aikatsu! in the first place. With each episode, there are songs written specifically for the show. You will hear them as the opening and ending themes or as inserts; they are performed by the fictional characters, but, surprisingly, not by their voice actors. There are so many songs, it's unbearable, and I have all of them. Every single song is so catchy, it's hard not to love them!As you can see, I'm giving this so much praise, despite it only being a kids show. But, does it have to not be a kids show in order to make it seem not weird? The show is harmless entertainment. I've stuck around with this series since episode one, and that was three and a half years ago. It shocks me that it's run for this long; I had originally thought it'd end by at least two cours. At first, I thought it was so-so, but as it went on, my love for it grew more. It even came to the point where I practically cry with each episode because of how much I love it (the last episode was no better).If you're looking for some good old fun with great characters, awesome music to dance to, and you don't care what the general audience for the show is, I'd say give Aikatsu! a shot. shows that are serious and dark, Aikatsu! always brings a smile to my face.The characters is one of the aspects that makes it its own.

For an example, Shibuki Ran is a professional idol and yet Ichigo and Aoi are higher than Ran. Aikatsu8 was full of BS, instead of the higher-ups, they put rookies! The fact that rookies have surpassed higher-ups is just stupid.Second of all, characters such as Yurika, Kaede, Shion, Ran etc have REALLY less showtime. Season 3 is about rookies trying to become top idols and they are supposed to give more showtime to them more, BUT when they want to show that the top idols being their seniors, it's mostly Ichigo, Aoi, Otome or Sakura. They...NEED to give more showtime to the other characters as how Ichigo, Aoi, Otome & Sakura are given. 1 or 2 episodes are not enough for them!Third of all, the transferring program is TOO much. They've given more showtime to the transfer student idols than the non-transfers already in Season 2. Season 3 is like just 'delaying' the awesomeness by doing a transfer student program. They can just have the Unit Cup but bringing in Season 2 stuff again is just 'outdated' already. Just have the seniors advice them and show them stuff to their juniors.Lastly, Akari has too much showtime. May the other characters have a fair amount of showtime, please.

Starlight Academy is a famous academy in the world of Aikatsu and Aoi herself who adores all things idols very much believes their time has come.

I honestly need to admit that Aikatsu is a very flawed anime that could of been great and an instant classic! While Aikatsu was certainly above average for sure and proved a long running idol anime could work, the anime seemed to really struggle at different points of its famous run. If it was starting bland with very ugly CGI or a horrible executed fifty one episode second season that introduced less interesting characters that caused just uprising characters to fade into a role of become sideline catchphrase characters. Sadly, a girl known by the name of Otome really never recovered from what I witnessed and even an attempt to keep her relevant felt lackluster compared to the character who had the throne before her. Avoiding spoilers, it was a pity. Aikatsu also had struggles later on and at times had art that was really nothing amazing. Actually, it was even trash at times. Though despite my criticism, Aikatsu really did shine in certain areas as wel-Yurika-Sama: Did you even like our 170+ episode anime?Aoi Nee-San: Personally, I thought it was very special!Letting me finish girls, yes I did enjoy the vibrant world that was Aikatsu. It had a fantastic cast of characters and is entertaining despite the flaws. It also has fantastic music and is certainly a must watch for fans of idol anime. Though, if you fail to enjoy anime that are dragged on or that can be called cute, avoid Aikatsu. Also, did I mention that the voice cast will be returning for Aikatsu Stars?

Upon meeting Mizuki who is acclaimed as the most popular idol known currently, Hoshimiya decides to take the leap in the process changing her life forever. Now, my second assistant will help me critique the anime fairly and as accurate as possible.Aoi Nee-San: Now that was something special! Though, was Aikatsu as special?Well, Aoi. I honestly need to admit that Aikatsu is a very flawed anime that could of been great and an instant classic! While Aikatsu was certainly above average for sure and proved a long running idol anime could work, the anime seemed to really struggle at different points of its famous run. If it was starting bland with very ugly CGI or a horrible executed fifty one episode second season that introduced less interesting characters that caused just uprising characters to fade into a role of become sideline catchphrase characters. Sadly, a girl known by the name of Otome really never recovered from what I witnessed and even an attempt to keep her relevant felt lackluster compared to the character who had the throne before her. Avoiding spoilers, it was a pity. Aikatsu also had struggles later on and at times had art that was really nothing amazing. Actually, it was even trash at times. Though despite my criticism, Aikatsu really did shine in certain areas as wel-Yurika-Sama: Did you even like our 170+ episode anime?Aoi Nee-San: Personally, I thought it was very special!Letting me finish girls, yes I did enjoy the vibrant world that was Aikatsu. It had a fantastic cast of characters and is entertaining despite the flaws. It also has fantastic music and is certainly a must watch for fans of idol anime. Though, if you fail to enjoy anime that are dragged on or that can be called cute, avoid Aikatsu. Also, did I mention that the voice cast will be returning for Aikatsu Stars? So, if you enjoyed the VA for Aikatsu then you\'ll likely be pleased at the news!Yurika-Sama: By the way, what is your opinion on me?Best girl.Yurika-Sama: W-Wha?Anywho. Thanks for reading. Let\'s all.....Akari: You barely discussed me...Listen, future watchers won\'t want to be spoiled! You are amazing, no fear. Anyway...Me with Yurika, Aoi and Akari: Lets all Aikatsu!Overall: 6.3', 'This anime is not finished yet, only 19 episodes out , but it is nevertheless one of my favorites! do you like super cute anime with a good story and lovely characters! then it is perfect!I think it is much better and intressang than Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream.it has a lot more action, and I like that they dance instead of skating. I also like the main character here better than in Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream.You meet many more characters, each with their own unique personality!it is an anime that makes you never want to give up what you really love! bit like yumeiro...patissiere! patissiere!', '(Currently at ep 66)Ever since I watched Love Live! and K-On! I needed something cute, relaxing, fun and music filled to watch that I could watch at the end of the day to unplug from work, university and everyday life. To be honest I wanted to see more Idol stuff, as I\'m now stuck in Idol Hell forever and I don\'t plan on getting out. I then AKB0048 thinking it was going to be another cute anime albeit in a futuristic setting, and boy I was wrong and I got them feels out of it, but still I needed something to let off some steam.I...then crossed Aikatsu. ""Watashi no atsui aidoru katsudou, Aikatsu! hajimarimasu!"". Boy, I can\'t begin to tell you how stupidly kawaii it felt after watching the main character telling me every chapter ""you need to relax? here, aikatsu\'s gonna start"". When I started watching it I thought ""it\'s gonna be great to watch it for fun"". Then, I think about 4 days after I started I was already into part 2 of the first season and I couldn\'t let go.The story of Aikatsu follows Hoshimiya Ichigo on her journey to become an Idol and be the best at it with her lifelong friend Kiriya Aoi. They both enter Starlight Academy with hopes of being the best in everything they try. Each episode has its own story and adventure that you can\'t wait to see. That is the whole premise of the show, until you realize there\'s something more hidden behind the story, which is a message of hard work, have fun doing what you like, never give up, and if you fail just smile and keep moving forward. On top of that, after each episode you get an ""Aikatsu! Aphorism"" which might seem dull and gimmicky, but when you think about it, you can really put some of them to use (one of my favorites is from one of the latest I saw which said ""Start your new year running!"")As for the artistic side, the use of a HUGE bright colors palette really puts you in the mood of feeling happy, relaxed, fun and wanting to dance and sing along. Each character has its own colors and can easily be recognized. The only flaw this anime has is its 3D side. The first 15 or so episodes have one of THE WORST 3D animations possible, but if you bear with it, you actually get to see it evolve and become one of THE BEST 3D animations. It really shows its evolution through the episodes and right now, what I see in the 3Ds is almost on par with AKB0048 in all honesty.The musical side of the show is its best part and its greatest strength. Although I am a huge fan of Love Live music, most of it tends to be cutesy, mostly jpop oriented and not easily listenable by people outside of Japan. What Aikatsu does is something beyond what I could imagine. The blend of genres Aikatsu has on its show is something incredible. You got the j-poppy Idol Activity, but the more western pop oriented sound of the Signalize opening. Then you get the old shcool poppy sound of the ending Calendar Girl. There\'s an episode that even dares to try with Gothic Rock/metal with the song Glass Doll, which, as a huge metal fan myself, found reallly well composed.As for the characters, they\'re all unique, with its own ambitions, strengths and weaknesses. Its as well one of the animes greatest strengths, as it follows each story carefully and what being an Idol means to every character (Ichigo best girl, but Otome (oh my god those Love you!s) comes in a close second with Seira (from the second season)). Each one of them has its own art and personality that blend together so good.All in all, Aikatsu!, although aimed mostly at a much younger audience than myself (I think its aimed towards <13 girls) it has given me a lot of joy and happiness watching it, everything about it so good and cheerful that I can\'t get enough of it. then crossed Aikatsu.

Its not all that realistic considering the idol world is very harsh but it gives...that happy lucky spin that sometimes this kind of anime needs. Ichigo is a typical leading character yet has something about her which is fun to follow her through the entire anime though i will say my favorite songs arent from her brand but she and every character in these two seasons makes it a complete and great season of their own. Season two story also gives you a little headsup on whats going to happen in season 3 with the introduction of Akari whom i can talk about when i get to season 3-4. Honestly i was worried about watching this anime but when the story was so easy to watch and characters so easy to like it made one of my favorites idol wise anime.Characters well there are tons so i wont say them all. Ichigo is the typical happy hard working anime mc which we all know but there is something about her that atleast makes her loveable as a character in herself.Shibuki ran and Kiria Aoi  are her friends which combination are always nice and funny to watch and with the rest of their friends they complete this anime. Hey you forgot Mizuki yeah the idol queen who rarely or never loses anything. This anime makes mizuki at times feel like a duo mc with ichigo which you will probably feel after a while and it can be annoying.Music wise this anime got their good bad and ugly ones but i dont think its right to say those and those are bad since it very much differs from person to person What they like It shouldnt be up to me as a reviewer to say those are the best or something. Eventhough i will say that Loli gothic has my favorites mostly. And this can be said for season 1 - 4.I honestly have few dislikes about it but that the creators made mizuki some immobil mountain kinda irritates me but that might be one of my few complaints so to speak. Since music or sound is just very individual preferencewhich is why I liked the variation of songs in this anime. The characters are easy to like and the story makes you just want to follow it through.If i was reviewing the first 1-2 seasons alone i would give the anime  8 maybe -9 but ye old 3 and 4 pulled it down. Not much but they did. Stay tuned for 3 and 4 now if your able.Season 3 -4 revolves around Akari whos idol carrier begun from watching ichigo on the tv.Story: It cant be helped but one does feel that these 2 new seasons were being a part of the great milking consept many long anime are famous for. The story has its big typical similarities with the first specially. When i got to the 3 i just felt like it started to be too much of the same or being too dull. It didnt have the same light as the former too and the reason i did push myself through all the episodes was because i wanted to stand here saying i have watched them all so i know. The songs , story and everything else feels weaker and its as if your mind keeps wanting something else. Though i admit this might be because im more of a first mc person in general with anime i still feel its just a reworked characters and story and nothing really new.  The 4 season has its own way as Akari and co discovers some new idols but remains the same as the 3 eventhough its about half the episodes it still just makes me want to end it.Characters: Akari who is the main here who follows her star ichigo and wants to try to reach the summit over here beloved senpai with Sumire the devoted loli gothic fan and Hinaki the child star and fashion girl.Eventhough i probably should think of these two as seperated in a way from the first 2 i will always think that there is something lacking in just about everything in this anime with a minor expetions. Its ok but when its done before and been done big then watching something with the same thing becomes just fair and a decent idol anime nothing more.I mean i liked parts of some characters that they got a japanese ish character next to kitaoji but i hate saying that there is nothing about the main characters that gave me that i love thing. I have tried to like it but couldnt and can only say what i think and feel about it.I think even if i were to have watched the 3 and 4 season first or if they had been the first i wouldnt have enjoyed them as the first or second. So stand alone anime i would give 3-4 somewere between 6 and 7  but not much else. It suffers from the been there seen it all consept.Overall with 1, 2, 3 and 4 i will give it a close 7 if anything maybe minus 7. For whoever who have managed to come this far the first two are great and i do advice going into the 3 and 4 with an open mind if you can sadly i admit i dont think i could. Dont expect the big drama and screaming but expect a fun anime that is lovely in its own way. that happy lucky spin that sometimes this kind of anime needs.

She is no different from a copy of Ichigo. In the following seasons, there are differences but not many people appreciate because there are too many characters and they are...all 13-14 years old.

Angel Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5251/Angel_Densetsu,"[""To summarize this series in 1 world would be HILARIOUS. When reading this manga/ watching the 2 episodes you will repeatedly LOL.  Its a shame that there are only 2 OVA episodes to this series as I believe it should be granted more. The manga for this series is long finished and I recommend reading this to everyone. The 2 episodes in my opinion are better than the manga because the artwork on Kitano's face is much better in the anime rather than the manga. As the manga progresses the artwork gets a bit better however. That being said I would recommend watching the...2 episodes of anime before switching to reading the manga which leaves off around chapter 4.Story: There isn't too much of a story for this series. It just covers the daily school life of Kitano. Later in the manga small arcs form, but there isn't much of a continuing story.Art: To see a demon in human form, Kitano's face seals the deal for the artwork. Otherwise artwork is a bit out dated, but this series has been out for over a decade.Sound: When Kitano yells out.... all I can hear is my laughter.Character: Kitano is seen as a demon in human form. He is a love-able protagonist as hes never doing anything wrong,and being misjudged by his peers.READ THE MANGA! 2 episodes of anime before switching to reading the manga which leaves off around chapter 4.Story: There isn't too much of a story for this series.

Kitano is kind man never hurt anyone and when he get punched he thinks hes the one to blame. Interesting story with only 2 episode :( so i did read the manga after the episodes cos i loved this! "", ""After seeing several insufficient reviews about the work, it aroused my interest to write one too, and I find it curious, that people only took the comic side of the work and not its subtext about a chilling criticism about the human look, judgment, fear and values of someone by their appearance.The movie starts by showing Kitano, the comedy here revolves around Kitano being so ugly that everyone associates him with the devil, delinquents are scared to death of him, teachers and principal are terrified of him, ordinary people think he is a psychopath. The work takes place during Kitano's events and the comedy uses...the misunderstandings of judging the person and thinking that he will harm someone.I really like this theme mainly because it is simple to understand and direct, Kitano is the image of an angel, he is simply an amazing person, an angel on earth, he only wants to do good, but he is trampled on, judged, humiliated, people are scared to death of him because of his appearance, this shows not only Kitano's side of not understanding things around him because he is too kind and innocent to understand, but it also shows the contempt and need for humans to always judge someone or diminish people by what they think they are.Kitano in these two episodes is used as a symbol and as a character, the work itself is humorous, the scenes of the gang, who are really bad guys, is explored by taking their own poison, as in the scene where Kitano wants to return the wallet or when he can't hold a tree because he is weak, but the delinquents are so furious with his face, that they don't even understand the situation, they are just scared to death, and it is an excellent way to approach comedy with this kind of misunderstanding, the author is spectacular in this sense.About the symbolism Kitano not only passes a message that deep down people are good, society has different views, but also that the fault of great people being destroyed by others is always their own fault, not yours. It is a spectacular critique in two ova, and is conveyed magnificently, not only changing my views on society, but also about judging someone for something, without really knowing them.Kitano uses and abuses this subtext, with a perfect character who is the perfect archetype for this situation, I believe Kitano is what makes the work so fantastic.

Have you been in a situation when you look at someone , you don\'t even know a single thing about them and thought ""he\'s such a creep, ew"", ""she\'s too pretty, that\'s why she\'s such a bitch"", ""just look at him he must be a crack head, he\'s following...me! I should walk fast"". Seiichirou Kitano is one of those people, who\'s been talked bad like all the time. With just his looks he could scared the crap out of you. Some would froze to their feet, some would choose to run the hell away from him.There\'s this scene were he approached a stray cat, and it suddenly jumps out of its feet, growled and hissed at him, like he was some kind of terrifying unknown entity. I\'m like, wow even cats don\'t like him. He was definitely been in a lot of situation where it made me laugh my ass out, at the same time made me feel sad, because if I\'m in his shoes and most of the peeps on the street was terrified of me, I\'ll probably will develop a severe chronic insecurity which I would stay at home forever. Or get some kind of full-face cosmetic surgery.

That style of humour would be jokes based on misunderstanding. An example would be when a girl walks in on a MC after he had god tripped into another girl's lap and then proceeds to punch said MC. This OVA series however, is what I personally think is this kind of humour done right. There isn't much to talk about because it's just a 2 episode OVA series but I think it's worth talking about.If you've not read the synopsis yet,...the story is of a boy with the heart of an angel but the looks of a devil. He's constantly doing nice things, but everyone's afraid of him and he sometimes ends up doing something to make everyone fear him more. The way it's all done just makes me laugh over and over again. The story isn't much, but it's presented in such a way that I'd say it's about a 7.Story:7The art style is quite old, this was released in 90's after all. I still think the old style of anime has a certain charm about it that makes it look alright. Nothing to special for it's time but I certainly think it's a style that suits the show.Art:6Sound was decent, can't really say it was amazing. I do think the voices of the characters were good though and the MC's voice was spot on.Sound:6The characters were very good. Sure you can argue that there's not much dimension to them, but I'm pretty sure a good amount of teens these days act the same way and we don't consider them 2 dimensional. I think the MC is really good as well because he's not your normal MC and give him credit for that.Character:8I really enjoyed this, it was very funny and I'll end up reading the manga to see how things go from there. I do recommend people to watch this, seeing as it's not all that long anyway and I'm sure if you're up for a good laugh, this will give it to you.Enjoyment:9Overall: 8 the story is of a boy with the heart of an angel but the looks of a devil.

Angel Densetsu is a funniest anime I ever watch. I always laughing because people reacted to Kitano's demon face. He have a scary face that make other people think he is very scary but inside his heart he is a kind-hearted angel who have devil face. It only have 2 episodes but it is worth your time.

Yes it's short and yes there isn't much to the show but despite this, its still really enjoyable.  There isn't too much to say about the show if i'm going to be honest but i'll give it a go.Animation wise it really rather strong.  Despite not much happening, the animation assists the comedy well.  I would go as far to say that without the strength in animation, it wouldn't be anywhere near as funny.  The character design is pretty standard for the time and there aren't many characters to focus on.  Then...again, not sure this really is a valid negative considering there are only 2 episodes lasting no more than 21 mins each of actual show.

Everything that happens is because people misunderstand the main protagonist and think he’s a delinquent. The older, unique artstyle also definitely adds to this as unlike in anime like Toradora or Beelzebub where the characters more or less look the same as everyone else, the main protagonist of Angel Densetsu, Kitano, actually looks scary with his slick-backed hair, lack of eyebrows and...almost nosferatu-looking grayish face. And through the misunderstandings there are some good bits of interesting moments that are both funny and intense, like a sort of dark slapstick humor, the dark part more prevalent in the manga where they look more and more into what it means to judge Kitano based on his looks.

Bai Yao Pu 4th Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/57995/Bai_Yao_Pu_4th_Season,"[""TL;DR: The donghua version of Mushishi.First, I was simply curious, because it was a chinese anime with a very promising cover and a somewhat interesting plot description. I expected to lose interest in it after the first few episodes. But then I just kept watching... And now, 4 days later, I can't wait to see the next episode. This is truly something amazing. A hiden gem, that I can only compare to Mushishi.I've been thinking for a while, how to describe this donghua, because I honestly think, that more people should check it out. However, I think this one will fall into the underrated and...unapprechiated pile, like most of the great ones, that will only get recognised many years later.Story structure:The first season was pretty much just random short stories in 2 episode formats, where we learned about the main characters and we got a taste of what this donghua are planning to offer. It has a rather unusual way of telling stories in my opinion. Almost all of the stories start out with a chaotic setup, which could make viewers think, that these are poorly writen stories. However, by the end of each episode we learn about the truth of the conflict and it always bring out a very emotional reveal. For me personally, this was a very refreshing experience, because it really felt like a reward for being patient and letting the story play it self out. Unlike in most anime nowadays, where we get bombarded with strong emotinal impulses, just to keep us glued to them. Once you get used to the format, you'll sit the stories trough knowing, that something amazing will await you at the end.Over the following seasons, this donghua begin refining itself and telling longer and more complex stories, which made the previously shorter experiences even better.Characters:The main cast is interesting. At first glance they're all very flawed and seemingly unlikable characters who can't even stand eachother. However, as we see them working their way though their various encounters, we learn through their actions, that there's a lot more complexity involved with them. It is very refreshing in this environment, where most characters are trying to up eachother by being the most perfect being, with some random flaw thrown in. Or the ones, that are literary just an expected stereotype.The most beloved characters always flawed in many ways, and their journey of overcoming these flaws make them unforgetable.Side characters:The side characters are the ones, who carry show, just like in Mushishi. Their problems and strugles keep things interesting. Luckily these characters rarely predictable, like in most anime, were most people can guess everything about them in about 5 minutes. I really apprechiete the fact, that some of these characters are dealing with serious, very relatable problems and in many cases, their conclusion at the end is almost enlightening. However, be warned not all conclusions are happy endings, but just.The world:The donghua takes place in a historical fantasy setting with a little bit of fantasy to make it interesting any mysterios. There's a bigger over arching plot involving this fantasy aspect, that we slowly learn about, but we're only getting tiny bits of information drops about it. I really enjoy watching it, because it feels very real. There are multiple instances, where we get a grim reminder of the reality of ceratin things in life. No ones perfect, everyone get their fair share of happines and sorrow. Some more, than the others.Conclusion:The overall idea is the same as in Mushishi. A traveling doctor healing/helping patients. But here, the story structure evolved from a single episode formats and it's trying to reinvent itself in every season to do better, than last time. The main cast also have a much bigger impact, unlike in Mushishi, where he was mostly just a semi-active participant in the stories. On the surface, Mushishi appears to be a much darker themed story, I think this donghua penetrate deeper, with it's emotionally charged revelations. The main casts unsually goofy antics probably play into this too, by making you forgot, how episodes usually end.I'm still new to writing these, but I really hope, that my review will make you give this donghua a chance and will bring as much joy into your anime watching life as it did to my. unapprechiated pile, like most of the great ones, that will only get recognised many years later.Story structure:The first season was pretty much just random short stories in 2 episode formats, where we learned about the main characters and we got a taste of what this donghua are planning to offer. It has a rather unusual way of telling stories in my opinion. Almost all of the stories start out with a chaotic setup, which could make viewers think, that these are poorly writen stories. However, by the end of each episode we learn about the truth of the conflict and it always bring out a very emotional reveal. For me personally, this was a very refreshing experience, because it really felt like a reward for being patient and letting the story play it self out. Unlike in most anime nowadays, where we get bombarded with strong emotinal impulses, just to keep us glued to them. Once you get used to the format, you'll sit the stories trough knowing, that something amazing will await you at the end.Over the following seasons, this donghua begin refining itself and telling longer and more complex stories, which made the previously shorter experiences even better.Characters:The main cast is interesting. At first glance they're all very flawed and seemingly unlikable characters who can't even stand eachother. However, as we see them working their way though their various encounters, we learn through their actions, that there's a lot more complexity involved with them. It is very refreshing in this environment, where most characters are trying to up eachother by being the most perfect being, with some random flaw thrown in. Or the ones, that are literary just an expected stereotype.The most beloved characters always flawed in many ways, and their journey of overcoming these flaws make them unforgetable.Side characters:The side characters are the ones, who carry show, just like in Mushishi. Their problems and strugles keep things interesting. Luckily these characters rarely predictable, like in most anime, were most people can guess everything about them in about 5 minutes. I really apprechiete the fact, that some of these characters are dealing with serious, very relatable problems and in many cases, their conclusion at the end is almost enlightening. However, be warned not all conclusions are happy endings, but just.The world:The donghua takes place in a historical fantasy setting with a little bit of fantasy to make it interesting any mysterios. There's a bigger over arching plot involving this fantasy aspect, that we slowly learn about, but we're only getting tiny bits of information drops about it. I really enjoy watching it, because it feels very real. There are multiple instances, where we get a grim reminder of the reality of ceratin things in life.

Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14227/Tonari_no_Kaibutsu-kun,"['An extremely disappointing series that had a lot of potential with vibrant characters that goes absolutely no whereAt first glance, TNKK seems like a cute and different kind of story. The female lead, Shizuku Mizutani, is top of her class but not without a price. She\'s cold and emotionless, only caring about studying and becoming successful, very much the anti-shoujo stereotype of being obsessed with love. She meets Haru, an intimidating boy with natural smarts that outmatch hers, a vivid outlook on life and an extremely wild, aggressive streak. The two are natural opposites - id and ego - who are destined to fall in...love and grow together, to better themselves, right?Nah.TNKK falls short of being a slice-of-life type of romcom, with half-hearted life lessons and story arcs that don\'t lead to actual character growth. Beyond the first episode or two, the story isn\'t exactly ""touching"" either. There is this back-and-forth love story for the majority of the 13-episode anime which was extremely tiresome all too soon. Characters are introduced, such as 3rd party love interests or the main characters\' relatives, that are irrelevant to the plot, get no character depth, or are rarely seen or heard from even though they are engaging and exciting. No plot lines get resolved and there is next to no character development. If anything, Haru and Shizuku regress into their 1-dimensional roles and become side-characters to others, such as Yamaken or Natsume (who, unfortunately, do not get their stories resolved either). It ends up being a chore to care about the two main characters.All in all, I just wouldn\'t recommend this series unless you REALLY have nothing better to watch. It has a few cute or sweet moments, but don\'t expect another Toradora or Chuunibyou. Having not read the manga, I can\'t be sure as to how well it goes along, but as a stand-alone anime, 13 episodes have left me wondering why I even bothered watching this show. And the fact that it can\'t hold its own, to me, is a mark of a bad show. love and grow together, to better themselves, right?Nah.TNKK falls short of being a slice-of-life type of romcom, with half-hearted life lessons and story arcs that don\'t lead to actual character growth.

The premise seemed interesting; a studious, no nonsense, anti-social girl named Shizuku finds a friend in a hostile boy Haru.While not an entirely unique story nor complex, I still found it entertaining.The story is quite simplistic, but I didn't really mind that much. (I just finished Noragami yesterday and that one was very complex.)I will say that I almost clicked out on the first episode due to pacing issues. However, I'm glad I didn't, because it turned out to be quite enjoyable. The said...pacing issues were non-existent due to a scene that happens at the end of the first episode that surprised and intrigued me, but I won't spoil it here.It was listed under the comedy section, so I figured I'd give it a shot, to break it up from all the serious anime I've been watching lately.Needless to say, the comedy did not disappoint. On multiple occasions I found myself laughing out loud, I even almost squirted milk up my nose.The art while nice and clean, is nothing special, however there are aspects and moments that are really beautiful. The animation during any of the sunset scenes are absolutely stunning. In the second episode I believe it's raining and the shot holds on the rain and the puddle. It looked incredibly realistic. Though not as stunning as others, I also love the eye designs, especially Shizuku and Haru's.The opening song is pretty average for the Shouju genre (or at least the ones I've seen), and I admittedly don't think that much for the ending song either. I will say I adore the soundtrack though, it's really mellow, and I could probably listen to it whilst going to sleep.The characters, I found were all very unique and distinct from one another, yet still maintain their personality as they developed. That being said, I feel as if it could have used a few more episodes to further develop the characters, as it ended fairly ambiguously in regards to said characters.When I started this early this morning, (like at one or two am) I didn't want to stop. But after watching four episodes I figured I should go to sleep. The first thing I did when I woke up this morning, you ask? I watched more. I definitely had me hooked, and I really wanted to know what was going to happen. I was a touch disappointed at the ending however the journey paid off, more so than the destination. pacing issues were non-existent due to a scene that happens at the end of the first episode that surprised and intrigued me, but I won't spoil it here.It was listed under the comedy section, so I figured I'd give it a shot, to break it up from all the serious anime I've been watching lately.Needless to say, the comedy did not disappoint.

Although providing quality artwork, animation, and satiating my thirst for lighthearted romantic-comedy, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My Little Monster) falls victim under this unfortunate plague.The plot of My Little Monster resides mainly in the perspective of the two main characters, Shizuku and Haru; both are social outcasts and have no friends at the beginning of the series due to their own respective personalities not meeting the standards of the social norm. They are both very weird characters, but maybe that\'s...why they were so entertaining to watch. I enjoyed the first half of My Little Monster a little more than the second because the characters were so forward with their emotions in the beginning and they really did voice what was on their mind unlike many other extremely passive rom-coms. The second half seemed to be a bit lacking for me in terms of development overall.The chemistry between the two main characters would be best described with a quote many of us have probably heard before in our lifetime, ""Opposites attract."" Shizuku is a study enthusiast whose main goal is to get good grades, while Haru is a semi-delinquent that does whatever he thinks is entertaining and often is seen getting into fights. Both become each other\'s first real friend. As they get to know each other Shizuku and Haru slowly begin to understand themselves as individuals and what they want from themselves and each other. They are able to make friends and assemble their own group of oddballs to form their own little niche.The core of the group consists of Shizuku, Haru, Natsume, and Sasahara and I liked all of them collectively. Since we know Shizuku and Haru are the romantic duo, where does that leave Natsume and Sasahara? Natsume is typically seen \'third-wheeling\' with Shizuku and Haru and often tags along with them to go places because she doesn\'t have friends either; she isn\'t very smart, is athletic, and is quite attractive to many guys in the show, leading her to be shunned by almost every other girl as a result. Sasahara is a baseball player that pops in every now and again, and though he\'s part of the core group he isn\'t there as much as Natsume is due to being in baseball and having other friends. He seems to be the most normal of the group. I loved this group of weirdos because they each brought something interesting to the table and truly delivered on the comedy portion of the rom-com.There are many times in My Little Monster that you will sadly forget the show is in fact a \'romantic\' comedy since the romantic bits of the show are extremely lacking. In fact, I would go so far as to deem it underwhelming. It was such a nice change up for the main characters to admit they were in love with each other within the first three episodes that I developed higher expectations thinking the series would be one of the best rom-coms around. Unfortunately, the romantic progress seemed to work backwards and the main characters went from knowing they were in love to becoming extremely passive, both unsure what they wanted from the relationship. Though this saddened me greatly, it does not ruin the show in the slightest.The artwork/animation and sound were spot on. I enjoyed everything the show had to offer for this portion. The artwork was unique and refreshing, there was clean animation, and the OP/ED were actually pretty good. There was the tingle of piano at dramatic moments, and upbeat silly music when things were getting fun, I couldn\'t ask for more. I also enjoyed the dialogue of My Little Monster very much. The subtle comments and word choices used really made for some quality comedic entertainment.Last but not least, the ending. As I mentioned in my introduction, the show seems to end at what seems to the the mid point in the series; it feels like it got halfway through a 24 episode run and got scrapped. A second season would do this series so much justice, but alas it may never come.Overall, if you plan to watch My Little Monster, don\'t have any expectations of a grand love story because there isn\'t one. As a romantic-comedy there should be a balance between romance and comedy, but this one leans more on the comedic side than the romantic one. It is a very feel good anime, and if you can ignore the lack of romantic development the show excels in giving you laughs and will leave you feeling genuinely happy. why they were so entertaining to watch.

Cheers!', ""Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is a romance anime that tries and ever so slightly succeeds at setting itself apart from the standard mass of harem anime that's out there, but inevitably stumbles and falls on its own flaws.Its first and most obvious flaw is that it progresses too fast. It is determined to set itself apart by portraying an attraction (of sorts) that's there and out in the open nearly from the get-go, but fails to recognize that this makes little actual sense when the characters hardly know each other. What is an attempt to portray, perhaps, a sense of naiveté or cute clumsiness from the...male lead - both at this junction and elsewhere in the series - comes across as silly rather than profound. The way the female lead falls for the male lead and the attraction she experiences feels rather out of tune with the character established in the beginning, creating dissonance rather than actual development. The subsequent challenges they face versus each other and those next to them tend to feel forced and this is both a result of the unsteady premise and the fact that, well, it doesn't set itself that much apart in the end. The end is a little better, especially if you overlook the last twelve-and-a-half episodes, but just... no.The other characters it portrays tend to be more of the same; unlikely and odd combinations that do not create interesting contrasts; rather, they left me dumbfounded at times with inane character interaction and stupid attempts at jokes. It felt... dumb. Simple and unclever. Few of the jokes really worked and their internal issues were driven by and challenged with equally plain methods. The ending was insufficient on many, many levels, failing to close some important knots and like so many other romance series, leaving the relationship itself a little too open.Animation-wise it does not offer a lot. Character designs are probably its strongest suit and they appear rather average, with often-out of place body structure and simple shading (yet at other times especially shading and vividness is done quite well). The backgrounds don't mix well with the character designs and are often very simple, as are the camera angles and shots used. The soundtrack offers some nice string and piano tracks, but for the most part it is your run-of-the-mill romcom soundtrack with a mix of comedy and romance themes. The opening theme is a very average school/romance theme with the usual colourful backgrounds and animations we've seen a thousand times before. The ending theme is more flowery but equally bland in terms of originality.Let this be said though. It avoids several common pit traps and clichés of romance anime, lacking both a distinct harem and many of the common episode settings that are so common. All in all however, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is an anime that tries to set itself apart, succeeds a little but eventually stumbles and falls face-first into the mud, void of any real sense of clever and intriguing writing.

Maybe you have more luck with it, but I would not personally recommend it."", 'Ok, so I wanted to wait for the anime to finish before writing a review because I wanted to have all my facts straight. Let me be a bit frank here:I am going to make a lot of people mad with this reviewPlease keep in mind that I rate a lot of anime highly on the premise of entertainment. If I enjoy something and finish it then I rate it highly. However, enjoying something and thinking that a series was well done can be two completely different things.But, as someone who is a huge fan of romantic comedies, who hasn’t read the manga...and has re-watched certain scenes, I feel the need to mention a few things regarding this anime: Both what’s great about it and what’s wrong with it.Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (or The Monster seated Next to Me) tells the story of Shizuku Mizutani, a very serious student who only cares about her grades. One day, Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to the home of a boy named Haru Yoshida, a delinquent who rarely attends school. Upon meeting Shizu, Haru immediately considers her his friend and a new relationship sparks between the two as they begin to experience things that neither of them have felt before such as friendship and love.The series itself is very episodic and appears to be well paced. Every episode contains at least one moment that will make you laugh and at least one moment that will make you go “awwww, isn’t that cute”.Brains Base did a great job with the animation for this show. Such amazing detail went not only into the main characters overall design, but even the side characters appeared to stand out. The backgrounds and lighting were also well done. Combine this with the animators bright color choices makes for the series to have an overall relaxing and cute atmosphere that most will enjoy.Now at this point you’re probably saying “Well, this anime seems interesting so far, why would you make people angry with these positive remarks?”Let me explain (spoilers).  After the first episode of the series, the premise of the story was presented to us in a way that made us think that for once, the female lead would be the one being chased rather than the one doing the chasing. I, personally, as a fan of Shojo, was happy with this because Shizu, while being extremely stoic, seemed to be a rational thinker while Haru was presented as………well…….. a possessive delinquent. The fact that Shizu WOULDN’T be interested in Haru makes sense to us.Then the third episode happened and this premise does a complete 180 with Shizu doing the chasing more or less out of nowhere.This, I’m sorry to say is one of the main problems with this series. While the premise and characters seemed good at the beginning, as the series goes on, you begin to realize how scattered and poorly structured the overall series actually is. You expect for the characters to move the overall story in a slice of life romantic comedy which has such a simple setting. But here, stuff happens almost at random and the characters actions at times seem to completely contradict what their characters SHOULD be doing.You could argue that the characters are growing and are trying to adjust to an environment that their not use to. After all, this series is about how two socially awkward people make friends and fall in love. But if that were the case, then we wouldn’t see them break out of character one moment, but then immediately regress to the way they were at the beginning. This makes everything done seem very forced and unnatural when there were maybe a dozen different ways the story could have been done right. By the end of the series, it’s really hard to claim that the main leads really changed between the first and last episode.If this were like say School Rumble were the series revolves around randomness and contradictions for the sake of comedy, then this would all be ok. But the producers are making the characters do this for the sake of unnecessarily expanding a series, making it longer and more complicated than it needs to be.“So if the series has such cookie cutter story progression like you claim, then why does this series get such unreal praise?”Simple: Gimmicks and quirks sell more than story.While one might THINK that the story is interesting and engaging, what’s REALLY interesting and engaging are the non-perverted comedic moments as well as the cute confessions which are done so well that I almost get a nose bleed from a cuteness overload. Who cares who confessed first, they’re cute together. Who cares if Haru’s not well put together, he looks adorable.Again, I don’t think this is a bad anime at all. If you are a fan of Shojo and or romantic comedies then it’s defiantly worth a look at least till the third episode. But it is a little……..misguided and manipulative to not be a little upset by it. and has re-watched certain scenes, I feel the need to mention a few things regarding this anime: Both what’s great about it and what’s wrong with it.Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (or The Monster seated Next to Me) tells the story of Shizuku Mizutani, a very serious student who only cares about her grades. One day, Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to the home of a boy named Haru Yoshida, a delinquent who rarely attends school. Upon meeting Shizu, Haru immediately considers her his friend and a new relationship sparks between the two as they begin to experience things that neither of them have felt before such as friendship and love.The series itself is very episodic and appears to be well paced. Every episode contains at least one moment that will make you laugh and at least one moment that will make you go “awwww, isn’t that cute”.Brains Base did a great job with the animation for this show. Such amazing detail went not only into the main characters overall design, but even the side characters appeared to stand out. The backgrounds and lighting were also well done. Combine this with the animators bright color choices makes for the series to have an overall relaxing and cute atmosphere that most will enjoy.Now at this point you’re probably saying “Well, this anime seems interesting so far, why would you make people angry with these positive remarks?”Let me explain (spoilers).  After the first episode of the series, the premise of the story was presented to us in a way that made us think that for once, the female lead would be the one being chased rather than the one doing the chasing. I, personally, as a fan of Shojo, was happy with this because Shizu, while being extremely stoic, seemed to be a rational thinker while Haru was presented as………well…….. a possessive delinquent. The fact that Shizu WOULDN’T be interested in Haru makes sense to us.Then the third episode happened and this premise does a complete 180 with Shizu doing the chasing more or less out of nowhere.This, I’m sorry to say is one of the main problems with this series. While the premise and characters seemed good at the beginning, as the series goes on, you begin to realize how scattered and poorly structured the overall series actually is. You expect for the characters to move the overall story in a slice of life romantic comedy which has such a simple setting. But here, stuff happens almost at random and the characters actions at times seem to completely contradict what their characters SHOULD be doing.You could argue that the characters are growing and are trying to adjust to an environment that their not use to. After all, this series is about how two socially awkward people make friends and fall in love. But if that were the case, then we wouldn’t see them break out of character one moment, but then immediately regress to the way they were at the beginning. This makes everything done seem very forced and unnatural when there were maybe a dozen different ways the story could have been done right. By the end of the series, it’s really hard to claim that the main leads really changed between the first and last episode.If this were like say School Rumble were the series revolves around randomness and contradictions for the sake of comedy, then this would all be ok. But the producers are making the characters do this for the sake of unnecessarily expanding a series, making it longer and more complicated than it needs to be.“So if the series has such cookie cutter story progression like you claim, then why does this series get such unreal praise?”Simple: Gimmicks and quirks sell more than story.While one might THINK that the story is interesting and engaging, what’s REALLY interesting and engaging are the non-perverted comedic moments as well as the cute confessions which are done so well that I almost get a nose bleed from a cuteness overload. Who cares who confessed first, they’re cute together. Who cares if Haru’s not well put together, he looks adorable.Again, I don’t think this is a bad anime at all. If you are a fan of Shojo and or romantic comedies then it’s defiantly worth a look at least till the third episode. But it is a little……..misguided and manipulative to not be a little upset by it.', 'This could also have been titled Domestic Violence:Origin Story. Shizuku is smart, focussed, hard-working. Unfortunately, one day she crosses paths with Haru. He is violent, jealous, and has no understanding of, or interest in, how anyone else thinks or feels. In other words, someone who Shizuku should stay well away from. He is an incipient abuser who needs therapy, not a girlfriend.Unfortuntely, Shizuku falls in love and forgives every red flag. Haru\'s default reaction to every stress is violence. See a friend talking to Shizuku? Attack. Encounter his brother? Grab the class president by the throat and hold her hostage.The worst of it is that...not only does he never understand the harm he is doing, not only does  everyone keep forgiving him, but the victims blame themselves. He\'s misundetstood. He had a hard childhood. It is their fault for not trying harder to understand him.Having reasons for abusive behaviour does not excuse that behaviour. Every violent criminal has ""reasons"" they think justify their acts. They never do. This story just disgusted me as I saw Shizuku\'s fate laid out, a spiral of self-recrimination and coping as Haru crosses one boundary after another in his fits of jealous rage until she ends up as one more domestic violence statistic. not only does he never understand the harm he is doing, not only does  everyone keep forgiving him, but the victims blame themselves.

Even trying to prevent her from going out.- He tries to control her friends and even treatens them with violence, one of them was almost pushed out of a fucking building.- **HE BEATS HER MANY TIMES** No seriously, more than once he made her bleed from punching her and then gave a pathetic excuse ""sorry i was angry"".Only watch this if you enjoyed movies...like twighlight like twighlight', ""This was the first romantic-comedy series I watched when I started watching anime a while back, it was great. Apparently this anime is shoujo, I didn't know what it was, but now I know. The setup or the premise instantly grabs you. The show is certainly enjoyable, greatly assisted by colorful range of expressions, and some genuinely funny lines. There were way too many still scenes , but we can use them. The scenes that were set up had such memetic potential.This series is bold, colorful, using varied, solid strokes with full color. The character designs are gorgeous and really appealing. The comedic sense...was simply pitch perfect for me. Gags and expressions were timed long enough for the chuckle, while being short enough so it does not overstays its welcome. The comedy remained consistent, deriving from characters taking advantage of humor, rather than utilizing gag-based jokes. The drama presented itself very well, intersecting with humor and not going into melodrama. The drama carefully presents multiple explorations and perspectives of relationship. Any episode does not end with a cliffhanger and was good. This anime was by far one of the straightforward I have seen.I can safely say that I enjoyed watching Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun.It has a great love story, cute and funny. The characters are great as they carry the show and make sit memorable. The series is an excellent show that is easy to watch whilst enjoying. It has great moments of comedy and emotion. Highly recommended for people who are searching for a slice-of-life or romantic-comedy series. Or for people who love a romantic comedy about two opposites that greatly attract, you'll love this series.The series balances drama and comedy in a really good way, skillfully, very fun, quirky, with good characters and decent romantic-comedy. was simply pitch perfect for me.

One of the strengths of this show - and this is already strikingly clear from its first episode which was a very strong start - is the amount of content and fun it can cram into 20 minutes. However, I was a little bemused at the first-glance appearance of the relationship.Haru\'s casual rape threat in the first episode, and repeated use of his physical strength to have his way made me...wary, given Shizuku\'s remaining at his side without much objection. The relationship definitely has some interesting moments and eventually becomes much more appealing and less tasteless than it seemed at first - both are very interesting, flawed characters (especially Haru, whom you might not even end up liking much) and their differences certainly enrich the experience. Shizuku is by no means a weak lead character.However the underlying truth is that, despite all of the teenage turbulence, ups and downs etc. their relationship hasn\'t really gone anywhere throughout the one cour of MLM that we\'ll (probably) ever get. Shizuku can\'t be straightforward and sees the distribution of her energy between Haru and studying as a zero-sum game in which the latter is more important. Haru is alarmingly frank about his feelings but is repeatedly self-sabotaging in his attempts to unravel her defences and by the end, since the first episode, we feel that he has in a way made as many steps backwards as he has forwards in pursuing her. At this point, much of our attention is captivated by the other characters.Normally, a romantic primary plot that doesn\'t really get anywhere wouldn\'t be too much of a problem, but it actually becomes fairly noticeable in this show simply because of how pumped full of content and activity each episode is - a fact that the very exciting first episode only exacerbates. Sure, quite a lot can go on in a single episode and this is definitely, overall, a forte in terms of fun, laughs and subtle developments. However, the big problem is that the fact that there is such a limited sprinkling of the dramatic over this whirlpool, and the fact that our character\'s stories only change very gradually somewhat trivializes most of the content and makes it less deliberate or meaningful, as you would get from some of the other great rom-coms. I consider myself a fairly patient viewer, but by the end I was really hoping for some zest, some drama, some passion, which I think would really add completion to MLM and bump it up to a 5-star rating, but which never really surfaced in these 13 episodes. This isn\'t really a big deal though, the high-school setting managing to overcome the absence of feels quite passably and charmingly. Besides, MLM is quite full of laughs and it isn\'t a dull show. You will be enjoying yourself.As for the secondary characters and their relationships: Surprisingly, these are the hidden strength of the series. You can relate to MLM\'s secondaries quite strongly. They emerge gradually in line with the show\'s ""fast but actually slow"" pacing and as I said before, at the end they have somewhat forced their way onto the centre stage alongside the primary relationship. Jaded romance-viewers might find the character line-up a little standard, but I think they were overall well-handled and endearing. Things weren\'t particularly predictable to me. Despite this, the sluggish progression of significant events means that we haven\'t really seen much more movement with the secondaries than we have with the primaries, even though they are all well fleshed-out. It seems that this season has been a big preparation - ie. gradual introduction of characters etc. which will precede the crescendo. But then as I said, that crescendo will probably never come as this may have just been a big advert for the manga.Last but not least, on the technical side it\'s very solid. The art is superb and sometimes the movements are quite impressive. Character designs are good and quite unconventional in this day and age, supported by plenty of fun expressions. No complaints here. The music is also great, with a fantastic OP and ED to wrap each episode in.Overall, MLM has some great moments hidden within. It\'s highly entertaining, and seems destined to become even better if it\'s ever given a second cour. The lack of both potent drama and a more determined linear progression in the relationship dynamics have been the main weaknesses of this season, but they are not significant. It\'s a solid and fun watch and deserves its recognition.7.5/10 wary, given Shizuku\'s remaining at his side without much objection.

Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun does exactly that and for those of you who have already seen Lovely Complex and/or Honey and Clover it gives you some traits from each of those shows and adds it\'s own flavor into the mix as well.Story- This is the weakest point of the series, however it\'s not so weak that it provides no interest or doesn\'t evoke any emotion from you.  It\'s simple and laid out right in front of your eyes within the first two episodes essentially.  That being said though, there...are a few kinks in the story along the way that give you something to think about.  So while it is the weakest point of the series, it also has it\'s strong point, and does enough with the core plot to move things along nicely at a solid pace.Art-  The art was a hair away from a ten, but I just couldn\'t do it so it wasn\'t meant to be i guess.  Anyway, it really was my favorite part of the show and I\'ve only thought this about maybe three anime I\'ve ever watched.  For the art to really have such an impact on the characters and story is really special I think.  The pleasant background ambiance and bright, sometimes exotic colors give the scenery personality and a location as simple as their popular spot ""the batting cages"" suddenly becomes unique and colorful because of it.Sounds-  The OP is one of my favorites and the full length version of it is an extremely catchy song, not to mention a solid ED.  There\'s a somewhat surreal feel to the background sounds i only mentioned in the ""art"" section of the review and immediately provide you with an engrossing feel that sucks you into what\'s going on.  Every sounds seems to fit just right and because of this it all flows so naturally.  Finally, the voice actors (or seiyuu) do a fantastic job portraying their character\'s attitude and feeling in various situation be it good or bad ones.Character-  At first they may seem like typical rom/com cookie cutter type characters but you\'ll be quickly proven wrong in that regard.  It\'s not as though we haven\'t ever seen these characters before in this genre, but the way they\'re executed is what makes them so enthralling to watch.  Haru is best compared to a wilder Morita (if that\'s believable for those who\'ve watched Honey and Clover) he\'s more violent and protective you could say.  That said, he\'s extremely passionate in everything he does as well as having nothing but pure intentions.  He\'s very funny and extremely intelligent, and just an overall interesting character that is well designed based on who he is as well.  Shizuku is a character that takes a little bit of developing for her to break out of her shell, and it works for the setting and story.  You really get to see her grow with Haru and the other supporting characters slowly but it never truly gets tiresome as it\'s not your typical whiny self-conscious high school girl questioning her life/love every few minutes.Enjoyment-  Needless to say I rather enjoyed this, and I\'ll be sure to re-watch it eventually.  I higly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the anime I mentioned above, as well as anyone interested in a good romance told in a slightly different yet charming way.Overall- It\'s a 9/10 like above the only reason it doesn\'t get 10/10 is because I believe you need to really go far above and beyond your genre and all other genres for that matter.  This is definitely one of the best rom/com/slice of life iIve seen.  This is also a perfect type of anime to get those who are just starting to pique their interest in this genre.  At only 13 episodes it progresses nicely, and it doesn\'t have those cringe-worthy overly dramatic moments some romances have, so it\'s easier for someone new to the genre to dived in without worries. are a few kinks in the story along the way that give you something to think about.

You really can relate to the, I really like how this anime's romance being combine with a little bit of comedy was done. Basically it is a reverse thing where bad boy comes into normal high school girl's life and turns it upside down and along the way bad boy's relationship seem threaten when he sees possible competition trying to win normal high school girl's affection.Art: Poor 3.This probably...the only time, where I's gonna criticized this anime's art.........it's generally terrible. For the female protagonist, I'd probabaly say that she looks better in a school uniform than in plain clothes, which she looks like a grandma. As for the boy's uniform where the main character's were studying I find it soooooo 70's, I will never understand the illustrator's PV as to why the boy's have to wear plaint pants co'z the last time I saw those kinds of pants is when my grandpa was young and part of the hippie movement in 1973.Sound: Mediocre 5.I just have nothing much to say about this category.Character: Good 7.Ok, the character's involved in this anime are somewhat you'll be irritated on one side but will most appreciated in another, ok, so about Haru, he's probably a guy whom you'll wanna do a ground and pound thing on him co'z he's more like this poster boy for a spouse abuser and he's also too reckless, but on the other hand you'll admire him that eventhough he's a delinquent, he's a delinquent who has both brains (in studying), brawn and certain level of dedication to the people close to him. Shizuka, is one ordinary mind my own business type of study bug whom you'll wish that she go for Yamaken instead of going for Haru, but you'll be a bit irritated by her seemly cold attitude towards the people around her.  There is also that part where you wish that a romantic arc develops between Sasayan and Asako, but unfortunately it don't look like that it's gonna happen, however I also see a potential for a Sasayan X Chizuru arc, then again like that's gonna happen.Going back to Haru, so he does provide the comedy aspect of this anime, but for him to be in a relationship with either Shizuka or Chizuru.......I kinda hate seeing it, to me I find him a someone who should be in a correction facility than  having a romantic relationship. I wonder what the hell was that chicken doing in this anime? Cluck! Cluck!Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.the enjoyment part of this anime revolves around as to what will Haru do next or what crazy thing does Haru up to order to satisfy his insecurity with his relationship with Shizuka. Overall, this anime is a combination of one irritation with Haru for being an insecure asshole and the ice cold study bug Shizuka.

The development of their relationship from Friend to an ""Item"" was really good, but after then it somewhat didn\'t progress at all, and even by the end i feel both characters were roughly the same development wise as from early on.Another thing that bugged me was how they would start little ""Side"" stories with the sub characters, but for the most part they didn\'t go no where, and even one of the key ones involving Asako Natsume was just left without anything happening to it.This just feels to me a little rushed, and even the ending, I had to look at this site to know their was 13 Episodes, It left me wanting more, But not in the good way, Felt like we missed out on a lot. Not sure if thats because they might of pushed for a S2? Who knows.Overal, I liked the series and enjoyed it alot, But the reasons i\'ve stated, it just felt a little rushed and story somewhat took a back seat.Would recommend it if you like Toradora, or a series like that, The whole Comedy/Romance in this series is good.

However I think Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is unique in that it doesn\'t try to make it\'s lead male into this delinquent boy who happens to be percieved wrong by all of his classmates, and is actually deep down a sweetheart who is a hero with all of his morals in the right place. In Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun Haru (the male lead) is literally an almost sociopath, minus the fact that he hasn\'t actually killed anyone, yet, and all...of his classmates have had the time to acknowledge this. Although there are plenty of shonen that have made comedic use of following an ""evil"" delinquent boy who has messed up morals like beelzebub and kyou kara ore wa, its quite rare in shoujo and I think the story of Shizuku (the female lead) reaching out to this troubled boy (out of obligation at first) is sweet and also hilarious and worth watching.Often art in shoujo has a particular style that is hard to transfer to anime successfully. However I think its obvious that this anime had the funds to make their art work properly and there weren\'t as many ""chibi"" + flowers scenes which are generally often present in shoujo, so it made this anime more realistic and watchable for me.I gave sound a high score because there are these ""classy"" characters that go to an expensive all boys school, and every time they show up/mess up/ do something silly it plays this public domain classical music and its hilarious. (they make use of the public domain music because of the lack of funding, it was correctly placed and super funny).Character wise Haru and maybe also his brother are the most in depth more 3 dimensional characters, who get tens because its hard to write an manga/anime character that is 3-D. The rest of the characters are more two dimensional, however some of them are 2-D for a reason. Shizuku is a girl that does nothing but study, which is unrealistic, however it probably reminds many girls with maybe good but not perfect grades of themselves in high school, who might regret being too serious. Although if there\'s no crazy delinquent beau around too force you into a less serious strain of activities, there is no crazy delinquent beau around. (There wasn\'t for me, and I happen to be attending a good college, but like most girls I like to watch anime in which characters, who are either very similar too me, or only have one trait because they are 2-D and thus easy to relate to, get to experience something more romantic.)I really like anime and manga that are humorous and I tend to not like a shoujo unless it\'s stupid funny in a good way, I enjoyed this anime a lot and would recommend it to other people. of his classmates have had the time to acknowledge this.

It continues to go in circles while not coming forth and facing its problems. At the same time showing us meaningless love interest with the side characters. Will they? Won\'t they? Why haven\'t they?It\'s a decent at most. I just fail to see, why others give it such high praise. If you enjoy, ‘Rom-Com; than this is for you. Be warned \'Abuse\' and \'Odd\' situations ahead. I’m a bit dumbfounded how I wasn’t able to enjoy. I love Romances but when watching this one, I found myself struggling at times and leaving...briefly hoping I\'d enjoy it later. The first episode was a great step forward towards on establishing a relationship but only took more steps back if anything. Never doing anything.A bit of spoilers a head. Gomensai. Read at your own risk.Story: 6The show is centered on Haru and Shizuku as they form a peculiar friendship of their own. From episode one, we\'re told Haru has a thing for Shizuku. Insisting to her that he ‘Loves’ her. Only to get rejected right there and then. There was no establishment that they were even good friends before hand but it was promising start nonetheless. As we got to see how their bond and relationship beginnings to form and unfold before our eyes. Both of them are stubborn as they try to come out their shells while making friendships with their classmates mainly Masahiro and Sasahara. I\'m left at awe at times how some of the side characters fall in love with others just because of a simple action or meaningless small talk.When others try to give advice to Shizuku and Haru, I fail to see where they’re coming. Feels forced, in hopes of only advancing the main love interest. There were cringe worthy moments, that could be questioned as abusive. Just a heads up.Art & Sound:  7 | 6The animation does have it\'s drop in qualities but it isn\'t too apparent. I like the characters designs for just about everyone, giving them all a distinct look. It\'s music does fit the tone at times during it\'s more dramatic situations which I found to be pleasant. However, the Opening and Ending OST aren’t really all that great in my opinion.Characters: 5Haru is the most intriguing character from the start and the driving force of the show. Lively, hot-headed, with a full head of steam. It\'s surprising how they don\'t address the fact that he enjoys, beating and wealing on others. That should have been more of focus rather than comedic relief. I didn\'t find it that funny, when he wailed on some people, which included his love interest at times.Furthermore, Haru can be so dense and gullible. It blows my mind how a prodigy when it comes to exams can be like that. He’s always seems to make act without giving it much thought on how it might affect others.Shizuku is the studyholic placing it above anything or anyone else. Let it be family or friends, studying comes first. Through the progression of the show, she opens up to others but has great difficulty when it comes to Haru. She can’t seem to figure him like her homework problems; they’re are simple while he’s a complex problem to her.Sadly, I didn\'t find the side characters all that appealing. None then did anything to stick out. All were bland and poorly written. We have Natsume who the ‘Baka’ and the annoyance of the show. Due to her poor choices of posting on internet forums. Sasahara is just their to give advice if anything else while being a comedy relief. The show didn’t let the side characters develop at all that much.Enjoyment: 5I found myself trying to watch this anime but had myself struggling often at times. The most I got out of it were from Haru goofy actions and behavior.Final Thoughts/Overall: 5If you want an unfinished Anime than this is the one for you. It a poor adaption which was made for watchers to read the Manga. It only rose questions like, ""Will those two end up together?"". Nothing was ever adress through the series.

Instead of making friends, this girl would rather study and try to be the smartest girl in class. She would act cold towards people and she doesn’t really care for most things. She is so extreme that people started calling her “Dry Ice”. One day, Shizuku was asked to deliver some homework to a classmate named Haru Yoshida. Haru is a troublemaker and he loves getting into fights. Shizuku was shocked to discover one of the school’s toughest guys to actually be desperate for friends and he has gained...a strange liking towards Shizuku. So now, a girl with very little experience about making friends is suddenly being befriended by a guy who would scare people away just by glaring at them. Shizuku has a tough front but it would seem Haru caught her attention. What’s a girl to do when Haru suddenly started saying declaring his love for you? For Dry Ice, it was a new experience but this love thing isn’t exactly one sided. Or is it?The premise of the anime instantly grabs you. There is a girl who has no care for anything except her studies and a guy who is a brute but a gentle misunderstood soul. Their interaction was pretty fun to watch since the girl is the only person that can get close to the guy and the guy is annoying the hell out of the girl. Little by little though, the relationship of the two gradually grows into something that is really adorable. The anime is pretty straight forward pretty much focusing on this story alone. That’s right. There are no other love stories in the anime. Or rather, the anime was still building up one but it was surely not as important as the main love story. This was great thing because the story of the two characters is really fun to watch and their story might seem straight forward at first, but it eventually reveals some surprises you never expected the show to do.This anime is not perfect and one of the reasons is because the primary focus of the show is the love story yet it was thinly spread out throughout the anime. There is a decent progression but the relationship of the characters are often dreadfully dragged that nothing satisfactory comes out of it. Majority of the episodes have the relationship on stand still going absolutely nowhere and you wait for a decent resolution only to be sorely disappointed. It was cute but thirteen episodes are too long for something cute that doesn’t have much to tell. Towards the second half, the pace died down and the focus was shift towards something else. At first I was glad that there is only one love story in the anime so it can develop the story some more but towards the end, the show fizzled out. The love story that grabbed you halted midway and snail paced its way to the ending. The characters stopped developing to compensate the immediate halt of the story and the focus was shifted to another thing. This is sadly, a typical Shoujo thing. I swear to God the whole anime is a manga lure. These are anime that stops the story so blatantly that it urges you to read the manga. It’s not really bad because anime fans are now familiar with the medium. The problem is that the anime had no decent ending. It basically slammed the door in your face with the sign hanging on it that said: read the manga. a strange liking towards Shizuku.

Skin deep, it\'s a pretty decent series with an interesting cast of characters, a somewhat intriguing plot in regards to Haru\'s back story, and has some rather amusing character interaction. However, I\'d be lying to myself if I didn\'t call Tonari a disappointment. This series reminded me of a teenager going through puberty. It\'s so full of potential but it\'s just so damn awkward in quite a few ways.The story of Tonari revolves around Shizuku, a rather studious girl that does nothing but study so that she gets...the best grades. She has no friends and has no interest in friends until one day, her teacher asks her to drop off some worksheets for Haru, a rebellious boy in her class that is serving a suspension for getting into a fight at school. However, as soon as the two meet, Haru becomes obsessed with Shizuku, essentially falling in love with her almost as soon as they meet. Hijinx ensue as the two of them have ""difficulties"" bonding, although still maintain a friendship/relationship throughout the series as well as make new friends.That leads me to the characters, which were probably the strongest part of this series. Besides the two leads, we\'re introduced to Natsume, a beautiful troubled girl that struggles with interpersonal interaction but loves social networking, Sasayama, an eccentric baseball loving friend of Haru\'s from middle school, Chizuru, a shy girl that develops a crush for Haru after he stands up for her, and Kenji, a rather arrogant boy who associates himself with Haru but has his own clique of friends as well as develops an attraction for Shizuku. For the most part, there are many supporting characters in this series, each with their own groups. There are several other supporting characters such as Mitsuyoshi, Haru\'s uncle and Yuuzan, Haru\'s brother. While I found the characters to be strong in their presentation, I found the development of those characters to be lacking...severely. As this series progressed, I wanted to know more about the troubled relationship between Haru, Yuuzan, and their father. I wanted to know how Mitsuyoshi and Kyouko (not spoiling this) played a role in that. I wanted to know more about Shizuku\'s own rather odd family situation. Hell, I just wanted to know more about the entire supporting cast in general. However, instead of focusing on these things, the writers brush it off for more odd character interactions that mostly lead to nothing.Another issue I had with this series was just how awkward it was with it\'s character interaction. While I know I said it was one of the strengths of the series, it was also one of the weaknesses. The relationship between Haru and Shizuku is just bizarre, mostly because they often change their minds about how they feel about each other. While I\'m aware that considering they are both awkward individuals in the first place, it was rather confusing how both would tell each other how much they love each other during the series, but then nothing would happen and they\'d act like they would break up. Honestly, it was hard to follow where the series was going with it. If nothing else, it made things kind of frustrating.While I have complained about the characters development, I think where the series falls short with it was how it was paced. The pacing was just awful and a lot of the situations the characters would get into were quite forgettable. For example, I barely remember anything actually happening in the final three episodes. There were stretches during this series that were just so bland and so forgettable it makes me wonder why the writers didn\'t even try to delve into the character back stories. That\'s what was weird about this series. You could sort of feel how the characters felt toward each other when they interacted, but what was even happening in the story was forgettable. It seemed like it was essentially leading to nothing.Overall, I can\'t say Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is a bad series. The characters were a lot of fun to watch and some of the interactions were downright hilarious. However, this series fell very short in it\'s story progression and character development...it showed. This series was downright awkward because it wasn\'t very strong for a comedy, it had dramatic elements that it seemed it barely wanted to touch upon, and the romance is very passive. This series essentially had a genre identity crisis, even though it tried to make it obvious that this was a romance series. It has me at a loss for who I\'d recommend it to. If you like a mild romance with a couple that has a unique chemistry about them, I guess I\'d recommend this. Unfortunately, while I want to say this would be an interesting series to watch, I cannot give it the strongest of recommendations. This is a series that is setup for a 2nd season and it badly needs one. I feel that if this series does have a 2nd season that cleans up what the 1st season left behind, it\'s worth a watch. However, until then, I\'d say wait on watching this series until a 2nd season is released if you do plan on eventually watching this. the best grades.

I personally rate shows based on how successful they are for what they are marketed as. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun pretty much masters what it is supposed to be a shoujo rom-com slice of life.The characters act like high schoolers. The love is awkward at times because, that\'s exactly what\'s it\'s supposed to be, awkward love between awkward members of society. The main characters are social misfits with social ineptitude. What ensues make sense. This is where the comedy aspect comes in. The take this awkward approach to love to showcase the hilarity of how out of norm...the characters are and used to poke fun at cliches. It definitely kept me laughing. But the slice of life aspect remains strong; the characters continue living on as normal. Rather than showcasing secret illicit romance rendezvous to hot springs, or other unbelievable likewise situations, like so many other high school romance animes do, they showcase the characters doing things like studying or just hanging out with one another. There are moments that make you laugh, that tug at your heart, that make you say ""aw"", just like real life.For technical aspects the art is very good, and smooth flowing. I personally really favor the soundtrack of this anime. The main song has just a beautiful nostalgic feel to it. the characters are and used to poke fun at cliches. It definitely kept me laughing.

I\'ve never written a review before, and I thought this would be a great place to start! Ikuzo!To be absolutely blunt, what initially drew me in was the OP, in all honesty it\'s one of the best OP\'s for a series, it fits the story perfectly and is cheerful, catchy and upbeat, I\'m listening to it right now actually xD.Aaaanyways, back my opinion, it takes a little bit of a while to pick up speed but around episode 3, the storyline becomes a little more interesting, personally I like really like Mizutani\'s character and feel a great many of us can relate to her...(myself included) given the nature of most students (especially in Japan) which makes it easy to understand what she\'s going through.I give it 8/10 because I don\'t personally like rom-com\'s as much as I do psychological dramas but this particular story stood out from the rest, so I gave it the rating I feel it best deserves.Really have no clue what else to write (yes I\'m a noob) I\'d recommend it to people who like rom-coms or ""studybugs"" kekeke (myself included) given the nature of most students (especially in Japan) which makes it easy to understand what she\'s going through.I give it 8/10 because I don\'t personally like rom-com\'s as much as I do psychological dramas but this particular story stood out from the rest, so I gave it the rating I feel it best deserves.Really have no clue what else to write (yes I\'m a noob) I\'d recommend it to people who like rom-coms or ""studybugs"" kekeke', 'So, I have somewhat weird routines in the morning. I need to yotube-surfs for at least one hour before start my day. It is when I found an interesting anime scene in someone amv. It\'s when a black-haired guy lick his girl\'s hands in stairs. This scene succesfully make me do some research in Google. And I found it, an awesome romcom anime named Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun.Story - 5/10Sorry... but i can\'t find anything new in this whole series. A violent guy who got tamed by a shy girl. Too focus girl on studying who defeated by a ""never-studying boy"". A girl who didn\'t come...to class in her first week and end up having no friends. There\'s too much cliché in this series. But, I don\'t take it seriously because it\'s romcom anime. It doesn\'t really annoying because what makes romcom anime fun and hilarious is the characters.But again, this series storyflow is too classic for me. Let\'s say Strangers > Be friend > Vague relationship > Rival show up > Jealousy > Clash between them. Ugh, i have watch too much romance story looks like this. And for me, it\'s boring. One aspect which makes me finish this series beside dropping is, i love the characters. Shizuku and Haru saves this show for me.Oh yeah, there are so many scene that makes me giggle and laugh. I just can\'t forget how they meet for the first time. xDCharacters - 9/10Characters is what makes this show entertaining. Our 2 main characters, Haru and Shizuku, have unique personality. And as this show has a strong start, it makes the characters well-developed. How Haru and Shizuku changed from ""socially awkward"" to person who understand others is simply beautiful. I love how they complement each other.One more aspect, the consistency of the characters. Even after all the teenage problems, they still be who they are. Shizuku with her score-on-top-of-everything, and Haru with his violence personality. I found it cool how the author makes his/her characters realistic. After all, natural behaviour isn\'t something easily changed in short span of time.Visual - 7/10For me, there\'s a huge gap between visual for action anime and visual for romcom anime. In romcom, we don\'t need battle scene or fluid movement. As long as it can helps building emotion, it will pass my criteria. That\'s why I have different parameter for this two genres. Okay, just forget my bullshit. I just pretending to be smart. xDVisual is something who support from the background, something who support build up emotion. In this show, it was nicely done. The character designs are great. And the art is impressive. There are so many funny faces in this show which makes me laugh, lol.Music - 7/10I must admit that the opening song are typical shoujo anime (I don\'t watch it that much, though) and it\'s pretty average. And for the ending... ugh, I\'m the type who close-before-ending-song person. But before I make this review, i watch it once and my thoughts are the same. Like the opening, it is an average ending song.Last but not least, I appreciate the soundtrack. I love how it makes funny scene funnier, and romantic scene more romantic. It helps build-up emotion in an elegant way.Okay that\'s it! Thank you for your time and attention. See you in my next review. ;p to class in her first week and end up having no friends. There\'s too much cliché in this series. But, I don\'t take it seriously because it\'s romcom anime. It doesn\'t really annoying because what makes romcom anime fun and hilarious is the characters.But again, this series storyflow is too classic for me. Let\'s say Strangers > Be friend > Vague relationship > Rival show up > Jealousy > Clash between them. Ugh, i have watch too much romance story looks like this. And for me, it\'s boring. One aspect which makes me finish this series beside dropping is, i love the characters. Shizuku and Haru saves this show for me.Oh yeah, there are so many scene that makes me giggle and laugh. I just can\'t forget how they meet for the first time. xDCharacters - 9/10Characters is what makes this show entertaining. Our 2 main characters, Haru and Shizuku, have unique personality. And as this show has a strong start, it makes the characters well-developed. How Haru and Shizuku changed from ""socially awkward"" to person who understand others is simply beautiful. I love how they complement each other.One more aspect, the consistency of the characters. Even after all the teenage problems, they still be who they are. Shizuku with her score-on-top-of-everything, and Haru with his violence personality. I found it cool how the author makes his/her characters realistic. After all, natural behaviour isn\'t something easily changed in short span of time.Visual - 7/10For me, there\'s a huge gap between visual for action anime and visual for romcom anime. In romcom, we don\'t need battle scene or fluid movement. As long as it can helps building emotion, it will pass my criteria. That\'s why I have different parameter for this two genres. Okay, just forget my bullshit. I just pretending to be smart. xDVisual is something who support from the background, something who support build up emotion. In this show, it was nicely done. The character designs are great. And the art is impressive. There are so many funny faces in this show which makes me laugh, lol.Music - 7/10I must admit that the opening song are typical shoujo anime (I don\'t watch it that much, though) and it\'s pretty average. And for the ending... ugh, I\'m the type who close-before-ending-song person. But before I make this review, i watch it once and my thoughts are the same. Like the opening, it is an average ending song.Last but not least, I appreciate the soundtrack. I love how it makes funny scene funnier, and romantic scene more romantic. It helps build-up emotion in an elegant way.Okay that\'s it! Thank you for your time and attention. See you in my next review. ;p', 'Bad boy meets lonely girl rom-coms are nothing new--they occasionally make for good comfort food, but having been done to death the way they have it\'s rare to find a series that\'s willing to look at its characters honestly rather than just putting an attractive loner on display to get the fawning fangirls a-squealin\'. Thankfully, My Little Monster not only averts many of the stale stereotypes associated with its tired premise, it manages to make its leads some of the most believably lonely and isolated characters I\'ve ever seen in a good long time. Love them or hate them, but we\'ve all known kids like...Shizuku and Haru. Some of us probably were those kids. Better still, they complement one another remarkably well, each filling in the other\'s deficiencies in surprisingly clever ways. This little gem of a series really does go to surprising lengths to set itself apart.If there\'s one word to describe the visuals of this series, it\'s colorful. The backgrounds and character designs are bright and lively, and yet they never stray so far from reality that it becomes a barrier against seeing these characters as real people. The animation itself isn\'t particularly high-end, presumably because it\'s adapted from a relatively little-known source manga, but it\'s good enough to get the job done. On a whole the show has a charming, playful aesthetic that\'s still earthy enough that it doesn\'t detract from the show\'s dramatic moments.The music is one of this show\'s high points. It can dive into over-the-top territory with rowdy and energized blaring trumpets, only to turn around and perfectly accent a sentimental, contemplative moment with soft strings, hitting just the right level of sensitivity without ever coming across as corny. It\'s a tough task to pull off, made no less difficult by the dichotomous nature of the content. Suffice it to say that there\'s not a second in this show that doesn\'t deliver musically. On a side note, am I the only one who got a Peanuts vibe from a few of the show\'s quirkier pieces, because I swear the resemblance is uncanny.Bad news for the dub lovers out there, this show is currently unlicensed, but I\'m pleased to say that the Japanese track will fill your needs just fine. I have to give the voice actors credit for managing to bounce between over-the-top silliness and grounded drama without a hitch, often managing to carry their characters with surprising subtlety. I have a hard time critiquing a language I don\'t speak, but I still find Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Haru to be a pretty impressive stand-out performance. From his aggressive side to his silly blunt honesty to his thoughtful, serious side, Suzuki manages to tie them all together into one memorable main character and make it sound like the most natural thing in the world.Speaking of Haru, he\'s definitely not your typical male rom-com lead. Rather than the brooding, stone-faced rocks we\'re used to, he actively fawns over Shizuku to the point of obsession. Naturally, this makes him an enormous pain-in-the-ass to Shizuku, who\'s used to being left alone and doesn\'t know how to cope with the attention. Actually, Shizuku herself is much nearer the stereotypical male lead I just described, but she still carries just a hint of suppressed femininity. She\'s much more grounded in conventional sensibilities than Haru, but just as unsure of how to act in social situations. She keeps her head down and is more interested in grades than guys (or so she tells herself), and it irritates her to no end that Haru, who seems like a complete buffoon, tops her test scores effortlessly. Haru, by contrast, wants to make friends with all his heart, but his brash nature scares people away, and those who do choose to hang around him tend to have ulterior motives, furthering his general mistrust for those around him. He generally gets into fights for the right reasons, but that\'s not how the people around him see it. Both characters are plagued by loneliness, but for completely different reasons.Not that this show is all sentimental and serious all the time. Far from it, most of the show is actually really lighthearted and silly, built around Haru\'s antics getting on Shizuku\'s nerves, their friend Natsume overreacting and panicking when things get out-of-hand, etc. Thanks to the show\'s charming direction it\'s almost never too dark or uncomfortable (notice I said almost, but we\'ll get to that later). The style of humor, like many other things about this show, is refreshingly grounded, like the kind of silliness that happens between real friends bouncing off of each other naturally, while still injecting a little extra silliness as only anime can. Much like Princess Jellyfish, a lot of effort was put into making this show warm and welcoming, and even the secondary characters have some genuine effort put into them, particularly their new friend Natsume and Haru\'s old friend Kenji, both of whom start out as borderline stereotypes but grow into complex, flawed yet strong characters in their own rights over the course of the story.If there\'s one problem with creating truly believably flawed characters, it\'s that it becomes very hard to give such characters proper catharsis and making such an ending feel deserved. Haru in particular is a daunting character to work with, constantly straddling the line between a misguided but good-natured boy... and a borderline psycho-path. In the first episode he actually threatened to rape Shizuku, but it was so thoroughly tongue-in-cheek and he said it with such barefaced innocence that I couldn\'t help but wonder if he even knew how to insert Tab A into Slot B. Later that same episode he accidentally hurt Shizuku in a moment of passion while trying to come to her rescue, but she gave him a firm scolding for it and it seemed like he\'d learned his lesson. And yet as the story progresses and we dig deeper into his pit of problems, he becomes progressively harder to sympathize with because by the end it\'s unclear whether he\'s made any progress from who he was at the start of the series.I have a no-spoilers policy, and I think it\'s worked pretty well for me up to this point, but for this review it\'s hard to explain just how badly the show messes up his character arc without giving away a detail that comes up later in the story. Let\'s just say that there\'s one moment, you\'ll know it when you see it, where Haru comes dangerously close to crossing a moral event horizon. It was creepy and disturbing (heck, I\'d actually related to his character up to that point), and then they never bring it up again. Once again, we\'re plagued with the problem of a series that\'s adapted from ongoing source material. Maybe they address it later on in the manga, maybe they don\'t, but either way it wasn\'t addressed in the show and that\'s what I\'m reviewing. Shizuku\'s character arc is somewhat more refined in execution, but still a little too open-ended for comfort, especially in the context of her relationship with Haru, which constantly waffles about in typical will they or won\'t they fashion. By the end Natsume felt more like the heart of the story than either of them, she had a much stronger grasp on what\'s important in life. The conclusion was inconclusive and open-ended, saved only by the show\'s strong direction, which somehow managed to remain consistently charming from start to finish.One of the most frustrating things a story can do is to reach for greatness and then stop halfway, and that\'s exactly what My Little Monster does. After putting so much effort into building up a realistically screwed up character, the show falls into the ""crap, I\'m an adaptation"" pitfall and stops before it can help him out of the pit he\'s in. Still, its strong characterization cannot be ignored, and coupled with its strong atmosphere I think the show has enough going for it to merit a watch and hope for a second season. Shizuku and Haru.

Tonari no kaibutsu-kun literally means sitting next to a small monster. The title in the English language is \'My Little Monster\'.I like this anime despite the genre of comedy-romance. I also never thought I\'d like this with this anime. The story is so natural about the life of a high school teenager. They all actually have the same problem, which is afraid to be alone and have no friends. Stories about friendship, love, misunderstanding, hurting each other, clearly illustrated in this anime. Comedy inserts that are...just right also don\'t make you laugh often.-Spoiler Alert-Haru who finally has many friends and is liked by the girls at his school, always helps his friends. Although he often behaves strangely and sometimes can not control his emotions to not beat people who make him angry. Shizuku who finally realized that having friends was so fun, because since childhood she was always alone and thinking about her values, she who was never sensitive to people\'s feelings and sadness, began to have those feelings. Natsume who considers Shizuku as her first friend always supports Shizuku even though sometimes Shizuku is cold to her. Sasaya who secretly liked Natsume never dared to express his feelings because he knew Natsume liked Haru\'s cousin. But they are still good friends and always together. Oshima who finally has a friend becomes more confident with himself.There is one sentence from Shizuku that I really like.""If you’ve recognized your mistakes, it’s easy enough to correct them, I think.""This sentence appears when Haru makes Oshima a prisoner so that his brother does not approach him, also Shizuku who makes Natsume cry because Shizuku is cold to him when Natsume tries to give input on the problem and Haru. Both Oshima and Natsume both felt hurt because the people they considered as friends made them sad and even hurt.But, after Haru and Shizuku realized that they had made a mistake on their best friend. They apologized and their friendship grew closer.I was very touched, I thought that a good friend would be able to forgive a friend who made a mistake and apologized sincerely. And as a reward from that is their friendship that is getting closer because they have known each other better. Instead of being an enemy.I think it\'s very hanging from this anime. Ends with the scene of all those looking for Haru, assuming Haru is looking for his chicken - the missing Nagya. They were all worried about Haru until they gathered at Haru\'s house. Shows that they care and have not been able to calm down before Haru was found.However, I still recommend you guys to watch this anime. :)Overall : 8/10 just right also don\'t make you laugh often.-Spoiler Alert-Haru who finally has many friends and is liked by the girls at his school, always helps his friends.

I have actually seen a screenshot posted on a social networking with a boy holding a girl and covering his mouth saying ""One peek and I rape you"".In short I became curious and asked what anime was it taken from. And they answered Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. As I began watching it, the anime is far from what I expected! (I expected it to be somewhat ecchi because of the screenshot.). But no, it was not ecchi and yet I fell in love with it making it the top anime of last...season.The story is about a socially challenged girl who cares nothing about but her grades and she is paired with an innocent troublemaker(ironic indeed). But the pairing worked out. The story may not be unique but the way the author develops the plot is really refreshing and is what you should look out for. The combination of comedy and romance without nudity and harem is exceptional.Character design were also great! The quality may not standout at first but upon continuous watching, you will definitely fall in love with them especially Shizuku and Natsume.The sound, how can I describe it, it is awesome and near perfect. The sound is appropriate for the scenes. And it comes with different versions, at one scene they will play a piano version and on the next episode a guitar version of the same wondeful song plays. The soundtrack in the beginning of episode 3 is my personal favorite.Enjoyment. Do I need to say more? Yes, I super enjoyed watching this anime. This made me a fan of the Rom Com genre. The plot progression is superb and I never failed to watch it upon release.Yes. It is a perfect ten, from the story down to enjoyment. It seems like everything went perfect for this anime.

Truly amazing.', ""As finish watching this 13 episode anime, I really can help but relate such thing that happened to me once.....btw, we are no longer in a relationship after I wooped his ass badly, co'z I'm not the type who would allow a man to tell me what to do, nuf said. I really find the whole anime amusing especially when it involves an opposites attract kind of thing. Though I do admit that I'm probably one of those who share the same dislike for Haru, but then again he kinda carries the overall performance of this anime. However there was still that situation that we...would have wish that the character's would have been paired off with the right combination. Bueno, I think it's time that I present my ratings:GOOD 7:Story- I like the opposite attract thing the evolves tow unlikely character between a bad boy like Haru and a serious study bug like Shizuka. Though most of the scenario always involves Haru's insecurities and Shizuka's cold demeanor it does provide the direction that this anime was going.Enjoyment- what makes it enjoyable is the even-thought the relationship between Haru and Shizuka is somewhat you would love to break it apart, it was still something that one will appreciate that the two seemly do go together as perfect opposites. But there was also the part where I wish that Sasayan would have also had a relationship with Asako.Overall- Studio Brain's Base really did focus on the opposites attract genre, and director Hiro Kaburaki gave it more emphasis that it could have been much better if the supporting character's Sasayan and Asako could have been a good love team, but alas more focus was given on the conflicts that happens between Haru, Shizuka and Yamaken, then again no romance would be complete with out some party interfering which overall this anime deserves a seven.POOR 3:Art- I really hated the illustrator's sense of fashion when it comes to the boy's uniform, though I would have forgiven the upper garment, it was the trousers that I hate, kinda have the retro 60's look. As for Shizuka, I would never understand as to why she was made to look dorky in plain clothes but cool in a school uniform, overall I really don't like how the illustrator's art for this anime.Sound- I be really honest, I like the VA's who did the character's but the songs whether it's the opening or the closing- I just hate it.FAIR 6:Character- at one point one would hate both Haru and Shizuka, Haru strikes me a bad boy who has the potential to be a boyfriend from hell,  which if he'll be in a relationship with me I'll make sure that I give him more than hell so much so that his grandchildren would feel it, beside like I said I'm not the type who allows a man to tell me what to do. Shizuka, is somewhat a kind of character that you'll admire for taking her studies seriously but there is one point that I would have wanted to whack her on the head with a hard paper fan for being too cold and inconsiderate. Asako, if I where her mom I would have confiscated her devices and smashed them in front of her. Now, since there are character's here that I admire like Sasayan, Yamaken, Chizuru and  Mitsuyoshi so even if the previously mentioned characters are somewhat you'll hate at one point but like in another point the , it was the after mentioned characters that made me give this category a rating of six.CARAMBA Y ARIBA!!!!!!!!!! would have wish that the character's would have been paired off with the right combination.

Tonari is a great example of this genre. Filled with enjoyment, hilarious laugh out loud moments and a good story, this anime does not disappoint.Shizuku, a hard working student has her complete focus on her studies. She doesn't care for socializing and is content with getting the highest grades. Haru, on the other hand is a guy most feared in the school. His violent tendencies and domineering expression terrorize people and so he is deemed a loner. When Shizuku's teacher asks her to deliver an assignment to Haru, he thinks he...has made a freind in Shizuku. And then, surprising to all those watching, he confesses his love for her.As their relationship developes, Shizuku's cold and uptight personality begins to change and Haru finds himself among friends who can look past his scary exterior and witness the purity of his heart.Tonari is a very enjoyable anime. This is not a lovestory in which the main protogonists spend hours pining over the other. There aren't 'love me -love me not' insecure moments plundering all common sense in their minds. No, the straight forward nature of the characters is very refreshing. If they have something to share, they are quick to tell the other and so there is no room for frustrating misunderstandings.This anime unlike most romance animes has granted it's characters with proper character development.  They all have a background story and a reason for how they act the way they do. The main hero and heroine are not completely obsessed with each other, instead they have a sound relationship with other people too.Haru is a very lovable character. He is very stubborn and persistent in what he wants and in this case he wants Shizuku. His genuine love for her is so adorable that numerous times I found my self unable to stop the involuntary 'awws' slipping from my mouth.Shizuku, a smart and highly independent girl is also a pleasant change from the shoujo heroines of the norm. Her mind isn't subdued with indecision and she doesn't let petty matters ruffle her, ofcourse the matter of Haru is different. She finds herself wanting to be in his company and caring for him.Even though, the love confessions our sprung quiet early in the anime, the love story is not rushed. Haru and Shizuku clash multiple times and yet they find their way back to each other.The art is good and the characters are easy on the eyes. The opening song is a typical shoujo anime opening song but the main background song is really good. It has a bittersweet feel to it that gives you a sense of nostalgia.Overall, I think it is a fairly enjoyable anime, perfect for fans of romantic-comedy. has made a freind in Shizuku.

If they have something to share, they are quick to tell the other and so there is no room for frustrating misunderstandings.This anime unlike most romance animes has granted it's characters with proper character development.  They all have a background story and a reason for how they act the way they do. The main hero and heroine are not completely obsessed with each other, instead they have a sound relationship with other people too.Haru is a very lovable character. He is very stubborn and persistent in what he wants and in this case he wants Shizuku. His genuine love for her is so adorable that numerous times I found my self unable to stop the involuntary 'awws' slipping from my mouth.Shizuku, a smart and highly independent girl is also a pleasant change from the shoujo heroines of the norm. Her mind isn't subdued with indecision and she doesn't let petty matters ruffle her, ofcourse the matter of Haru is different. She finds herself wanting to be in his company and caring for him.Even though, the love confessions our sprung quiet early in the anime, the love story is not rushed. Haru and Shizuku clash multiple times and yet they find their way back to each other.The art is good and the characters are easy on the eyes. The opening song is a typical shoujo anime opening song but the main background song is really good. It has a bittersweet feel to it that gives you a sense of nostalgia.Overall, I think it is a fairly enjoyable anime, perfect for fans of romantic-comedy."", 'okey, be patient with me. this is my first review so i dont think i will be very good.tonari no kaibutsu its a really really really funny anime. i mean really. not a single anime i had watch had made me laugh out loud  like tonari did. the story isnt  very special, i mean its like the tipical story about the tipical ""responsable"" girl and the ""trouble"" guy.to be honest when i start watching this show i didnt expect very much on it. but, man, i really got surprised.the art is completely beutiful ( i cant stand low quality and old anime drawings)...and the sound is perfect , on the perfect times.but whats really got on Tonari are the characters.Haru is my favorite; he always gets into fights and gets angry all the time but is sweet and heartwarming on his way. he made me laugh all the time and sometimes i get pitty on him. he is completely different from all the characters we had seem but it kind of remainds me like Morita from Honey and Clover.Shizuku; everyone thinks she is cold and smart (slightly autistic) but she´s not. she is sweet and funny in her way, mostly when she is angry or when Haru saids something sweet to her.if you are looking for an anime to keep you happy , heartwarming and entretained.TONARI NO KAIBUTSU IS PERFECT FOR YOU and the sound is perfect , on the perfect times.but whats really got on Tonari are the characters.Haru is my favorite; he always gets into fights and gets angry all the time but is sweet and heartwarming on his way. he made me laugh all the time and sometimes i get pitty on him. he is completely different from all the characters we had seem but it kind of remainds me like Morita from Honey and Clover.Shizuku; everyone thinks she is cold and smart (slightly autistic) but she´s not. she is sweet and funny in her way, mostly when she is angry or when Haru saids something sweet to her.if you are looking for an anime to keep you happy , heartwarming and entretained.TONARI NO KAIBUTSU IS PERFECT FOR YOU', ""Sometimes you watch an anime, and you have to watch the first few episodes to get into it, and then it gets good. This one is different. You watch the first episode, and you're just like--what the freaking crap was that. It almost feels like you're watching the final episode instead of the first one. Granted, it made me want to watch the rest of the anime, but it kind of made the rest of it anti-climatic.Story: 7The story was definitely different from your normal shoujo. The reason I only gave it a seven is because like I said, it felt like the climax was...the beginning.

It definitely isn't your everday run of the mill shoujo anime.Storyline-wise the anime tells us about a study-focused girl meeting with a kind-hearted yet violence prone guy and their everyday encounters with other characters that are also put in the spotlight. The story progression is slow but this is just the right pacing for the story. It sadly ends in a cliffhanger though.Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun has clasiccal stunning shoujo backgrounds and...characters.

Each character has very distinct personalities. Shizuku is strong-willed, independent, and very blunt and cold at times. This clashes with Haru\'s eccentric, open, and clingy personality. The show gets its charm in the beginning, by showing two characters with clashing personalities learning and growing from one another. Shizuku teaches Haru how to control his emotions. She teaches him to smile, to stop picking fights (or at least try), and to restrain his constant need...for her affection. In turn, Shizuku learns that there is enjoyment beyond studying. Haru\'s loyalty, lighthearted nature, and unconditional care for Shizuku opens her to feelings of affection.At the beginning there are some truly wonderful moments: when Haru professes his love for Shizuku, when he kisses her by surprise, when Shizuku awakes on Haruku\'s lap and enjoys the moment instead of going to class, and when Shizuku professes her love for Haru again. These are incredibly moving moments, but the fire dies down as the two become lost in opposing expectations.The later episodes are interesting and fun, but there is no real progression in story. This is an excellent representation of Haru and Shizuku\'s relationship, but can become dull for the viewer. The two are lost, as most young lovers are. Shizuku truly loves Haru, but expects a quiet laid-back relationship, but Haru\'s dependency issues make him clingy and obnoxious. Haru, also lost as to what it means to be in a relationship expects Shizuku to be more attentive and responsive to him, instead feeling ignored by Shizuku\'s studying.The anime has excellent art, music, characters, and story. It is one of my favorite shows because of its realism, comedy, and heart-touching moments. However, by the end the audience feels unfulfilled, much like the characters. Shizuku summarizes their relationship by saying ""Why? Why do we keep clashing? I\'m guessing that we\'re out of sync somehow, but I don\'t know how to fix it. I don\'t know the right answer."" Like her practice problems, she expects a simple answer, but is lost when she can\'t find one.Overall, I would highly recommend this anime, although you may feel unfulfilled toward the end. I doubt there will be a second season because I believe the producers want to leave the future open for viewer interpretation. In the real world, the two would have good moments and bad. they would learn and grow through their relationship, but more than likely their differences will put a strain on their love and they\'ll drift apart. I was honestly hoping to see Haru profess his love for Oshima to make Shizuku upset, or to crush her academically to provoke her. This is how I think the characters would at in real life, especially over time.

Mizutani is an interesting lead due to her apathetic attitude towards most things, including romance (which may come off tsunderish to some, but I'd argue against that). She cares more about her academic life than her almost-boyfriend, but not to an exaggerated degree, making her refreshing in comparison to the typical horny teenager protagonist that only thinks about getting laid. As for the second half of the couple, there...isn't much to say about him in comparison. Haru is a run-of-the-mill anime delinquent (that turns out to be the smartest student in school somehow), but he still remains fun to watch and his interactions with Mizutani are the highlight of the series, as you'd expect. All the side characters are very amusing to watch and provide a lot of the show's comedy which is genuinely funny and made me laugh out loud more times than I had anticipated from a RomCom.A noteworthy aspect of the series that absolutely amazed me was the fact that I found myself rooting for the side characters in the multiple love triangles that appear throughout the series even though they directly obstruct the main couple. Take that as a testament to the character's likeability.A point that could be viewed as a downside is the fact that the show stays lighthearted for all of its duration and never gets heavy with the drama like most romances. I personally think that made the anime better, but viewers expecting something more intense might get disappointed.The anime is the standard 12 episode length so there isn't much reason not to watch it, even if the ending is inconclusive and begs for a second season that I would most certainly love to see.

(You’ll get what I mean when you watch the show)(-)Standard rom-com bullshit (Does she like me? Doesn’t he like me?)(-)The soundtrack is very forgettable.The Story (6/10): The story behind this show is an age-old classic.

Not this show however they get that kiss out-of-the-way in the first episode, but you still have to deal with the endless running around in circles. As annoying as that is this show somehow manages it, and the relentless back and forth isn’t as exhausting as something like Kimi no Todoke (BOOM!) and this is due to the story actually acting like it’s placed in a high school setting, example; A girl says, “I want to touch you.” What the first thing that runs through your brain, it’s that exactly thought that the protagonist thinks in the show and he shows it, so when the girl just puts her hand on his cheek he thinks, “Oh that’s what she meant.” See what I mean, the show acts like it’s actually real. Making the back and forth, as I’ve said a couple of times already, a lot more tolerable. In the latter half of the show however there’s an entire sequence of events involving the relationships of a few side character and I can’t help but feel like that’s only there to fill time.

There’s no sort of romance conclusion with the two leads apart from, “Yeah we believe we love each other.” Yeah didn’t figure that out back at episode 7.The Characters (7/10): The characters are pretty important considering the genre of the show and I can say that for all intents and purposes the characters fit their roles remarkably well, if differing only a bit from the standard clichés.Haru Yoshida: Intimidating bastard when you look at him wrong and a bit of a bro-con (hehe).Shizuku Mizutani: Egghead and bleeder of the nose.There are about three or four other characters that are important to the show (But because MAL doesn’t list them as Main, I’m not going to talk about them individually) and they also serve their purpose well within the show. One thing I did like about Haru is that, while not immediately clear, is that the dude isn’t at all adjusted to school, and because of that you get some pretty good comedy moments, like when he brings a chicken to school by hiding it in his shirt. That’s about the level of the comedy, especially when Haru is invovled.The Art & Sound (6/10) & (5/10): The art of the show is solid, exceptionally solid, for a three-year old show it could’ve been a lot worse. Apart from that there’s not a lot at all about the art to say, is good, that’s all I can really tell you.The sound on the other hand is entirely forgettable I just finished the show not even an hour ago and I can’t remember shit is terms of sound, the characters VA are good I was convinced that these were in fact the character’s voices.

Their best works to date are Baccano and Penguindrum and even them were just lively and colorful but not exactly masterpieces.- Directed by Kaburaki Hiro, who has experience with the romance genre but didn’t produce anything amazing.- Based on a manga by someone whose this is the only work adapted.PROPER MINDSETMy Little Monster is in a way like Kare Kano, one of the most memorable school life anime of the 90’s. It has characters that are pretending to be someone else, or even to actively not enjoining...their teen lives. All that for the sake of being likable to others and to increase their chances of success in their goals. It is a very commonplace and reasonable thing most teenagers do and it’s nice to see how they would deal with the psychological pressure such issues create.CASTThe comedy factor of the show is very high though, so most of the conflict is presented in a comical and light way. They address them but don’t expect a realistic handling of them. Take the main two characters for example.- Shizuku, the heroine, cares only for her studies, until she meets Haru who completely messes her organized life.- Haru, the co-protagonist, is a crazy teenager with extremely anti-social behavior, violent, vulgar, never takes something seriously, and acts as he likes without thinking much. He comes to the conclusion Shizuku is in love with him, just because she cared a bit about him and never leaves her side thereafter.A thing you must accept right away is Haru’s behavior. He does some really horrible things from time to time, such as threatening to rape Shizuku, punches her hard to the point of bleeding, undresses in public, and constantly gets into fights for close to no reason. Normally such problematic people would not be allowed in typical schools, but since the show is mostly comedy whatever he does never has negative consequences. You must also accept Shizuku’s passive acceptance to all that. You would expect she would be devastated and would hate Haru for all the terrible things he constantly does to her. But instead she just becomes his best friend (and possible sweetheart) without much of consideration.SCRIPTThere isn’t much of a plot; it’s basically the small daily problems teenagers face while trying to socialize or get good grades. There is close to no continuity and character development is close to zero. So in case you are watching this just to see the two main characters getting all serious in their relationship, don’t expect anything to happen. The characters are eccentric and full of emotional angst for you to like them right away but they are otherwise bricks when it comes to simply saying “I love you” or the more expected “let’s mate like rabbits, since we are crazy”. It is questionable how far they can remain interesting without developing their relationship or something actually important happening in their lives. I for example lost interest in 4 episodes before the lack of serious handling of its themes and the commonplace setting made me lose interest. This didn’t happen with Kare Kano, thanks to its weird animation (or lack of it).PRODUCTION VALUESOk in terms of colors and character figures, but don’t go looking for anything special in them. They still have lots of choppy animation and the setting is just another typical high school with typical teenagers. Voice acting is very good for the roles each one of them has and the songs are ok for this sort of show, but still overall nothing memorable.LEGACYJust like all romances, it’s a good time waster for the slice of life or comedy fans but nothing that will be remembered in a few years from now.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 1/2 (generic)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (basic but fitting with the feeling of the series)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 1/2 (basic)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (average)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 2/10Premise 1/2 (simple)Pacing 0/2 (loose)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 0/2 (doesn’t exist)CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (eccentric)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (none)Catharsis 0/2 (none)VALUE SECTION: 2/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (no reason to rewatch)Memorability 2/4 (the main duo make it slightly memorable)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 2/10Art 0/1 (looks typical)Sound 0/2 (sounds meh)Story 0/3 (what story?)Characters 2/4 (eccentric but don’t develop)VERDICT: 3.5/10 their teen lives. All that for the sake of being likable to others and to increase their chances of success in their goals. It is a very commonplace and reasonable thing most teenagers do and it’s nice to see how they would deal with the psychological pressure such issues create.CASTThe comedy factor of the show is very high though, so most of the conflict is presented in a comical and light way. They address them but don’t expect a realistic handling of them. Take the main two characters for example.- Shizuku, the heroine, cares only for her studies, until she meets Haru who completely messes her organized life.- Haru, the co-protagonist, is a crazy teenager with extremely anti-social behavior, violent, vulgar, never takes something seriously, and acts as he likes without thinking much. He comes to the conclusion Shizuku is in love with him, just because she cared a bit about him and never leaves her side thereafter.A thing you must accept right away is Haru’s behavior. He does some really horrible things from time to time, such as threatening to rape Shizuku, punches her hard to the point of bleeding, undresses in public, and constantly gets into fights for close to no reason. Normally such problematic people would not be allowed in typical schools, but since the show is mostly comedy whatever he does never has negative consequences. You must also accept Shizuku’s passive acceptance to all that. You would expect she would be devastated and would hate Haru for all the terrible things he constantly does to her. But instead she just becomes his best friend (and possible sweetheart) without much of consideration.SCRIPTThere isn’t much of a plot; it’s basically the small daily problems teenagers face while trying to socialize or get good grades. There is close to no continuity and character development is close to zero.

This is the first romance anime I've watched, I've re-watched it many times, the art style is good. I really like the opening! I like the art style. I even memorized the opening of this anime but unfortunately now I've forgotten a bit T-T I like Shizuku who tries hard, even though she acts indifferent to those around her, but actually she also cares about those around her, especially the people close to her. because in the anime the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, I've read the manga until the end, I really like this!! "", ""I wasn't gonna write a review on this anime but all the hype that people have over this anime I just don't see it???Haru's and Shizuku's relationship just annoyed me, their unsure feelings towards each other is just making so many unnecessary dramas for the plot.It would've been amazing to see more character development for the main characters....everything just became so plain and I just wasn't satisfied.Haru was so sweet towards Shizuku since the first episode but all she cared for was her studies. Yes, school is important but it just hurts me to see Shizuku shut herself in with her books and...ignore everyone and especially Haru.I was happy when Haru confesses his love to her but it took her so damn long to say it back that when she actually confesses it was so anti-climatic and disappointing.I DO NOT recommend. I have to admit this is the worst romance anime I have ever watched. ignore everyone and especially Haru.I was happy when Haru confesses his love to her but it took her so damn long to say it back that when she actually confesses it was so anti-climatic and disappointing.I DO NOT recommend. I have to admit this is the worst romance anime I have ever watched."", 'Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun was unexpectedly good. I mean, I read the synopsis and thought it might be ""OK"" but it was actually very fun to watch. With only 13 episodes it\'s an easy watch, and it\'s filled with a lot of great little moments.I\'ll start with the basic stuff. It had good artwork and animation. It had good music and sound. It had great characters, and an ok story... blah blah blah. It\'s not perfect, it\'s not horrible, it\'s average to great in most categories so it comes down to taste and preference. It\'s definitely not bad at all, and it has some intangible elements...that make it very ""likeable.""This is really a great character love story. Each of the cast has a slightly over exaggerated but common social disorder, and it\'s their grouping together that creates a really interesting and entertaining dynamic to watch. The focus isn\'t just the two main characters, they have a pretty interesting entourage as well. The general anime stereotypes are included, but they are not dominant factors in the delivery. There are plenty of refreshing moments and a few little surprises that make this anime series shine.The thing I loved most about this series is that it was very relatable to my teen years. I connected with a couple of the characters, and there were others that reminded me of people I have known or at least had observed. They each were unique and they never really acted out of character. The level of irrational teen behavior was never over exaggerated. In fact, it was pretty accurately done. Teens struggling with how they feel and how they think they should feel is a major theme of this story. I have to say that element was really well done, and they definitely get kudos on that point.The highlight of this series really is the main story (the only real story for that matter). The love story/relationship between Shizuku and Haru is comedic without being too slapstick, and it\'s so wonderfully dysfunctional that I couldn\'t help but enjoy every moment of it. They complimented each other in such an interesting way that I couldn\'t get enough. It\'s definitely one of my favorite love stories now that I\'ve seen it. I am not normally big on romantic comedies, but this was a good one.My only real complaint is the open ending. I normally don\'t mind open endings, but it felt like there was going to be more. I don\'t want to spoil anything, but the only indication it was the end was Shizuku\'s inner monologue during the final scene (oh and do watch the short clip after the credits of the last episode, it\'s not an ending either but it\'s a little funny). I guess this is yet another teaser anime series that introduces you to a manga series, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing.This is a great series, and if you\'re not sure about it because it\'s a romantic comedy then you should still give it a shot. It\'s a good ""comedy"" and the romance is very light. In fact, it\'s more of a weird relationship story than a romantic comedy.

And somehow they all happen to be good looking. Makes one wonder how are they not popular.Anyway, as I said, the story with its light romance is so beautiful. Good comedy, great character stories, but pretty typical characters. Normal music and average animation.Okay so these are not spoilers, remember.

It seems that they\'re being unrealistically honest but the turns their relationship takes is very realistic. It\'s not based around a fairy tale setting or a romantic dream. It\'s much closer to real life where you\'re sure and unsure of things at the same time. Where you\'re in love but you\'re not displaying that. And everything isn\'t so smooth with all the fights and difference of opinions. It\'s a real and fun love story.But after half a dozen episodes pass, you would sense they\'re overdoing things. Dude, that\'s enough time to reach a conclusion about whether it\'s a deal or not, especially when you got no other stuff or problem in the whole story. But it\'s overly stretched.

And I could not believe how much I enjoyed it without any particular reason. The leading characters are extremely annoying, yet for some reason you still root for them. Side characters were actually nice, even in the shade of the main ones. I was grinning like an idiot the whole time watching it. In general, it is a really cheerful no-brainer for a rainy afternoonI really hope there is second season, since now the show ended without any comprehensive conclusion. ', 'I like this anime. I do. It has a lot of elements that really work... and some that really don\'t. The main thing I love about this anime is the main character and his whole attitude. He is like a dog, lovable and loyal... until you piss him off, then it is all fangs. One of my favorite scenes is when a group of upperclassman kidnap the girl they see him hanging around with and take her to their classroom to ""get back at him."" They are nice enough to her and really don\'t want to cause her trouble. She asks if she can study...and they say ""sure."" When the MC gets there and bursts in... all hell breaks lose. He goes crazy. The main girl tells tries to pull him away before the fighting and tells him its alright... but in a rage he actually hits her in the face by accident. Hard. It was both funny and gave great insight into the character and that his protectiveness was a double edged sword.One of the main problems with this anime is the amount of wasted potential and the lack of depth. For example... the way the older brother acts is one built up and portrayed as a villain. It could EASILY have been a very interesting relationship and dynamic. Say... if his brother were the head of a gang and he made his little brother fight and do all kinds of terrible things to hurt people. It would add some context to why he is so adept at fighting and explain his bursts of unbridled rage. Then this girl comes along and changes him and the older brother doesn\'t like it so he has some of his goons kidnap her and the little brother has to save her while dealing with his past demons... instead what we get is a wishy washy love story with some really ridiculous turns. The amount of times they go back and forth with ""loving each other"" is dizzying. Just stick with it already!Overall, great anime. Worth a watch!

Even though i enjoyed the series and it was very different from the normal Rom Com the ending was just so bad it practically ruined the whole show for me . with all of Shizuku\'s studying it left for no romance or the promised picnic at the end and any other relationships the other main characters were trying to have never happened either . they led...it up like every couple at the end would be together and it would be very romantic but nothing happened between anyone and they left multiple cliff hangers and there will be no second season . and even if they did Shizuku wouldn\'t even put down her text book to develop any romance with haru anyways .They should have atleast given us an ova of the promised group picnic they were supposed to have . i had alot of hope for the ending due to all the signals and the put offs she gave haru but i was so let down ... it up like every couple at the end would be together and it would be very romantic but nothing happened between anyone and they left multiple cliff hangers and there will be no second season . and even if they did Shizuku wouldn\'t even put down her text book to develop any romance with haru anyways .They should have atleast given us an ova of the promised group picnic they were supposed to have . i had alot of hope for the ending due to all the signals and the put offs she gave haru but i was so let down ...', ""A very charming anime.After watching the first episode I could have sworn it was only ten minutes long.  I was worried they had cut out parts of the episode in order to place it on the internet.  But, no.  They hadn't cut anything out.  I felt like I was time traveling while watching these episode.  It was so captivating and fast paced.I loved the characters, and enjoyed every episode, although I thought the ending lacked a little.  I hope they continue it with another season.The story was entertaining and made me laugh out loud at parts.  It's your...typical romantic comedy. typical romantic comedy."", 'Please note that this is my first time writing a review so there might be flaws in this report. Also, there might be some mild spoilers ahead.An amazing buddy-themed anime which turns out to be a romantic relationship or should I say, a romantic comedy.Welcome to this one-of-a-kind romantic comedy show called, ""My Little Monster"" or should you say ""Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun"" (となりの怪物くん).This anime follows a highschool girl named Shizuku Mizutani (I\'m using the Western style of mentioning names though) who turns out to be quite geeky and emotionless. She has been interested in studying when she was still a kid. The story...goes when her adviser asks Shizuku to give some class printouts to Haru Yoshida, an eccentric young man who turns out to be some monster. While both of them have encountered, Haru declares that Shizuku and he are friends. This freaked Shizuku bit, so she carried on with her normal and peaceful school life. After she delivered her task, her adviser, once again, asks Shizuku to convince Haru to come to school as he will be expelled from the school premises. This causes Shizuku to have another encounter with Haru. Since they are ""friends"" after all, Haru agreed with Shizuku and this is where everything changes especially in Shizuku\'\'s life. This is where their crazy, yet touching relationship happens. Tons of events happen in their relationship. New friends, new rivals, new circumstances and new cunnings start to clash. Now I\'ll start my review from here.Story: 8I liked how thrilling Shizuku and Haru\'s relationship is with all of the bumps in their way. The plot may be tiresome, but with all of these circumstances happening, you\'re gonna need a deep laugh. Shizuku and Haru have some disagreements, but despite of this, they\'ve changed their hearts severely. Haru has been chasing his own tail, while Shizuku has been changing her tunes. To be honest, their confessions were not that serious as you think and they haven\'t accepted each other yet until now. I\'m guessing that from the ending that I\'ve watched, this anime is a cliffhanger. The ending is quite abstract as you see. It\'s still the same issue between Shizuku and Haru although a few things have changed and they were able to enjoy a wonderful experience with one another though this is short. Not really what I\'ve expected. I just hope a second season would come up to clear all of these misunderstandings, but my report is really late and will there be one with this time gap? Who knows? Maybe there could be one, but in a new generation.Art: 9The art is really great. Considering how they creatively come up with the opening and ending animations, it\'s a cream of the crop. Character designs may look bland, but it\'s still lively for a romantic comedy like this. The CG effects are really simple and unnoticeable. Overall, the art catches someone\'s eyes with all of this peculiarity.Sound: 8The voice acting is great. Haruka Tomatsu really did a great job. She was able to create a perfect geeky and cunning voice for Shizuku. Asuna sounds totally different from Shizuku considering that they have the same voice actress, but I guess this is the secret for the voice actors/actresses.  Tatsuhisa Suzuki did a great job with Haru, voicing him with all of his gentle and touching voice. It\'s not really how a monster sounds like, but I guess this is good enough. The opening theme song is okay. It\'s quite a good start for an intro. The ending song is also okay. I mean, the song is a Christmas-themed song and only a few episodes are set during Christmas/New Year. It didn\'t really match the whole romantic theme, but the song is still appealing.Character: 7As mentioned earlier, the issue is still there between Shizuku and Haru, but there has been a slight character improvement. Shizuku became more friendly and interactive with others and Haru became more mature though some flaws still remain like his jealous side. Natsume became mature as well, especially with advice, though a kiddie side of her remains. Sometimes, her minds fly. Sasayan-kun remains the same. Yamaken keeps his cool, though he still has feelings for Shizuku. Yamaken\'s friends are still outrageous as usual. Oshima hasn\'t changed though she opens up even more. The rest are a bit bland. No resolution has been made yet to their stories.Enjoyment: 9The story may be tiresome and unmoving for some with all of these goosebumps, but this is what makes the anime more thrilling and exciting to watch. The anime will always make you smile with all of the outgoings of these characters. Still, it\'s a cliffhanging anime, and there is no particular resolution to this.Overall: 8If you like romantic comedies, then step back and enjoy this show! The show will go all forth with all of the absurdity in this show. If you like a really touching and dramatic show, then this show is not your place. This show may be a bit cliché, but it\'ll turn out to be a wonderful experience for you!

The Fl was unique at first but soon enough it was clear that she was selfish or maybe self centred,she doesnt come close to an understanding human being and on the other side the Ml is childish earnest, even clumsy but he still understands stuff and is all over an entertaining character.I really liked this anime in the beginning but by the end of it the things were just the same there was no change all together other than some relationship forming. There was no...character development evryone was the same.Ofc Haru being the main lead would be the root of everything but... Thats it other characters where just there... Its like everything revolves around him even if noones there its still about him. Its not a typical rom com but the other characters should atleast have a role of their own other than just boosting the Male lead.In conclusion it was not an anime i would persinally like if you like frustrating animes like this where there is just no change in anything other than normal relationship then this anime is for you. character development evryone was the same.Ofc Haru being the main lead would be the root of everything but...

For what it's worth, Tonari no Kaibustu-kun is a good shojo romance anime. I just feel they could have done so much more with it. At times it felt like they got stuck on 'unnecessary elements', causing a slow paced progression and ultimately unfulfilled ending. Nothing terrible happens, but rather you don't feel that the characters ever reach their expected destinations or got the promised resolution.

At times Shizuku's incisiveness gets a bit frustrating, but ultimately it serves as contrast between her and Haru's different personalities. Thankfully Shizuku is not a tsundere; I doubt she's any of the familiar 'deres'. Her biggest antagonistic battle is not as much the love interest between her and Haru, but rather the emotional and intellectual battle in her thoughts. Haru's battle is that of patience and undying love for Shizuku's indecisiveness.I would have given the show an 8, but the blunt ending ruined it for me. I should perhaps give it a 6, but I will judge the show on all its merits – both good and bad. Ultimately the last episode was a poor choice of script writing. The ending begs for a second series, yet none in sight. Apparently the mange is much more fulfilling. The anime ended while the manga was still being written, hence the poor ending. Reminds me of Ichigo 100% and Great Teacher Onizuka. In both cases the mange was superior because it ended properly.

It may disappoint you in the end but it will still give you laughs, tears and smiles. The anime really depicts a very original japanese comedy. It is showered with the most craziest conclusions, honest opinions and emotional confessions about love; moreover, It has a cute title that is, My Little Monster.I won\'t tell you guys about the...plot because you guys are probably tired on the repeated explanation on how the story goes. Instead, I will explain the things that you will encounter while watching this series. The story is well, let\'s face it, it\'s cliche, redundant, and a lofty show of legendary heart-warming scenes that will keep your heart racing with marshmallow flowers and butterflies in the stomach, but, it really is fun to watch. The whole series really made me happy and it wasn\'t boring. There are weird things in this anime like for example, green jokes coming out of nowhere, distracting movements of the characters and finally their facial expressions in facing the same nonsense everyday. The plot has some unpredictable stuff on it so I don\'t think people will keep saying,"" Oh, they will get together so easily since this is a fast pace anime"" but, NO. Just NO! There is a huge roller coaster and a wall before the two main characters get together. You will keep guessing and thinking on how things will go smoothly or how things will be a disaster in every episode of the show. Sometimes we can appreciate the weird things that are going on in this show and we can just say, ""Oh what the hell! that is too darn funny!"" And one more thing, this show is full of love triangles (take note love TRIANGLES) which means more unexpected characters will fall in love with each other. In short, it is a classic rom-com anime that will never get old.The art of this anime is very modern. It\'s not something so old and cartoon-looking. It\'s more clean, neat and high definition (because obviously it was made last October 2012). Somehow, the drawings were inconsistent. The head sometimes gets deformed, the body is too big, the face sometimes is too small but, I don\'t want to stop watching this anime just because of the tiniest flaws. It\'s the story that really counts in every anime and that\'s what I really look forward to.The opening and the ending was swell. It\'s not distracting or anything. It\'s not that half bad. The tune of the background music during each scene in the anime whether it is a dramatic scene, a happy and romantic scene, or a fight scene, it still sets the mood and it gives life to every scenario.The characters were simply amazing. From the weirdest ones to the coolest ones, they all have an outstanding performance and personality that completes the whole story. Some appears to be just an extra character but the truth is, they have important roles in this anime.I enjoyed the whole series and honestly the ending was a bit of a rip off. Some questions weren\'t answered and some things didn\'t get fixed. It was a great experience but I wished the ending was good and well planned. The sudden ending and the well developed beginning didn\'t really go well together. Everyone wants a good ending in every anime but maybe we can\'t really have it all in life.All in all, it\'s a good anime but not the best one yet. It\'s a shoujo anime so I think only a few people will appreciate its beauty. It has low rating because it didn\'t have a great ending. a lot of animes are like this, it started off smoothly and interesting but in the end you\'re just looking into a very fancy teddy bear but as soon as you get it, it will turn into ashes. So far, I\'ve been thinking too much.. Why does Japan have to do the same thing in every anime. Well, that\'s life. If you\'re asking about my recommendation about this anime, I myself, can\'t answer that question. I don\'t want you guys to experience an empty feeling again but I only watched this because I\'m already okay with those kinds of animes.

However, as time passed and the first season (probably) ended, Tonari has left me feeling warm, but disappointed and unsatisfied.Story: 5/10One of the things that I enjoyed about this show was the pure innocence of it, how two misfits are slowly discovering the world of love. But I believe that it just stops right there. The whole series felt like one big filler, with some...progress for five minutes every three episodes. Yes, you read that right. They definitely got the comedy part right, I laughed my ass off so many times (""Gorillas can communicate with their eyes!""). But the romance between the main two characters was just so confusing, being indecisive and having slow progress. Even during the final episode, which may I say was a total disappointment, the furthest the two progressed was Shizuku saying how she wishes to have full affection for Haru, one day. The anime did have bright points, though. It gave off themes such as the importance of relationships in ones life. Tonari did manage to make me feel warm inside as well, so I\'ll give them points on that.Characters: 7/10Natsume was easily my favorite character in this series. Her story may have been quite too much at times, but many people were able to relate to her story. Shizuku actually did some justice, she went from study bug to a study bug with feelings. Her indecisiveness irritated me a whole lot, though. Haru was absolutely adorable but he was rather confusing. His past with his brother was shoved in in order to explain his rash behavior. Needless to say though, he was an entertaining and unique character that\'s hard not to love. Yamaken brought excitement and a low-key love triangle between Haru and Shizuku, but it was obvious that he wouldn\'t have made too much of a difference. Still, seeing an elitist fall for a blatant study bug was rather adorable. Sasayan was a cutie, but really, what was the point of him? Have a crush on Natsume but then give up once he realizes she likes Mi-chan? I just wish he had more talk time because he did nothing much. These characters did bring liveliness and were relatable, so despite the wasted space some of them created, they were enjoyable.Sound: 9/10The music in Tonari was really pleasant, and did a pretty good job in bringing emotion in some of the more dramatic, emotional, and humorous parts. Nothing too applaud-able  though. It\'s not like I\'d go and illegally download any of their OST\'s. The voice actors did a TREMENDOUS job. I seriously am satisfied with how each character was portrayed by each of them. They brought emotion to the characters and made the show much more interesting that way.Animation: 9/10You definitely can\'t go wrong with the animation in this show. It was one of the reasons that I started watching it in the first place. The character\'s proportions are perfectly in tact, and their expressions were adorable and fun to watch. The scenery also was impressive at times and the whole thing was a treat to my eyes. Nothing too choppy or blurry, the character and setting design settled down the part of me that raged at the draggy plot.Overall: 7/10Tonari no Kaibutsu kun was a treat for the eyes and the ears, but the plot dragged on for the whole series and left many of the viewer\'s questions unanswered, including many of mines. Hopefully a second season will be made, one where Shizuku\'s and Haru\'s relationship will pick up, but hopefully not too quickly.

While it’s not that funny it has a few good jokes here and there. One or two per episode but it keeps a very lighthearted tone that you can’t help but smile.The colorful, vibrant artwork adds to it. The characters are drawn in more realistic proportions giving the show a live action TV kind of feel. None of that bug-eyed, moe bullshit.Now here’s the gimmick. Instead of boy meets girl, they deny each other’s love for 12 episodes and confess at the end, they outright tell each other their...love on the first episode. This was refreshing and kept my interest.B-But if they spill the beans already, what’s there to watch? The conflict comes from the main couple dealing with their new emotions. They’re both antisocial fucks. The main guy is childish, naive, and brutish. The girl is cold, distant, and just wants to study. They have really nice moments that make you root for them. There’s a lot of nostalgia which I really enjoyed.However, it’s a manga adaptation so it ends abruptly so there’s no cohesive plot over the 13 episodes. There are a lot of subplots with minor characters that never get resolved. The show can get too silly sometimes to take seriously, and the main guy can get a little irritating because he’s so childish. love on the first episode.

I know what you're thinking; another Anime where the generic main character gets a magical pet of some description that causes all kinds of mayhem, right? Wrong. Tonari no Kabiutsu throws off the shackles that burden a large portion of the Anime industry these days, and makes a great attempt at originality.The Rom/Com genre has become infested with moe or cookie-cutter character types. Try and find a Rom/Com these days that has no Tsundere, no shy fragile girl, no genius girl etc, or of course the Ryu male lead - or all...of them for some spicy harem-goodness. While you scramble to prove me wrong, I'd like to point your attention back to the Anime in question.My Little Monster is a story about a introverted girl that appears to only care about her studies - quite frankly, she is plain - and a boy that by all accounts is the complete opposite: a quick-tempered, outspoken and violent young man with no regard for his education. The best part about the pair is that, by all accounts, they appear to be... human (revolutionary stuff, right?). I won't be 'that guy' and spoil the plot in a review, but the characters in this Anime truly feel genuine. They have no idea how relationships work, they seem fascinated by each other but appear unable to articulate their fascination. Dare I say... they are average, confused youths, and by golly is it refreshing. It's like taking a shower under a pristine waterfall on a hot day, like taking a random nap in the afternoon, like taking a wizz in the morning... you get the point.What more can I say? Thus far Tonari no Kabiutsu-Kun appears destined to leave a positive mark on Anime culture, here's hoping it helps to shift the industry out of its repetitious rutt it finds itself in. Watch it, follow it, enjoy it.Animation: 9/10 - Highly polished, smooth visuals. Superb character emotion animation.Sound: 7/10 - Sound for me is the complete package. Intro song got on my nerves, and some of the sound effects were unnecessary, so it brought down the score.Story: 8/10 - Too hard to judge after 4 episodes, but refreshing and intriguing so far.

I didn\'t have high expectations of an anime that I knew nothing about going into it, and a cliche that had been used several times over and over. Before I knew it, I had finished this series in less than a day and wanted more!Story 9/10As I said before, this is a cliche used often, and I\'ve seen it all before. But never like this. This anime put a twist on the average ""girl-likes-boy-but-boy-doesn\'t-like-girl"". In fact, this anime took all of that and reversed it completely! The abusive and...emotionless one was the girl, and the semi-annoying, head-over-heels character was the boy. Now, I\'m only pointing these details out because, of all the romance animes I\'ve watched, the timid character who seemed to be in love was in fact, the girl. I love how they took the stereotype of the obsessive girl and abusive boy and totally turned it around.Art 10/10I loved everything about the art in this show. When I wasn\'t wishing I was Mizutani Shizuku because she\'s so darn cute, I was dreaming of the day when I found my Yoshida Haru.Character 8/10All of these characters had so much depth!! Including the chicken! They did such a good job at keeping Shizuku emoitionless, and at some times, really rude. But while keeping her a certain way, the watcher also found out the reasons as to WHY she became this way. I\'m also really impressed at how the main girl character did NOT have huge tits and boys lining up to bang her. It\'s really difficult to find a good romance anime without the female protagonist having huge bazoongas, but this anime did those shows justice!Overall 8/10I really enjoyed this anime and I would probably watch it again. The only reason I would give it an 8/10 is because there were ONLY 13 EPISODES. I neeeed more!! emotionless one was the girl, and the semi-annoying, head-over-heels character was the boy.

This show was NOT one of them. After setting quite generic pretext with rebellious-badboy and goodygoody-nerdgirl these two cats pick the petals off daisys in the most generic will they/ wont they battle. It was probably as frustrating to watch as swimming behind the fat guy in the swimming lane when your you trying to show off to your gurl in the next lane.I really thought they would have a huge climactic ending with emotion...and more confessions, but there wasnt.I really thought Haru's conflicting past with his family and background would be expanded upon, but it wasnt.I really thought the supporting characters struggles and conflicts introduced would be expanded upon and given closure, but it wasnt. Side characters come and go having focal time but dissapearing just as quickly as they arrived.I didnt find the show parrticularly funny. I found the main characters to be quite 1 dimensional and particularly difficult to relate to and to like in general. There simply wasnt much to each character. As a result i found myself quite bored watching through the episodes. It wasnt a relationship i particularly wanted to happen because i simply wasnt interested.I found myself dual screening with the highlights of boku no pico on my second, cum splattered screen whilst trying to concentrate on TnKThis review came out far more negative than i thought it would even though didnt find TnK to be a bad show. it was just rather bland and a bit weird.If i had to describe it, it would be like a hippy eating a slice of pizza without any cheese on top with a knife and fork or a an italian man eating grandma chows special friend rice with a straw. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ and more confessions, but there wasnt.I really thought Haru's conflicting past with his family and background would be expanded upon, but it wasnt.I really thought the supporting characters struggles and conflicts introduced would be expanded upon and given closure, but it wasnt.

In school a boy named Haru Yoshida, sits next to Shizuku but rarely attends class. After Shizuku is tasked with delivering class printouts to Haru's home, she meets Haru, who immediately greets her as a friend, starting their new relationship.Art: I loved the art for this series it was loud, bright, and overall amusing. Most of the characters were visually appealing and were developed nicely.Character: Shizuku is the main female protagonist of the series and I...enjoyed watching her grow throughout in terms of warming up to people. Haru also made a very fitting male protagonist different from your usually cold male lead. There isn't a moment in the series where I have to question Haru's feelings for Shizuku from the beginning he is loyal to Shizuku and it was nice to see considering that most of the shojo's out here like to create a love triangle with two girls and one male. It was interesting to see the other way around. Other characters like Natsume a lonely girl who has problems making friends due to her intimidating beauty, and Sasahara who appears to be frienimies with Natsume will also keep the viewer highly entertained and wishing for a pair off sequel starring them.Overall I enjoyed the series, it is one of my favorites.

This anime was a very good one, so please, make another season. I have fallen in love with Mizutani, Shizuku. I enjoyed the story very sincerely, how a girl, who is very deep in her studies, but then falls in love with a trouble maker. The thing is Haru, said he loved her,but he didn't mean it like that, yet. Therefore later on, Mizutani, Shizuku fell in love with him, but Haru does not love her like that....She say's she'll wait for him to fall in love with her. Then a few months pass by, she realizes her grades have took a toll, do to her feelings, towards another human. So she then has time to talk to him, and tell's him she's not attracted to him anymore, but the time she said that, Haru fell in love with her. Then another boy has came into the picture, which Haru knows of, therefore Haru get's jealous and suspicious. Kenji Yamaguchi, the other boy, has fallen in love with Shizuku, and they have cram school together, but before that Shizuku thinks it out, and tells Haru he has nothing to worry, because she's in love with him. Later on they meet up, the day after new years and she, thinks to herself, she wishes one day where she can look beside her and feel affection for the boy standing beside her. Thank you this was my review, the story was very brilliant, please make a season two. It's also weird how I have fallen in love with Shizuku. That will be all, Thank you, also I dream of an Anime world to exist. Also to have the same Love story, but it's impossible. So I get depressed and sometimes cry. Oh it's weird for a 14 year old boy to cry isn't it. She say's she'll wait for him to fall in love with her.

Then another boy has came into the picture, which Haru knows of, therefore Haru get's jealous and suspicious. Kenji Yamaguchi, the other boy, has fallen in love with Shizuku, and they have cram school together, but before that Shizuku thinks it out, and tells Haru he has nothing to worry, because she's in love with him. Later on they meet up, the day after new years and she, thinks to herself, she wishes one day where she can look beside her and feel affection for the boy standing beside her. Thank you this was my review, the story was very brilliant, please make a season two. It's also weird how I have fallen in love with Shizuku. That will be all, Thank you, also I dream of an Anime world to exist. Also to have the same Love story, but it's impossible. So I get depressed and sometimes cry. Oh it's weird for a 14 year old boy to cry isn't it."", ""I was looking for an action-romance anime but I stumbled upon Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. Was I disappointed that I found this instead of another anime? No, in fact, I'm glad I found this anime.Story: 10/10Why a 10, you ask? I review stories on how well it does on its genres. In this case, the romance and comedy were perfect for this anime. The romance side was very sweet, about Haru and Shizuku and them confessing to each other multiple times, but somehow failing because either Haru's an idiot or Shizuku can't answer. The comedy side is funny too, to the point where I laugh...hysterically at each episode on how stupid some characters are and their responses to a situation.Art: 8/10Like your typical rom-com anime, nothing too special. Colours were nice.Sound: 8/10Whenever I review the sound, I usually listen to it alone because it's easy for me to forget. The OST is very nice, I saw a piano piece OST in the anime on YouTube and that felt very calming. The OP and ED fit the theme of the anime, being happy and lighthearted.Character: 8/10Haru Yoshida, the protagonist who has a dark history of himself, being violent at others and fighting very often. He looks scary on the outside, but inside, he just wants to live like a normal high school student and of course, that wish was granted. A very kind character who would save his friends from the bad people, even to the point where he would kill them. Also, he's an idiot.Mizutani Shizuku, the cold hearted genius who doesn't have any feelings such as happiness or sadness or loneliness until he meets Haru. In her world, studying is the #1 thing for her, anything other than that is unnecessary.Enjoyment: 10/10I enjoyed each episode of this anime, as it would either show the development of relationships between each other in the anime or something serious would happen. I wanted to watch this anime as I came back from school but sadly finished it in an instant.Overall: 9/10If you're looking for an anime that is VERY SIMILAR to Kaichou wa Maid-sama, then this anime is JUST for you. hysterically at each episode on how stupid some characters are and their responses to a situation.Art: 8/10Like your typical rom-com anime, nothing too special.

Unfortunately it doesn\'t fully commit and meanders around for the rest of the season only picking up at the end.The saving grace of the show would have to be its characters. The unpredictable Haru and the deadpan Shizuku make a great foil for each other. Supporting them is a cast of characters...that are at home in any love-comedy.

It\'s a show that seems to promise to break all the conventions of a typical romance anime in its opening episodes, only to end up in the same place.""Tonari no Totoro-kun"" is the story of this furry monster named Totoro who lives next to… oh hang on, wrong anime! *leafs through the notes* Ahh yes, here it is: ""Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun"" is the story of this non-furry monster of a human named Haru who strikes up an unlikely...friendship with his classmate, the cold and studious Shizuku.I took an immediate liking to ""Tonai no Kaibutsu-kun"". Its art style appeals to me, it\'s funny and charming, and the characters are interesting as individuals, but even more interesting when thrown together. The main girl Shizuka is unusually cold and analytical for a female character and struggles to display affection and other kinds of tender emotion. On the other side, we have Haru, who\'s a monster in the sense that he\'s wild, impulsive and often violent … and yet at the same time he\'s remarkably intelligent and open with his feelings. When you have these as the leading pair, then crazy things are bound to happen.What\'s more, ""Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun"" starts out determined to set itself apart from other romance anime. Do you get frustrated that the lead pair in these kind of shows are always dragging things out, never expressing their feelings for one another and keep leaving you wondering ""Will They? Won\'t They?"" until the very last episode or even beyond? Well here\'s a show where you don\'t even need to wait for the second episode to see a first kiss and a confession. By episode 3, this anime has covered enough ground for others shows of the genre to last the whole season. Where can it possibly go from there, I found myself wondering.Turns out the answer it gives is disappointingly similar to what we\'ve all seen so many times before: nowhere.If the typical romantic plot is like shuffling a couple of steps forward followed by a couple of steps back, then ""Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun"" is like running very fast in big circle instead, recycling the plot points of its earlier episodes over and over again until it reached its episode count.The result is, of course, the same. Is ""Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun"" a better anime for taking an unconventional way to get to the same place as most others of its type? Probably not. I think this is partly due to its short length - the frustration of seeing the same thing over and over is, if anything, worse than seeing an anime drag its feet over the course of a 13 episode run. The sheer pace of the story required to sustain the short cycles also means that the anime feels a bit too plot driven - the twists and turns often undercuts the development of the characters and made them feel superficial.If you\'re wondering why I don\'t rate this show lower, it\'s because at the episodic level, I still mostly enjoyed it. Even as the overarching plot became increasingly convoluted, I still found it entertaining to watch. And while the recurring plot points were predictable, I never quite knew what will happen in any given episode. I do think ""Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun"" is a good anime but I\'m really frustrated and disappointed that it\'s not a lot better. For an anime that does fulfill its potential, try ""Tonari no Totoro-kun"".

I was hooked. However it ended horribly. It was a total let down. They ended the series way to soon and never went into depth on the characters or story line. It had so much potential that I am horrified that they allowed this to happen! ', 'Why do I sometimes think of Shakespeare\'s ""Taming of the Shrew"" when I see the chaotic and misunderstood yet super cute relationship between Shizuku and Haru? Maybe because it sometimes feels like the two protagonists are struggling to come to terms with each others feelings in quite ridiculous ways! I grew to really like the characters and themes of this anime, and even though I haven\'t finished watching it yet, I think it deserves a review.Story: 9/10This anime really surprised me with its originality, it\'s not quite the cute lovey dovey story of high school students. Shizuku is a self-focused study freak who, at first,...is forced to deliver school handouts and messages to Haru, who is known to be a serious troublemaker. He mistakes her actions as acts of friendship and starts following her around everywhere. Little does Shizuku realise that she slowly starts falling for Haru, and the rest of the story is about how these characters come to terms with their feelings. Thrown into this romance are some hilarious and silly moments, especially because Haru and Shizuku are almost polar opposites, so they end up confusing themselves over whether they like each other. The mix of comedy and romance makes this anime very easy to watch, particularly because the story itself is driven from the eccentricity of the characters and their nature, so you really get comfortable with the characters themselves.Character: 10/10The characters are what really make this anime special: you\'ve got your opposite two protagonists (a girl who loves studying and has only ever cared about grades, and a misunderstood delinquent of a boy who is actually craving for friendship on the inside). On top of that you have a bunch of interesting friends: a shy school-rep who doesn\'t fit in with her peers, a cute classmate who cherishes her online communities and a baseball player who just goes with the flow. What is unique here is that although everyone in this anime is different in their own right, they all have the desire to make and maintain friends (except Shizuku, who then slowly realises the value of friendship). Even beyond romance, one of the key themes of this anime explores what it means to be a friend; and I think on that level, although the characters are ostensibly hilarious together as a group of friends, you really get to learn how they feel as they develop these bonds with each other. I really loved the character development in all the characters in this anime, particularly in Haru and Shizuku! And don\'t forget our beloved rooster that Haru just decides to bring in to school... he also has some exciting moments lol!Art: 9/10I thought the characters were nicely drawn, their expressions and looks definitely suited their inner character whilst maintaining the elegance of an anime.Sound: 10/10I actually noticed that the background music in this anime is extremely adorable and comical. It feels like if I played that music and went for a walk down the park that a random Haru look-alike holding a rooster will pop out of nowhere! And the opening theme song is super cute, gets me hyped for each episode haha!Overall Enjoyment: 9/10Gotta love this complicated but very intriguing romance story that\'s chock-a-block full of awkward and hilarious moments! I just loved the characters and I loved the drama that they created between themselves. I was surprised at how I kept watching episode after episode non-stop, maybe because it is not your ordinary school romance, which I kind of like seeing.So if you\'re looking for something refreshing with a large variety of characters and a whole lot of romance and friendship drama, then this is perfect for you, so do check it out! is forced to deliver school handouts and messages to Haru, who is known to be a serious troublemaker.

Shizuku grows over the episodes, as does Haru and the way they interact is really sweet - it\'s a love story, without being the typical ""boy meets girl and they all live happily ever after"". I really hope there is a special or second season, I\'d love to find out what comes next.Oh, and guys will like this series too, my husband thought it was pretty funny and he\'s really picky.

She was, in essence, who I was through my school years.I loved the fact that she was not just another girl who fell in love at first sight, but rather was genuinely focused on her studies and tried so hard to keep her focus despite her growing crush on Haru.Haru, on the other hand, is wonderfully eccentric, not at all yet another knight in shining armour, or...a perfect prince. He has faults that are utterly cute yet realistic, but his brunt honesty really drew me in as well. It doesn't hurt that something about his look also made me squeeeeeal (those eyes! that floppy hair! that mischievous yet innocent smile!)I highly recommend this anime to be a fun, light watch, a very good rom-com.

In fact, the last episode was pretty pointless... So with so many cliffhangers and unanswered questions, plus an ongoing manga, I really hope that a season 2 pops up sometime soon.I really enjoyed this anime - the male protagonist is hilarious, and the character relationships are really involving.

Shoujo fans should not...miss out on this. miss out on this.', '*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*Okay, this is my first revieww on MAL so forgive any shoddily made points, but you\'ve got to start somewhere.Now, I wouldn\'t call myself an expert on anime or manga by any means. I\'ve been on MAL for a few years, and have been watching anime for a while before that, but there\'s hundreds of anime I\'ve never even heard of, let alone seen yet. However, I\'ve seen enough to know when an anime is bad - and...this is a bad anime.Story: 3Okay, this is by far the weakest point in the show, so I\'ll get this out of the way first. You could save yourself a lot of time with this show, and watch episodes 1-2. After that, turn off your computer, because you\'ve seen the full extent of the main plot.Remember watching Dragon Ball Z as a kid? I do. Imagine burning through the episodes of the Frieza arc, watching Krillin\'s death, and feeling your heart racing as Goku charged up to turn Super Saiyain. Except he didn\'t turn Super Saiyan, he sat down in the grass and said ""Will I ever reach Super Saiyain? I do not know, but this sky is pretty"" and then got blown up. That\'s the plot. The two main characters never advance romantically past this point, they occasionally look at the next step, sometimes they\'ll even talk about it, but never will they set foot on it, because god forbid the plot advances in any damn way.The same can be said for the rest of the, dare I say, sub-plots. Everyone falls in love with each other at some point. Literally. This show redefines the love triangle, actually I\'m pretty sure in the process it created the love octagon. Of course they never tell each other but, y\'know, I think we\'re all used to that by now.The male lead has a troubled past hinted at by his estranged brother, which gets brought up and put to bed in the same episode, never to be mentioned again, and more or less the same thing happens to the female lead.All in all, the plot left me feeling disappointed and dragged this score into the dirt, after more or less everything else impressed meArt: 9Now that\'s out of the way, let\'s move on to the best thing about this show. The first thing you\'ll realise about My Little Monster is that it\'s just enjoyable to look at. The characters could all be dressed as semi-eaten salmon carcasses and you\'d still enjoy just watching it.This is what I believe slice of life art should like; while watching even the most mundane shit, plot-related or not, the blow is softened by active characters, attractive backgrounds, and there\'s something about a set of well-drawn eyes. Or maybe I\'m just a little strange...Either way, the art in this show is, in my opinion, worth the watch alone.Sound: 7There\'s not really much to say here that hasn\'t already been said in the other reviews, the music is above average and matches each scenario quite well, namely the brawling scenes and the emotional scenes.Character: 6Now I don\'t particularly have anything against the characters in this show, in fact I quite like the side characters, they add a nice touch to the overall experience. Everyone feels different in their own way, not like some shows which copy-paste personalities until you feel like you\'re watching the Neo and Smith fight scene from Matrix Reloaded. Except Neo is also Smith, and they all blush at each other and call each other ""Smith-chan"".Despite that, I think my favourite character is Haru Yoshida, the male lead, and that\'s mostly because I like to think he\'s the only sane one in this world. He acts like a normal person for the first half of the show in a school where everyone has chronic social anxiety, and seeing him punch somebody with the force to rupture their spleen for living on the same planet as him is pretty entertaining in a mind-numbing kind of way. But despite his possibly psychotic behaviour, he tells the girl he likes he likes her, and then gets lead on like the pushover he turns into. He\'s dumb as a rock but the smartest person in school because anime, he\'s a god among men and has the strength of fifteen sexually frustrated gorillas because anime, and of course he has a harem as big as his hero-complex, because of course he does.The same can\'t be said for Shizuku, the ""love interest"", if you call a few hugs and a joke kiss love. She spends the entire show putting everything before Yoshida, treating him like someone she barely even knows, and giving him the run-around by not clarifying on her love for him. She also says ""I need to think about our relationship"", and makes him wait a month. A MONTH. People have met and gotten married in less time. They are idiots, but that\'s why I believe it\'s a good comparison. She\'s cold, harsh, boring, selfish, self-centered, neglectful and all round a shitty person. The perfect catch.Overall, maybe I was bit harsh on this show, after all anime is the same as any entertainment, it has to appeal to the biggest possible audience to make money, and unfortunately we live in a world where numbers matter more than creativity. Everybody\'s afraid to step out and try something new, and this is nothing more than another turd in the sewage pipe which that mentality has helped to build.But the wounds are still fresh from the disappointment this brought me. The reason is simple; I can see the potential, you and anybody else can see the potential if you watch it, but it\'s wasted, as it so frequently is lately.Keep the art, keep the sound, double the episodes and flesh out your characters, give us some payoff between the love interests, hell if you\'re feeling generous even give us a one-off OVA a year later showing them post-graduation. I would watch the shit out of that, but unfortunately, I don\'t see that happening. So this remains a disappointment to me. this is a bad anime.Story: 3Okay, this is by far the weakest point in the show, so I\'ll get this out of the way first.

He\'s dumb as a rock but the smartest person in school because anime, he\'s a god among men and has the strength of fifteen sexually frustrated gorillas because anime, and of course he has a harem as big as his hero-complex, because of course he does.The same can\'t be said for Shizuku, the ""love interest"", if you call a few hugs and a joke kiss love. She spends the entire show putting everything before Yoshida, treating him like someone she barely even knows, and giving him the run-around by not clarifying on her love for him. She also says ""I need to think about our relationship"", and makes him wait a month. A MONTH. People have met and gotten married in less time. They are idiots, but that\'s why I believe it\'s a good comparison. She\'s cold, harsh, boring, selfish, self-centered, neglectful and all round a shitty person. The perfect catch.Overall, maybe I was bit harsh on this show, after all anime is the same as any entertainment, it has to appeal to the biggest possible audience to make money, and unfortunately we live in a world where numbers matter more than creativity. Everybody\'s afraid to step out and try something new, and this is nothing more than another turd in the sewage pipe which that mentality has helped to build.But the wounds are still fresh from the disappointment this brought me. The reason is simple; I can see the potential, you and anybody else can see the potential if you watch it, but it\'s wasted, as it so frequently is lately.Keep the art, keep the sound, double the episodes and flesh out your characters, give us some payoff between the love interests, hell if you\'re feeling generous even give us a one-off OVA a year later showing them post-graduation. I would watch the shit out of that, but unfortunately, I don\'t see that happening. So this remains a disappointment to me.', ""What should I say? I love everything about it! The first episode already made me laugh, and happy to say throughout the rest of the episodes. I just like how Shizuku and Haru found friends and learned to understand each other even though things got complicated between them. Also, I really love that this two are very open about their feelings. And as for the rest of the characters, I love all of them. It's just a pity that this has only 13 episodes that's why I'm giving it a score of 9 in overall since i want more. "", ""It was...all right.  The anime overall had very little driving plot, which can work out for an anime.  I'll reference Mushishi as a case-in-point.  This, however, is no Mushishi.  As in, there was no struggle to be had here, beyond the day in and day out life of the main characters (Shizuku, Haru and Asako).  This works early on as it establishes character personalities and traits, as well as their base motivations.  But then that's all there is.  Thirteen episodes of Shizuku and Haru falling, and then falling out, then falling in again, of love.  If you...can really ever call it that.  It's more along the lines of an infatuation, which is cute, but I see no further progress in their relationship past something like episode seven.  There is an introduction of a third interested party, but this love-triangle is only to distract you from the fact that nothing is actually happening.This anime needs a second season.  I think they were perhaps leading up into getting one, but I've heard the sales haven't been good for this show, which is actually somewhat disappointing.  Maybe if they had given the fans some form of fulfillment there would be more people excited for this sort of series.  It's a good, solid and decent series.  Just don't expect anyone to get with anybody, and for characters you think to be relevant to drift away without a mention (like Shizuku's brother - only shown in a single episode being demonic).  There were too many loose strings by the end that the audience is left with absolutely zero fulfillment for their invested hours.So, in the end, this is a fun, quirky, and bright series.  I adored the opening.  The rooster was entertaining.  The characters and amusing mood shifts are worth the twenty minutes per episode.  Shizuku is a blessing and a cool, refreshing breeze to the heroines of other romantic animes; she sticks up for herself, doesn't just roll over when male characters get possessive, and she isn't, well, stupid to put it bluntly.  But failure to deliver on teased back story events, failure to give me a proper resolution, and a failure to uphold the base promise of a romance (characters actually getting somewhere in a relationship and us actually seeing that physically, somehow) makes My Little Monster a seven in my books.I hope the manga has that sense of fulfillment I'm looking for, as that's slated to finish up in August. can really ever call it that.

The ending is OK but I felt that it was truncated abruptly, as if plans for a second season were dropped at the last minute. ', 'Released in 2012. The ideal high school romance anime where the characters do a lot of monologue and their experience of love is highlighted in the show is a genre that was slowly shoved to the sidelines for a long time. The premise of the anime instantly grabs you. There is a girl who has no care for anything except her studies and a guy who is a brute but a gentle misunderstood soul. Their interaction was pretty fun to watch since the girl is the only person that can get close to the guy and the guy is annoying the hell out of the...girl. Little by little though, the relationship of the two gradually grows into something that is really adorable. The anime is pretty straight forward pretty much focusing on this story alone. That’s right. There are no other love stories in the anime. Or rather, the anime was still building up one but it was surely not as important as the main love story. This was great thing because the story of the two characters is really fun to watch and their story might seem straight forward at first, but it eventually reveals some surprises you never expected the show to do. The characters are the ones that really made the show amazing. They’re very interesting and utilized pretty nicely. Every character grows on you from the main to the side characters. Haru and Shizuku are just cute together and their character dynamic is pretty fun to watch. An unpredictable guy and girl who aren’t fazed easily make for an interesting love story anime. This anime is not perfect and one of the reasons is because the primary focus of the show is the love story yet it was thinly spread out throughout the anime. There is a decent progression but the relationship of the characters are often dreadfully dragged that nothing satisfactory comes out of it. Majority of the episodes have the relationship on stand still going absolutely nowhere and you wait for a decent resolution only to be sorely disappointed. It was cute but thirteen episodes are too long for something cute that doesn’t have much to tell. The character design is pretty decent. The characters have unique look to them.The animation is pretty decent as well. I say decent because there is enough to tell a story but you can see the quality differs from most episodes. One thing I noticed is the facial features often not having enough details in some episodes and there are scenes where just the mouth moves. The eyes don’t even blink. The facial expressions are nicely animated though as well as the fight scenes. These are often the best moments. In the end I would say if you like romance go and watch this it’s not perfect but it’s okay. girl.

There was a strong comedy appeal within the story which was good, and it keep you interested.  I believe the story held a very strong meaning, however it seems as if it dragged on to a incomplete end. In my opinion, if this had been a longer series with a better outcome, I would have enjoyed it much more. I gave the story...a 8 because I felt as if the ending was not done well at all. What I am saying is that if you want to watch a happy ending try watching something else, In  Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun you will find little to no resolve.Art: I loved the art style, plain and simple.Sound: Music was catchy, but got slightly annoying over time.Character: I thought the characters in the story where slightly bland. The characters would develop and then in the next episode simply throw away said development. The relationship between characters did not seem to change much after the first few episodes.Enjoyment: Honestly Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun was a decent anime. It had its ups and downs, and its horrible ending.I give this a overall of 7. This is only my opinion, if the series had a better ending, or stronger plot twist it would be much, much better. Although I had to keep in mind that this was simply a romantic comedy series with no major drama.

It proved to have a prefect blend of comedy,wackiness,romance,and a lot of unpredictable reactions and scenes you would not see coming.

If you want your memory of this series to be great and not utterly ruined for you i\'d suggest stopping at about episode 5-6 and simply taking the storyline at that. After...about episode 6 the romance turns to almost complete apathy and spite for the main characters of the series and eventually develops into a weird Love triangle/square that just leads to very unhealthy character relationships border lining on psychological manipulation and sociopath like attributes of the main characters. The main protagonists constantly go back in forth admitting their love for eachother each episode which is cute at the beginning when it\'s genuine however 1/2 way through the series they continue to claim ""love"" but rarely interact with each other (never romantically) and become stand offish almost to the point where it seems like the love aspect becomes unhealthy and one sided becoming an elaborate lie.

I genuinely do not believe Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun deserve a rating lower than 7.8.Seeing as you\'re reading this review, I\'d assume you\'ve seen plenty of other 4-6 reviews. Out of disbelieve, I\'ve read through the majority of them, and I consider the majority extremely biased, or downright false. This also highlights some of the strongest suits that this anime possesses. Please keep this in mind while proceeding to the later section of this review.1. This is a manga adaptation. If someone expects a conclusive ending after 12 episodes, he/she\'d be...complaining about horrible pacing.2. The story was told by the main female lead. Her strong character growth has been displayed many times from the very first episode to the very last. There are even moments where she or her friends verbally reminded us of how different she is, and to bring our attention to it. The other characters have shown significant growth as well. I fail to understand how any counterargument could make logical sense, regarding ""no character growth"" and ""plain and flat development"".3. This is a slice of life show, and people seem to expect a marvelous, unique story which not only teach a huge life lesson, impeccable character development, and also a spectacular romantic relationship. To that I say the following:Please make up your mind. What you\'re actually looking for is called a fairy tale.>> Side note: It is extremely irresponsible to discourage people from watching an anime, without acknowledging the pros along with the cons. You don\'t see 4-6 rated reviews discuss why the show isn\'t any lower than a 4. They simply bash the show to an absurd degree, so I don\'t see why they couldn\'t have rated it a 1 in the first place. Please don\'t speak for others. Let them be the judge.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------With that out of the way, let\'s take a look at what Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun excels at.1. The pacing. Each episode is packed with enjoyable moments and engaging interactions between the well written characters. Anything more or less would have ruined the flow, yet the show kept on giving, pausing to reflect on important moments, and giving details when necessary. The progression is smooth throughout the series.2. The characters. All characters were presented with their own issues, and their way of tackling them. Most importantly, they are down to earth and very relatable. It\'s a story of ones who discover and experience friendship and romance for the first time. This is the show that made me go ""yeah I was pretty silly as a teenager"". I can\'t help but wonder how mature and experienced some people were as a teen, when they criticized the characters for ""falling in love too fast"". Similarly, I wonder how lucky they must have been to not be able to relate to ""relationships going nowhere"". Maybe they simply had no life experience whatsoever.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯3. The cliché. It is true, that this show might not have been the first to ""exploit"" the ""introvert meets extrovert, opposites collide"" stereotype, nor was it the most outstanding and inspiring romance of the decade. However, this is an anime which perfects it. I\'d go as far as to say that it coins the genre. The awkwardness between newly met friends was on-point, the conversations felt natural, while embracing what the stereotypical cast of characters could offer. Cliché =/= bad. Stereotypes usually came to be because they are true / accurate / popular.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion:I highly recommend this series, especially to those who are new to the genre. It showcases what slice-of-life rom-com has in store, which makes for a great starting point. For those who has seen plenty of the genre, please watch it and judge it for yourself.As I have mentioned at the beginning, this is my 3rd time watching the anime over the span of 6 years. Being one of the earliest anime I\'ve seen, I\'ve decided to revisit it every 2 years, to see how my thoughts of it differs as time passes. My impression has gone from sweet to bittersweet, and for that I liked it even more.I wouldn\'t deny that nostalgia may have had an effect on my rating. Realistically I can see the show rated at 8.5, while I have personally rated it a 9. (My 10s are preserved for no more than 7 shows, and they change according to time.)Thanks for reading :) complaining about horrible pacing.2. The story was told by the main female lead. Her strong character growth has been displayed many times from the very first episode to the very last. There are even moments where she or her friends verbally reminded us of how different she is, and to bring our attention to it. The other characters have shown significant growth as well. I fail to understand how any counterargument could make logical sense, regarding ""no character growth"" and ""plain and flat development"".3. This is a slice of life show, and people seem to expect a marvelous, unique story which not only teach a huge life lesson, impeccable character development, and also a spectacular romantic relationship. To that I say the following:Please make up your mind. What you\'re actually looking for is called a fairy tale.>> Side note: It is extremely irresponsible to discourage people from watching an anime, without acknowledging the pros along with the cons. You don\'t see 4-6 rated reviews discuss why the show isn\'t any lower than a 4. They simply bash the show to an absurd degree, so I don\'t see why they couldn\'t have rated it a 1 in the first place. Please don\'t speak for others. Let them be the judge.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------With that out of the way, let\'s take a look at what Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun excels at.1.

ANd I may reviewing Tonari no Kaibutsu as OVERALL (which is mean I include the manga since it is impossible to review the story without finishing it imo)Tonari no Kaibutsu-Kun is totally a masterpiece!The bad thing about the anime series is that it was forcefully cut the story halfway (not even halfway! I am so damn pissed) when the line still far from mature. That last episode (which is not in the manga) was totally something that cut the anime...and leave it hanging like hell.Seriously, just finish the whole story instead of cutting it off and wondering if the second, the third season will come. It really a beautiful and emotional story.What I love the most?The character! I can\'t say enough how each of every character have their own portion in the story and they are linking each other in the most reasonable complicated way. Each character introduced nicely with their own background. Which is then their background make reasoning why their attitude towards other character. I cant believe Robico can think of something as detail as this. Remarkable.The story! Yes it is awkwardly so beautiful. Haru and Shizuku is definitely the best couple in my entire anime universe. I am so damn jealous with them but I feel happy for them at the same time (just like Natsume-chan I would say)Yes! I was so connected with the series that after I finish the series in a day I continue finishing the rest 43 Manga Chapter in two nights)The story and the relationship between Haru and Shizuku made me cry in joy. It is so beautiful *tearsShizuku is truly a solid character. Very mature, independent, dependable, smart, carefree, but at the same time loveable, and unique. Haru is as strong as Shizuku as a character, they fill each other EXTREMELY WELL. What I love the most of them as a couple is that they are very frontal to each other in saying their feeling towards each other.Their relationship develop NOT in a magical way and thats the reason why I am sticking with series the entire way. The romance flow.And honorable mentions to ALL SIDE CHARACTER.  All of them fill what kind of character that missing from Haru and Shizuku and fill all the hole (mention Sasahara, Natsume, Yamaken, Mitsu, Andou)Well...I cant tell you enough how GREAT is Tonari no-Kaibutsu-kun is.PLEASE, TO ALL OF YOU AUDIENCE....CONTINUE THE STORY FROM THE MANGA BECAUSE THE ANIME SERIES ENDED IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. IT IS FAR FROM THE BEAUTY. NO JOKE.Art:Well I am actually a shounen manga but to be honest, Tonari no Kaibutsu is a shouju manga with a shounen influence illustration (what the hell am I talking, whatever)Things are so vivid and so lively and seriously not disappointing at all for regard of the manga works. It doesnt missing all the details the manga had from what I see as well.NBL Shizuku eyes are something that I cant get over with >.< Man she is so adoreable.Sound:I love Shizuku voice. It really ensemble her character in the most realistic way. It is easier for me to follow the manga after watching the anime. For Haru, I just think that his voice (seiyuu) a little bit too lively compared to what I feel from the manga. It should be better if he got toned down a bit but I still like it as well.Q&A Recital, haha damn it bring a live to the series, seriously I really like the opening of the anime.DONT FORGET HOW GOOD IS""TETSUKAZU NO KANJOU"" really connecting the feelings * I feel like crying again.I just finish the manga today and I still really sad that it comes to end like this. I just wish great manga or anime never ends.

It may be somewhat simplistic in it's concept, but the series has a lot going for it once you start watching.The series begins with a very nice set-up, and the cast of characters are diverse and interesting. The protagonist and love interest are both great, each with intriguing personalities and backgrounds. Their relationship progresses at a good pace, allowing them to navigate different issues and grow together.While the ending might not be the perfect conclusion everyone would have hoped for, it feels more realistic for...the characters and their relationship. I'd hope for another season, but that seems incredibly unrealistic at this point. the characters and their relationship. I'd hope for another season, but that seems incredibly unrealistic at this point."", ""Brain's Base anime? I just watched through 12 episodes without a thought. Never knew something would brought me so much feelings, although at first I thought the synopsis of the story make it a normal romance anime, I have never been so happy to be so wrong. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun really talks about a story of Shizuku Mizutani fickle feelings and Haru Yoshida a idiot, genius. It really has a first love kind of plot which makes it reminiscence of one's first love, bittersweet,conflicting, happy and sweet.TL;DR: You will not be disappointed by this love adventure between this two characters. Overall: 9/10 (above average compared...to other anime)~Spoiler Alert~Story: 8/10I can really see the development of the story, from the first episode that first kiss. I could really see where this could go. However, a maiden's heart is confusing and deeply profound. Shizuki Mizutani was conflicting with her own feelings, which eventually lead to the happy ending everyone needed. However, I realize that the first kiss was to grab the audience attention from the start, the creators could have been more prudent and put the kiss in at perhaps episode 5 or 6 to reduce pacing and repetitive problems. The other characters in the story really helped to pace the story a lot better in the later part of the anime, making the anime not a generally failing one.Art: 7/10The art was decent compared to many of the other fall 2012 anime. Although the other more famous anime might have a slight edge over this one. It is really a good effort by the studio to have given this anime a lot of colour variation as compared to a anime that is just full of bright colours making it more obvious to show the difference between the tone and mood for different settings in the anime.Sound: 8/10The opening is a happy and catchy tune. A symphony of drums and trumpet makes it so easy to just listen to the entire opening, a great pleasure. sung by Haruka Tomatsu also known as Asuna from Sword Art Online is definitely a great pleasure. The Ending is very festive theme, feels like a Christmas song, considering Christmas is about 2 weeks away, this is defintely a joyful and joyous song.Character: 9/10They are all generally enjoyable. Mizutani is cute in her ways, Haru is a weirdbut genius character which is also undeniably handsome. (not gay) Natsume is the cute girl that gets all the boys' attention, the gang with Kenji Yamaguchi, a rich asshole that likes Mizutani. (good thing Haru triumphs, would not have written this review if it was that asshole as protagonist)Enjoyment: 9/10Really a good masterful piece that really brings forth the feelings of first love, and the struggle of a smart, tsundere girl with ponytail. I think that it distance itself from the normal rom-com anime which is a plus point.Overall: 9/10I would definitely recommend you to watch this anime, if you don't mind a wee bit of repetitive tsundering and idiot Haru. Would definitely watch again. ~ to other anime)~Spoiler Alert~Story: 8/10I can really see the development of the story, from the first episode that first kiss. I could really see where this could go.

The pacing is a little awkward and the ending leaves much to be desired since there are so many loose ends let unresolved or untouched. At the same time, I guess it kinda suits it. The plot is a bit jumpy and the main love interest goes back and forth, but sometimes real life can be like that too, so out of this anime's many faults, I can't list that as one of them.I just wish there was more done to explore...the characters to give some of them a bit more dimension. There quite a few that felt like they weren't characters, but just distracting background noise that didn't help move the plot except for one moment, and that was only when they were first introduced. Again, this is a pretty average anime that's best to not get your hopes up about when watching since there's some tension that builds up, but never gets resolved and more or less forgotten about a couple episodes later. the characters to give some of them a bit more dimension.

When I went into this anime, I didn’t know what I was watching at first. With the English title, “My Little Monster”, the first thing my mind wandered to is Pokémon because it’s the abbreviated term for “Pocket Monsters”. This isn’t anything like that.Instead, you get a cast of diverse characters. With these characters, they all had unique traits which some dispute saying that they don’t change much, but in my opinion, that’s...a good thing. You don’t drastically change that fast upon meeting a person. It takes a long time, and I think the show did the pacing of development well enough that I felt attached to almost all the characters. Some argue saying these characters are tropes which is sort of true, but I thought there was more substance behind it than that since there was reasoning behind it, and their chemistry overall was a result of that quirky concoction. Besides that, I don’t think I’ll give too much more description into that because I truly believe that the characters’ actions will speak far greater than my words.The story in this anime is quite simple. Just like a lot of romance anime, it is about two people falling in love. More than that though, I think one of the beautiful things about the romance and slice of life genres are the way that you can take it. There is the melancholy tragic backstory or the happy-go-lucky comedic storyline. This one is more of the comedic kind, but there is a bit of backstory given. Although none is anime-level tragic, I think it was nice that they put it in to give a bit of background for each of the characters. I am a person who believes that most disliked characters can be made more tolerable with a good character arc or backstory. Now, with that in mind, some characters don’t receive as much development as others. With thirteen episodes, you can’t ask for that and expect it on a silver platter. Overall, I believe that the story, although simplistic, was a refreshing type of storyline that put a unique twist on its comedic-romance/slice of life genre.In terms of score and animation, I can’t say much about it since I found that it was rather simplistic and normal. I will say that I disliked the score. The score for me just did not fit the show well enough of what it could’ve been, and to me, score is a huge factor of a show as it sets and amplifies the mood, so I was disappointed. Animation and art was about average. There weren’t any scenes that stood out for me, but I will note that as usual, there are a ton of laughable funny faces. I think it adds to the comedic value of the show, and with the characters and general jokes, I think it did its job sufficiently. The seiyuu of the show were also unique in their own rights. I had no problem with any of their performances because I truly found them as a great fit for each of their characters.This anime I feel does not have a high enough score for the amount of enjoyment I had watching it. It was truly a pleasure to watch, and it is one that I would put up with some of my other favourites from the genre like “Toradora” (I can’t name much more than that since I am usually more of an action/shounen type of anime viewer). Sure, it's sometimes childish and stupid, and the anime itself isn't thought-provoking and deep, but it's fun to watch. If you are considering watching this anime, I would say to watch it. It’s only thirteen episodes, and I just found it amusing to watch.Overall Rating: 8.4/10 a good thing. You don’t drastically change that fast upon meeting a person.

It\'s definitely one of the most important points that seems to be left out. Having said that, I\'ll start from the beginning.The character I least liked in this anime was Haru. This anime made me cringe and feel uncomfortable at times because of how many times stuff pointed to an abusive relationship, and it all came from Haru. Haru has the personality of a sociopath/psychopath and that can be seen many times throughout the anime. He is possessive...of Shizuku even though they aren\'t dating, hits her several times without apologizing, follows her everywhere she goes, tries to tell her what she can/can\'t do, and threatens to beat up anyone that comes near her. He also doesn\'t know how to properly behave in public and Shizuku tells him in an episode that if he behaves meanwhile she is at cram lessons, they\'ll go on a picnic. Shizuku also questions her love for Haru because of his weird personality and wonders if she can actually get over that. She even states that they seem to clash a lot and wonders why. In another episode, he licks her hand out of nowhere and Shizuku lectures him on personal boundaries and consent. She tells him the touch of a man that is not warranted by her first is repulsive. He then proceeds to get mad. He also threatens to beat up anyone that comes near her.Quotes by Haru:""One peep out of you and I\'ll rape you.""""Shizuku\'s the one who keeps changing. I can only wonder if she\'s going to leave me behind one of these days. Makes me consider ripping off her arms and legs.""Quotes by Shizuku: ""We won\'t get anywhere if I\'m the only one doing the right thing.""This anime wasn\'t the typical rom-com I was expecting.  I won\'t spoil the ending, but the ending isn\'t actually an ending; it is just another episode that can be continued in a second season or by reading the manga. The only thing I liked about this anime is that Shizuku finally found friends but other than that Haru\'s personality ruined it for me. of Shizuku even though they aren\'t dating, hits her several times without apologizing, follows her everywhere she goes, tries to tell her what she can/can\'t do, and threatens to beat up anyone that comes near her.

No progress.aside from those two, others were charming.However, aside from the storyline, i was pleased with the artwork.

To be honest, it's been a while, since I've watched such as entertaining anime with such likable characters. This is one of the few in which I just find myself truly smiling and laughing at some moments, and truly feeling for the characters that are introduced.And that's just from the first five episodes!With the endless mass of cliche romcoms that currently populate the anime...world, it's difficult to find one that knows how to execute the story properly.STORY: 9/10While it isn't the most unique of story lines, it certainly brings a breath of fresh air. A studious, loner girl accidentally meeting an innocent, misunderstood bad boy? This is the type of story that could go wrong, yet TNK handled it in a way that made go very very right. I like how it doesn't rush things between the characters, and it keeps the viewers interested because there really is still mystery even though it balances it with the comedy.It's cliche done  in all the right ways.ART: 8/10I really do like the art style. It's not anything special, but I like how the characters were animated. The colors are bright, but not too bright. Also, I really like the backgrounds for some reason. Although, I really do have a soft spot for how Haru was animated, so there's that.SOUND: 7/10While the OP and ED won't make it on my favorites, they are still catchy. I won't mind watching them each time I watch an episode of this anime. I like the background music, so that's a plus.CHARACTER: 10/10All I can say is that the characters are definitely what drives this anime to be how good it is.Shizuku, despite being supposedly unfeeling, is one of my favorite anime protagonists. She's not annoying, and it's hard not to understand her. The scenes which portray her confusion just makes me smile and want to cheer her on.Haru, on the other hand, is definitely my favorite male protagonist at the moment. I'm positive that it's difficult not to fall in love with his idiocy and innocence. This character just has so much HEART. He is the type of character that I would love to meet in real life. It's strange how from the first episode, I'm undeniably attached to Haru.The other characters, including Mi-chan, Asako, Yuuzan, and the others are all pretty interesting, and I can hardly wait to get to know them better.ENJOYMENT: 10/10If it isn't obvious enough already, I really really enjoy this anime. It makes me smile. Not just laugh because of jokes, but actually legit smile.OVERALL: 9/10I'd give it a 10, but there's still something lacking. Plus, I'm still on the fifth episode, so who knows? It can only go downhill or uphill from here on out. world, it's difficult to find one that knows how to execute the story properly.STORY: 9/10While it isn't the most unique of story lines, it certainly brings a breath of fresh air.

I found this one while on a wild search for something new, something that could compare to Toradora (one of my die hard favorites).I came upon Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun because it was in the new list of anime on Animefreak. I studied the art, hardly looked at the two characters on the picture they were showing me, and basically told myself it wasn't going to be what I was looking for. I can't even begin to tell you how wrong my pitiful assumption was.I won't sit here...and explain the story to you, or give you any kind of spoilers, but let me tell you why you'll enjoy this.1) If you're like me, and you're looking for something new and different, this is it. I love any anime that makes me smile and gives me a good laugh all in one. I've caught myself actually chuckling at things that go on or situations they present to me. I'll tell you, this hardly ever happens because I feel like what they usually want me to laugh at isn't believable or amusing.2) This is not your typical story about a delinquent and a girl who's all into her studies. The two main characters, Shizuku and Haru, have much more going for them. I've never seen a main girl who was so blunt and straight to the point, it was as refreshing as it was shocking. Haru at first comes off as someone who's strange and you can't tell what's going on in his head, but he's smart and has more beneath the surface.3) This anime keeps you so interested, that even the background characters or side characters who's names you don't know keep you entertained or make you smile. I never thought I would be someone who enjoyed side characters, but there are at least three in this anime that excite me when they pop up on the screen.4) I can be a bit picky about the styling of an anime, or how the art is drawn, but this one is definitely my sort of thing. It isn't generic, and it isn't over the top with colors bursting in your face. Their limbs are a bit long, but that isn't something you'll pay so much attention to that it bugs you. I had a friend of mine tell me it reminded him of a Code Geass style, but I don't see it whatsoever.5) Enjoy plots where many characters are falling in love or have crushes? Oh god, you will love this. This anime has so much of that, it's bursting with it all over the place. They do it in such a quirky way that it doesn't make you uncomfortable, and you may (like I do), want characters to be with both options.The bottom line is that I thoroughly recommend this anime. To miss this would be a loss, and I think you'll be missing out on some strong feelings for it and some good chuckles. and explain the story to you, or give you any kind of spoilers, but let me tell you why you'll enjoy this.1) If you're like me, and you're looking for something new and different, this is it.

Well, I could say that this anime doesn't live up to the expectation as I hope. Why? Here's the reasons why I personally did not like this anime.1. The closure/endingAt least Toradora! and Chuu-2 Byo have proper closure for their story, where at least they did not leave the plot hanging at an unsatisfying point. Both main character has actually made their resolution and at least we can see where...their relationship can go on. But in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, it is unfortunately a no. The relationship between Haru and Shizuku didn't meet up my expectation. I can't be sure that I can see where their relationship is going, as it did not progress at all!..2.The plotAs I said before, I can't see any clear progress that they made. Maybe it is my mistake because I'm comparing this anime with Toradora!. What's more, even the last few episodes didn't stress out anything between them at all, instead showing how Shizuku is getting more familiar with Yamaken and how Yamaken had developed special feelings towards Shizuku. Somehow, I even forgot about the relationship between Haru and Shizuku and actually rooting for Yamaken instead. Fuck me right?I only dislike this anime because of these reasons. Other aspects are acceptable by me. The art is good, and the comedy and humor always made me burst out of laughter. The side characters also play their role well in the story as I can see their significance in the plot.Last but not least, those who expect to watch a storyline similar to Toradora! or Chuu-2 Byo will probably will get disappointed. Or maybe not? I don't know. Watch it yourself, and judge it yourself. This is only my opinion. their relationship can go on. But in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, it is unfortunately a no.

You really get a chance to like the characters and enjoy their journey to find their love in each other and the supporting characters are fun and interesting enough to enjoy watching alongside Mizutani and Haru.The art was good and I liked the style that the characters were drawn in.

The only thing about it that I didn't really care for was the ending. It didn't really tie up all the loose ends that I was expecting and the OVA was random and didn't give me anything extra to add to the actual story either.

Haru has been absent from class for a long time now because of his past bad behavior, and Shizuku gets tasked with bringing him back to class. The series then concerns him their relationship to each other, and how each of them grows from that.Haru is seen as a scary, impulsive thug who glares at everyone. Shizuku is the serious, responsible type who always studies. But they each have hidden sides to them that the series then...explores. Part of the fun of the show is finding out about those hidden sides to their personalities. My main focus here will be the main relationship between these two characters, and their general attitudes toward not only each other, but toward the world. Most of the comedy of the series comes from the clash between their viewpoints, and also a clash between their desires and the constraints of the “normal” world.Arguably the most interesting thing about the Haru character is his enthusiasm. At the beginning of the series, he’s hiding out from school. He beat up some upper classmen and  got suspected; but his suspension had been lifted, and he simply refused to go. When he meets Shizuku, he escapes by jumping out a window. But later on, he accosts her and stops her from leaving. The truth is: he’s curious, he’s anxious about school; he wants to go. His tough exterior actually hides a soft, rather inquisitive nature. He wonders out loud that since Shizuku brought him his school papers, it must be because they’re friends; and he later asks her school was. His knowledge of friendship, of school, of all sorts of things, seems to be derived from media; he yearns to experience it for himself. Shizuku is the excuse he gives himself to attend school, but soon enough we see how important going and being there is for Haru. He earnestly believes in the significance of the rituals of youth; he wants to make friends so they can all hang out together after school, wants to meet them in the weekend, wants to live out his high school life the way it’s supposed to be done. But, again, he’s too weird, a little too intense, to get along with other people; in the end, only Shizuku seems to be able to handle him.Shizuku, on the other hand, is a loner by choice. She comes across as cold, unfeeling, and stuff like that. But really she’s also as intense as Haru is. She focuses all her energy on her studies. She’s not interested in what happens around her, or what other people say, or that she might be missing out on some better life. For her, high school is just a thing she has get through, make good grades in, and get an amazing job later on. Which, fine; that’s actually a pretty great way to look at it. But immediately the show takes great care to show another side to her. Although she tries not to get involved in Haru’s problems, she cares too much to let things pass. She’s blunt and says what she wants, sometimes without thinking of the consequences, as when she calls out Haru’s friends for not treating him right; her truth-telling can be brutal. But Haru’s presence radically changes how she perceives her life. There’s a beautiful moment in the school rooftop (where else?) where she falls asleep. When she wakes up, Haru’s there watching her; it’s the first time she’s ever skipped class. She allows herself to relax, to feel the moment around her, to know why it might be an important experience, “my world is growing.”What’s refreshing about these two characters is how these characters aren’t tortured souls without any clue about their real feelings. In the first two episodes, both characters have confessed to each other. Just like any good old-fashioned romantic comedy, a bunch of complications pop up; romantic rivals, past wounds, etc., just to put off what is inevitable. But I loved how sure they all were of their feelings. I’ve seen so many shows where the characters are completely clueless or never have the courage to say anything about what they feel that it becomes annoying. Haru and Shizuku may be clueless as to how to navigate the world and deal with people, but they are remarkably sure about their feelings; and honestly it’s thanks to that that the series remains solid and engaging. Haru and Shizuku are characters who are weird, too intense, to fit in “normally” with everybody else. They’re people who can’t turn off their personality just to fit in. The show, almost imperceptibly, allows them to build a world for themselves. By the final episodes, our main characters have found people who care about them, even though they themselves remain as stubborn and as weird as they started.It’s a shame that we’ll probably have to wait for a sequel to find out what happens in the romantic lives of these characters, but that’s okay. The show has the confidence to basically end on a totally filler episode because we’ve already learned to love the characters and love to spend time with them. Perhaps a second season will introduce more drama into their life, perhaps not. The series allows our main characters to feel some new emotions, have their lives be changed, all without too much angst or anything like that.

I can't because it feels half and half...  Anyways, the story revolves around the Haru and his developing relationship with Shizuku and the group of friends that these two socially unique people create.To be honest the main romance doesn't really get anywhere after a third way through the anime, but it guess its that sense of confused and conflicted young love that helped support the anime, but most of time you just find the main character's love for one another conflicting with their own desires, intentions, and worries which...doesn't get resolved at all.  There are some side romantic plot points but they don't get anywhere either, I get you could say their is a lack of closure for everything in this anime.The characters are a really strong point in this anime, they make you laugh and are so interesting and complex.

My one issue with the anime is that I would've liked for everything to be resolved with character development and romances.  There were too many things left just hanging out there.  When the anime ended for me, I felt an empty feeling that longed for closure between all the characters.    That's the only tragic flaw I felt for this anime so I won't let that get in the away of my rating... The anime was hilarious, emotion grabbing, and entertaining, but felt unfinished.

(in other words, you’ll be fine)Before I started my review, I had the obligation to read about what other people thought about the show and see if I can conclude with an unbiased review and just tell you really what the show is for what it really is. However, I learned that such a case wasn’t viable to reviewing a show that instilled so much emotion. It wouldn’t make sense for me to tell people that the show was objectively good or objectively fun, it just doesn’t make sense. Take it...for what you will, but this review is going to simply be about why I thought this show was great and why you should give it a try:I decided to start with the shows greatest strength because I personally found this to have higher precedence than the story because the story’s simple enough already. What TNKK did that most other slice of lifes I have seen in my life didn’t was make the characters genuine. Each character cares about something that people can relate to and aren’t merely tools to move the plot forward. In fact, it becomes the other way around.“Shizuku is a girl who finds happiness through studying which inevitably leads her to becoming this objectively straightforward person.”“Haru is a boy who couldn’t make friends most of his life due to his violent behavior in the past.“If one were to read these sentences alone, you’d get the most generic characters that are no different from most kuuderes and tragic characters in mainstream anime. But put these characters together and you’ll get the complexity essential to kickstart a story from their genuine relationship. One of the central themes of Shizuku when it comes to the relationship is whether or not she should embrace it over studying, which differs from Haru’s willingness to simply be loved. It casts aside the rigid dichotomy of “who’s right” and “who’s wrong”, but rather “how will it work?” The show’s core objective is different from many slice of lifes and relates more to shows like Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru where characters are everything. It’s a show about genuine people coming together and developing from mere exposure to each other.What makes it even better is that this trope isn’t restricted to the main characters, but the supporting characters just as equally. What TNKK likes to do is give each character an interest or way of life that they cherish like anybody else. Shizuku loves to study because she found that hard work pays off in the end, Natsume finds consolidation on the internet because it’s hard making friends in real life, Sasahara likes soccer because it’s fun, Yamaguchi adopts an elitist mentality to not try too hard since he comes from a rich background, and Haru does whatever he does to make friends simply because he wants to.It is with this that the characters becomes easier for us to sympathize and makes us more inclined to take part in their decisions as well. Characters are seen constantly asking themselves a series of genuine questions on how they should behave, act, or think when interacting with other characters or just clashing in general, especially amongst Shizuku and Haru. We see that each character is its own person that you can’t help but support or disagree with because they’re relatable. It is also through these genuine interactions that we also get a lot of really really funny moments, which got me cracking up and grinning for a good hour each episode. The characters just made it easier to laugh, smile, and cry with them once you realize that they’re not merely tools for your enjoyment, but symbolically people in their own right. No one breaks out of character, they simply are their characters.With that in mind, the show did not need to have a plot full of complicated twists, overdramatized themes, or fantastical elements to make it compelling. It simply just gave its characters the room to be themselves - to let them be the characters they were written to be.The soundtracks are also very, very fitting for the show. It’s mellow, but memorable. It doesn’t try too hard to be something fantastic as it did not want to detract the importance of the scene itself. Once the song gets implanted into memory (which isn’t hard because there aren’t many) it will make you think back to the last significant event where the song played, indirectly piecing each scene together as something of intrinsic value to character development. I agree that the opening and ending songs weren’t that great, but I didn’t find that to be all that important if you were to only care about the show itself.Strangely, the same thing could be said about the art itself. Mellow, but memorable with a heavy focus on the characters before anything. I really enjoyed the minimalist style of the show, though most people can argue otherwise it’s just my personal taste. The art is color and sometimes reminds me of paper mache. The best part about the art, for me, was the body language in that each facial expression or body movements embody what the person is feeling or thinking. This tied with passionate and awesome voice acting by the cast makes for comedic moments to its maximum potential. Faces will contort, stretch and swing with the character’s voices, so every joke doesn’t come off half assed. This also applies to when they’re nervous, scared, sad, energetic, tired, etc. Though It wasn’t anything special, I was very impressed with the studio’s creativity and passion to adapting what the manga strived to do.Now to finally address the elephant in the room. If there’s one thing that was extremely disappointing about this show is that it ends less than midway through the manga itself. It literally stops as the characters are developing and we’re left with unanswered questions and no sign of a season 2 (which is probably 100% by now). Personally, I found budget to be the only reason this was a failure, but still enjoyed the ride nonetheless.I think this show would be perfect for you if:You don’t care that it stops midwayYou are more focused on characters than the plot itselfYou don’t care if it’s not anything extravagantYou are a big fan of slice of life anime and want to try something differentDon’t care about fan serviceWant to laughAre my best friend :^)Take it for what you will, it’s just my opinion based on what I’ve felt and what other people felt when I showed this to them.All in all, I found TNKK to be an indescribable experience that I can easily rate a 10/10 by merit and respectable writing in general. It doesn’t rely on cute characters, fan service, “accidents”, cliches, or miracles to be interesting and does so in a very concise way that is easy to follow. If that isn’t good writing, then I don’t know what is. My favorite character overall was probably Haru just because of the purity in his actions and Natsume when it came to the comedy because her voice is just so funny.I feel that many people, regardless of my view and tastes but rather for one’s interest in slice of life anime, should definitely give this show a try. MAL is an amazing place for people to share and exchange ideas, so I’m glad to be one of the few people that gave a 10/10 review for this show.TL;DR (for the lazy) The show is driven by the complexity of the characters than the story itself, which is what makes TNKK a genuine and respectable piece of work. It doesn’t try to do anything too over the top, but will always do something different to get the viewer’s attention, whether it’s the art, music, comedy, or the characters themselves. for what you will, but this review is going to simply be about why I thought this show was great and why you should give it a try:I decided to start with the shows greatest strength because I personally found this to have higher precedence than the story because the story’s simple enough already.

The manga had more detail about what happened.I am extremely disappointed, like the romance started out cute but in the end they literally went back to square one, as awkward couples. The entire time I went thru an emotional rollercoaster only to realize nothing changes in the end.The art style is definitely nice, I really found myself enjoying the introduction's art and the vibrant colors.The characters themselves are entertaining, sort of relatable.The story, I really wish they fleshed it out instead of giving a crappy kind of slice of life ending.Overall, I was so disappointed I feel like GRArkada...with the ending of School Days.**Spoiler Alert:**NOTHING EVER CHANGES!!! It is literally unknown if they get together unless you read the manga... with the ending of School Days.**Spoiler Alert:**NOTHING EVER CHANGES!!! It is literally unknown if they get together unless you read the manga..."", 'Story: The first episode to the anime is very interesting. There\'s a girl named Shizuku Mizutani who is basically your ""wants to be on top of everyone when it comes to grades in her school"" type of chick. Everything seems to go according to her plans until the day she has to drop off homework for a student who\'s new to the school but hasn\'t shown up to classes yet named Haru Yoshida. He was known for his violent behavior in his younger years, but as soon as he meets Shizuku, he just turns out to be flat out weird. In fact, he starts cherishing...her for being different from everyone else. Then, when he kisses her, Shizuku ends up on a coming of age journey of a lifetime. And what I basically just explained was the first episode. The rest of the series is just ""There\'s a problem, the couple fights, and there may or may not be a resolution to it."" To me, that formula is boring. Where are the getting closer moments? There are barely any, and that\'s disappointing for a romance anime. If you\'re into that whole thing, I won\'t stop you from watching, but if you\'re not, you\'ll be pretty disappointed. Score: 5/10Art: I guess the only thing the anime has going is the animation. It\'s basically it\'s own staple, and that\'s what makes My Little Monster unique. It\'s cute, and it\'s also very clean. It has this stenciled touch that matches the stenciled world that Shizuku thinks she belongs in, and I believe that the anime should tell the story in the main character\'s point of view and how the main character views the world. 10/10 successful.Sound: The in-show soundtrack is pretty bland except for the love theme between Shizuku and Haru. It\'s pretty cute when it comes to their personalities clashing together. The other scores seem either out of place or they\'re just not what I imagined for this anime at all. However, when it comes to the opening and ending, I just think they\'re not catchy in the slightest. They\'re just generic in general, and I can\'t stand it at all. Pretty disappointing I guess. Score: 3/10Character: This is one of the first times since beginning to watch anime again that I cannot stand the main character at all. Shizuku is the stereotypical studious girl but done to the maximum degree with makes her extremely boring as hell. She even gets to the point where she\'s angry because she can\'t study, but you know she wants to express her feelings to Haru. God, I can\'t stand people like that! Then, you have her new friends. Natsume is the girl who does not have many real friends because she claims her real home is the Internet. She also gets low grades...but she\'s cute? I appreciate her supportive nature at times, but she could just be annoying mostly. Sasahara is the kind baseball player, but he doesn\'t really deliver much character into the group of friends. I think he\'s cute, but there\'s nothing much that\'ll make me say, ""Why should I care about you?"" Yamaken becomes a main side character for no reason whatsoever. If his only purpose is to break the couple up, then that makes this like any other generic romance shoujo ever. If there are only two characters I like they are, of course, Haru and Mitsuyoshi. Haru is your innocent weirdo who has a tragic past and wants to do right in the world. Plus, he has a pet rooster that he hid in his shirt in the second episode. How do you not? Mitsuyoshi is Haru\'s guardian and everyone else\'s guide. He\'s where the purest humor comes from. However, I can\'t say that those characters are the saving grace though. Score: 6/10Enjoyment: The factors that I just explained do play a major factor when it comes to enjoying the show. There are moments though when the show is funny, but the more you get into the series, the more the jokes start to get old, and it\'s just not that fun anymore. The characters are your tropes and don\'t really bring much to the table, and the couple is a little deadpan, making you feel bad for Haru nonetheless. My enjoyment rate would have to be 5/10.Overall: Well, I pretty much said what there is to be said here. Story: pretty much goes in useless circles. Art style is the best thing. Sound needs major creativity improvement. Character needs to be more broad. And all of that would make better enjoyment for the audience. Last score: rounded 6/10 her for being different from everyone else. Then, when he kisses her, Shizuku ends up on a coming of age journey of a lifetime.

Last score: rounded 6/10', ""Love is spontaneous, love is unexpected: it has no pattern and cannot be forecast. It is that very nature of romance, that makes it exciting, disconsolate, and serene in an unlikely combination, whose variety makes it irrefutably the spice of life.  Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My little monster) is a charming slice of life drama, that emphasizes the atypical strangeness surrounding love and romance- and if you let it- can take your breath away. My little monster is a show blessed with a great cast of interesting characters, a beautifully composed soundtrack, well drawn art and animation - and unlike a great many romcoms- a...supporting cast that has it's own interesting conflicts and struggles; however, despite all those positives, the show still somehow disappointed me, ultimately leaving me winded, a screeching voice at the back of my mind saying, “is that-- it?!?”.Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun’s biggest issue lies in it’s plot. Before I really begin to hammer this story with my abusive comments, I have to establish the fact that I hold the Manga in the highest esteem, and my disappointment solely lies in what could have been. My little monster, despite all its’ resources, suffers from hollowness. Every good story has a heart- a central message that the plot runs on. For Tonari no kaibutsu-kun, the story was forcibly skinned from the body, leaving a hollow imitation of the original plot. It runs in the same order as the source, but is missing its limbs. It laughs and cries, despite the fact that it does not feel. The story was all in all disturbing to me, like seeing an uncomfortably life-like humanoid in the place of a human being. As disappointing as this was however, it was not a surprise. The mistranslation of a book to video is a trend in film work, so this was only natural from that perspective; although, it was unexpected for an anime adaption of a manga, as traditionally- in my experience- very little is lost in translation from the two mediums. The case here was very different, as I have made clear, as the anime managed to lose the entire purpose and central idea of the story: which, in turn, has caused a fair amount of rust to set into a piece of work that originally shined with brilliance.A corroded plot aside, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun excels in its characters and their relationships. Despite a rather light-hearted and trepid plot, due to missing elements from the manga, My Little Monster’s characters are still lovable, interesting, and relatable to the viewer. Their awkwardness and irregular behavior add depth and allow what would have been a typical, simplistic, slice of life love comedy to hold the viewer’s attention and keep them interested despite of a seemingly motionless plot. From Shizuku’s anti-social, emotionless attitude and unwavering intent on studying, to Haru’s rambunctious mood swings and social awkwardness; My Little Monster has two very strange “monsters” at the helm of the story. The captivating ups and downs of two people opening their hearts for the first time manages to redeem a directionless plot, and capture the audience’s attention in the moment.The spotlight of this show however, belongs to a well composed score that perfectly parallels the emotions and mood of the story. Where the music really shines in My Little Monster, is in the pretty moments, when it gets to express a quiet and gentle romance in the serene sounds the score provides: whether it be on the stairs overlooking the sunset over the city, or on a bright afternoon sitting atop the school rooftop gazing up at the sky, our protagonists are given beautiful backdrops of sound to match the feelings in their hearts. It is able to draw the audience much closer into the feelings of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun’s characters, and allow us to associate with its individuals through more than just sympathetic thoughts, but through empathetic feelings. The music does have its flaws though, much of which is not the fault of the composer but rather the editor. The introduction of suspenseful music in encounters are misused due to the show’s failure to visualize it, leaving the viewers feeling the tension from the score, then feeling confused due to not actually seeing any conflict to match the mood created by the soundtrack. This is caused by some lousy arrangements which cut short much of the material needed to detail the conflict that this music was originally made for.The art for Tonari no Kaibutsu kun isn’t especially new or unique, nor is it ridiculously high quality animation like what you would expect from a Kyoto animation project, but still manages to be perfect without trying too hard. The characters look precisely as they should, reflective of their respective personalities and look distinct but not ridiculous (I’m terribly happy to see them avoid rainbow colored hairstyles), all of which add to the realism of the work, which was honestly a good decision. A show’s art can either make it serious and grim, or light hearted and cheerful. Much like Director Hayao Miyazaki (as he stated once in an interview regarding the anime industry suffering from otaku), I personally believe that unrealistic portrayals of the characters that make up our lives in anime are hard to relate to and generally meaningless. So every little detail and effort that goes toward making a story more realistic and relatable is a good effort. So, despite a lack of extravagance and showiness, My Little Monster’s art is still the best it can be for the story of life it wishes to tell.Overall, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (the anime) has a lot going for it: a nice source to draw the plot from, a good array of characters, superb music, and art that is suitable and nice to look at. However, because of bad overall editing, and a failure by the director to understand the central message of the original work, it is nothing but a pretty face concealing a bland interior. This show, despite how lost it is, will make you feel happiness, anger, and sadness, but will leave you disappointed with all the questions you still need answered by the end. It will make you love the characters that star in its story, but won’t manage to give them a satisfying send-off. What would have been a hugely successful, two seasons long anime with twenty five episodes per season, became one thirteen episode long chunk of the manga that would fail to have a clear reason and conclusion. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is not dreadful, it is by all means a lovely appetizer, an antipasti to spark our appetite and get us ready for the main course. That big meal being the manga written by author Robico, which concludes the story of the characters viewers will grow to feel attached to by the end of this slice of life, shoujo anime. Lets just say that TNKK is going to disappoint you: no viewer ever wants to watch something full of potential fall onto its back, there is nothing to be disappointed about if you never get your hopes up, so in a way, because of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun’s beautiful music, art, general concept, and how much it got me to care about its characters, I was far more disappointed than I would have been had I not cared at all. So despite it lacking the criteria of a great story as a standalone TV show, it still deserves to be recognized as a good stepping stone to the source content, and appreciated for what it does do well as the appetizer that it is. supporting cast that has it's own interesting conflicts and struggles; however, despite all those positives, the show still somehow disappointed me, ultimately leaving me winded, a screeching voice at the back of my mind saying, “is that-- it?!?”.Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun’s biggest issue lies in it’s plot.

So, despite a lack of extravagance and showiness, My Little Monster’s art is still the best it can be for the story of life it wishes to tell.Overall, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (the anime) has a lot going for it: a nice source to draw the plot from, a good array of characters, superb music, and art that is suitable and nice to look at. However, because of bad overall editing, and a failure by the director to understand the central message of the original work, it is nothing but a pretty face concealing a bland interior. This show, despite how lost it is, will make you feel happiness, anger, and sadness, but will leave you disappointed with all the questions you still need answered by the end. It will make you love the characters that star in its story, but won’t manage to give them a satisfying send-off. What would have been a hugely successful, two seasons long anime with twenty five episodes per season, became one thirteen episode long chunk of the manga that would fail to have a clear reason and conclusion. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is not dreadful, it is by all means a lovely appetizer, an antipasti to spark our appetite and get us ready for the main course. That big meal being the manga written by author Robico, which concludes the story of the characters viewers will grow to feel attached to by the end of this slice of life, shoujo anime. Lets just say that TNKK is going to disappoint you: no viewer ever wants to watch something full of potential fall onto its back, there is nothing to be disappointed about if you never get your hopes up, so in a way, because of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun’s beautiful music, art, general concept, and how much it got me to care about its characters, I was far more disappointed than I would have been had I not cared at all. So despite it lacking the criteria of a great story as a standalone TV show, it still deserves to be recognized as a good stepping stone to the source content, and appreciated for what it does do well as the appetizer that it is."", 'Well, at first, I wasn\'t interested in this anime at all...He was in my list to watch and then, I found out that he was on Netflix and suddenly I became curious. The episodes are good and somewhat fun, but I think the development of the characters are really poor. The anime was appealing to me because of the fact that Shizuku was a cold hearted girl, who didn\'t care for friends or romance. But later in the episodes, she became someone who really frustrated me, with all the confusing attitude. In the other hand we have Haru, who is a ""delinquent"" and a...really open hearted boy. He definitely got my heart. He is a little confusing in the beginning, but he became into a really sincere character and is what saved the anime for me.Haru is fun and caring, he is the opposite of Shizuku. So this makes you think the obvious: Haru will change her.I was hoping that too.But what I saw was a back and forth pre-romance that didn\'t make me happy. Shizuku was so cold sometimes that I was ready to punch her in the face and sometimes I wanted her to be cold again. The relationship with Haru (for me) didn\'t move to another level. The other characters are good in their ways, like Natsume who truly wanted to be a friend for Mizutani or Ooshima, who also likes Haru, but didn\'t tried to ruin the couple or something. But nothing more.I\'m not saying that is bad, because it isn\'t. It\'s good to watch, but you can\'t expect good romance. The story has everything to be a very good piece: awesome art, sound, characters... But I guess that it\'s a little hard to develop a pretty story in 13 episodes.

I did not like Haru when he......I think it was twice in the anime his actions towards Shizuku were highly disturbing, but you'll have to watch and see for yourself.Despite those actions though, I did like Haru. I don't like how so very early on both of them were forcing love into the equation. I mean talk about moving fast, slow ya roll now!I like that it was not the kind of anime where everyone else has issues and those issues brought the main character closer. This was not that kind of anime. And...Haru did have a rival.The anime is kind of like Maid Sama, the last six episode of that anime, just this anime had more episode and didn't cram the triangle in toward the end.

It’s not only about love but more importantly it’s also about friendship and some of the hardships of teenage school life. The romance, drama, and even comedy are so well-balanced.About the CHARACTERSOne of the few unconventional things in the series is the not so “typical” characters. No more the old school “waiting for them to realize their feelings” or “confessing their love” as both protagonists know that they love each other right from the very start. Even their bickering is not common. Their love story...is definitely not the conventional which makes the series so exciting. Not only the protagonists who are so interesting but almost all the characters which is quite rare nowadays with the long lists of romantic comedy series.About YOSHIDA HARUThe male protagonist is the most interesting about the series. I could even say his personality is the combination of the different and common types of male lead which makes him quite rare. His weird antics, naivety, and mysteriousness make him even more interesting.About the ANIMATIONAs it is one of the latest animes of 2012, the animation is also one of the best; the character designs, the lay-outs, and it is very fashionable as well. The characters are also one of the most gorgeous I’ve seen. Plus, the background music makes the romantic moments even sweeter.About the ENJOYMENTDefinitely the best romantic series I’ve seen since Kimi ni Todoke and Kaichou wa Maid-sama!

This anime is a coming of age story first, and a romance story second. What does it mean to be friends or lovers? What is important to me? Am I happy with who I am right now?

This anime takes a more realistic version of outcast characters becoming friends or more for the first time while dealing with the pressures of high school.Sound: The OST is beautiful. It gives a similar feeling to the OST in One Punch Man.Character: The characters are...unique and memorable. The mellow female lead was a very nice change of pace from the usual anime female leads. Side characters are given some attention as well -- the side female character ended up becoming my favorite. The only qualm I have is that the main male character's backstory is still confusing even though time was spent trying to flesh it out quite a few times.Art: I think the art is average.Story: There isn't much story as not much time passes in the course of the anime and it is more geared towards being a slice-of-life. At least to me, this anime is more about the characters and their development. Since there isn't much of a story, there isn't really an end to the anime, rather it is left open ended.

The slice-of-life/shoujo/school anime promised a cute romance and good comedy in 13 episodes. Question is, did the anime actually hold on to the things it promised? ""My Little Monster"" is quite unusual for an anime title but as such, it clearly caught my attention.PLOT AND STORY LINE 📜Most of the shoujo anime we know involve one shy and socially awkward character on one, and a popular and outgoing character on the other side of the romance. But what happens if neither of the characters is socially...awkward nor shy, but still don\'t have any friends because of their \'special\' behavior? Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun gives the answer in a fresh anime atmosphere that really shows that the producers tried to make a different shoujo show.In the middle of the story we have Mizutani Shizuku, a rather apathetic girl who cares about one thing only-her grades. But her cold nature would soon start to fade after she meets the violent troublemaker Yoshida Haru. Much to her surprise, there is a lot more to Haru than just his violent behavior, which she would eventually find out after the two become really close.Even though Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun differs from other shoujo anime in terms of characters, other elements are still present. So, you get for example, not one, but two love triangles involving the main characters in only 13 episodes. Which brings us to the next point-the ROMANCE.When it comes to that, it is like TNKK committed a serious crime in the shoujo world by putting a clear love confession right in the beginning. I know, shocking right? To think that a shoujo anime character would confess his/her feelings right in the beginning and so omit confusion and awkward moments between the two main characters, is absolutely barbaric (*meme material*). Kidding, even though one side of the romance is clear, the other one gets pretty confused not knowing what to do with the new feelings and so ruins all the potential the show actually had.From there on, the show literary goes nowhere. The main story line gets all messed up, the romance part slowly fades as the main characters grow further apart and all that leads to a unfinished story that had the chance to hit it big. I don\'t know what happens in the manga later on, but they could\'ve at least made a decent season finale. In this way we are literary left with nothing.On thing that Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun did extremely good, is the comedy. Haru is an extremely funny  character and all he does is just hilarious. So, you might not enjoy the story and the romance of the anime that much, but it is perfect if you just want to chill and have a good laugh.CHARACTERS 👦👩Just as it happens in a lot of the other shoujo anime, most of the characters in Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun have superficial personality and a minimum of (or even non) character development. Just the two mains, Shizuku and Haru had more depth in their personalities and some detail in character, but the rest is just...meh. Asako was the annoying side-kick, Kenji the pitiful side-kick, Yuuzan (Haru\'s brother)who was about to put some drama in the anime but nothing actually happened in the end, and there was Sasahara, who literary showes up every here and there but doesn\'t actually contribute to the story. I was also annoyed by Shizuku so I won\'t be talking about her, but I did love Haru. As said, he is a hilarious character that contributed the most to the comedy factor of the anime. He also doesn\'t get any character development but I like him just the way he is.ANIMATION AND STYLE 🎨💻In short, the animation was quite satisfactory and enjoyable to watch but it was the style of the anime that made it look this good.

Especially our main male love interest is a very comedic and intriguing person, making decisions which lead to hilarious outcomes, keeping the anime somewhat refreshing. The other characters are rather bland though, and our main female love interest isn't particularly revolutionary.The sound and art are fine, but they aren't anything special, nor do they add to the experience....They do the job just fine.Overall the enjoyment is okay, but you shouldn't expect anything too interesting.  If you enjoy either romance or drama, I can wholeheartedly recommend this to you, but if you're looking for something new and intriguing, you might want to look somewhere else.

From the first episode it is unconventional but that is what makes it great.Story: Shizuku, cold, indifferent and intelligent. Haru, childish, violent and spontanious. These two very different characters first encounter leads to Haru to confess his feelings for her. The story progresses as the two characters slowly become friends and the trials that face them in their journey.Art/Sound: In all honesty, I am going to quit typing this block unless something really sticks out. So far this anime has nothing special about it when it comes to artwork or sound.Characters: Okay,...here is where the fun begins. With the two characters, my first thought it that it will be boring as hell. You have an emotionless character and one that is eccentric. I mean how the hell do you plan to develop them, how will they grow? And you know what, this studio accomplished that. They went with a cliche story but unconventional characters. Each episode is unique. Both of the characters are funny in their own way. And there are some episodes where I am laughing to the point where I am about to cry.Enjoyment/Overall: This here is a unique romcom. Highly unconventional. Completely different than others. The only thing I did not like about it, is the back and forth between them and their feelings for each other. It was hella annoying at times. But besides that, the characters are amazing.

The characters in the anime don""t know what love is and are trying to figure it out themselves. Add in a female main who only cares about her grades and a guy main character who is a thug with a good heart in the inside. The story is very sloppy and very repetitious as it keeps back peddling every episode. I understood that you are trying to be unique but i mean come on, i want development and progress. The art was standard...and the music was OK. I actually really enjoyed all the characters a lot ass they were unique and refreshing. However their lack of development was the only thing bothering me with the character. In general i see what they were trying to get at with this anime, but due to the sloppy story and the lack of character development it wasn\'t as good. Even though i have been bashing the anime, there are people that think that the story was well done in a sense. So all i can say is try it out and see if you like it. and the music was OK.

I was full of hope from those first 4-5 chapters, but it just lead nowhere from there. The constant push and pull these two dudes were in was ridiculous, and somehow after 4 love declarations they are still thinking if...they really should date or not. And to top it off, we get another final episode that seems like goddamn filler. Worst episode of the show.That said, I loved this shit. The comedy was great, the characters lovely, and all the other sides of the story other than the relationship between the two mains was soooo good.Altogether, loved it, but still a lot of wasted potential. If it was handled properly this could have gone up to the level of Toradora, but since that was not the case, it just became another fairly allright romcom.

So I\'m just saying I\'m not the a reviewer as much as a person who just likes to watch anime and read manga/light novels.Review: My Little Monster is a good concept to see two different characters to go through these emotions in a relation ship- but is it a good anime? Well it is but isn\'t at the same time.Reason one, the anime is 13 episodes to never explain on how well it conclude and go back in fort in relationship wise, now the anime was running as...the manga was going as well. But as for the relationship going back and fort is kind of annoying but it shows that two people with different personalities can\'t be perfect- or can they? Same with Toradora!- two people, different actions, but it has more episodes to explain itself then My Little Monster.Ask yourself this. Would you feel the same if Toradora if it was 13 episodes and not telling the full story? Kinda like Deadman Wonderland where they tell you at the end to go and read the manga.Now- move aside that... Do I like the anime? Kind of- like I said before, it\'s nice and all but not many episodes to explain itself. The music is nice, characters are great in their own, art style as well, story, etc.The manga however explains a lot more and is actually enjoyable. More explaining, but it sometimes doesn\'t focus on our main characters, but it does go on to say- they need to learn to work together. I won\'t explain nor tell you to read the manga but if you want to see what happened after everything in the anime- read it.Rating: Now my full rating for the anime is just ""meh"" (5-7/10)The anime could be better if explained to our main characters focused- yet it is still a good-ish anime, I will only say it could have been better if they published it after the manga was done so we can see the whole story.Simple Answer: Just read the manga...

The characters are fun and interesting, but show very little development in the short 13 episodes. I loved how blunt and realistic the dialogue was at times, and some scenes had me laughing out loud. The art was pretty good - nothing outstanding, but pretty to look at and a nice...colour scheme.Unfortunately however none of the arcs in this show seem resolved at the end. Neither the main protagonists’ relationship, nor any of the side characters arcs or the questions about certain characters past that were brought up repeatedly throughout the show (sometimes even as the main point of the episode) but never attempted to answer.All in all I enjoyed this show A LOT while watching, but it feels very unresolved as you finish it - somewhat like it was cancelled halfway through the season. colour scheme.Unfortunately however none of the arcs in this show seem resolved at the end.

Haru was so cute and super sweet to Shizuku and he tried to get her to hang out with him but all she cared about was her studies. I thought that throughout the anime she would learn that school isn't everything and that it's okay to miss some answers on tests, but she didn't. There were some instances where she would let loose but then her final grade would be one point less then what she wanted it to be and she would bury herself back in books and shut...Haru and everyone else out. I just felt like the anime ended very abruptly. For instance, I was happy when one of the side characters finally confessed her love to another, but it never showed what happened after that. I was waiting so long for her to confess her love and when she finally did, I didn't get to see his response. I would have enjoyed this show a little more if there was more romance and less complaining. The creators didn't go wrong with the comedy though. I was laughing through the entire show.

I was laughing through the entire show."", '(Mild-spoilers discusses romance between the main two characters - but that should be obvious from the synopsis)SUMMARYThe series starts out well for the first 5 episodes but soon falls apart, as the male lead reveals himself to be an insensitve and somewhat abusive character, with no personal development or redeeming himself as the show goes on. This is despite the female lead becoming a more developed charcter in contrast. The series is not helped by the fact that after episode 13 the manga still continues on, leaving no room for closure in the show. It would\'ve been great if things could\'ve been completely wrapped up...but as it I wouldn\'t recommend this anime.REVIEWFirstly, the show starts off really well. Both leads are presented as interesting characters. Shizuku Mizutani is a headstrong, academic and competitive girl - focussing on her studies more than anything else around her, including even friends. Haru Yoshida on the other hand is a deeply troubled young man, who although smart himself, seems to have very deep rooted social and behavioural issues and has isolated himself from others. As the two spend time together viewers are treated to moments of charm and sweet supporting interactions between the two, where two socially inept characters become closer. Surprisingly for a shoujo anime the main charcters often talk very open and honestly about how they feel towards each other and their own thoughts. The first 2 episodes are great examples of this, with virtually little misunderstadning, mumblings or cliches. Though in stark contrast there are moments of violent and threatening outbursts from Haru that really throw things off later on.Haru\'s verbal threats to others are quite shocking, as well the threats of violence - they are extreme given the contexts. At times Haru is fighting to stick up for others being bullied which is an endearing trait, and at other times he is fighting and threatening others with harm as he becomes possessive over Shizuku. The switch in behaviour would be great if the narrative decided to follow a really sinister plotline, or a comedic romance plotline - but as it jumps between the two it becomes really jarring.Shizuku ends up falling for Haru, and the devlopment of the attraction is well presented from her perspective. At no point do you feel this is contrived by overt gestures or tropes. As the story progresses you soon realise the two really don\'t have a clue as to what a ""healthy"" relationship should be. However as things develop Shizuku find\'s herself having to manage Haru\'s jealousy and anger (and violent outbursts) - it gets to point where she ends up having to bargain with him often(""If you behave and promise not to fight, I\'ll go out on a date with you""), as well as dealing with his forced physical approaches.Over the 13 episodes Shizuku is the only one that really show\'s some personal growth, while Haru remains the same as always - never seeming to be able to redeem himself or improve his behaviour, which is a shame. Maybe this could be addressed if there was ever a season 2 (note the manga goes further from where the anime ends).Special mention should go the supporting characters - especially the ditsy Asako Natsume and likeable Souhei Sasahara. All are well realised, and display their own want\'s and desires. Asako\'s arc towards the end is worth special mention - and lightens the mood on the rest of Shizuku-Haru\'s relationship. You also can\'t help but feel there is a deep secret that would explain Haru\'s behaviour - and the screen time given to Haru\'s brother, Yuuzan Yoshida, hints at that but sadly not explored. This ends making it very difficult to empathise with Haru for most of his behaviour.Animation wise the quality is good, no over excessive use of still screens and the sound is fair with a good slection os supporting music that sets the moods for scenes really well.CONCLUSIONOn the whole, I would\'ve really liked the idea of two socially awkard people that are not sure what a healthy relationship looks, but end up with one being in an abusive and controlling relationship. Unfortuantely, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun really misses the boat on this. What could\'ve been a great exploration of two people finding love, lust, jealously, friendship, romance, fear, anger... is instead just a bit of a narrative mess with only Shizuku ever ""trying"", and the male lead being insufferable throughout. I would avoid this one. but as it I wouldn\'t recommend this anime.REVIEWFirstly, the show starts off really well. Both leads are presented as interesting characters.

My little monster was one of those anime’s for me. I truly considered it (past tense) a top tier anime in the genre of romance and comedy. The main characters were extremely interesting and just cute to follow. The anime did lack interesting side characters though but the bizarre whack a doodle relationship of the main characters Haru and Shizuku had me fully invested....Now you might wonder why I keep speaking in the past tense when I talk about this anime… well here’s why IT WILL NEVER FINISH. YUPPPP here we go adding another bomb ass show into the pit of “No season 2 announced”. 8 years later and even after the manga’s completion Brain’s Base refuses to make a season 2.So in conclusion what I’m trying to say is watch this anime if you wanna have a really fun time, following one of the cutest relationships I’ve ever witnessed but be warned that you will be disappointed in the end as it just leaves you with an empty feeling that you can’t have more of it even before you see their relationship truly take off.

I haven\'t marathoned an entire series in one sitting in a while; I watched the first two at a club screening, then later restarted the series and ended up finishing all 13 episodes in a row. I\'m wondering why I haven\'t heard about Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (TNK) before. Watching this showed me what a romance slice of life anime could do to your heart; it pulled at my heartstrings so, so much, and there were so many moments when I thought/said to myself ""that\'s so... sweet."" Typically when I start new anime the first episode doesn\'t enthrall me too much; usually...it\'s after seeing episode 2 that I really want to see the rest. But TNK was riveting from the very beginning. It was surprisingly pretty fast-paced. In 13 episodes a lot happens. A myriad jewels of friendship and love brim in the air. The pot is full, like, all the time.HARU YOSHIDA. This kid. He\'s so damn innocent! A delinquent who avoids going to school because other students fear him. Tends to get into fights easily. Has no friends. Doesn\'t understand a lot about the world. But I loved all of it. The seiyuu work was done brilliantly to convey his range of emotions, from inquisitiveness to anger to bashfulness. Watching him and the other main character, Shizuku Mizutani, was enough to make me glued to the screen. Both characters grew up with basically no friends, Haru as I explained, and Shizuku because she only cared about her grades. I\'ve never seen a person, in real life, literature, film, or anime that\'s as diligent as she is. I must say she\'s either highly motivated or just plain obsessed. Anyways, human psychology plays a huge part in this anime. As both Haru and Shizuku are new to the sociable setting, it\'s not surprising that when they befriend each other as their first true friends this friendship evolves into something greater. As obvious as it may seem, it\'s not that simple. Robico delved very deeply into the emotions and inner thoughts of Shizuku as she struggles to understand her new feelings. As she tries to examine her relationship with Haru and not just her grades. Human love is a very powerful emotion. I\'ll just say that it doesn\'t only involve these two in TNK. The ways it can affect and change people. As an introverted person myself who finds it difficult to interact comfortably with most people, I could understand all too painfully this endearing couple. However, I\'ve never experienced ""true"" love, whether one- or two-sided, so TNK was enlightening in a way.There seems to be a prevailing theme and motif of human bonding in the anime universe. I wonder if that\'s a byproduct of adolescent society of Japan -- for whatever reasons, they appear to cherish social interaction, friendship and love. SO MANY (and this is a good thing, a magnificent thing; it\'s always wondrous to gaze at on the screen) anime series deal with this in some way, no matter the genre, whether it\'s shounen or slice of life or what have you. It\'s amazing -- I\'m glad, actually that I entered this amazing universe relatively late, when I was more mature and able to understand the plots and characters. If I had begun my anime journey in elementary or middle school, I would have watched some anime without truly being able to appreciate and adore it. Anime, unlike its prevalent stereotype, is NOT puerile and childish. There is a plethora of anime out there with deep, dark, poignant, salient themes vis-à-vis the human condition and mankind as a whole. Other mediums like literature and film may do the same, and I know being a former bibliophile myself; but anime -- but anime, like raise it on a platform to the heavens above and call down the empyrean lightning -- for anime does it so blindingly well! American television in terms of emotive quality is like a child compared to the god standards of anime. TNK showed me this fact in 13 episodes. And this oh so endearing fact is not just contained to 13 episodes, but rather in the tens of thousands within the anime universe.Now back to TNK. The soundtrack was also done very well. I really liked the recurring track Tetsukazu no Kanjou (don\'t look it up until you\'ve finished the anime if you want the full viewing experience). In all scenes, the music matched the emotions superbly, and the fade-outs of sound were done superbly as well. The opening was okay. The ending was one of those endings that surpasses the opening, which doesn\'t happen often, but all things concerned the ending was undesired, for whenever it came up it meant the episode was over. I WANT MORE TONARI NO KAIBUTSU-KUN ANIME. I\'m definitely going to read the manga now. 13 episodes was 13 episodes of sheer magnificence, but still too few for my liking. Just like how Angel Beats! ended after 13 episodes and Tokyo Ghoul ended after two seasons of 12 episodes each and God Eater ended after 13 episodes and... for those with remaining material, I beseech the anime industry to make more seasons.Animation done by studio Brain\'s Base. I\'m starting to dislike the part 1, ""Rate the Anime"" section above the review because, for example, the quality of an anime\'s art is largely influenced by the studio\'s budget and its own style of animation. ufotable, for instance, reaches a near-photographic level of visual quality sometimes and in my opinion does the best job at in-depth detail to the art (i.e. Fate/Zero, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works, God Eater). On the other hand, Studio Pierrot did Naruto and Bleach and since those are long-running shounen they couldn\'t pay too much detail to the art like they did with Tokyo Ghoul, which is a 2-cour anime and was animated very well. Now Brain\'s Base (notable for Durarara!!, Baccano!, and others) draws its characters more flatly and with less attention to detail, but if it could animate its works better it would, obviously. So I\'m saying that if I were to compare the art of TNK to the likes of ufotable, it\'s not that good, but taken at eye level -- when I\'m watching it, that is -- it\'s still good. Honestly the animation doesn\'t matter that much, once you encounter the different characters and the plot it\'s just the conduit through which such elements are presented. It\'s not what\'s truly important.If TNK has flaws, I\'d say it\'s its length (too short, as I mentioned earlier), the mediocre opening, and... and, I think that\'s it. TNK is such a lovely story of two formerly friendless people trying to understand what it means to love another in a romantic way. I thank Robico, Brain\'s Base, and everyone else involved with the creation of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. Anime like this makes me want to be a better man, to understand other humans better, and ultimately to watch more anime to see if I can experience more of the emotions I felt when watching it. it\'s after seeing episode 2 that I really want to see the rest.

So I\'m saying that if I were to compare the art of TNK to the likes of ufotable, it\'s not that good, but taken at eye level -- when I\'m watching it, that is -- it\'s still good. Honestly the animation doesn\'t matter that much, once you encounter the different characters and the plot it\'s just the conduit through which such elements are presented. It\'s not what\'s truly important.If TNK has flaws, I\'d say it\'s its length (too short, as I mentioned earlier), the mediocre opening, and... and, I think that\'s it. TNK is such a lovely story of two formerly friendless people trying to understand what it means to love another in a romantic way. I thank Robico, Brain\'s Base, and everyone else involved with the creation of Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun. Anime like this makes me want to be a better man, to understand other humans better, and ultimately to watch more anime to see if I can experience more of the emotions I felt when watching it.', ""To be frank, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (the anime, let me be clear) was a waste of 13 episodes that probably would have been better given to another series. Here's why.Story:It is so anti-climactic and unfulfilling. The story ends abruptly, with no closure, leaving so many open threads that it doesn't feel as if the production team behind the anime cared enough about the story to patch it up nicely for the viewers. None of the relationships are solidified. None of the characters have developed. Nothing of substance, within 13 episodes, happened. None of the characters have arcs and development befitting a score higher than 3....The only reason why I even gave it a 3 instead of a 1 is because the anime was just so badly produced that it kept me hoping that it would improve itself. The only catch was, it didn't.Art/Sound:Endearing art style, and the sound, while not very memorable, complimented what was happening in the story nicely.Character:None of the characters developed within 13 episodes. Not one character seemed to have a redeeming quality, nor did they have any kind of complex personality traits or characteristics. Violent, cold, lonely -- these are not complex characters. These are 2D, simple and mediocre characters that the viewer has no reason to sympathize with nor like. I've never watched an anime where I felt so indifferent towards every main character that, regardless of what happened to them in the actual story, I just didn't care that much. The main character is intolerable. Her friends seem to be plot devices instead of actual characters that are meant to add significance to the story. And Haru, the people around him said that he was changing, but I simply couldn't see it.Enjoyment:All I can say it, don't watch the anime. Read the manga.Overall:Please skip this anime for your own sake. Guaranteed you are not missing out on anything substantial. Save the time it would take to watch 13 episodes to watch something else. Or, better yet, read the manga. I have yet to see a faithful, satisfying, and well done adaptation of a manga.

This anime starts off at a sprint but sadly it loses its speed towards the end a good watch, but it could have been much greater. Nonetheless watching this show made me happy, I am though a Shounen genre main so my taste in romance might be off but ya know i dig it.Extensive Review.Ok lets do this, i was so excited for the start of this the first episode i would say is 10/10 but like i stated above it gets really slow idk the reason why it does it just...feels like its missing something. To my understanding the manga actually has a ending to it so i would say to read the manga first that way you know whats up cause i dont and im gonna go read the manga after i write this short review cause lets be real you dont need someone writing a whole damn essay to tell you if its good. feels like its missing something.

Sadly, their relationship doesn\'t progress that much throughout the show, and it never gets to the point where they specifically consider themselves a couple, or kiss (with mutual consent) for that matter. Although after the final episode, it is pretty safe to conclude that they will become (or are) a couple at that point.It was a very entertaining watch, that\'s why I rate it 8/10 even though the ending wasn\'t satisfying.A second season (or perhaps some special episodes) would be a nice addition, making it a very nice show.

However, never was the actual drama explained or got into in depth detail, all that was given are some puzzle pieces you *could* put together but without any guarantee.The slice of life was rather far...off and got interrupted by the drama without place.While some characters where interesting there was no depth about them whatsoever making them feel kind of flat and their *touching* moments not touching at all.However, I really liked the OST but that doesn't really make the anime that much better.Overall I think it would've been a better experience if it was one of my first romance anime but that's sadly not the case..

That\'s why shows like Lovely Complex or Kimi ni Todoke succeed despite not necessarily doing anything to re-invent the wheel, so to speak. On that note, I ask 3 simple questions. Is the protagonist likable? Is the main love interest likable? Is their chemistry good? In the case of this particular show, it\'s a resounding 0 for 3.Let\'s start with the main character, Shizuku. She likes to study...and is generally cold to others around her. Not off to a great start. But what\'s worse is how much the author attempted to make the connection between the two. As if it is literally impossible to take school seriously and be a decent human being. It was honestly borderline insulting. And as far as development, don\'t get your hopes up. Overall, just a really, really poor main character.Moving on to the main love interest, Haru. Aka the ""monster"" in the title. He is wild delinquent, and apparently that characteristic was supposed to explain away all his abhorrent behavior. He inexplicably falls in love with our charmless protagonist and things go from bad to worse for his character. A brief overview of some of his actions to follow: he essentially threatens to sexually assault Shizuku, aggressively stalks her, gets violently jealous anytime a guy as much as talks to her, gets into fights because of this, accidentally punches her and draws blood twice, and in one instance when he\'s in the dog house licks her hand when she is handing him something. Really think about that last one. Another human being, whom do not want licking your hand, suddenly doing so out of the blue. *shudders* But, like Shizuku, this is all sort of shrugged off, like it\'s just ""Haru being Haru, what a goofball"". And again, if you\'re wondering about development, don\'t get your hopes up. Overall, maybe the worst love interest I\'ve come across in the genre.But you might be thinking, hey, maybe they\'re not super likable, but they could be cute together. Noooope. Individually they\'re pretty awful, and yet they somehow find a way to come together to make something even worse. None of their interactions are the least bit endearing or natural. Do you know that ""aww"" feeling you get watching a cute anime couple? Whatever the opposite of ""aww"" is, that would described this couple. My ideal fanfiction for this series would be for one of them to move to the other side of the planet and never see the other again. But for now, I\'ll just be satisfied knowing they have yet to invade our screens for a 2nd season.At this point you might be asking why I devoted so much time to talking about the main couple. And the answer to that is there just isn\'t much else going on. Haru\'s brother showed up at one point to try to get him to return home and one of Shizuku\'s friends had a crush on Haru\'s older cousin, but neither of those story-lines went anywhere interesting. So, like I said at the beginning, the whole anime basically hinged on the main couple.But as far as the art and sound go, they were both solid. The OP was quite catchy and colorful in particular. I don\'t really have any strong thoughts on the VA\'s performances, but they were at least adequate. The character designs were pleasant to look at, but maybe not memorable.Overall: 4/10tl;dr: awful, awful, awful main couple turn what would\'ve been an average high school romcom into the worst shoujo I\'ve had the displeasure of watching. and is generally cold to others around her.

My little monster, the story seemed like any other cliché we see in shoujo, the solitary girl, the nerd that pick the interest of a certain boy, well, it's close to it. This time, we get a solitary girl that care for nothing but her studies and get a great job to  live up to her mother expectations, and on the other hand a turbulent, very naive boy that get easily in trouble and looks for friends. Two people really different that meet and fall in love...so far, not really...different to other shoujo right\xa0? Well, no\xa0!First of all, the two main characters don't beat around the bush about their relationship, being naive and romantically challenged with no experience, one single skip-beat and stare is enough to confess, but what I loved about this shoujo was how they approached love in the way it really is\xa0: complicated. Sometimes, we can mistake love with compassion and safety and relief, the feeling you get when people ignore you or leave you aside because of fear and when the one person that accept you become you anchor.  Sure Haru is straight with is feeling, so is Shizuku, but as they learn more about each other they discover that feelings and love is much more complicated, and that sometimes love isn't just love. Between jealousy and envy, fear of loss and being ignored, plus the involvement of rivals, they went through the bad and the good parts of being in a relationship and learn what love really means. They give to each others, their tiny world extend and they're getting closer, accepting each other in a total honesty, and that's love, and it's not easy to reach, this total faith in the other...that's how this manga/anime evolve, not just between a one-sided love that beat around the bush to finally after the umpteenth chapter become mutual.Overall, it was a very refreshing anime/manga until the very end, far from the old cliche that I've seen and read so far...pretty enjoyable. different to other shoujo right\xa0?

A bowl full of potential poured down the drain. A group of characters who would be interesting to watch in many kinds os stories, if well developed, but it wasn\'t the case here.First of all I\'m letting Oshima the class rep out of this because she entered the story late, didn\'t do anything useful and then left, even if Shizuku narrated in the first episode that she had ""a lot to talk about her"".Out of the main 5 characters, Sasayan is by far the least developed. As being part of the group, he is expected to have a role...in the story, but it just passes around him. He\'s a friendly baseball player, and that\'s it.Only 4 characters had some kind of arc, and Yamaken surprised me. I first thought he would be just a douchebag antagonist, but his view of the world changing when he fell in love with Shizuku was the most interesting thing in the later episodes. He doesn\'t stop acting like a sociopath, though. The only result of these changes is being the third-wheel of the main couple, but for some reason he just gives up in the end.The main guy, Haru, has a rough backstory with his brother, father and deceased aunt. That influenced him to be the way he is with Shizuku, but what about the ""evil brother\'s evil plan""? Forgotten, just like Yuzan, who vanishes after his third appearance. He\'s a great guy, though, and deserved someone way better than Shizuku, but the plot dragged his one-sided crush for too long and never did something with it.As for Shizuku, the protagonist, I\'ve got to say she changed A LOT. She was cold, emotionless, felt no remorse regards anything and only cared about her studies. She stopped being like that, experienced new sensations, and found a new way of living in general... in the first 3 episodes. All of it is discarded. She comes back to study, being like a robot for the rest of the season. Sometimes she goes out to do something else, only when the story forces her to do so (like when a friend is in serious trouble).A lot happens to imply that she is changing her way of being, like the conversation she had with Yamaken at the library. But what exactly changes? In every episode, she has a ""Yeah it would be fun to date Haru"" moment, and then she goes back to being a study-slave.Damn, even in vacation she doesn\'t stop solving math problems. And what is the reason why she is so obsessed with being the best one in school? What are her motivations? We never know. Same with her brief family introduction.And the most wronged character, the bookmark girl Natsume, the main reason I started watched this show. Having a cheerful, best girl personality, you are expected to like her, and I did. But her story is like a car who loses its track, crashes into a gas tank and explodes.We see her as a cute girl who is excluded from society and doesn\'t have any friends in real life. Her main goals is to be friends with Shizuku and Haru and having them be together. In the mid-season she falls for Min, Haru\'s cousin, and tries to show him her feelings. When she does this in new years party, all she gets is a silent rejection and a depressing, solitary walk home. This could be where Sasayan might be handful, but he decides to leave her suffering alone.And what was the point of her story? Like most of the other ones\', it has no conclusion, just suffering after suffering without any changes.What to say about the last episode? Horrifying. After Nagoya went missing and most of the characters met again, I thought it would be a chance for something to happen. But nothing actually happens. Yamaken has a chance to make a move but he just leaves. His last encounter with Shizuku on the streets, such as all the characters\' meeting, was meaningless.The last scene with the stagnated main couple was also awful, and makes you think that they\'re now worse than when they started. Natsume doesn\'t getting a talk with her crush\'s unfinished business and being bullied by some pervs for the rest of the episode, just to end the season walking back with Sasayan after a pointless search, was by far the worst thing to see.Don\'t get me wrong, this anime is not a very bad one. It\'s just meaningless, the characters have no actual development and their stories are pointless.Overall, I think the protagonist is a self insert of someone with no personality and Haru is put here as the dream guy who will love her and be submissive to her no matter how bad she mistreats him. I enjoyed some scenes of the anime and some of it was funny, but I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone. in the story, but it just passes around him.

I enjoyed some scenes of the anime and some of it was funny, but I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone.', ""The series had a lot of potential...it had a good start...if it wasn't for the ending i would have give it 9/10...i am so dissapointed after watching the ending... i guess i'll continue with the manga...!i loved the plot they created...the main protagonist of the series Haru had a type of character that i wanted see and made me more interested in watching it....they should have revealed Haru's past,coz i badly wanted to know why he was so violent and so lonely,which thing led him to this,about his father and of course his brother yuuzan.Yuuzan seemed to hate Haru and he would always hide his...real character there maybe an history between them.It seemed that the story between sasayaan and natsume was trying to reach an conclusion...i guess sasayan is in love with natsume...it could've reached that part...But i loved the love chemistry of Haru and shizuku.Had a lot of expectations,but i have to admit it led me to dissapointment :) real character there maybe an history between them.It seemed that the story between sasayaan and natsume was trying to reach an conclusion...i guess sasayan is in love with natsume...it could've reached that part...But i loved the love chemistry of Haru and shizuku.Had a lot of expectations,but i have to admit it led me to dissapointment :)"", 'My Little Monster is a typical ""Will they, won\'t they"" show about two polar opposite.  The main characters are Shizuku, a social shut-in who is obsessed with studying, and Haru, a juvenile delinquent who was suspended on the first day (and this isn\'t the first time either).I am a sucker for slice life anime that have a story surrounding romance.  I saw a few snippets of the show in a YouTube video and the art style jumped out at me as very visually appealing.  The little details I got about the series made me want to watch more and so I...decided to give the show a shot.I want to start off by saying My Little Monster is a decent show.  I really loved the color palettes for both the characters and the backgrounds.  The voice acting is pretty solid and the soundtrack if pretty moving.  It also has some legitimately funny moments in the show and as Japanese comedy typically doesn\'t translate into laughs for me, that\'s an accomplishment.  The side characters are also not merely window dressing.  Moreover, while all the characters exemplify some pretty well worn tropes (the completely socially muted, the pretty girl without friends, the vanilla best friend, the rich-attractive rival), they also give a fair bit of depth so that no one is too stereotypical among the main cast.What the series suffers from is both bad pacing and too few episodes to accomplish its narrative, which is ultimately why I can\'t give this show anything over a ""Good"" rating.  The story goes back and forth with the two characters confessing for their feels, with the other having swung the other way and being unsure/confused.  It felt like a see-saw that when finally the other parties feel like reciprocating the emotion, the other one is at the opposite end of feelings. And perhaps that is what the series is going for, that these two people, for as much as they go back and forth really do like the status quo of the not-quite-dating relationship. If that\'s the case, its very well-done but it also is a bit unsatisfying.While I also do like that we have two character archetypes as the main love birds and both are socially absent minded for different reasons, there are points where I have to try and struggle to remember why these two actually like each other.  In fact, although I am not one of these ""best girl/best guy"" proponents, the romantic rival vying for Shizuku\'s affections seems like a much better fit and indeed person than Haru.Going back to the series length, there simply isn\'t enough to have a complete narrative.  Shizuku is obsessed with studying but there is no real great explanation for why she has sacrificed nearly all social relations for this goal.  We never find out what really is driving this compulsive need to the best.   With Haru it is hinted that he has a pretty traumatic past but we only gets very brief glimpses in it, and certainly not enough to understand his terror at his brother.  And the final episode...There are no spoilers to say that it literally resolves nothing.  If anything, it could be compared to the infamous filler episodes in shonen in that it does really nothing to advance the plot and just involves some crazy hijinks involving Haru, a rooster and a lightning bug.If you enjoyed My Little Monster, which again I have to say I did, I\'d recommend watching Tora Dora, which does a much better job with the opposites-attract motif. The premise is a lot more interesting, the narrative is much better developed and you legitimately root for two to get together. decided to give the show a shot.I want to start off by saying My Little Monster is a decent show.

It also would have been nice to see some more character development from all of the characters. For the majority of the series, the characters are pretty much the same as when they started. TNKK had a lot of potential for being a really interesting story and had a variety of really entertaining characters but it definitely lost its momentum near the end of the series.In my opinion the ending was unsatisfying and leaves a lot of crucial questions unanswered....I don't mind ambiguous endings for series but this one was a bit much for me I don't mind ambiguous endings for series but this one was a bit much for me"", 'Very cute anime with good progression in each episode! Watching the first episode will definitely grasp your attention immediately. The first episode is one of the quickest progressions in any anime I\'ve seen. A liking of someone, a confession and a kiss all in the first episode! The main element of this anime is it\'s comedy as well as the comical pairing up between a study bug and someone with no social cues nor social intelligence. They couldn\'t be any more different, but at the same time couldn\'t be any more similar in that they are both lonely.The main character Haru is very direct...with his feelings towards Shizuku. He is often misjudged for his actions but he is genuinely a kind and loving person. His love for Shizuku is extremely great. Shizuku on the other hand is forced to make a decision between her studies and her love for Haru. In this sense, it is quite relateable in the real world where people are often pressured into choosing one over the other. Shizuku, through her character development in the anime, slowly learns to discover that this is not necessarily the case.The anime explores how loneliness is a very depressing situation to be in through the characters of Haru, Shizuku and Natsume each for their very own reasons. Haru because of his erratic behaviour, Shizuku by choice and Natsume because of her superior kawai-ness to her fellow classmates, leading to her being singled out. Also Natsume is one of the most kawaii characters ever in the anime universe!An example of Haru\'s erratic nature is when he started a fight with a stranger telling them how ""gorillas could communicate with their eyes"" haha! Another funny thing with this anime is its unpredictability. When you think the characters take one step forward in their relationship, they go 2 steps backwards!The art is very beautiful. The piano soundtrack (especially the main one) is very beautiful and soothing. It really matches the scenes. Overall a very enjoyable anime!

At first sight, even though the art is poor, you even get a slight glimpse of emotion and you think ""maybe this will be cute"". You wish.As  the story continues, all we get are random situations that could inspire some character development and offer some insights on their background, but everything falls flat and those situations lead to nowhere really. I wanted to like this story, but TNKK kept working against that will.My biggest disappointment is the main couple. Shizuku is lifeless until the very end...of the story. Haru, however, is a whole new level of annoying. For starters, he behaves like a rip-off of Disney\'s Tarzan. And then he goes on to act in the most controlling ways such as trying to stop her from studying, beating random men on the streets for looking at her, ordering her to go straight home from the places she goes to, etc. Not to mention he keeps accidentally beating her. And pays no mind to that.Overall, it wasn\'t exactly painful to watch because I\'m really into this genre, but it got increasingly bothersome.

Even me, pretty much a newbie otaku, can see that. The anime basically ended at about 6 or 7 episodes, and the rest is filled with what i perceive as fillers.This story is about Yoshida Haru, a delinquent who is socially awkward and just wants to have friends, and Mizutani Shizuku, a cold, apathetic girl who only cares about grades and studying. At first, its really interesting, because rather than the usual, 'I hate him, but slowly i love him, but i...can't tell him how i feel because i don't want to ruin everything' cliche in romance, Yoshida basically already confessed and kissed the heroine at the first episode. They're both such an interesting characters in a romance anime because of how honest they are with each other, rather than the usual hiding the feelings things. This is the downfall, because basically, in about 7 episodes, both of the main characters already confessed both of their feelings to each other, and after that the anime ran out of content and just shows the side characters romance, and the rivals trying to steal them.For me, the anime can do much better in the story department. As the anime ends in season 13, there's still many questions that haven't been answered, and events that should've been happened, but instead, they make the last 3 or 4 episodes to be pretty much a filler. As example, we pretty much still doesn't know anything about Yoshida's family and Yuzan, it feels like after the Yuzan Arc ends, they all just forgot about him. There's also the thing about the romance between the side characters, between Natsume, Sasahara, and Mi-chan. They pretty much just ended it in cliffhanger. It feels like they're trying to squeeze as many content and Arc in 13 Episodes, but pretty much never finished each of them, making it feels like its just a filler, if you know what i mean. Also, we didn't even get a date/picnic scene that should've been happened in Episodes 13, but instead, they decided to make it another filler. The story could've been great if they just focused on finishing one or two arcs, rather than squeeze as much Arc as possible. It should've been about Haru and Shizuku from Episode 1 through 13. can't tell him how i feel because i don't want to ruin everything' cliche in romance, Yoshida basically already confessed and kissed the heroine at the first episode.

It wasn't totally unique, but I can say that I've never seen anything quite like it. I guess let's start with the art and sound. The art style is sort of sketchy, at least in its environmental elements. The colors were very saturated, so it did make many of the scenes quite beautiful, but I think overall, the art style was simplistic. That isn't a bad thing, though. The sound was average. That's all.Okay, the story. It was kind of nonexistent. There was an element of storytelling happening with the two...main characters since they had a romance going on, but other than that, the plot didn't have all that much direction. I'm not saying that's a negative, but this isn't an anime you can come to for a good story. It's just an anime where you'll hang out with the characters until it ends.Speaking of the characters, they're probably simultaneously the best and worst parts of this anime. On the slightly negative side, they weren't consistent characters at all. Their motivations and feelings changed at the drop of a hat, so it made it difficult to keep up with each character and who they were. On the other hand, they were also all very entertaining. There was enough character development and backstory in this anime to keep me interested in them and coming back for more.What would I do to make this anime better? I really don't know because the charm of it might be lost should it become more consistent, but at the same time, it isn't as good as it could've been. I think that maybe the characters' stories were book-ended too soon. It felt like the anime left them in the middle of their development, so that was sort of disappointing. I don't know if I'd recommend this anime to anyone, but it was interesting for the duration that I watched it for. Do with that what you will, and if you do decide to watch it, be prepared for a whole lot of weird. main characters since they had a romance going on, but other than that, the plot didn't have all that much direction.

Overall, it's decent enough.  The relationships that the characters share are cute, and it isn't as boring as some other slice of life animes I've watched.  To put it simply, this anime isn't the best but it isn't the worst either.  The lack of communication that the two love interests shared kinda annoyed me, and the romance was a bit rushed, but rewatching this anime was...a nice experience.

It would\'ve been better if there were a second season. The story overall seemed very promising at first, yes, it\'s one of those teenage high school love stories but seeing it started off with an unconventional approach, it kept me engaged and eager to commit to it. HOWEVER, my biggest qualm is that (spoiler alert) one of the most interesting side plots about Natsume and Mi-chan-san was completely unresolved, the ending was very lacklustre. I had hoped...there would be at least some sort of acknowledgement from Mi-chan-san about Natsume seeing the connection between them was mildly hinted throughout the episodes, but when it ends with nothing, it makes me wonder if all the subtlety laid path between the two was necessary.It\'s a shame because aside from the ending, the overall quality of the anime is quite good. I like the art style and all the character designs; the VA for Shizuku did a great job, and for all the animes that work with the standard formula of including pets to add appeals, having a rooster instead of a cutesy neko or puppy is quite unconventional. It wouldn\'t be a title that I\'d recommend to people who want to watch a high school romance (as opposed to ""Ao Haru Ride"" or ""Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou"" if you are looking for this genre, highly recommended), but it does merit a 7 star at least. there would be at least some sort of acknowledgement from Mi-chan-san about Natsume seeing the connection between them was mildly hinted throughout the episodes, but when it ends with nothing, it makes me wonder if all the subtlety laid path between the two was necessary.It\'s a shame because aside from the ending, the overall quality of the anime is quite good.

But as I jumped from one episode to another, I didn't see any development between the Main and the side characters. And not to mention Haru (especially), I noticed something with his behavior from the very start but didn't pay much attention to it thinking that the series would probably address and focus on this issue. Was it too...much to handle? I guess I was wrong and expected too much.There was too much red flags, unnecessary events (considering its numbers of episodes), little to no character development, and potentially interesting yet colourless side characters.

The story itself doesn't follow general shoujo cliches and the characters each have their own individual quirk, both of which are the ingredients to a good show. I'd say even though episodes are around 24 minutes they're very dense in terms of plot. However,the story is really brought down by the frequent and casual sexism as well as alludes to domestic violence right off the bat which caught me completely by surprise. I think this show had all the makings of a good anime but failed to utilize the characters fully without taking it too far. There are...definitely parts of it that are easy to enjoy but the issues can make it hard to bare. definitely parts of it that are easy to enjoy but the issues can make it hard to bare."", ""In all honesty my little monster is much short of becoming a masterpiece, it lacks a lot of the pieces to make it memorable or anywhere near a classic. However, it has some aspects in which I can really love especially after watching and reading plenty of romance manga and anime.The school setting is super overused, for obvious reasons, this however seems to be the only plausible setting for a story like this because of the unlikely connection made between the two characters. At points I love them both to death or I hate some parts of them but it feels like it makes them...more and more human with all the different scenarios they're put in.The story really does drive me to death sometimes, a lot of it can be seen as repetitive due to the nature of the show and how they fall in and out of love so easily and so often.

He's pretty irrelevant. Shizuku is...boring, bland, heartless, sometimes courageous, and overall unlikable. While the show does explain why these two would fall in love with one another, it doesnt make its main girl likeable or shit even interesting! I've survived this romance through Haru.

Not much else to say except I just love watching them.Art/Animation:Animation is above average due to the characters not being too complicated. But obviously no where near as good as toradora's animation.Art is a little dif than what Im used to which is nice. Shizuku's character design is ridiculously bland and I think they made her too much of a loser! Does it really make sense to have her dress like an old lady, have her friends point it out and then have her be embarrased about it? It would fit her character if she says I dont give a shit!

It gave me huge Horimiya vibes but unlike Horimiya, My Little Monster is inferior in terms of characters, comedy, and overall writing but it’s still a decent show.It’s one of those “Will they, won’t they” stories where at multiple points in the story the main “couple” aren’t on the same page in terms of their relationship and feelings because of something the other said and/or did, which causes a gap between the two that they must overcome just to create another one not to far into the future, which could...be pretty annoying.

He’s the bro that’s just there to let everyone know how Haru has changed.My biggest gripe with My Little Monster is that a lot of things go nowhere and as a result the final episode while very wholesome, isn’t satisfying and I can easily see a lot of people being left angry, frustrated or disappointed.  Haru’s whole beef with his brother and father was very interesting but is dropped off the face of the planet mid way through the series and never elaborated on, which sucks cause it could of done so much more for the story.

The first episode I thought provided the grasp of the show. Whatever happened in the beginning should have happened at the end. It started off fast-paced, then slowed down drastically. There was very little to no character development (especially at the end and the fact that the girl had trouble with decision making for once), and even most of the designs were average looking.A person cannot love someone instantly from one interaction or it does not mean he or she is in love because someone gives him or her more attention than anyone...else.Overall, this anime was mostly filled with boring plot and backwards progression.

That, for 13 episodes.The animation is fine for what it is, when it\'s present, but most scenes are dialogue filled or monologues/flashbacks. I liked the way characters were drawn, even if they didn\'t really seem unique their plain look suited the tone of someone trying to be serious when they\'re surrounded by people who have their quirks turned up to 11.The side characters are there to either support the main characters with exposition, or to form love triangles so there\'s a sense of conflict outside of the relationship between the main characters.

This means that the story seems to just cut off with a bunch of loose ends, which, technically it does.The manga continues afterwards and is what I would suggest that you read in the first place, as the flow is not interrupted and the style of the manga can be gotten used to at the start...of the story, rather than mid-way through.Watch the anime if you want a quick introduction to the series before reading the manga or if you've already read part or all of the manga to see what the story would look like animated. of the story, rather than mid-way through.Watch the anime if you want a quick introduction to the series before reading the manga or if you've already read part or all of the manga to see what the story would look like animated."", ""The reason I watched this anime was because of some small clips, but mostly because it was a romance anime.Story: The story is set place in high school. There one student whose name is Shizuku. She usually too herself and all about studying and pretty much to the point / cold person. Her life started to change when she meets another student named Haru. He is a violent person that end up fighting people. They meet up when the teacher ask Shizuku to give some homework to Haru. Haru first hated Shizuku because he thought she was from the school, but after that he wanted...to become friends and started to treat her as a friend. Shizuku confused by Haru weird interaction learn that Haru doesn't have any friend. So the story focus on these two where one become less cold and the other person become more capable and non violet type person.Rating time:Plot: The plot progression was slow. The main focus of this anime seemed more slice of life then it was romance. The pacing was a little weird and when they needed to fill in back story they put it near the end it seemed. I give this  a 6/10Animation: The animation was alright, quirky here and there. I didn't have anything bad to say about it. It wasn't ecchi so it not like they would be putting in 100%. 7/10.Sound: I watched the anime in Japanese dub. The sound was fine, the voice acting was interesting choice but I liked it. The music was not annoying. I give it a 7/10Characters: The character concept was interesting. I like the idea of basically two character that were not really popular trying to get together kind of thing. And some of the friends that came along with them were also not very popular at all. Most of the time it was people that were not very liked or had friends. So for introduction it was good. The development of the character was interesting, but sometimes it felt like they restarted their progress and that got a little annoying. You don't really find out about 2 other character development. They develop but didn't finish. I think they needed more to flush out the character more, but still not bad. 7.5-8 / 10Overall with bias: After watching it all and giving my individual rating I would give it a 7 out of 10. I enjoyed the anime and the character were interesting, but nothing amazing.Recommendation: Tough one. I think it popular anime and some people might enjoy it more than I would. I would recommend researching and looking at clips from episode one and see if you would like it. So I would say maybe lol. to become friends and started to treat her as a friend. Shizuku confused by Haru weird interaction learn that Haru doesn't have any friend. So the story focus on these two where one become less cold and the other person become more capable and non violet type person.Rating time:Plot: The plot progression was slow. The main focus of this anime seemed more slice of life then it was romance. The pacing was a little weird and when they needed to fill in back story they put it near the end it seemed. I give this  a 6/10Animation: The animation was alright, quirky here and there. I didn't have anything bad to say about it. It wasn't ecchi so it not like they would be putting in 100%. 7/10.Sound: I watched the anime in Japanese dub. The sound was fine, the voice acting was interesting choice but I liked it. The music was not annoying. I give it a 7/10Characters: The character concept was interesting. I like the idea of basically two character that were not really popular trying to get together kind of thing. And some of the friends that came along with them were also not very popular at all. Most of the time it was people that were not very liked or had friends. So for introduction it was good.

A school themed rom-com that can makes me laugh and watched it again and again. Why? Because the characters in this anime is very interesting. Each of them has their own distinc trait, and because of that kind of thing, i laugh really hard when i first thought that haru is a (your common) delinquent, turns out to be a cheerful and honest person.Honestly, i think i won't feel enough with just 13 episode "", ""I've noticed how all my favourite romantic shoujo comedies were made around 2008 and I haven't any particularly good ones since then and it's quite a disappointment. But anime is exactly what a rom-com should be like. A truly great way to start bringing back shoujo animes. Not to mention that I absolutely love the characters.I've noticed how extremely similar it is to kimi no todoke (another really good anime) The story, luckily, has no long boring dramatic background to it but still puts in informations on the male characters past. I just wish there would be more episodes. :( "", 'I loved this anime at first sight. Not only was the name interesting, the OP and the characters were also very interesting. Shizuku has actually encouraged me to study harder. This is a great romance-comedy between two teens. GREAT ANIME ', ""it's not the same as every other anime of the same genre, the story slowly grips you and it doesn't matter if your a fan of romance/comedy...it will get to younot a must watch but a pretty good one, i'm enjoying it "", ""The story revolves around a genius girl (Mizutani, Shizuku)who knows nothing but studying and never in her life had any friends until she met this guy (Yoshida, Haru) who's a war freak and never goes to school.The supporting characters are likable too! One is this girl (Natsume, Asako) who has an issue with guys and has many friends only in online communities. Second is a guy (Sasahara, Souhei) who likes playing baseball and a former classmate of the leading guy character. Third is a girl (Ooshima, Chizuru) or a class representative though never really had any friends in her class (like the other characters...too!). Fourth is a guy (Yamaguchi, Kenji) who's studying in a different school but a former classmate of the leading guy character too and had made friends with the other characters i mentioned. Lastly (i cant mention all of the supporting characters! gomen!), is this guy/girl/thing (Nagoya) that is loved by everyone!!!The art was very simple but very detailed. I actually like those flashy characters and animation and even doubted watching this. But i guess judging a book by its cover really is wrong. The anime itself really has a comical and romantic story!All of the characters' voices fit their own personalities so i give it a thumbs up!Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is like any other romance, school life and comedy anime.

(What makes it unique? See it for yourself! :)"", 'Within the first few minutes of the show, I felt bombarded with clear signals of mental instability within almost every main character. I immediately started getting annoyed, thinking that my decision to watch a seemingly corny high school anime as an adult was going to be as bad a decision as I had warned myself it would be (I genuinely mean no offense by that whatsoever! Just a joke!). I thought, ""Oh great, it\'s going to be another unhealthy romance all dolled up to make it look like stalking is cute."" But.... as I kept on going (because there was just something about this relationship...that I needed know) I started to realize that that was the theme. It was supposed to be about those kids - the ones who were a little off, or didn\'t seem to have any friends. Among all other shows I\'ve seen, this one (imo) did the most accurate job at successfully creating an anime for the outcasts. It\'s about feeling normal for once amongst a sea of people who think you\'re not.These kids are all so lonely, so awkward, so goofy, socially unacceptable (whether for good or bad reasons) that it had me thinking about my own judgements on others, and especially about myself. What was really wrong with these kids? Why were they not accepted? They have the same worries and fears as the others. Once they find each other, we start to see them learn the same lessons as their peers, only they seem to be more aware of the fact that they\'re experiencing something simple (such as happiness, jealousy, and friendship). In other words: they\'re growing up. And because of the fact that they\'re a little late to the party, they\'re perceptive enough to notice what\'s happening. It\'s both comical and a little sad.In their own clumsy way, the main characters stumble through lessons of love, friendship, growing up, and some important life lessons. It\'s absolutely adorable, completely relatable, and it\'s quite funny.Another majorly refreshing plus is the fact that the main female, despite the main dude\'s attempts to control her actions, remains a strong and independent individual. Instead of the average anime girl who falls head over heels for the bad boy and would do anything he asks without question, Shizuku tells Haru straight-up that he has no right to tell her what to do. I love it!And I know, I\'m totally over-thinking this... but I just felt something so deep in watching this anime. If you have ever felt like you were not accepted, or like friendship could never be possible for you, I can almost guarantee you will find something relatable in here. Whenever I think about my own social awkwardnesses I just tell myself, ""Haru would be my friend"" :3 I just want to stress that this isn\'t your average romance story. It\'s about being a little bit weird (or, in some cases *coughHarucough* a lot a bit weird), and figuring that out yourself, and then learning that it\'s ok. That\'s what I like most about it. They don\'t look at Haru\'s violent outbursts as normal. They know it\'s wrong, he knows it\'s wrong, but they recognize the fear in him and stand together and help each other out. It truly is about friendship and getting to know those friends. The fact that there\'s a cute romance story on top is just an added bonus!I just wish they had focused more on the oddities of each person, and put more of an emphasis on those little details that make them so relatable to those of us who have gone through similar things. This is really the only reason I don\'t give it a 10/10.All in all, I absolutely adore it.Note: I watched before I read that I needed know) I started to realize that that was the theme.

This is really the only reason I don\'t give it a 10/10.All in all, I absolutely adore it.Note: I watched before I read', ""Honestly, this was one of my most recommended shoujo animes. The storyline/plot is rather simple , yet really tugs at the heartstrings and makes you want to experience a pure love story like Shizuku's and Haru's . In addition , the characters' personalities and individuality  are not anything miraculous nor original . Yet the character development and human interaction is spectacular. It's neither a masterpiece nor magnum opus but to summarize : Tonari no Kaibutsu Kun is simply beautiful , and worth watching . "", 'If I had to describe Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, I would say: ""Haru sad. Haru smash! And that chicken looks delicious."" To put it frankly, there\'s not much else to this anime.Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun is an interesting anime in that it\'s not the typical shoujo template where the female MC is overly insecure and seems to be head-over-heels for the dreamy male MC. However, this does not cover for the fact that there is no strong storyline.The basic story is about Shizuku, a high achieving and studious high school girl who lacks some sort of companionship. One day at school, she is randomly asked to...look after a particularly violent individual by the name of Haru. Typical to a shoujo plot, Haru feels comfortable around Shizuku and his violent tendencies seem to subside, though he still has his violent outbursts. As a result of being around him, Shizuku learns that Haru can be a caring guy. This is where the ""plot"" takes off. While Haru is determined to win Shizuku\'s heart, she is unsure of her own feelings for Haru. That\'s pretty much it. The main pitfall of the anime is that there are a few interesting arcs but the characters do not develop as a result of those experiences. In other words, the stories just fizzled away.Due to the fact that Shizuku is sorting out her own feelings, there is not much romance happening in the anime. I do have to say that I got excited in the beginning of the anime for the romance but as the story dragged along, there was no progression in the romance. The drama does pick up near the end of the anime but like the other parts of the show, it just fizzled away. By the last episode, I felt that the main characters made no progress in their relationship.The comedy in Kaibutsu-kun is okay at best. There were moments that I chuckled but I did not find myself rolling around laughing at any time. Most of the comedic elements stem from Haru\'s childish actions and Shizuku\'s nerdy behaviour. There are a group of side characters who provide some comic relief but Haru\'s and Shizuku\'s comedy moments are better.Most of my praise for this anime would be for Shizuku. She has her insecurities but unlike other shoujo anime, she is not lovey-dovey for the good-looking male lead Haru. She knows her priorities and is not afraid to give others a piece of her mind. If I had to compare her to another shoujo female character, I would say she is the introvert version of Misaki from Kaichou wa Maid-sama!. Unarguably, Shizuku has the most character development in the anime.Haru is like a violent man-child, though when he does some introspection, he slips into his more mature self. His redeeming trait is that he is not afraid to show his affection for Shizuku. Nevertheless, I particularly did not like his violent tendencies as most of them were unwarranted. Further, the writers failed to provide a substantial story as to why he is such a violent person. Maybe then I would be able to sympathize with his actions. Until then, I did not find Haru as a very likable character.Out of the relatively large cast of side characters, Natsume and Yamaguchi stand out the most. Natsume has her own little anxiety to deal with and personal attraction to sort out. Yamaguchi\'s arc was the more interesting story in the anime as it brought some romantic spice to the show.Kaibutusu-kun\'s art is good. The characters were nicely outlined which seemed to make them pop out of the screen. I also liked the vibrant colour palette. I would have preferred that Shizuku sport a long-hair look rather than the double ponytail. It would have made her 10x cuter. The animation was also good. The OST was forgettable. It was not particularly outstanding but not by any means annoying. The OP felt like the intro to a game show in a way, which was pretty funny.Overall, this anime seems good for anyone who wishes to relax and not have to think about the characters or thematic elements. For romance fans, this anime is definitely not for you as you will be left disappointed. This may be a popular anime but I would only recommend Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun only if you have nothing else better to watch.Since I have a dissenting opinion, I would love to hear the other side to this anime!

She doesn't grow and her claims of him building up her hopes.. is  what she does with him.  Her character is really well handled but she doesn't grow or expand her destructive world view.

If it wasn't just a bad sub its unneeded and just makes you start on the wrong footing with the character.This anime has its fun moments.

I was so hooked on the romance up until like the 6th episode when they both confessed their feelings only to be at two different viewpoints. It was so close.

I felt bad for...Kenji, I must admit that deep down I wanted to see something between him and Shizuku, but I know it wouldn't make any sense for the story and it's just the voices in my head obsessing over blondes and rejected men.Art: Well, I didn't see anything much in the art itself, but it attracted me, it's nice, I think nothing more.Characters: I really liked most of the characters, both Shizuko and Haru, including, Haru was methodologically designed to break the hearts of little girls, and he make this role easily, I melt all over with his jerky way. I found the two friends, Asako and Souhei, very entertaining too, Asako much more so because she is clearly more exploited, while Souhei stays in the same superficial style throughout the anime. And about the rivals, they both suit me very well, and I find it difficult to be angry with them, even with their roles (I even think I have a crush on Kenji).Enjoyment: I had a lot of fun watching it, it was one of those anime that leaves me with butterflies in my stomach and with sadness at the end of the episodes, definitely your manga was added to my list, because I need an ending.~Nine<3 Kenji, I must admit that deep down I wanted to see something between him and Shizuku, but I know it wouldn't make any sense for the story and it's just the voices in my head obsessing over blondes and rejected men.Art: Well, I didn't see anything much in the art itself, but it attracted me, it's nice, I think nothing more.Characters: I really liked most of the characters, both Shizuko and Haru, including, Haru was methodologically designed to break the hearts of little girls, and he make this role easily, I melt all over with his jerky way.

I went into this show with pretty standard and basic expectations; my expectations weren’t even met, I would say.STORY - 1My Little Monster seems to be an interesting concept in the beginning; a well-disciplined, studious girl (Shizuku) and a delinquent boy (Haru). You would probably wonder what kind of relationship or how a relationship would blossom between the two types, be it a little cliche.Instead, the 13 episodes are filled with constant back and forth of misunderstandings that, frankly, don’t even seem to make sense. The pining between the main characters is dragged...on throughout the whole show to make an illusion of plot that doesn’t exist. Haru immediately confesses his love for Shizuku within the /first episode/, despite them having just met. It feels extremely awkward and out of place, but there is still a bit of charm that makes the first two episodes have some potential. It is all quickly gone, however, by the third episode, when there is still no progress made despite both of the main characters confessing their love to each other.Shizuku actually tells Haru she loves him, only to get a response that made it seem as if he was still unsure about his feelings.. but there was no hint of this in the first two episodes? There was no conflict to even explain why he would be nervous about dating her despite genuinely believing he loves her.Even worse, multiple side characters are introduced, literally only to each have a crush on Haru and Shizuku respectively and to cause random, nothing conflict where nothing happens. Hell, Haru gets inexplicably defensive to Yamaken (one of the side characters) showing romantic interest in Shizuku, despite them /not even deciding to date, multiple times, for no reason/. Meaning, there is no right for Haru to feel that way. He even goes as far as to almost kill Yamaken by pushing him off the side of a building because he simply states he likes Shizuku.Character development is nonexistent, too. Any resemblance of a plot line, background, etc is never resolved. None of the many, many annoying love triangles are solved or even barely touched upon. Even when the main characters seemed slightly interesting, it is ruined by how one-dimensional they are throughout the rest of the series.ART - 3The first two episodes of this show were actually very, very beautifully animated. You can tell in certain frames they really tried too and it is nice to look at.. until you get to the third episode. The animation and art both drop so badly that it’s impossible to not notice, and personally, has a huge effect on the viewing experience.SOUND - 2Every music in the show becomes extremely irritating to hear by the last couple of episodes. There is nothing special about it.ENJOYMENT - 1Getting through this show felt like the worst drag I’ve ever felt watching an anime. It is genuinely the first show I’ve ever rated at such a low rating, but I have nothing to make me change my mind. I wanted to stop watching in the middle, but my boyfriend convinced me to keep going because he enjoyed it. Of course, by the end, he was completely on my side. The ending of the show simply put the nail in the coffin, making it concrete how within the 13 episodes, nothing had happened to make me believe that the last episode felt climatic, even in the slightest.Overall, this show was so bad, I wish that I never wasted time on it. I would not recommend this show, especially for a romance. Watch Toradora or Chunbiyou instead on throughout the whole show to make an illusion of plot that doesn’t exist.

Watch Toradora or Chunbiyou instead', ""The only anime I've ever dropped (as of August 22')This was unbearable to watch, I despise my little monster so much istg, first of all the good things about this showThe art is pretty good, and the animation is above average cookie cutter generic Isekai anime so I can give it praise for that.The first 4 episodes are very good, you might even be tricked into thinking that this show has some charm or promise to it, but of course like all anime at this point the second half is so shit that I had to drop it.Now I thought there'd be a side plot...about the romance of the 2 side characters, but I didn't see any of that, and that's the tip of the iceberg for how shit kaibutsu Kun isMizutani is one of my least favorite characters ever, anytime that bitch is on screen I wanna strangle her so much, even though it's a shoujo show, which is meant for girls to self insert, idk a single person who'd willingly choose to be like Mizutani.It's also so fucking dragged out for no reason, in a time where horimiya exists you cannot be putting these fake confessions that go no where and expect anyone to be entertainedOverall 4/10 don't bother watching it's a literal waste of time, if you want something kinda similar I'd say just watch horimiya, and if you want something moderately long in this genre check out OreGairu about the romance of the 2 side characters, but I didn't see any of that, and that's the tip of the iceberg for how shit kaibutsu Kun isMizutani is one of my least favorite characters ever, anytime that bitch is on screen I wanna strangle her so much, even though it's a shoujo show, which is meant for girls to self insert, idk a single person who'd willingly choose to be like Mizutani.It's also so fucking dragged out for no reason, in a time where horimiya exists you cannot be putting these fake confessions that go no where and expect anyone to be entertainedOverall 4/10 don't bother watching it's a literal waste of time, if you want something kinda similar I'd say just watch horimiya, and if you want something moderately long in this genre check out OreGairu"", 'There was so much potential.Interesting characters that could have grown so much by the end of the show, had they just organized their content better. As per usual, there is a lot of push and pull. Typically in an anime this should be distributed to about the first 1/3 or 1/2 of the show. This anime has it all throughout. By the end, it really feels like we\'re back to square one. The most character growth that happens is quite possibly in the first few episodes. This is unfortunate, given that there very well could have been consistent character growth with the well-written and...mature problems presented in the anime.They were very ambitious with their side characters. I understand that they are trying to be more authentic with the manga but given the length of the show it ended up hurting the experience more than heightening it. Had they had more time, or maybe distributed their content better throughout the show (for example getting rid of the scene where they go to the lake on the mountain for whatever reason. It literally added nothing to the story or the characters except ""oh look Haru\'s living life like an actual teen"", which was already exemplified prior to this episode. I can name about 3 other scenes like this that were fundamentally useless), they could have not only rounded out the main characters plotline, but also those of the side characters. This is also a huge disappointment because they have some veryyy interesting side characters that with a little more depth and more complete story lines would have really shone and might\'ve alleviated the main characters\' plot lines.So to sum up the negatives, it seems that in hopes of being similar to the mangas which they come from, many animes fall short when it comes to adapting the much lengthier and fuller manga into a 12-13 episode anime. They fail to properly go through with the full story arcs because of time constraints and they include useless scenes just because they appear in the manga. Unfortunately by the end of the show, all of this leads to a relatively disappointing and underwhelming end. No plot lines get resolved and the main characters almost regress back to their original states with no signs of improvement. The same goes for the side characters and their side stories. It\'s almost as if the show ended right in the middle.Overall, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun was fairly enjoyable to watch. It\'s slice of life style was a little bland and the comedy wasn\'t exactly top-knotch but it\'s cute and fairly simple. That being said, do not expect a resolution because there basically is none.

I'm glad I did.It's a different kind of show, with a different kind of romance. The leads prove that opposite do truly attract. The supporting cast was pretty good, and kept the show going in some of its flatter moments. Shizuku is a remarkable character, a strong female lead in anime (in a time where that was starting to become more commonplace). She is realistic when it comes to life: She does love Haru and enjoys her new friends, but her...schoolwork suffers for it. I enjoyed watching this show, it evoked a few laughs and was sweet in some of its best moments.Recommend to fans of romance. schoolwork suffers for it.

However, as the series progressed, it became less and less, until the end, when it just became bad. At the beginning I thought it was a really good series, because the main character with his desire for violence but still kind heart seemed quite interesting. The female main character was also cool, but didn't really stand out in my opinion compared to him.My big problem with the series are the side characters, the love affair of the main characters and the ending.The side characters are irrelevant and are 0% memorable. Whether they get...a relationship or not was not that important to me. Probably the biggest problem by far was the relationship between Haru and Shizuku. The constant changing of love interests for each other was just cruel. Moreover, I never once really felt love or thought to myself, but they make a cute couple. Shizuku always rejected him and pushed him back, while Haru just reacted stupidly. Let's not even talk about the ending... The action with the fireflies was quite cute, but there was just another implausible confession of love, but no kissing scene or anything else.I know the manga is much more advanced and that the anime wasn't that popular/hasn't sold well, but still, they could have at least made it a little better. a relationship or not was not that important to me.

Having rewatched the show now, I can see the charm a little clearer. I won\'t lie, it took me a while to get there. But this is *my* own interpretation of it and may not entirely be correct or in line with how the author wanted it to be interpreted.My Little Monster is a story about two very different people falling in love for the first time, in their first year of high school. Two people who\'ve grown up differently, have different values and ultimately will clash over something as complicated yet also...simple, as love. And they do. Multiple times. When I was first watching I couldn\'t believe the pacing of the show because it seemed so fast compared to other romance animes I\'ve watched.But here\'s the thing, the episodes we see don\'t seem to be the full picture. That\'s the only reasonable thing I can think of for why the pacing seems off. The anime isn\'t supposed to be about the development of them falling in love with each other, instead it\'s about them learning to work with each other, understand each other, all while being in love. It\'s messy, they go back and forth a lot, and feelings are hurt. There are so many miscommunications and problems that I don\'t blame people for rating it low.I chose NOT to see it that way though. If anything, I started to find it charming how Shizuku and Haru went back and forth and still stayed by each other\'s sides. The parallels between them were interesting. Shizuku, a girl who puts studies first and has no interest in developing personal relationships, whose family guided her to be that way. Haru, a guy who spent time off studying and easily gets top scores, puts Shizuku first, and loves the idea of having friends and developing personal relationships.In short, there\'s a lot to unpack. I could go on and on about the main couple but it\'s purely my take on them. Just like how Scum\'s Wish upset some people, I\'d put My Little Monster in the same category of having this sense of realism. Sometimes love is simple and people stumble through it together, with just the right amount of misunderstandings and fights and clashing. But other times, all the work needs to be done before a relationship even starts. Relationships aren\'t always simple just because people have feelings for each other. And this anime shows that. The importance of values, timing and emotional maturity play a part in how easy it is to work with another person.Aside from that, there\'s enough ""sweet"" moments to get some people by. I\'d recommend watching this just for the sake of getting a taste of a differently paced romance. It tackles different issues and has darker undertones at times. But I\'ll admit that I can\'t help but be a softie towards the kind of love that manages to get through the tough times and two people who work through it no matter how hard it gets. simple, as love.

Not even hand-holding, but how could they when the two main characters were basically never together?+ Comedy- It's listed in the genre, but I personally didn't find it funny even once....+ Characters- There are two main characters: Haru and Shizuku.- Haru falls in love with Shizuku because she brings him his homework and openly tells him that he has the wrong friends. But apparently, this is about a different kind of love than true love. His behavior is a complete disaster. He harasses, hits, and threatens Shizuku multiple times. The only positive is that Haru isn't interested in any other girl throughout the show and genuinely falls in love with Shizuku, developing romantic feelings.- Shizuku is cold, emotionless, and lacks empathy, so she has no friends. For her, only grades matter. As someone already mentioned, what's the problem with having a relationship and getting good grades at the same time? She is so arrogant that she has to be first in every exam, otherwise, her little world collapses. On one hand, she gives Haru hope, confesses her love to him, only to end it again. But Haru doesn't give up and fights for her until she admits again that she is in love, only to show zero interest until the end of the series.- I prefer not to write about the side characters, as they were hardly interesting and only served as a means to an end for the two failed main characters.+ Music- It was okay but nothing special.+ Animation and Character Design- I found it positive and fitting for the series.Conclusion, and I'm being nice here.

Shizuku from what I remember was similar to Hachiman from Oregairu which is the cold and blunt attitude which I liked. Their were two inaccuracies about the anime in particular. The writing for Oshima and the love triangle between her, Shizuku, and Haru was obnoxious. The second critique I have is that I feel like Haru barely had character development as oppose to his love interest, Shizuku. He’s still the troublemaker brat and it imposes a toxic relationship between the two. Obviously in the manga he gets better but from the anime alone it was...disappointing not seeing Haru grow out of his troublemaker attitude. All in all a solid rom com disappointing not seeing Haru grow out of his troublemaker attitude. All in all a solid rom com', ""❝I'm just gonna watch this 'cuz I don't know what else to watch.❞ *cries* And is it a cry of sadness? Let's find out.Art - 7/10 It's okay, a little bland and your typical early 2010's anime artstyle but it's cute. I prefer the manga artstyle.Sound - 10/10 I enjoy listening to the opening (Q&A recital) and ending song (White Wishes). It's also in my playlist. The opening song is fun and energetic while ending song is very... sentimental? I'm listening to it now as I write this.Character - 9/10 I adore their friendship! :) I liked everyone's personalities and designs including Asako's...(I disliked her at first, haha.) But there was one person I didn't really warm up to even at the end of the episode and it's the class rep girl with the glasses. I hate her so much. (TW: opinion 😲) I have second male lead syndrome so I was rooting for Yamaken a lot, haha. Haru was nice too, he was really clingy and cute. :> The thing is some of them are useless, like I expected Yuzan (Haru's older brother) to do more in the story but he was just there to be there. What a shame. Also, Nagoya is so cute.Story - 7/10 Just like the old wattpad fanfictions I've read as a kid, It's your typical quiet girl tames the troublemaker boy. Others might enjoy it, others might not. Personally, it was okay but it was predictable. Maybe I should've put this in character review but something that bugged me was that Haru never really apologized for his behavior for punching Shizuku, he did it twice too. He's cute and all but he needs help. And he tried to push Yamaken off the railing at that one episode so it's quite a.. problematic relationship. And they never resolve their problems by talking!

(I disliked her at first, haha.) But there was one person I didn't really warm up to even at the end of the episode and it's the class rep girl with the glasses. I hate her so much. (TW: opinion 😲) I have second male lead syndrome so I was rooting for Yamaken a lot, haha. Haru was nice too, he was really clingy and cute. :> The thing is some of them are useless, like I expected Yuzan (Haru's older brother) to do more in the story but he was just there to be there. What a shame. Also, Nagoya is so cute.Story - 7/10 Just like the old wattpad fanfictions I've read as a kid, It's your typical quiet girl tames the troublemaker boy. Others might enjoy it, others might not. Personally, it was okay but it was predictable. Maybe I should've put this in character review but something that bugged me was that Haru never really apologized for his behavior for punching Shizuku, he did it twice too. He's cute and all but he needs help. And he tried to push Yamaken off the railing at that one episode so it's quite a.. problematic relationship. And they never resolve their problems by talking!

I bring this up because a majority of modern romance anime, including but not limited to: Nagatoro, KanoKari, Love is War, Takagi-san, and so on,  has a tendency to not respect my time and harass me with endless amount of ads that end up padding the run-time of the series. Simply put, I do not have the time nor the interest to watch 2+ seasons of endless flirting filled with a snail\'s pace-progression just to end...at a confession and hand-holding. Watching My Little Monster, after countless hours of ad-ridden brainrot, was quite refreshing. The pacing felt quite nice, with the exception of the latter episodes becoming weird (and like always, the best solution is to blame everyone but the main character).

Obviously Kubo is heavily involved with the project, and you can tell his studies on London/England are paying off, and he really infuses that world design with the cultural background.

Every single detail and little addition to the characters comes out in a classic...Bleach style, but with an even sharper refinement of his previous style into something similar, yet different. It really helps give the world it\'s own ""identity"" aside from Bleach, but you can easily see these characters appearing along side the Bleach ones as they have the same framework in design.

Amagi Brilliant Park,https://myanimelist.net/anime/22147/Amagi_Brilliant_Park,"['The past couple years haven\'t been so great for KyoAni. It\'s hard to deny that they\'ve lost the influence and momentum they had back in the mid-to-late 2000\'s, and their work as of late has largely ranged from mediocrity to the flat-out bad (yes, I\'m looking at Kyoukai no Kanata). Most of these issues can be attributed to their weakness in writing drama, which, thankfully, is nearly non-existent in their most recent series, Amaburi.Amaburi (officially ""Amagi Brilliant Park"", which doesn\'t roll off the tongue nearly as well) sticks instead to KyoAni\'s strengths. While it\'s lacking in drama and shirtless bishounens, as a light-hearted slice-of-life...about a group of idiots managing an amusement park, it\'s well worth a watch. It also has Isuzu, who is maybe, just maybe, one of the most attractive heroines in anime, if hot anime ladies is your sort of thing.That said, anyone potentially interested in the show should be warned that the first episode is by far the worst. In it, the busty heroine (Isuzu) drags the cynical protagonist (Kanie) to the dilapidated amusement park that she manages, in the hopes that the former child actor, who, by the way, has absolutely zero experience in business management, will save the park from ruin. He begrudgingly accepts the offer, of course, and vows to meet the 500,000-visitors-in-four-months deadline so that the park will not be closed. At the end of the episode, Kanie also receives an abrupt kiss and a random superpower (which is not shown or mentioned again until several episodes later), because, uh, reasons?Tell me if this sounds at all familiar, because I\'ve seen hundreds of anime which have started off in the exact same way. I almost dropped Amaburi right there, and I\'m glad I didn\'t, as it quickly shows it has little interest in being a serious story. Instead, it treats alcoholic, talking animals and magical powers as being completely ordinary. There\'s even a group of pirate walruses and a bloody dragon. Amaburi fully embraces its silly fantasy setting and cares not for realism.But a cost of this silliness is that the show spends more time on the animals and park mascots than it does the human characters. And the mascots (who wear their costumes so frequently that they must be fused to their body) are nowhere near as interesting as Kanie or Isuzu, considering that many of them are based on a single trope. There\'s an otaku masquerading as some sort of squirrel-thing, an easily-angered shark who turns into a hell-demon when doused in water, a sheep who acts like a street thug, and so on and so forth. Sure, these characters add a great deal of energy to the show and make the park feel more alive, but after their second or third appearance, it\'s not likely you will appreciate their presence all too much. A few of them even show up dozens of times, and by that point it feels like the show is stretching its jokes way too thin. Granted, though, the commercial scene in the final episode is pretty damn hilarious.Moffle is perhaps the one mascot who is treated as an actual character and not a running gag. He is introduced as some sort of asshole who punches his own customers when they throw a few bad words his way, and really, he\'s just an unlikeable jerk towards Kanie until the two start to accept each other\'s existence. But the reason he is a jerk makes sense: he doesn\'t want ruffians and other undesirables bringing danger to the park\'s princess, Latifa, so he plays the role of the jerk in order to protect her. It\'s hard not to warm up to the little guy by the end of the series.As for Latifa, she just sort of... exists. Latifa and the park are the two main focuses of the story, except she\'s absent in everything that occurs in the park and is only ever relevant in the first and final episodes. She\'s there solely as a catalyst for drama, which means her scenes are, unsurprisingly, the weakest in the show. At least she stands there and looks pretty sometimes, I guess?Kanie and Isuzu are far more interesting. On the surface, they\'re both very typical KyoAni characters (the Kyon-like protagonist who sighs and reluctantly does everything, and the big-breasted kuudere prone to hurting things), but there is at least a little bit of depth to their character. Kanie\'s reasons for quitting his role as a child actor is explained in one short scene, and so too is Isuzu\'s reason for constantly shooting people with her musket (though why a minor can legally carry a gun to school remains a mystery). The scene where their past is explained is actually handled with a surprising amount of maturity: there\'s no screaming and crying, no childhood trauma-- the two just accept it and move on with their lives as people normally would.However, the fact that the two are high school kids and yet somehow able to run a massive multi-million dollar business on their own is inexcusable nonsense. I\'m sorry, but 16-year-olds are nowhere near experienced enough to tackle such a huge responsibility. This is especially evident when Kanie makes asinine decisions like charging only 30yen (equivalent to 30 cents) for park admission, with all the rides being free of charge, as if this wouldn\'t immediately drive the park to ruin with an insurmountable amount of debt. Isuzu also occasionally shows up wearing an office lady outfit, and I couldn\'t help but groan every single time. If you want to write adult characters then, please, just bloody write them. It\'s not like it\'s particularly difficult to make the characters a few years older-- say, 19 or 20-- rather than forcing them to be high school students when it makes absolutely zero sense in the context of the story. It\'s like KyoAni is deathly afraid of writing characters past the age of seventeen (perhaps they think their fans will set fire to their studio if they dare try). I\'m getting very tired of it. The world does exist outside the confines of high school.The art is about what you would expect from any KyoAni anime, which is to say that it looks great. The sound is much more noteworthy as it is what gives the show the majority of its energy. There\'s a ton of classy jazz music playing in the background, and the OP is the sort of thing that will get stuck in your brain immediately after hearing it for the first time. I spent a few of my college classes with ""MAGIC HEART"" screaming in my head and it was both delightful and horrifying.It\'s hard to get rid of the feeling that Amaburi is one long prologue to what will probably be a second season. There\'s subtle hints of romance between Kanie and Isuzu-- the kind that KyoAni loves to expand upon-- and the story abruptly ends with a light-hearted episode that would normally have been stuck in as an OVA. There\'s a lot of potential for the second season to be superior to the first, and if KyoAni doesn\'t create one I would be very surprised. And perhaps a little disappointed.Amaburi is best approached with minimal expectations. If you\'re expecting another big hit from KyoAni, then Amaburi is certainly not going to be that. If you\'re OK with just having a few laughs at silly nonsense (and if you\'re a guy, a few erections from Isuzu\'s scenes), then you\'ll probably enjoy your time with the show. It\'s not a great anime, perhaps not even a good one, but there\'s more than enough enjoyable content in here to warrant a watch. If nothing else, at least it\'s not Kyoukai no Kanata. about a group of idiots managing an amusement park, it\'s well worth a watch. It also has Isuzu, who is maybe, just maybe, one of the most attractive heroines in anime, if hot anime ladies is your sort of thing.That said, anyone potentially interested in the show should be warned that the first episode is by far the worst. In it, the busty heroine (Isuzu) drags the cynical protagonist (Kanie) to the dilapidated amusement park that she manages, in the hopes that the former child actor, who, by the way, has absolutely zero experience in business management, will save the park from ruin. He begrudgingly accepts the offer, of course, and vows to meet the 500,000-visitors-in-four-months deadline so that the park will not be closed. At the end of the episode, Kanie also receives an abrupt kiss and a random superpower (which is not shown or mentioned again until several episodes later), because, uh, reasons?Tell me if this sounds at all familiar, because I\'ve seen hundreds of anime which have started off in the exact same way. I almost dropped Amaburi right there, and I\'m glad I didn\'t, as it quickly shows it has little interest in being a serious story. Instead, it treats alcoholic, talking animals and magical powers as being completely ordinary. There\'s even a group of pirate walruses and a bloody dragon. Amaburi fully embraces its silly fantasy setting and cares not for realism.But a cost of this silliness is that the show spends more time on the animals and park mascots than it does the human characters. And the mascots (who wear their costumes so frequently that they must be fused to their body) are nowhere near as interesting as Kanie or Isuzu, considering that many of them are based on a single trope. There\'s an otaku masquerading as some sort of squirrel-thing, an easily-angered shark who turns into a hell-demon when doused in water, a sheep who acts like a street thug, and so on and so forth. Sure, these characters add a great deal of energy to the show and make the park feel more alive, but after their second or third appearance, it\'s not likely you will appreciate their presence all too much. A few of them even show up dozens of times, and by that point it feels like the show is stretching its jokes way too thin. Granted, though, the commercial scene in the final episode is pretty damn hilarious.Moffle is perhaps the one mascot who is treated as an actual character and not a running gag. He is introduced as some sort of asshole who punches his own customers when they throw a few bad words his way, and really, he\'s just an unlikeable jerk towards Kanie until the two start to accept each other\'s existence. But the reason he is a jerk makes sense: he doesn\'t want ruffians and other undesirables bringing danger to the park\'s princess, Latifa, so he plays the role of the jerk in order to protect her. It\'s hard not to warm up to the little guy by the end of the series.As for Latifa, she just sort of... exists. Latifa and the park are the two main focuses of the story, except she\'s absent in everything that occurs in the park and is only ever relevant in the first and final episodes. She\'s there solely as a catalyst for drama, which means her scenes are, unsurprisingly, the weakest in the show. At least she stands there and looks pretty sometimes, I guess?Kanie and Isuzu are far more interesting. On the surface, they\'re both very typical KyoAni characters (the Kyon-like protagonist who sighs and reluctantly does everything, and the big-breasted kuudere prone to hurting things), but there is at least a little bit of depth to their character. Kanie\'s reasons for quitting his role as a child actor is explained in one short scene, and so too is Isuzu\'s reason for constantly shooting people with her musket (though why a minor can legally carry a gun to school remains a mystery).

If nothing else, at least it\'s not Kyoukai no Kanata.', ""Amagi Brilliant Park has been making waves in the anime community this season, and it's easy to see why. An intriguingly goofy premise coupled with the fact that it's a Kyoto Animation production sets up rather high expectations. And I have to say, Amagi Brilliant Park exceeded my expectations in nearly every way.To say that Amaburi is absurd would be an understatement. Kanie Seiya, a high school student, is tasked with reviving a failing amusement park and has three months to reach its yearly quota of 500,000 guests or the park will shut down. Also, this park is inhabited by magical beings from a different...realm who rely on the fun that visitors have for their livelihood. Add the fact that the two lead characters are named after Kanye West and 50 Cent--how can you resist?Amaburi does well with its plot, but that's not where its true strength lies. At its core, Amaburi is built on its characters. Absurd, zany, and above all, lovable, the ensemble of characters contained within the park will win you over instantly. I'm amazed at how much character development they managed to fit into 13 episodes (12 really--the last episode is just a filler). Amaburi really makes you feel the characters' emotions and their motivation to keep their park open. It's been a while since I've been this engaged by a show's characters alone. The hilarious trio of mascots, the dysfunctional dance group, Sento's insecurities despite her stoic appearance, and an arrogant, narcissistic, but ultimately big-hearted main character, as well as a plethora of other wild characters leave a lasting impact.Huge props to the art direction team on this one. Amaburi looks absolutely stunning. The various areas of the park are bright and colorful, the characters are dynamic, and Amaburi features some of the most hysterical facial expressions I've ever seen. A great job is done with character designs (whoever designed Sento, I cannot thank you enough--you have done humanity a great favor). Appearances aren't everything, but in this department Amaburi sure has it all.Honestly, I hardly have anything negative to say at all regarding this series. A great job of managing pacing gives it a full, complete feel despite its short length. By the story's conclusion, it's clear that Amagi Brilliant Park is more than just a goofy comedy. It's about more than just a high school kid running a magical theme park. It evokes feelings of community, friendship, and overcoming adversity that, while they may be corny, ring loud and true. Amagi Brilliant Park is far more heartwarming than its premise suggests. This is the feel-good show of the year. realm who rely on the fun that visitors have for their livelihood.

This is the feel-good show of the year."", ""LOOK AT THE SKY IT'S MAGIC HOUR.Actually, it's half an hour in one episode, but you'll get the joke soon.Amagi Brilliant Park is just spectacular. Some of the audience loved it, and I think it's a chance that Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) has actually redeemed themselves over the troubles they had over the past year. Watching the first episode got me hooked since it has an interesting setting to look forward. You surely have seen amusement parks in a lot of anime, but that's just depicting the characters' enjoyment. But, I'm sure you have yet to see behind the scenes of the park's operation.The story starts...with Sento inviting Kanie to go with her to an unknown location which is Amagi Brilliant Park. Kanie wasn't pleased with the tour from Sento of the amusement park which is bad in shape and unsatisfactory. Later on, Sento introduced Latifa who then wants Kanie to become the next manager of the park and save it from being taken away. Also, this amusement park isn't just any ordinary park. Kanie learnt that it is occupied by 'fairies' from Maple Land, a magical place far from reality.Before you are worried about KyoAni's antics, don't worry. To spoil a bit about the story, it wasn't written in a way which later it is plagued with problematic tropes. Basically throughout the whole anime, you see how Kanie is able to handle the park as the manager. He gets to learn more about the park, its attractions and the workers along the way and from there, he finds ways to improve the well-being. The anime is mostly comedic, meaning lots of moments to laugh at from episode to episode. I would say that it wasn't repetitive, making those moments unique in a sense. There are some dramatic moments which honestly, I feel that they are a bit forced and out of place from the prominent hilarious comedy. But not to fret, they don't really mess up the story much, since then the characters involved got back to their feet. There are also undeveloped romance in some relationships, but it's sweet to see some hints coming about.What I absolutely love about the story is how the park manages to develop, thanks to Kanie's direction as a manager. The workers might be negative over his choices of attracting visitors to the park, and you may be astonished too, but he managed them. The story may also not show this result, but it also drop hints too. Overall, I think the story was almost original and doesn't not have a lot of faults. Of course, many more topics in the story can be expanded, but out of thirteen episodes, I think it's a job well done for the script-writers. There is also some fan-service included that doesn't exceed too much, but you know, it's quite astonishing for KyoAni to add some. Sure, Free! is another anime with a lot of fan-service, but ignoring that anime, it is still a nice shock.The anime has a huge cast which is quite diverse in terms of personality. How the story introduces the characters one by one is fine, since Kanie meets a few workers in the park from episode to episode. Some of the characters have a small story behind them. But what is really good about the cast is that they are never forgotten. Once they are introduced, they will eventually pop up in the next episodes. So if you have your favourite character inside, don't feel left out.Of course, the story do focus on some of the characters. While Kanie manages the park, Sento assists him in some ways. There is some development between the two, but not very much to the point it gets romantic. Indeed, both of them have their own faults which can cause hilarity or not, given the situation they face. They are definitely different on each other in attitude-wise, but they understand each other. However, Latifah doesn't feel like as a main character but more of a plot device to make the story more dramatic. Not much interaction is seen from her, even many of the characters that don't have a larger role get more air time than her. Also, there's the three mascots, Moffle, Macaron and Tiramie, and the four Elementario fairies, Muse, Sylphy, Kobori and Salama. While the mascots serve more as a comedy piece of the story, the Elementario fairies get more development and story. It isn't really consistent but there's one episode that show more about themselves and it's great.Overall, the development is okay but not too great. More can be shown not only to Kanie and Sento alone, but also to Latifah and the rest. But given the thirteen-episode limit, it couldn't be helped anyway.Knowing KyoAni's anime already, I shouldn't be disappointed by its pleasing art style for this anime. The sceneries were definitely eye-grabbing, along with the details in them, the vibrant colours chosen and the lively atmosphere portrayed by the background characters. There are a lot of visual effects shown which are great, such as magical sparkles or the rustling of leaves. You've already seen it quite a lot if you watched a lot of KyoAni anime, so it shouldn't really be a surprise, yet it is so awesome. The character designs were not really original, given that the face styles are similar to other characters from KyoAni's anime. But they are detailed and nice-looking. Some of the non-human designs are definitely cool for some, wacky for the rest. The facial expressions are well-done, and I definitely love the cartoon-ish ones to express hilarity.The opening song, sang by AKINO with her band, has won the hearts of many with the catchy beats and groovy tunes. It's easily one of the best songs heard in this season, since it attracted a lot of attention. See that starting quote? That's the first quote in the lyrics. It's too famous indeed. I actually looped the song many times. It has a nice feel that relates to the context of the story, giving the hype for the story and the lively feel in it. The ending song is different-sounding. Sang by the voice actresses of the Elementario fairies, it is supposed to have a more calm approach. You may feel that it doesn't really match the context, but you'll get used to it. If I put it aside, it's not a bad song and it's nice. The background music is not really noticeable, but I quite like the style of it. The OST album has been released, and a quick run-through has got me interested. The voice acting is great too. Some voice actors are well-known, the rest are either new or does not have many roles.Overall, I really loved the anime so much. Ignoring what has been giving the negative impressions of the anime, it's pretty much one of the best anime I've watched this season. A seemingly-interesting story and a diverse cast will not disappoint you definitely. To summarise this anime, it has great comedy from the characters and a good development of the park, thanks to a narcissist manager and an emotionless assistant. Of course, the thirteen episode feels more like an OVA than an actual episode. It still continues from the previous episode indeed, but honestly they can just stop airing at the twelfth episode. with Sento inviting Kanie to go with her to an unknown location which is Amagi Brilliant Park.

Being one of the biggest and most successful animation companies in Japan, people tend to automatically just chalk down whatever they license and eagerly await it, expecting something great. But does KyoAni succeed with their latest addition, Amagi Brilliant Park? Can they truly amount to more than just their wonderfully crafted artwork?Amagi Brilliant Park (Or Amaburi for short) follows Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic and self-centered (Wait. Kanie...Kanye...I see what you did there, KyoAni) high school student and...former child-star, as he is recruited as the new manager for a failing theme park. However, this theme park is currently owned and operated by a group of people that come from the magical world of ""Maple Land"". The women are beautiful and the males all look like mascots for college football teams, which is personally my ideal picture of a magic kingdom.Even though the story seems a little odd, it does quickly become alluring when you find out the princess of Maple Land and former manager of the park has a sickness that prevents her from aging and resets her memory once every year. And so Kanye West Seiya must bring in a total of 500,000 visitors in a six month period in order for the Maple Landers to keep the park. If he does not succeed, Princess Frailty will lose her magic powers contained within the park and ultimately die a tragic death.Amagi Brilliant Park has its ups and downs (LIKE A ROLLER COASTER. HA) but it isn\'t by any means bad. I found myself looking forward to it every week, just as I normally do with Kyoto Animation\'s stuff. But this time I didn\'t have to fully invest myself in the story like I had to do with sthows like Hyouka, which worked on solving mysteries and building up relationships. So, lets delve deeper as I once again break this show apart, piece by piece, to better illustrate how I feel about it.Music: 7/10Just like every other normal person in the world, I love clapping. The opening song to Amagi Brilliant Park utilizes clapping. Twice. That\'s cool, I like that. And since Kyoto Animation created the opening, the clapping looks sweet. But I digress. The anime sounds just like you\'d expect a show about a theme park to sound. The music is lively and cheerful, and at the same time it delivers hope. And with Amaburi\'s story, that is absolutely vital. Background music isn\'t repetitious at all and plays an essential part in making each scene seem full. But because the music wasn\'t outstanding and didn\'t play a part in changing the way people viewed the show, it wasn\'t perfect and definitely could have been improved upon.Characters: 9/10As far as characters go, Amaburi has a solid line-up. Kanie is quite different from the dense male leads you\'ll often find in anime today, and the rest of the cast is pretty solid as well. Sento Isuzu (Whose name I just found out comes from 50 Cent) does a great job in supporting Kanie\'s character throughout the duration of the show. And all of the mascot-men are there with extremely strong personalities to provide sufficient comic relief for the theme park. The thing is, even though the characters were very original and unique all across the board, the majority of them were ONLY there to serve as that comic relief I mentioned. It\'s great to be funny, but if that\'s your only personality trait in real life, you\'re probably going to have a hard time and you aren\'t a perfect character. I would have liked to see some more development in anyone apart from the leads, but it just didn\'t happen.Art: 10/10This was probably a given as soon as Kyoto Animation\'s name was put under the title, but Amagi Brilliant Park delivers some of the best artwork this year. Character designs were outrageous and easily memorable, and the theme park as a whole, even when it was decaying, was a sight for sore eyes. It\'s refreshing to see KyoAni constantly improving and not just taking advantage of their position in the industry and settling down in a ""safe spot"". They are constantly pushing themselves to create something better, and it has been succeeding. As a reference point, please direct your attention to the Ferris wheel above. Isn\'t that the best damn Ferris wheel you\'ve ever seen in an anime? You\'re damn right it is. Amaburi has zero issues when it comes to appearance, and that is vital in keeping the audience\'s interest locked in.Story: 6/10What\'s disappointing about the story line of this show is that they throw in a lot of information that seems like it\'s important, but is never mentioned again. The viewers never find out what exactly happened to cause Kanie\'s fallout of the entertainment industry. Sento\'s affections never get let out and ultimately become meaningless when you look at the bigger picture. And then Kanie goes off on this rant about how he is terrified of heights and wants to hide it from everyone but it plays no part in determining how you look at the story. And then there was the whole thing with how Kanie somehow ran into the princess when he was a child and now felt like he was destined to save her life. It just started to seem forced, like the writers wanted there to be a story when in all actuality the show was just there to be fun. The idea was good, but countless attempts to make it deeper than it should have been really ruined its legitimacy.Amagi Brilliant Park is a solid show, but it could have been much better. You\'ll find that the driving force in bringing you back to the next episode falls completely on the characters and artwork. It\'s definitely enjoyable, but one of the weaker shows KyoAni has brought forth in recent years, which may be a direct result of them setting the bar too high for themselves. Watch this if you are either an avid fan of the studio or just looking to have a few laughs and wind down. There are better options out there, but Amaburi will suffice if you don\'t want to look for them. former child-star, as he is recruited as the new manager for a failing theme park.

But this time I didn\'t have to fully invest myself in the story like I had to do with sthows like Hyouka, which worked on solving mysteries and building up relationships. So, lets delve deeper as I once again break this show apart, piece by piece, to better illustrate how I feel about it.Music: 7/10Just like every other normal person in the world, I love clapping. The opening song to Amagi Brilliant Park utilizes clapping. Twice. That\'s cool, I like that. And since Kyoto Animation created the opening, the clapping looks sweet. But I digress. The anime sounds just like you\'d expect a show about a theme park to sound. The music is lively and cheerful, and at the same time it delivers hope. And with Amaburi\'s story, that is absolutely vital. Background music isn\'t repetitious at all and plays an essential part in making each scene seem full. But because the music wasn\'t outstanding and didn\'t play a part in changing the way people viewed the show, it wasn\'t perfect and definitely could have been improved upon.Characters: 9/10As far as characters go, Amaburi has a solid line-up. Kanie is quite different from the dense male leads you\'ll often find in anime today, and the rest of the cast is pretty solid as well. Sento Isuzu (Whose name I just found out comes from 50 Cent) does a great job in supporting Kanie\'s character throughout the duration of the show. And all of the mascot-men are there with extremely strong personalities to provide sufficient comic relief for the theme park. The thing is, even though the characters were very original and unique all across the board, the majority of them were ONLY there to serve as that comic relief I mentioned. It\'s great to be funny, but if that\'s your only personality trait in real life, you\'re probably going to have a hard time and you aren\'t a perfect character. I would have liked to see some more development in anyone apart from the leads, but it just didn\'t happen.Art: 10/10This was probably a given as soon as Kyoto Animation\'s name was put under the title, but Amagi Brilliant Park delivers some of the best artwork this year. Character designs were outrageous and easily memorable, and the theme park as a whole, even when it was decaying, was a sight for sore eyes. It\'s refreshing to see KyoAni constantly improving and not just taking advantage of their position in the industry and settling down in a ""safe spot"". They are constantly pushing themselves to create something better, and it has been succeeding. As a reference point, please direct your attention to the Ferris wheel above. Isn\'t that the best damn Ferris wheel you\'ve ever seen in an anime? You\'re damn right it is. Amaburi has zero issues when it comes to appearance, and that is vital in keeping the audience\'s interest locked in.Story: 6/10What\'s disappointing about the story line of this show is that they throw in a lot of information that seems like it\'s important, but is never mentioned again. The viewers never find out what exactly happened to cause Kanie\'s fallout of the entertainment industry. Sento\'s affections never get let out and ultimately become meaningless when you look at the bigger picture. And then Kanie goes off on this rant about how he is terrified of heights and wants to hide it from everyone but it plays no part in determining how you look at the story. And then there was the whole thing with how Kanie somehow ran into the princess when he was a child and now felt like he was destined to save her life. It just started to seem forced, like the writers wanted there to be a story when in all actuality the show was just there to be fun. The idea was good, but countless attempts to make it deeper than it should have been really ruined its legitimacy.Amagi Brilliant Park is a solid show, but it could have been much better. You\'ll find that the driving force in bringing you back to the next episode falls completely on the characters and artwork. It\'s definitely enjoyable, but one of the weaker shows KyoAni has brought forth in recent years, which may be a direct result of them setting the bar too high for themselves. Watch this if you are either an avid fan of the studio or just looking to have a few laughs and wind down. There are better options out there, but Amaburi will suffice if you don\'t want to look for them.', 'What exactly is Amagi Brilliant Park? On the basic surface, it isn’t exactly brilliant with its host of generic characters. However, taking a closer glance at the show might make you think differently once you’re on board with its ideas. Don’t get me wrong though. Amagi Brilliant Park isn’t exactly a show for everyone but it does launches itself into a realm of its own that has a unique ability to keep the audience at their seats.Adapted by the light novel of the same name, this anime series covers the first book with a bit of expansion. There are also several interesting noteworthy attributes to...take into consideration about this adaptation. First, the series is written by Shoji Gatoh who is well known for his work, Full Metal Panic. Then, there’s the studio in charge known as Kyoto Animation. While the studio needs little introduction, one should take notice a history of its works and realize this show is one of the first they’ve done relating to such a gimmick. Rather than taking place in some school setting, the series take place in a place of modern fantasy known as the Amagi Brilliant Park.A fresh concept. This show can seem a bit strange at times. The first episode blasts off without wasting any time by introducing the two main protagonists – Seiya Kanie and Isuzu Sento. The oddball circumstance involves Sento going on a ‘date’ with Kanie but only then does he realize that their fun time turns into something else. As such, the show initially introduces the basic mechanics of Amagi Brilliant Park. It establishes the premise and lets the audience know what it’s about, a task done quite well with the mechanics. But when it comes to characters, the show swings in a bit of an odd direction. For instance, it’s easy to tell that Kanie and Sento are quite different. Kanie has a narcissist attitude with a full of confidence and pride. While on the other hand, Sento is much more stoic who shows little emotions despite her sensitive personality. When you put these two characters together as the main duo, there’s a problem with compatibility. Nonetheless, the show does seize opportunities to bring the best out of them.It does this often by appealing at the ideas of the show. To do this, almost every character that Kanie or Sento gets involved with plays a form of role in bringing in new customers. Because let’s face it, the goal of the series is to attract 250,000 visitors to the park and if not done in 3 months will lead to closure. The show makes it clear that if the park closes, then it would seize to exist at all (literally) in the human world. This is because of the staff of the park is made of beings from another realm known as the Maple World. And for the park to function, it needs to harvest magical energy from visitors who are having fun. Simply put: no visitors, no energy, no park. The show also makes it clear that Kanie has experience in the entertainment industry early on thanks to flashbacks and his own experiences. As such, expect Kanie to bring in ideas from what he has learned to ensure that Amagi Brilliant Park reaches its goal.As a show with many possibilities, most of it consists of the characters. There’s a wide diversity of them whether it’s a princess like Latifah Fleuranza, fairy mascots such as Moffle, the Elementario girls, or other members hired by the staff. The series gives them a variety of roles although their key purpose is to bring entertainment so that visitors come by. To say the least though, the show accomplishes its task of entertainment with the personalities of the characters. Almost all of them brings in some form of fun to the series even when timings feel off or the amount of generic concepts used. It also seems as if the show is self-aware at times because even some of the character names are originated from popular icons from the real life world. The key element to take into consideration is still entertainment as the show tries a different set of dynamics each episode. These involve the different attractions at the park such as Indiana Jones style adventures, Water Park (complete with pirates and the ship), trials and error with idol themes, or secret cave with a mythic dragon. There are still repetitive gimmicks used though such as Moffle’s fury (which is resulted from his endless rivalry with Kanie), Sento’s gun (that often strikes fear into almost anyone that comes near it including Kanie), or the variety of species used to bring in diversity. As such, a show such as this offers almost something for anyone when it comes to the characters. Unfortunately, characterization suffers and in fact almost non-existent. Except perhaps the princess, Sento, or Kanie, none of the other characters get background stories or development. It also seems like the show plays off of stereotypes and make certain characters (ex. Elementario girls) seem like a joke with little more than pure eye candy.Despite being written by the author of FMP, don’t expect much similarities to it. There’s no psychological scenarios or plots about the military. Instead, see this series like a showbiz. And to deliver that, the show needs to inspire comedy. While I think the series is on the right track, it occasionally tries far too hard to appeal in such a way at times. Comedy is repetitive and feels slipping away at times. There are some serious moments but some of the awkward timings feels off. However, a few of the characters are memorable for their personalities especially Kanie during key moments. One of his earlier speeches shows exactly the type of person he is despite putting on his poker face. While starving for ideas, the show does also finds ways to create opportunities to explore every aspect of its attractions through either internal or external conflict. These even include hiring new staff members, dealing with the past, and even events outside of the park. However, the endgame could be a mixed bag because like I mentioned before, this series is not for everyone. The finale of the episode also feels OVA-ish.When it comes to visuals, Amagi Brilliant Park’s technical quality nails it with its high production values thanks to Kyoto Animation. While landscapes aren’t lavishly on Makoto Shinkai levels, it does have creativity ideas behind it. However, the character designs feels childish. In particular, the mascots looks like furry animals while the Elementario girls almost gives off the feeling that they are teenagers on the way to a Halloween costume party. Did I also mention fan service? The first episode has a full glimpse of that while subsequent episodes does this with bikini outfits and pirate gear. Luckily enough, the show doesn’t make this as its main attraction but rather just as part of its gimmick.Soundtrack plays a few key roles. To say the least, the OP song is very catchy not just with the lyrics but by the energy it crafts with almost every character being featured; and in some moments clapping hands in unison. I also give some credit for Kanie’s voice for his ability to really demonstrate his character as a perfectionist. His speeches may sometimes feel laggy but they are to the point with brutal honesty and narcissism. Other characters such as Latifah brings in a gentle atmosphere with her voice while Moffle does the exact opposite of that. However, the OST is easily forgettable even during some emotional scenes of sentimentality.Oddly, Amagi Brilliant Park feels like an entertainment showbiz itself. The story offers a variety of ideas although it does falter whenever it tries a bit more than it should have. There is almost an ensemble like cast of characters that the audience may find attached to. Just be aware that these characters play roles like pieces to a puzzle rather than getting depth on their own. For all its technical wizardry, the show is still very much about a guy trying to do his best to save a park that definitely needs to be saved. Fans of other Kyoto Animation works may find this a bit different than what they are used to. It’s not just the different main setting but also because this show plays around with itself like a roller coaster on steroids. take into consideration about this adaptation.

It’s not just the different main setting but also because this show plays around with itself like a roller coaster on steroids.', ""Amagi Brilliant Park is a Fantasy, Romantic Comedy anime, where Seiya Kanie is asked to help the park from closing by attracting 250,000 visitors because the staff of the park are from a magical realm called Maple Land and the park is really a facility thats harvests a magical energy form visitors while they are having fun, so they can maintain their existence in the human realm. So as you can see just a normal anime plot, ok really it a really good concept and is very interesting, and i promise the story is really good as they face different situations each episode while trying...to get visitors need to keep the park open. Each episode will surprise, make you laugh and what they do about getting people to come to the park.Now on to the characters, now i only going to to talk about the main three characters because there is a lot of characters in this anime and i not going too much information about them as the anime does a good job explaining what the characters are like and somethings about main characters are story spoilers. First up is the man himself, Seiya Kanie (Voiced by Kōki Uchiyama), He is a high school student that is highly intelligence, excellent reflexes, has a sharp mind and a narcissist. He is asked by Latifah, the princess of Maple Land to become the manager because of being in the entertainment business before. Next is Isuzu Sento (Voiced by Ai Kakuma), is a royal guard to the princess who carries a rife called Steinberger and is the one to get Kanie to go to the park by forcing him at gun point. She rarely shows emotion, but she hides a very sensitive side. Her gun can be summon from any exposed skin as it is infused magical to her body. After Kanie becomes the manager of the park, she starts developing feelings for him, even if she dislike is arrogant demeanor. The last main character is Latifah Fleuranza (Voiced by Yukiyo Fujii), she is the princess of Maple Land and she asked Sento have Kanie meet her. Due for some reason which is about her frail body, she can't stay to far from the castle in the park. I would talk more about her and the other characters, but because of spoilers i can't say more but trust me, the characters are very well made.Next is presentation, Amagi Brilliant Park is very much colorful and the looks like a very will made anime. It using a similar art design as Is the Order a Rabbit?, as the character are alive with color, the scenery is very lively and overall is very well designed. The characters' animations on screen are smooth, their facial expressions and body language are realistic. Next is the sound/voice acting, the music used for the opening song is very catchy as it beat fits the style of the anime quite well. The ending song is beautiful as the artwork shown when it played is great. The background sounds and music are well created and really fit the feel of a amusement park and the voice acting is very well done as every voice fit it character quite well. Lastly the topics used in the story are well written and doesn't seen out of place and very Interesting.Now my thoughts about the anime. Amagi Brilliant Park is a very well written anime as it doesn't leave any plot point unfinished by the end of the show. It is very funny and it has a very magical way to make you care about the characters i really can't explain. The characters are very well created and i love them all, but i really like Sento because all i can say her answers to problems is great. Overall i think the anime has been created with a lot of care and has a great story that all can enjoy. I recommend this to everyone as even if a very few scenes are little questionable, all in all it just really fun to watch.With that said, Amagi Brilliant Park is an anime that should be watch as it concept is unique as there not really an anime like it and can be enjoyed by all ages. If you like unique concepts, liked Is The Order a Rabbit?, just like anime or look to see what anime is like, then i would recommend Amagi Brilliant Park. to get visitors need to keep the park open. Each episode will surprise, make you laugh and what they do about getting people to come to the park.Now on to the characters, now i only going to to talk about the main three characters because there is a lot of characters in this anime and i not going too much information about them as the anime does a good job explaining what the characters are like and somethings about main characters are story spoilers.

It has an alright style of conveying the characters emotions, although it has unfinished romance between some of the characters which i don\'t like happening in anime I watch.Story: The plot for Amagi Brilliant Park is certainly original. I haven\'t seen any other anime with this plot and it makes for a good change. Although they do explain why they have to run the park, I would have liked more detail in that aspect. The originality makes up for it though....8/10Art: The art in Amagi Brilliant park catches the eye with it\'s style of characters. Recently there has been a development in art since the release of 1080p resolution. Well, I guess that isn\'t recent, but you get the point. This anime uses the new style of art - and well. 9/10Sound: The soundtrack isn\'t something amazing, but it suits the anime well. It makes for some emotional scenes even though most of the anime is a casual watch, and is not one of the anime that gives the feels for me. The voice actors perform well in this anime and suits what you think the character would sound like. 8/10Characters: The main character is a bit generic, but is one of those ""never give up"" characters, which suits the anime. For me the backstories could have been told in more detail, but that is not much of a problem. Overall the characters were good. 7/10Enjoyment: Although I did enjoy this anime my overall opinion is mixed. I loved the art but the only downside was I would have liked more character development, although the characters were thought out well. 7/10Overall 8/10 8/10Art: The art in Amagi Brilliant park catches the eye with it\'s style of characters.

Miniskirts! Swimsuits! Low-Angle Shots! You need to put in as many of those as possible without breaking the law.”-Amagi Brilliant Park, Episode 13Another season, another project by KyoAni unfolded to the masses. However, it seems as though KyoAni’s latest attempt at trying to appeal to the anime demographic that loves cute and sexy girls is now back in full fashion. I want to think of Amagi Brilliant Park as their apology to all the people who were whining about the “gayness” that KyoAni was ostracizing with their recent hit, “Free!”. Hey, they can make whatever they please, and...we can judge whether it’s worthy of being timeless in their long successful history. In which case, Amagi Brilliant Park will only be seen as just another Kyoukai no Kanata, a filler show.Whereas Kyoukai no Kanata fell vastly short even of being called a memorable show, a filler show, Amagi Brilliant Park is at least commendable to be called a filler show. In the strictest sense, what made me distinguish while watching this show was how appropriately tame it is with how it portrays the story and setting. For the most part, everything is lighthearted and easy for the mind to sit back and relax in pure escapism. As with every anime comedy, there are cute girls in it. KyoAni indeed hasn’t failed in giving us quality girls as opposed to other aspects of an anime.The main characters are fueled by their appearances and personalities, which spark up a great deal of charm in their archetypes. Latifa is typically the girly girl part of the cast that is always optimistic and smiling, so we can view her innocence and glamour. She is not necessarily the best character considering her backstory is quite exaggerated in the most apathetic way possible, but nothing terrible either. However, there is Isuzu. The one saving grace of the show is her hilarious stoic demeanor. Hilarious in that when she breaks character and starts showing emotion, you have no choice but to squeal with ultimate delight. You can’t be a true man if you refuse her offer to paizuri you.Besides our two central girls, our male protagonist, Seiya Kanie, isn’t anything special. He doesn’t offer any nuanced grandeur to make him stand out like any memorable KyoAni protagonists before him. But the real crux of the cast is the supporting cast, and there are a lot of them. The problem with this is how so little of the supporting cast barely have anything to make them seem unique other than just being weird mascot characters that are hardly significant. Sure, some of them, particularly Moffle and Tiramie, have some funny moments, but it's a quick little comedic pick me up before it’s later tossed away by another funny moment.Amagi Brilliant Park is unique amongst other KyoAni’s projects in how vibrant and colorful they’ve made their art and animation. Earlier in KyoAni’s career, they’ve tried to make their characters seem more realistic despite just relying on the moe-blob formula. They’re still present here, but it is refreshing how they implement the cartoonish aesthetic to the different characters. Besides our human characters, it’s nice to see KyoAni make these adorable animal mascots and give some spark of creativity to how they interact with their bodies and each other.In closing….oh wait, I forgot about the story. Wait, honestly, what story is there to critique? It’s almost 2nd nature to Amagi Brilliant Park. All there is to service a plot is the characters trying to keep their amusement park from closing down. But the only problem is that they fail even to make that an issue that I should care about since all the fanservice and cute characters drown it out like white noise. It's one of those situations where the show falls flat on the story, but that isn’t the whole point, and even the show itself makes this clear as day. When you first show a girl dressed up as a pirate girl in a bikini, your only response is to clap slowly in amusement and go, “Yeah, okay, I’ll let this be passable in any measure.”That’s how Amagi Brilliant Park can be described in one word: passable. It's just a bit above mediocre to where it can be labeled decent in the critical spectrum. As far as KyoAni shows, which I’ve become not fond of even when they were in their “golden age,” it will nonetheless entertain with enjoyable comedy to splendor about. Sure it’s another show centered around cute girls, but when you see the sight of Isuzu in a cheerleader bikini outfit, it’s a sight that is more than just moe; it’s life.Grade: B- we can judge whether it’s worthy of being timeless in their long successful history. In which case, Amagi Brilliant Park will only be seen as just another Kyoukai no Kanata, a filler show.Whereas Kyoukai no Kanata fell vastly short even of being called a memorable show, a filler show, Amagi Brilliant Park is at least commendable to be called a filler show.

She is not necessarily the best character considering her backstory is quite exaggerated in the most apathetic way possible, but nothing terrible either. However, there is Isuzu. The one saving grace of the show is her hilarious stoic demeanor. Hilarious in that when she breaks character and starts showing emotion, you have no choice but to squeal with ultimate delight. You can’t be a true man if you refuse her offer to paizuri you.Besides our two central girls, our male protagonist, Seiya Kanie, isn’t anything special. He doesn’t offer any nuanced grandeur to make him stand out like any memorable KyoAni protagonists before him. But the real crux of the cast is the supporting cast, and there are a lot of them. The problem with this is how so little of the supporting cast barely have anything to make them seem unique other than just being weird mascot characters that are hardly significant. Sure, some of them, particularly Moffle and Tiramie, have some funny moments, but it's a quick little comedic pick me up before it’s later tossed away by another funny moment.Amagi Brilliant Park is unique amongst other KyoAni’s projects in how vibrant and colorful they’ve made their art and animation. Earlier in KyoAni’s career, they’ve tried to make their characters seem more realistic despite just relying on the moe-blob formula. They’re still present here, but it is refreshing how they implement the cartoonish aesthetic to the different characters. Besides our human characters, it’s nice to see KyoAni make these adorable animal mascots and give some spark of creativity to how they interact with their bodies and each other.In closing….oh wait, I forgot about the story. Wait, honestly, what story is there to critique? It’s almost 2nd nature to Amagi Brilliant Park. All there is to service a plot is the characters trying to keep their amusement park from closing down. But the only problem is that they fail even to make that an issue that I should care about since all the fanservice and cute characters drown it out like white noise. It's one of those situations where the show falls flat on the story, but that isn’t the whole point, and even the show itself makes this clear as day. When you first show a girl dressed up as a pirate girl in a bikini, your only response is to clap slowly in amusement and go, “Yeah, okay, I’ll let this be passable in any measure.”That’s how Amagi Brilliant Park can be described in one word: passable. It's just a bit above mediocre to where it can be labeled decent in the critical spectrum. As far as KyoAni shows, which I’ve become not fond of even when they were in their “golden age,” it will nonetheless entertain with enjoyable comedy to splendor about. Sure it’s another show centered around cute girls, but when you see the sight of Isuzu in a cheerleader bikini outfit, it’s a sight that is more than just moe; it’s life.Grade: B-"", 'Amagi Brilliant Park is a high energy, fun comedy anime with a large amount of characters that all have their own unique personalities. There has been a lot of hype built around this anime, many people saying that this is a must watch, one of the best anime of the fall 2014 season, possibly one of the best of 2014.I for one, did not receive any of said hype, and didn\'t watch while the show was still airing. I eventually started watching Amagi Brilliant Park a few months later, and boy did I miss out on something amazing!Summary: It begins by introducing our self absorbed...MC, Seiya Kanie, who has been forced to go on a ""date"" to an amusement park by our main heroine, Isuzu Seno. From this, he is brought into a world of magical creatures from another world that want him to help get 500,000 guests in 3 months. Can, or will he do it?Now onto the review!:Story: 7/10The story was pretty straightforward, the park in trouble of being shut down, if the goal of 500,000 guests was not reached within 3 months. For the most part, it was pretty episodical, though there was still character and plot development each episode, making the show pretty enjoyable.Art: 10/10Wow, I have to give credit where it\'s deserved, the art was absolutely amazing, though the animation was average, the beautiful art made up for the animation.Sound: 9/10The sound was very consistent, the Opening and Ending songs were fantastic, especially the Opening song, it got me pumped up to watch each episode! LOOK AT THE SKY IT\'S MAGIC HOUR!! Ahem... Outside of that, the OST was beautiful.Character: 9/10Now the characters, while some seemed a little generic, they put a twist on each character to make them unique to the show... and I loved each and every one of them. From the self obsessed MC, socially challenged heroine, to the perverted and hilarious mascots, I truly loved all of them, and the interactions between all the characters.Enjoyment: 10/10What can I say, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, I found myself laughing at almost every joke and funny moment, and caring what happens to the characters at every point.Overall: 9/10Creators of Amagi Brilliant Park, Bravo!

You made a great anime.', ""A carnival setting in anime, is new for me, so going into this show I didn't know what to expect, it looked colorful and bright and there was a huge cast so I had a feeling it was gonna be right up my ally. As I started my rollercoaster expecting something pretty good and maybe amazing, by the end of the rollercoaster, I just had a smile on my face, It wasn't the best ride of my life it was just good. I could sum up Amagi Brilliant Park in just that sentence itself. But this is a review! That would be too dumbwitted.Story: 7/10The...story here is simple, a park known as Amagi Brilliant Park (hence the name of the show) hasn't been going well, it needs to have 500,000 visitors in just a couple of months, A highschool student has agreed to be manager but only until they get 500.00 visitors by the time limit he shall thou quit.A straightforward story, now I like stories that are easy to understand, its a sign that the show will be more enjoyable and anyone can watch it. Now when I saw this show had 13 episodes I was afraid this show was gonna be rushed but shockingly its the perfect run time for a show like this, didn't see that coming huh?I don't have too much to say about the story, its simple and good.Art: 8/10The animation is pretty well done here, with some really nice backgrounds and colorful art style it just shines here.Sound:8/10The music is upbeat and fun. The OP is like a rollercoaster that never stops....until the OP finishes. The ED is Ok for the most part.Character:7/10First we have Saiya. a highschool student who loves himself so much that he denys girls, HA GAY! Well other than that he is a fucking honest and brutal MC, he runs the park like he means it, the creators had balls to make the MC like this compared to other male MCs in modern anime, I give props to that.Then we have Isuzu, Saiya's co-worker, a mindless woman who literally threatens people with some shotgun just to get work done. It seems pretty funny when she stops bad problems using her shotgun. Other than that, she hardly changes throughout the series, by the end of the show she's still the same as the first episode.There's meant to be some kind of relationship between Isuzu and Saiya, there's lots of potential for character development, but as soon as it can happen in scenes where the two are alone, it just fails to deliver and they're back to root one co-workers. Even in the last episode there's so many chances but the show acts like noting happened.Enjoyment: 7/10This show is episodic for the most part, each episode has its own story and problems and more visitors round up in. It keeps going till the last episode. Now its good this wasn't 24 episodes, cause that would be very repetitive. The comedy in this show is pretty good, there's some chuck-worthy moments and scenes where I was laughing.Overall: 7/10Amagi Brilliant Park is a good show that delivers what it can do, it shines in its art and sound and does fairly well in its story and characters, give this show a go, you'll probably enjoy it.

A highschool boy becomes the manager of a magical theme park in an attempt to save its workers from doom. To be honest, it is ridiculous. There's no way around that. Luckily, this anime is so fun and entertaining that it's easy to forget how stupid it should be.The characters help this aspect a lot. All of the main characters get ample development, and a lot of the side characters as well. This helps pull the anime through some of its sillier scenes, and lends weight to what should be cheesy dramatic moments...sprinkled here and there.Both the animation and sound are spectacular. There are many memorable bgms, and the opening song is a good way to get fired up for the next episode. The animations and art are precise and colorful, with some surprising flair to be found every once in awhile.I'm not a big fan of comedies. You could even refer to me as a killjoy. However, this anime made me laugh more often than not. There were some comedic misses here and there, but if something can make you laugh even once, then it succeeds as a comedy. Together with some pleasantly heartwarming scenes and endearing characters, this anime manages to avoid the trainwreck it so easily could have been. Worth a watch if you are in the mood for a light, funny, heartfelt dramedy. sprinkled here and there.Both the animation and sound are spectacular.

But what kept me watching is my love for theme parks.I really thought Amaburi would be an exposition, showing its viewers true-to-life behind the scenes and nitty-gritty aspects of a particular object (in this case, a theme park) - something like Shirobako with anime making - plus an added fantasy in the side. I suppose it is that kind of anime in its own way. Only, most of the elements you encounter are improbable. It's a fantasy anime, no doubt about it.Amaburi's art is its most dazzling feat. It's nothing less...from KyoAni. Its visuals are colorful, vibrant, and fluid befitting that of a theme park. KyoAni hasn't innovated its character design that much but it still packs a punch in Amaburi. Kanie's, for example, can put the Iwatobi boys' to shame.Where the series suffers the most is the story. The first two episodes give us a trajectory. The setting may be cliche in its execution but it gave us a clear goal.Afterwards, the succeeding episodes are loaded with filler stories that may or may not make sense and only give the slightest intent of ever reaching that goal. They may give us an inkling of what is needed to run a theme park but they're nothing more than run-of-the-mill antics with a touch of the improbable. I honestly think KyoAni could have done a better job if they put a little more thought and effort in building the fillers.The overarching story is put back in focus in the last five episodes. The series manages to save itself as it slowly unfolds a cute, charming little story amusing enough to keep me watching until the last episode. It is the biggest plus side after that mess of a middle. Save for a few plot holes and open-endings, I can say that Amaburi ended well enough.With its characterization, Amaburi keeps it simple. But with its diversity of characters, development was disordered. For some characters, you'll see them grow as the series progresses and for the others, there is almost no development at all.It hits most of what we can expect from an effort by KyoAni - consistent visuals, top-notch character design, and a whole lot of fan service. After Free! and Kyoukai no Kanata, I would have asked for more. But with its variety of scenes, AmaBuri proves how versatile the studio is.All in all, Amagi Brilliant Park is a roller coaster ride. It takes you up and down and through the unexpected and ends abruptly enough for you to want more. It may not be the best of what KyoAni has to offer but it is a good addition to their opus. I would recommend this to anyone looking for lighthearted entertainment. from KyoAni. Its visuals are colorful, vibrant, and fluid befitting that of a theme park.

Disney world, Six Flags, Oceanworld, Japan\'s DisneySea, we all have wonderful, wonderful memories in them with our families and friends.  But have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes?  (Probably not)  But thankfully, Amagi Brilliant Park gives us this answer in a very nicely done comedic sense.Story (7.33/10):  Held against a wall against his will, Kanie Seiya is threatened with his life by a girl at his school by the name of Isuzu Sento, who is holding him by gunpoint.  After being asked (more like forced) to go on a date with her to an...amusement park, he reluctantly goes, before seeing the poor, poor state that Amagi Brilliant Park is in.The Story of Amagi follows a rather simple plot line.  As being appointed as the manager of the park, the story follows Kanie as he attempts to make up ways to build up Amagi\'s popularity and visitor count, thinking of a new harebrained scheme each episode in order to do it.  In addition with this plot line, the show builds up its character count by adding in more and more side characters as the story goes from episode to episode.  The plot line does work very well for the series and does a great deal of positive things for it, however, there are a couple things that do bring the series down a bit.One of bigger flaws for the series is character development.  For the main three characters: Kanie, Sento, and Latifa, the show gives each of them a bit of a backstory for each of them, explaining a little bit about their character and why they are the way they are.  The only problem with this is due to how little it is.  The show is good in its characters because they\'re interesting.  The backstories are genuinely interesting.  However, it was a bit disappointing seeing that the characters didn\'t get as much development as they could\'ve because I would\'ve liked to see more of what what made them into what they are.Still though, the story overall was good to watch.  The comedy was decently done and the general pacing of the show was good.  Personally, I found myself enjoying the show a lot and looked forward to every episode.  Every episode except the last one was good.  The only reason why the last one felt bad was because it felt REALLY out of place.  I personally would\'ve put it a 1 or 2 episodes back before the last one because it didn\'t really make sense to put it as the last episode.Overview:+  Good story+  Good comedy+  Good pacing-   Not enough character development-   Out of place last episodeCharacters (7.61/10):  The characters for Amagi were definitely a very interesting and memorable bunch to watch.  I can guarantee that these characters will stick in your head long after you\'ve finished the series.Kanie Seiya is the main protagonist of the series.  Kanie is a self-proclaimed genius, thinking of himself that he\'s good-looking and the center of the world.  (His character is named after Kanye West.  No surprise his character reflects it.)  As a previous child star, Kanie has knowledge over what makes things popular and makes uses of that expertise as a way to make Amagi more popular and appealing to the public.  As the series goes on, you can see Kanie grow as a character as he puts in his time and effort into the Park.  The development is really nice to see and really shows how development can be put into any series.  As a downside however, his character isn\'t really explored beyond how he\'s a child star.  They don\'t explain why he got out of it, or why he went into it into the first place, which really was a downer considering how much more it could\'ve added to the story.Then we have Isuzu Sento, the Kuudere secretary to Kanie.  Sento is a very interesting character because she doesn\'t really have much on the surface, but she really becomes a memorable character.  Her backstory doesn\'t really extend beyond the fact that she\'s a guard, which is also really disappointing because you don\'t really get to know very much.  Her most defining characteristic is her gun, which apparently, she can pull out of any exposed skin, which makes for some decent character moments.  Beyond that, as well as her lack of understanding situations, she doesn\'t get very much.  Regardless though, she is still quite a memorable character and does make for a nice secondary main character.In addition to these two, there are the other characters which I would consider to be main characters, those characters being Latifa, Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron.  The first one being the other main character, the other three being the three drunk stooges of the series.  Let\'s start with Latifa.  Latifa is what I would consider to be an underused character.  In the series, she\'s not really made out to be a prominent character, but more like an important character that doesn\'t show up much kind of character.  She doesn\'t have a very large presence in the series overall, and mostly only gets proper screentime and plot importance later on.  She has a decent enough backstory to support her character, but I really wish we could get a little bit more from her timewise because she was an adored character that we don\'t really get to see.  The other three I mentioned play as a sort of comedy trio, being somewhat essential to the plot by being the park\'s main three mascots, creating comedy moments and sometimes conflict, along the way.What the series does have lacking as well were some proper character usage.  Most notably, the four elementario fairies.  Personally, I would\'ve liked to see Sylphid, Muse, Kobiri, and Salama have a lot more screentime in the series.  The series went to the effort of devoting the ending song to these four, making them the star of it, which really didn\'t reflect on how they were treated in the series since they really only got one episode to devote to them, making them just as important as all the other side characters in the series.  Amagi made them look more important than they actually were, so that was a bit disappointing to see.Apart from them, we have side characters, a lot of them.  in every single episode, the series introduces new members of the park, both new ones and ones we haven\'t met, adding to the ever expanding cast.  What makes these supporting cast members somewhat memorable is both their design, and how they make use of their small bits of screentime.  (But mostly their appearance)  They make the park seem populated with workers, and that\'s really about all they do.Overview:+  Memorable cast+  Interesting main characters+/-  Unfinished character development-  Supporting cast was a bit too expansive and some weren\'t handled too wellArt and Sound (8.08/10):  Amagi was produced by Kyoto Animation, the same studio that did Haruhi and Lucky Star.  The animation for Amagi does look very high quality.  The colors for the show are very bright-looking, giving off that storybook/fairytale kind of feel due to how primary and light all the characters look.  In addition, the characters look rather simple.  There\'s not an absurd amount of decoration in them, but they look very pleasing to the eye.  All in all, the art is definitely fantastic to look at.  It\'s nice and simple, crafted very nicely, but it isn\'t particularly standout in comparison to other shows.  (That being said, we do have this show to thank for the phrase ""Kyo-Ani Butt"")As for sound, the show boasts a good duo of opening and ending songs with each of them serving different purposes.  The opening sort of gives off the tone of what you can expect when watching Amagi, starting with a wind-up music box tone before showering you with chords, saying that you\'re not watching a fairy tale, this is real, and it\'s fantastic.  In contrast, the ending does the opposite, giving off a whimsical tone and sound as it sings about the elemntario fairies and the four elements that they ""control"" (since they can barely summon water, wind, earth, or fire.)  The ending may or may not stick to your head, but the opening surely can.  (Just listen to the first 10 seconds if you don\'t know what I\'m talking about.)Overview:+  Good art+  Memorable musicPersonal Enjoyment (8.33/10):  Kyo-Ani has been a good studio for me to watch from.  The stuff that they produce appeals to me and gives me a sense of enjoyment.  This show was no different.  When I found the concept of an amusement park being an anime setting, I thought to myself, ""Ok, what kind of shit are they going to make here?"", cause anime has decent comedy from a lot of different settings.  (such as high school, working at a family restaurant, and even about buying from a supermarket for god\'s sakes.)  When I watched the show, I was pleasantly surprised, keeping at it because this was a show I genuinely enjoyed.Did I like this series?Yeah, I did.  The show did keep me intrigued by switching the focus from one part of the park to another, keeping the show fresh with new side characters in order to give the audience a new experience.  In addition, the show did add character growth to its main protagonist, which was a nice plus for the series.  Also, the freaking fairies in this series drink beer.  Have you ever seen a violent mouse with a hat, a perverted pink cat, and a dissatisfied sheep guzzle a couple pints like it was their life?  Thought so.What didn\'t I like about this series?Well, aside from the horrendously out of place final episode, the show didn\'t really make use of the backstories that it had set for some of its characters.  We don\'t really get to know why Kanie quit his child star career, or why that last-minute protagonist did what he did, or even like the future of Amagi.  Cause I really want to know what happens afterwords.  The main characters didn\'t get I feel, enough of a backstory.  They feel incomplete, and I wish we could get just a little bit more bang for our 30 yen entry fee.Would I recommend this series?Honestly, yes, I would.  It\'s a great little comedy series that doesn\'t really take itself too seriously.  It\'s a nice comedy show that provides some very memorable characters, and even a few choice moments that are actually quite memorable.  While the character development is a bit lacking in that department, and the large amount of side characters may or may not be distracting, Amagi Brilliant Park is a nice place to visit, and I hope you may all visit again.P.S.  Salama best girl.  You are free to disagree in my comments.Overall Score: 7.48/10 amusement park, he reluctantly goes, before seeing the poor, poor state that Amagi Brilliant Park is in.The Story of Amagi follows a rather simple plot line.

In the series, she\'s not really made out to be a prominent character, but more like an important character that doesn\'t show up much kind of character.  She doesn\'t have a very large presence in the series overall, and mostly only gets proper screentime and plot importance later on.  She has a decent enough backstory to support her character, but I really wish we could get a little bit more from her timewise because she was an adored character that we don\'t really get to see.  The other three I mentioned play as a sort of comedy trio, being somewhat essential to the plot by being the park\'s main three mascots, creating comedy moments and sometimes conflict, along the way.What the series does have lacking as well were some proper character usage.  Most notably, the four elementario fairies.  Personally, I would\'ve liked to see Sylphid, Muse, Kobiri, and Salama have a lot more screentime in the series.  The series went to the effort of devoting the ending song to these four, making them the star of it, which really didn\'t reflect on how they were treated in the series since they really only got one episode to devote to them, making them just as important as all the other side characters in the series.  Amagi made them look more important than they actually were, so that was a bit disappointing to see.Apart from them, we have side characters, a lot of them.  in every single episode, the series introduces new members of the park, both new ones and ones we haven\'t met, adding to the ever expanding cast.  What makes these supporting cast members somewhat memorable is both their design, and how they make use of their small bits of screentime.  (But mostly their appearance)  They make the park seem populated with workers, and that\'s really about all they do.Overview:+  Memorable cast+  Interesting main characters+/-  Unfinished character development-  Supporting cast was a bit too expansive and some weren\'t handled too wellArt and Sound (8.08/10):  Amagi was produced by Kyoto Animation, the same studio that did Haruhi and Lucky Star.  The animation for Amagi does look very high quality.  The colors for the show are very bright-looking, giving off that storybook/fairytale kind of feel due to how primary and light all the characters look.  In addition, the characters look rather simple.  There\'s not an absurd amount of decoration in them, but they look very pleasing to the eye.  All in all, the art is definitely fantastic to look at.  It\'s nice and simple, crafted very nicely, but it isn\'t particularly standout in comparison to other shows.  (That being said, we do have this show to thank for the phrase ""Kyo-Ani Butt"")As for sound, the show boasts a good duo of opening and ending songs with each of them serving different purposes.  The opening sort of gives off the tone of what you can expect when watching Amagi, starting with a wind-up music box tone before showering you with chords, saying that you\'re not watching a fairy tale, this is real, and it\'s fantastic.  In contrast, the ending does the opposite, giving off a whimsical tone and sound as it sings about the elemntario fairies and the four elements that they ""control"" (since they can barely summon water, wind, earth, or fire.)  The ending may or may not stick to your head, but the opening surely can.  (Just listen to the first 10 seconds if you don\'t know what I\'m talking about.)Overview:+  Good art+  Memorable musicPersonal Enjoyment (8.33/10):  Kyo-Ani has been a good studio for me to watch from.  The stuff that they produce appeals to me and gives me a sense of enjoyment.  This show was no different.  When I found the concept of an amusement park being an anime setting, I thought to myself, ""Ok, what kind of shit are they going to make here?"", cause anime has decent comedy from a lot of different settings.  (such as high school, working at a family restaurant, and even about buying from a supermarket for god\'s sakes.)  When I watched the show, I was pleasantly surprised, keeping at it because this was a show I genuinely enjoyed.Did I like this series?Yeah, I did.  The show did keep me intrigued by switching the focus from one part of the park to another, keeping the show fresh with new side characters in order to give the audience a new experience.  In addition, the show did add character growth to its main protagonist, which was a nice plus for the series.  Also, the freaking fairies in this series drink beer.  Have you ever seen a violent mouse with a hat, a perverted pink cat, and a dissatisfied sheep guzzle a couple pints like it was their life?  Thought so.What didn\'t I like about this series?Well, aside from the horrendously out of place final episode, the show didn\'t really make use of the backstories that it had set for some of its characters.  We don\'t really get to know why Kanie quit his child star career, or why that last-minute protagonist did what he did, or even like the future of Amagi.  Cause I really want to know what happens afterwords.  The main characters didn\'t get I feel, enough of a backstory.  They feel incomplete, and I wish we could get just a little bit more bang for our 30 yen entry fee.Would I recommend this series?Honestly, yes, I would.  It\'s a great little comedy series that doesn\'t really take itself too seriously.  It\'s a nice comedy show that provides some very memorable characters, and even a few choice moments that are actually quite memorable.  While the character development is a bit lacking in that department, and the large amount of side characters may or may not be distracting, Amagi Brilliant Park is a nice place to visit, and I hope you may all visit again.P.S.  Salama best girl.  You are free to disagree in my comments.Overall Score: 7.48/10', 'I started watching Amagi Brilliant Park, with a mindset ""I am gonna drop this after a few episodes."" A killer start and a hilarious graduation of sit-com, throughout the series, got me hooked and now I am craving for more.The first two episodes builds up the goal of the story. After that, it switches to a slice of life and comedy style of story telling, where this goal is still present, but in a background in a unintrusive form. I think it helps to enjoy the characters and the fantasy elements even more.The anime adapts the light novels in a non-chronological order and changes a...few details in characters. Although these details are not that important and will not make the anime feel chaotic and out of touch with the novels. (I would pick up the light novels, but there is no translation group that picked it up and yen press didn\'t license it so far.)The main character is dominant during the story. Well, he is more of an ""OK"" character, but I had more fun and enjoyment with the fantasy side characters. The way they adapted to the world is hilarious. They have the best lines and moments in the story. few details in characters. Although these details are not that important and will not make the anime feel chaotic and out of touch with the novels.

You are not watching some kids trying to save the world, or some evil zombie feast, or even (un)popular-guy-loved-by-every-girl-he-talks-to.  Aamgi Brilliant Park is brilliant, entertaining and never fails to amaze.(MOSTLY) GOOD - StoryThe series quickly established the premise: the run-down Amagi Brilliant Park, owned by a princess from a land of magic, is in dire situation.  Unless it reaches the yearly quota of half a million visitors in the next three months, it faces foreclosure.  The only saviour is in the form of Kanie Seiya, a narcissistic high school student...who, after much needed coaxing, promised to help out as the park's new manager.Theme park management is probably the last thing you have in mind when it comes to anime.  It works brilliantly as a game (too many theme park sim game to name here), but as an anime, you might think that it would be a tough nut to crack.  Well, Amaburi gladly proves you wrong.  Amaburi is one of the funniest anime in recent time, and it comes down to the story and the characters.Each episode is an adventure.  Being a comedy, one would expect the adventure to turn into something that never goes according to plan.  The comedy hits just the right spot at the right time.  Sometimes it is when you least expected it and sometimes you can see it from miles away.  Each episode is a self-contained story, with the overall arc being played out in the background.  That is, until the last few episodes when it is number crunching time.  That's when the story picks up pace.  Rest assured, the ending is well written (for the most part) without feeling rushed.  In fact, I think the series has good pace overall.Without the overarching story of the threat of closure, this anime could go on forever.One thing that I like about this anime is that it does not rely (solely) on ecchi to sell the show.  Sure, you get great fan service (check out those racks on Sento!), but they only tell part of the story.  This show is driven by the humorous writing and great characters.  You would develop feelings for the park as it is transferred from the ICU to the general ward as it can now breathe normally without life support.  But will the park be able to leave the hospital in full health, or will its condition suddenly turn south?  You will have to watch it for yourself.However, Amaburi is not without its problem.  Because each episode is a self-contained story, sometimes it loses track of the overall picture.  Sure, they are great fun to watch.  But it might not actually have anything to do with saving the park.  I feel that some of the episodes could be done as an OVA while the main series should be concentrated on how Kanie uses his (alleged) brilliance to save the park from collapse.GOOD - Character developmentThere are plenty of characters in Amagi Brilliant Park, but we only get to know a handful of them.For those who we do get to see, they are well rounded and full of energy.  Each character has his / her own personality, not your typical cardboard cut-out character.  Kanie Seiya, while being an egoistic teenager, is actually quite caring and loves his job.  Isuzu Sento is a stoic blank face on the surface, but she has a great sense of responsibility and would do anything in her ability to complete her task.The secondary characters like the three main mascots and the four elementary fairies are well loved and have a great sense of humour.  Those viewers with keen eyes might recognise the remarkable resemblance between Moffle and Bonta-kun’s from Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu.  And given the nature of FMP? Fumoffu, one could not be faulted for associating Moffle with comedy.The three mascots in particular (Macaron, Tiramie and Moffle) is a major source of entertainment.  Macaron is divorced and refused to pay child support, Tiramie is really a pervert at heart, and Moffle has a violent tendency.  You really can't judge the book by its cover.One strength of the series is letting the characters shine in their own light.  There are episodes where our main characters have little impact on the outcome.  However, this is a double edged sword.  As it stands, letting other characters take the spotlight unfortunately detract the main story line.  A better way would have been letting other characters come up with ways to resolve some of the issues facing the park, rather than the scenarios that ended up in the anime.I would love to see other characters being introduced in the series, but sadly, the anime is too short to fully explore the so many lively characters that is employed in the park.GOOD - AnimationThe background is colourful and vibrant.  The drawings are crisp, and animation is smooth.  Character design is adequate.  The three main mascots are mascots, so you do not get to see costumes changes.  Other mascots stays the same throughout the series.   Kanie and Isuzu mostly donned the Amaburi uniform, albeit with seasonal variants.  I can count on two hands the number of outfits that Sento wears.If fan service is what you are after, there are plenty of that too, though not as much as the creators wanted them to be.  But then again, there is something call the 'internet'.  Some search results might come up quite 'revealing'.BAD - Not Enough Kanie MagicI might be nit-picking here, but we have already established in the first episode that Kanie has been gifted with magic that can read minds.  Unfortunately we don't get to see nearly enough instances where his uses magic to his advantage.  We see Isuzu with her guns from you-know-where, I mean, god-knows-where magic trick every second episode, but in the case of Kanie, I think it has potential to make a regular appearance.  Maybe we can get some comedy out of him reading the minds of guests.OVERALLThe eponymous Amagi Brilliant Park is anything but brilliant.  The park is in such disarray that it is a surprise that there are visitor at all.  But through aggressive marketing and the (alleged) brilliance of Kanie's management skills, the park is slowly brought back to life.  The anime is a journey to that end.  Though it sometimes detracts from its main goal, Amaburi managed to stay on track long enough to keep the audience interested.The anime is a great fun to watch, though that are many potential areas that are left untouched.  Hopefully they could be addressed / expand in future seasons.  Every character has his/her own personality that makes the team so different and dynamic.  The OP and ED have the typical JPOP feel, and the music, though not memorable, is quite soothing to listen to.  The animation is marvellous.  Plot is great, entertainment and funny.

The story was well set up and introduced with easy to recognise and interesting characters. the first 4/5 episodes are related to the over-arching story of needing guests with a few ""character helping"" episodes in between before finishing the main story. i normally hate this format as it means my fat 300lb ass has to sit through more aneemay and spend less time shaking hands with my man downstairs but it was very enjoyable, each episode had its...own charm and interesting conflict, i was never once bored watching this show. it was well combined humour and character/plot development. at 12 episodes long, it did well to tell a good story with a decent level of depth in an entertaining manner.The strongest point of this show by far was the characters. I dont think ive ever liked a set of characters as much as this set.The main character in particular was one of the most ""normal"" well rounded characters ive seen. It pisses me off when the main characters of typical shows get all shy when talking to girls, shy when bikini/sex related stuff comes up and just tries to be a goody two shoes in general. He was real, he did things to piss people off, he played the bad guy, he could actually hold a conversation with an attractive girl (much like me irl m\'lady *tips federer* (yes i am single. my number is 6942042069)) he wasnt over exaggerated and did shit done without being too personal about it. No i am not homo for this guy but he was funny, had a complex and has a great bum.the supporting cast was also well constructed with sufficient development to the extent that i could enjoy every appearance. the three bunnies in the costume were particularly hilarious. their male urges displayed by such a cute and innocent exterior was refreshing to say the least and very all around entertaining.There wasnt much i didnt like about the show.

What\'s not unique or amusing about a bunch of drunk, lewd-minded mascots running around a magical decrepit amusement park?I honestly thought every aspect of this anime was really well balanced.

I'll admit, I literally had no idea how the hell that was going to happen before I tuned into Amagi Brilliant Park.  This is one of those shows that grabbed my goldfish attention span with a sticky glove and refused to let me get to my ever-growing backlog.  I was in the mood for a lighthearted series with lots of laughs and colorful pizzazz, nothing more.  What Amagi delivered ended up...being a pleasant surprise in the slew of mediocre shows coming out these days.  And I don't give out 7's to just any show … well maybe I do.Amagi Brilliant Park is a story about a perfectionist high school student named Seiya Kanie with a knack of pissing off literally everyone around him with his incessant narcissism.  I mean the dude is named after Kanye West! I feel that speaks volumes of his character and personality from the get go.  Through a date arrangement with a fairy royal guard member named Isuzu Sento, he is tirelessly recruited into helping a magical theme park help to restore its popularity and subsequent revenues in order to stay in business.  The entire effort is led by a frail Princess named Latifah Leuranza (named after Queen Latifah herself) who was crippled by a magical wizard and forced into a permanent form of a 14 year old for eternity.  I know this sounds ridiculous (and it is), but bear with me.  Once Seiya delves deeper into helping the park's members out, he quickly realizes how deep in doodoo they actually are.The story isn't generic by any means, so I have to award some credit for originality.  However, it doesn't entirely avoid pitfalls that most short animes fall into (plot holes, under-developed antagonists).  Also, although adapted from a Light Novel by Shoji Gatoh, there are certain parts of the this adaptation that didn't translate over to the anime.  I tend to forgive this small issue, since I don't really read manga to begin with.  I mean, think of how many movies differ from their associated novels.  Seiya has a large number of interesting interactions with the other park employees as well, including plentiful physical altercations with Latifah's uncle Moffle (yes, he's actually a mouse and yes, he's the same Moffle from Full Metal Panic if you didn't already realize that).  At first, it just seems as though the reasoning for Amagi Brilliant Park needing to acquire more guests and popularity is purely monetary, but an unfolding backstory backstory of how the park was created sheds new light on that opinion.  Since the park is “magical”, it relies on assimilated energy from the guests happiness due to visiting the park to stay in operation.All magic and character antics aside, the writers actually do a decent job at making you feel a sense of empathy for the magical fairies that reside at the park.  You end up cheering them on to get the amount of guests they need for that day, as well as shedding tears when things don't quite go their way.  Seiya does a fantastic job at playing the leader and manager as well, and he's initially very honest with them about how much they suck at being adequate magical carneys.  I mean that IS what they are, right?  Also, through the weeds of hilarity and vulgarity, there are quite a number of uplifting morals contained in Amagi.  I wouldn't necessarily let young children watch it (thanks Tiramie!), but even the pretentious intellectuals of the anime community could find one less anime to shit on for not being intellectually challenging enough.There are a boat load of characters to enjoy in Amagi Brilliant Park.  Seiya is initially the MC you love to hate, constantly admiring himself in the mirror and putting his vanity on display, but he contains a reasonable amount of depth as the series progresses.  Not only do we get to understand why he is such an asshole, but the writers also shed some light on his child-acting past and his previous ties to Amagi Brilliant Park itself.  I always enjoy animes with protagonists I don't want to take a figurative shit all over due to their annoying sense tropey-ness.  Isuzu is a great character balance to Seiya in many ways.  She's no yandere, but she does have deadpan humor (or no humor for that reason), and can tend to violently police Seiya and the other members of Amagi's cast.  Not to mention that she's got the looks and endowment to make her a staple on any pleb's waifu list.  I wouldn't be surprised if one or more otakus out there had a pillow made of her after the show aired.  Latifah is frail and often passes out during periods of too much physical exertion, but she does make some good food.  Oddly enough, she was also blind in the light novel, but perhaps the anime directors assumed this would distract viewers from the rest of the story.  Besides her over-arcing role, she didn't really get much more depth.The supporting cast has something for everyone.  The aforementioned anime-jumping Moffle often scuffles with Seiya, and he has a tendency to fly off the handle, but when it comes to his niece Latifah, he plays a softy in every way.  Moffles best friends are Tiramie, a pink pomeranian and Macaron, a male sheep who plays the violin and can be somewhat of a dead beat.  Tiramie is hands down one of the funniest anime characters I've ever come across.  The constant perverted jokes and cat-calls he makes at women coupled with a love for explosives ensures there's never a dull moment with him around.  I literally went almost the entire show without realizing he was not a girl.  This dude is fucking hilarious! There's also 4 voluptuous vixens that double as the Elementario fairies, each with a unique personality but they often fight as a result.  They provide the seemingly necessary fan service in Amagi.  This anime has such an insane amount of characters, that I couldn't list them all, but due to this a problem arises with character development.  It's really only there for Seiya and Isuzu.  I would almost argue that this show doesn't need it to keep me entertained, but it would probably catapult even higher on my list if that were the case.It can be really hard to rate the art in modern animes.  I mean, it's kind of all starting to look the same if you think about it.  In Amagi's case, the art style neither helps nor hurts it as an overall series.  It's pretty to look at, but if you really pick it apart I'm sure you could find plenty of tiny things that would irritate your pompous critical side.  I can applaud the relatively complex character models this series possesses between the animals and inanimate objects that are personified and made lively and colorful.  The voice acting is well done, and not to sound like a fanboy or anything, but Ai Nonaka did fantastic as Tiramie.  Well, at least I was correct in my presuming the role was played by a girl...  I also thoroughly enjoyed the opening of Amagi.  It really pumps you up for each episode.  I feel that an OP should either add some depth to the series, or get you excited for the upcoming episode.  Sometimes it's like the producers say, “here's this semi-intelligent premise, oh and here is some random ass OP that has completely ruins the vibe the show was going for.”  The ED was nothing special, and being that it was only 12 episodes, I felt that it was better to just binge instead.  Sound effects were spot on, and the rest of the OST was okay, but I never really noticed there was background music to begin with.I thoroughly enjoyed Amagi Brilliant Park for what it was.  The series was a slight anecdote to my backlog and it fill well as both a comedy and a motivational genre.  I would recommend this series to someone who just wants to take a break from all the shounen or serious animes they've been watching as of late.  Although I don't expect this world to be explored again, I think it act as a pillar for a series of sequels, if it were in the writer's future plans.  Thanks for reading! being a pleasant surprise in the slew of mediocre shows coming out these days.  And I don't give out 7's to just any show … well maybe I do.Amagi Brilliant Park is a story about a perfectionist high school student named Seiya Kanie with a knack of pissing off literally everyone around him with his incessant narcissism.  I mean the dude is named after Kanye West! I feel that speaks volumes of his character and personality from the get go.  Through a date arrangement with a fairy royal guard member named Isuzu Sento, he is tirelessly recruited into helping a magical theme park help to restore its popularity and subsequent revenues in order to stay in business.  The entire effort is led by a frail Princess named Latifah Leuranza (named after Queen Latifah herself) who was crippled by a magical wizard and forced into a permanent form of a 14 year old for eternity.  I know this sounds ridiculous (and it is), but bear with me.  Once Seiya delves deeper into helping the park's members out, he quickly realizes how deep in doodoo they actually are.The story isn't generic by any means, so I have to award some credit for originality.  However, it doesn't entirely avoid pitfalls that most short animes fall into (plot holes, under-developed antagonists).  Also, although adapted from a Light Novel by Shoji Gatoh, there are certain parts of the this adaptation that didn't translate over to the anime.  I tend to forgive this small issue, since I don't really read manga to begin with.  I mean, think of how many movies differ from their associated novels.  Seiya has a large number of interesting interactions with the other park employees as well, including plentiful physical altercations with Latifah's uncle Moffle (yes, he's actually a mouse and yes, he's the same Moffle from Full Metal Panic if you didn't already realize that).  At first, it just seems as though the reasoning for Amagi Brilliant Park needing to acquire more guests and popularity is purely monetary, but an unfolding backstory backstory of how the park was created sheds new light on that opinion.  Since the park is “magical”, it relies on assimilated energy from the guests happiness due to visiting the park to stay in operation.All magic and character antics aside, the writers actually do a decent job at making you feel a sense of empathy for the magical fairies that reside at the park.  You end up cheering them on to get the amount of guests they need for that day, as well as shedding tears when things don't quite go their way.  Seiya does a fantastic job at playing the leader and manager as well, and he's initially very honest with them about how much they suck at being adequate magical carneys.  I mean that IS what they are, right?  Also, through the weeds of hilarity and vulgarity, there are quite a number of uplifting morals contained in Amagi.  I wouldn't necessarily let young children watch it (thanks Tiramie!), but even the pretentious intellectuals of the anime community could find one less anime to shit on for not being intellectually challenging enough.There are a boat load of characters to enjoy in Amagi Brilliant Park.  Seiya is initially the MC you love to hate, constantly admiring himself in the mirror and putting his vanity on display, but he contains a reasonable amount of depth as the series progresses.  Not only do we get to understand why he is such an asshole, but the writers also shed some light on his child-acting past and his previous ties to Amagi Brilliant Park itself.  I always enjoy animes with protagonists I don't want to take a figurative shit all over due to their annoying sense tropey-ness.  Isuzu is a great character balance to Seiya in many ways.  She's no yandere, but she does have deadpan humor (or no humor for that reason), and can tend to violently police Seiya and the other members of Amagi's cast.  Not to mention that she's got the looks and endowment to make her a staple on any pleb's waifu list.  I wouldn't be surprised if one or more otakus out there had a pillow made of her after the show aired.  Latifah is frail and often passes out during periods of too much physical exertion, but she does make some good food.  Oddly enough, she was also blind in the light novel, but perhaps the anime directors assumed this would distract viewers from the rest of the story.  Besides her over-arcing role, she didn't really get much more depth.The supporting cast has something for everyone.  The aforementioned anime-jumping Moffle often scuffles with Seiya, and he has a tendency to fly off the handle, but when it comes to his niece Latifah, he plays a softy in every way.

Thanks for reading!"", ""Amaburi is a place of dreams, hope and enjoyment... That's how the premise was supposed to start and yet— it was the usual reverse-psychology plotting. Bad advertisements, poorly maintenance on the attractions, wacky dolts as entertainers. The hectare field of an amusement park is the setting where magical elements is the focal point. Oh yeah, we can already see how it'll go.The synopsis have given me a rough idea on what Amagi Brilliant Park is. A place where bankruptcy is knocking at their door's end, a saving hero will turn the situation 180 and happy ending is achieved. Starting with an original MC plus the...interesting three stooges along with beautiful girls with large circle eyes, I had myself hooked up from the first episode.Story: 7/10Solid writing. The author didn't bother making the story complex to garner the watcher's interest. It is also the winning formula of Amaburi. As far as the story goes, the series only had one problem, 'How to win 500k customers in a limited time'. Within this hurdle comes along many variations on which it gave us a good watch for a 13 episode long title.Art/Sound: 9/10Usual Kyo-Ani standard. Frankly, I am really not a moe enthusiast but Amagi's art department is such a hard thing to resist. I find myself liking every character, whether he/she be a supernatural like Moffle and his two friends to the ever beautiful Sento Isuzu, Latifa plus the rest of the chicks. Everyone has a good art, not only the characters but the amusement park itself.Sound is good as well. I play a little piano and soon as I finished watching the series, I started poking the keys just to make the tune of the ending which I really, really like... Bgms are also fitting. Whether it be a sad tune due to a predicament or an exciting one because of a hype twist. Nothing beats good music when you're watching a good show. It's a must and Amaburi had played their aces well.Character: 10/10Perfect characters. Of course, the crew is vast so only the highlighted characters are the ones I'm talking about. Kanie Seiya f.e. This guy is just too original. Unlike overpowered MC and flawless bishounens, Kanie himself had the fundamentals of being one of the generic but hey, turns out he's the 'real' deal. Whether it be his past or his series actions, he was always a good and entertaining watch. In the end, realizing that 'no man is an island' he came to accept everyone despite his terrible narcissism. That itself makes his worthy of his screentime. Plus it's also thanks to his VA who wonderfully depicted the character.Sento and the other girls. Oh damn, these girls are just too beautiful. Sento and Latifa in particular, who would obviously turn Kanie's romantic interest if a sequel lits up in the future. Sento, who also got a terrible view on how to associate herself and Latifa, who at first episode, looked like she was bothered by a terminal disease. Oh man, she's just too adorable. Honorable mentions are the fairies. Muse, who got the most screentime definitely looks my type of girl but hey, Amagi's girl are all my types. Please don't touch them... XDLastly, I wouldn't miss the three Amagi pillars. Most especially, my favorite character in the series, Tiramie. This dirty old dude is just too good. I had myself on a laughtrip because of his antics. Whether he be deliberate on doing rotten lewd acts or just too stupid to do things right, he is just awesome...Enjoyment/Overall: 9For a normal 13 episode series. Some tends to do things like inserting irrelevant fillers. I don't read the reference. But if Amagi has one, then its filler is still wonderfully threaded to its main story. As per my mention above, the story is still the main winning formula. Not too complicated to the point it tried too hard yet not too lax to the point it never tried anything. The story is very easy to empathize and easy to appreciate.Concluding, if there's another standout gem last season including Bahamut:Geness, then it's definitely Amagi Brilliant Park. Good laughs, good story, good characters, minimal fanservice. The 13 episodes will keep your time worthy of watching, will keep you on your seat entertained and will never leave you bored. A recommended watch for everybody. So come and watch Amagi Brilliant Park and wish for a sequel in the future! interesting three stooges along with beautiful girls with large circle eyes, I had myself hooked up from the first episode.Story: 7/10Solid writing.

I will try to not spoil anything, though I am not very experienced with writing reviews so we shall see how this goes, please understand Senpai.Amagi Brilliant Park boasts beautiful animation and a beautiful soundtrack (I love the opening theme). Kyoto Animation does what they do best with stunning art and a memorable soundtrack, combined with a frenzy of laughs. Every episode is humorous and worth the watch, never does an episode seem to overstay its welcome (If only all comedies could be like this).Our main character.Kanie,...is dragged to an amusement park by fellow student Sento (sound familiar? Well kinda) Where he is told that he must help magical strangers attract guests, with the intention of saving the park. Kanie must hit a target goal of 500,000, or the park will be shutdown. Seems rather lighthearted, and it really is, however as we move along we see a plot start to develop, one that really brings out the hero (If that is really a word to describe Kanie)  in our lovable mc Kanie.Kanie may be the center of attention, but the other characters get a solid share of the spotlight. Each character contributes to the comedy in his or her own unique way. Each one has it\'s own purpose and none of the characters feel out of place...or maybe they are all out of place so it works out...idk.At the end of the day, Amagi Brilliant Park is not on my ""must watch"" list when recommending anime to friends, but it is however just below that magical. I would recommend Amagi Brilliant Park to anyone looking for a lighthearted anime. The comedy is well executed, and is enhanced by a wonderful soundtrack and beautiful art. It does not introduce any new concepts, but it is a great example of the tried and true, and if you give this enjoyable series a watch, you might just find something magical. is dragged to an amusement park by fellow student Sento (sound familiar?

Where your manager is a high-school student and 70% of the staff aren't human.Story: 8/10The story is actually quite original, as I have never seen an anime dedicated to a theme park the perspectives of staff working in it. The story was solid, but sometimes it would drag out, though that didn't affect the story that much, as it was more interesting than boring even though there wasn't any action scenes at all. It was funny to see how each character responds to each reaction, because some of their reactions can be really stupid. There's harem in the anime,...but it's barely noticeable because some of them don't show their feelings that much. Same goes with romance, but later on the anime Isuzu starts to show some interest in Kanie. There's actually fan-service in the anime, but it's mild.Art: 10/10The art is amazing, but expected from an anime that finished airing at the end of 2014. The animation is smooth and the colors are darn bright and eye-catching.Sound: 8/10The OST in the anime was used whenever it was necessary and matched the each scene the OST was used in. Even though the OP was catchy, it didn't quite fit the anime. I'd think that the OP was more for an action + romance anime. The ED has lyrics that fit the 4 element characters (water, fire, wind and earth) and does fit the happy theme of the anime.Character: 9/10If I were to classify a character as a bad one, it would have to be someone who is really annoying and easily gets on my nerves. Did this anime have anyone like that? Nope.Kanie Seiya, the main protagonist of the story who likes to compliment himself, like telling him that himself he is a perfect 10 in any outfit. He's a very cocky person, but is also hardworking, to the point where he would do anything just to save a person from dying.Sento Isuzu, a monotone character because of her background. She uses guns to threaten people into helping her, because she doesn't know how to ask politely. A very mysterious character and has funny responses, such as crying to a very badly produced video.Fleuranza Latifa, a very calm, kind and elegant character. She is the type that has a strong heart on the outside, but is very emotional in the inside. Before you question yourself about her age, all I can say that is she isn't under-aged. A type of character who thinks of others before herself.Enjoyment: 10/10I really like this anime, mainly because it's new to me. Even though I'm used to action, this anime somewhat calms me down and makes me happy.Overall: 9/10If you're looking for something new and unique, then this anime might suit you. Would I re-watch it? Yas. but it's barely noticeable because some of them don't show their feelings that much. Same goes with romance, but later on the anime Isuzu starts to show some interest in Kanie. There's actually fan-service in the anime, but it's mild.Art: 10/10The art is amazing, but expected from an anime that finished airing at the end of 2014.

Yas."", ""Amagi Brilliant Park was mediocre and had very lopsided pacing. The idea of the story was meh to begin therefore its unfair to be too judgemental of the execution. The art and sound were all fine, thats not really an issue for me. Im more of a story and character guys so ill judge the show solely on those two elemts. As i said before the idea of the story is very underwhelming. The show is episodic in nature with each episode being either the addition of something to the park or some sort of scheme implemented by the main character to help drum up...business, there is slight variation but these are far and few between. The ending was very lackluster and unbearably predictable. This isnt inherently a bad thing however twords the end the story tried to focus on Latifa and tried to make the weight of the situation more intense. This really didnt do it for me because she was painfully underdeveloped and acted more as a motivation device to, as stated earlier, add urgency to the situation. Instead of caring about her well being because she expressed attractive character traits, the show tries to give her a pitiful backstory as well as a mysterious disease in order to tru and gain the empathy of the viewer. This to me was just lazy. I understand that they only had 12 episodes to work with but you would think one of the priorities should be developing your main plot device because without that development no one will care about the outcome of the entire show. Latifa isnt the only failure of a character in this show.The supporting characters are fine. They often have one episode in which there prescence is heavy then proceed to fall of in subsequent episodes. I could go on about how underdeveloped they are as well, but like Latifa, they are a plot device. The show shot for quantity of quality to try and increase the urgency. They wanted the effect that adding all these characters would add to scope of the park, making its closing affect such a great amount of characters. Thats fine no complaints. Im also categorizing the main three mascots as supporting characters as well because even though they have distinct personalities and offer something to the show in their own rite, i felt they as foils to the main characters was more important to the overall story. The only two characters i would consider to be main are kanie and sento. Kanie is a douchebag. Hes supposed to give off that impression that he truely cares about others but is afraid to let anyone get close to him and acts like a douche as a self defense mechanism. Thats fine. Original? Not by any stretch of the imagination, but fine. Mediocre mc is mediocre. Sento on the other hand had the potential to be a great character, but suffers from one of her iconic features, her gun. At first the gun was very interesting to me but got stale later on. I found it interesting that she ruled by fear and was tyrannical, but she did it all with good intentions. She didnt know anything but brute force so thats what she used to get results, but like any tyranical leadership, things fell apart, which of course she couldnt understand why. I liked this, i liked this a lot, but what killed it for me was when she used the gun to prevent character development. It was lazy writing. When someone would say something that made her uncomfortable such as bringing up Kanie as a potential partner for her, instead of literally any other reaction, she would just pull a gun on them and they would cease the discussion. This fits her character in the beginning because it is clearly a self defense mechanism, but later on as her character progresses, which is extremely slow due to her limited dialouge, it would make more sense for her to slowly ween herslef off the gun and then towards the end discard it as a mechanism entirely. She also suffers from being extremely one dimensional, the scenes where she displays a change in character are very few, as in maube 3 if you're lucky. Like i said her introduction was good and her psychological value was good in the beginning, but the show shifts too much attention away from her which is very unfortunate. business, there is slight variation but these are far and few between.

Logically then, there are going to be a very large number of truly great anime. But I haven’t watched them all, and probably never will. Why? Because I’m already having fun. Why am I having fun? Because I’m watching Amagi Brilliant Park.Kyoto Animation are the undisputed kings of the moe slice of life style. Anime like K-On are thoroughly enjoyable rides if you accept that Mio is just the best girl, whilst Clannad is a masterpiece of the anime world, despite the fact that Key are seemingly only capable of drawing side-characters with purple...hair. There is a sense of sameness though to a large number of Kyoto Ani’s shows, a sense that they’re a one trick pony. That is, until they released Amagi Brilliant Park. For better or for worse, Amagi Park is a noticeable departure from the standard mold, not least because it spends less than 99.99% of the time OUTSIDE a high-school.Amagi Brilliant Park is set in a magical amusement park. It’s populated a variety of chirpy characters, with talking animals, a fairy who thinks she’s a helicopter, and a dragon suffering from acute anxiety. Most importantly, it has Kanie Seiya: our narcissistic, arrogant and friendless protagonist. Yes, that was not a sentence I would ever have expected to write in a review for a Kyoto Ani show. For once, Seiya is not the layman protagonist who attracts girls with his aura of affability. I definitely wouldn’t say he brings an air of maturity to the KyoAni roster (far from it, he’s about as idealistic a character as you can get). What he does is bring a likeable cocky persona to the table. Cracks in his armour of confidence do begin to appear throughout the show though, and so Seiya thankfully isn’t all talk. He’s a fully-developed character, but simply chooses to hide behind an exterior that can get things done. It’s something that KyoAni show themselves capable of doing just as well as their Aizawas or their Tomoyas.As the protagonist, Seiya is tasked with rebuilding the park and attracting 250,000 visitors, or else the magical staff of the park will lose their popularity and die! He has no mean challenge ahead of him then, but the challenge itself though is not the focus of the show. Enter his side-kick and ‘obligatory KyoAni love interest’, our very own Isuzu Sento.Not quite a tsundere (lovey-dovey under a ‘it’s not like I only have eyes for you, baka’ layer), and at the same time, not quite a kuudere (lovey-dovey under a ‘I couldn’t care less if you fell out of that window’ layer). These are the two features that most define Sento. She is efficient, but trigger happy and very willing to pull out her trusty shotgun, often with hilarious if painful consequences. Although Sento suffers from a distinct case of inexplicable in-love-with-the-protagonist-for-no-particular reason-it is, she is still the more empathetic character of the two – she suffers from nervousness when interacting with others, often resorting to violence as she pulls her gun from underneath a skirt that seemingly holds TARDIS like qualities. Sento is loveable and entertaining in the very opposite way that Seiya is, but their chemistry is more than enough to drive the show, and largely overshadows the artificial drama set-up for each episode. No, there are no panty shots as a result of this ‘TARDIS’ skirt, but I hear Highschool of the Dead is very happy to see you now.You’ve probably noticed by now, but entertainment is an approach that plays a much larger part in Amagi Brilliant Park than in some of the more dramatic pieces Kyoto Ani has become known for – many episodes I did indeed find myself in tears, not from sadness, but from excessive laughter. The OP is insanely fun and catchy, and I’ve not seen anything quite as entertainingly ridiculous as when I watched three stuffed animals sitting down to a pint of beer, but it’s situations like these that Amagi revels in. There’s a good blend of more innocent and inventive humour more traditional to KyoAni, and a very adult, crude approach as well. It may be a KyoAni show set in an amusement park, but sometimes the show is anything but child-friendly!So I definitely enjoyed the show. There is a ‘but’ though. And that but is this: Amagi Park is very similar to many of the shounen anime out there. Amagi Park may be a departure from Kyoto Ani’s norm, and that’s to be welcomed, but it starts to become inseperable from other popular shounen titles in the process. Kanie Seiya’s cock-sure personality is something we’ve largely seen in shows like No Game No Life’s Sora. I have grown accustomed to Kyoto Ani shows emphasising the moe fan-service, and Amagi Park doesn’t buck this trend, but it introduces a surprisingly sexual sort of fanservice into the mix. It’s one of the few problems I have with the show: I wanted and expected to innocently enjoy this storyline, and on a few too many occasions I was vehemently obstructed by several busty pairs of PLOT (those milk secreting mammary glands females have).I should note that, for better or for worse, Amagi is simply not a finished story. It's got an ending that successfully manages to tie up the 13 episode series, there is still ample room left for what will presumably be another season. It’s not a bad ending, justifying the drama that had been building up the last couple of episodes, but it leaves me vaguely underwhelmed. Regardless, I look forward to the inevitable Amagi Brilliant Park!!/Amagi Brilliant Park: After Story.Amagi Brilliant Park is light-hearted and whimsical, largely satisfied to be nothing more than harmless fun and looking pretty great to boot. If you’ve enjoyed this year’s lineup of shounen anime, no doubt Amagi Brilliant Park will leave you satisfied. If you’re a KyoAni fan, you may find yourself disappointed with quite how the show doesn’t take itself seriously enough, and doesn’t feel quite finished. Ultimately though, you’ll probably find yourself surprised at how, even when it’s not particularly serious or a tearfest, the KyoAni magic is still there, making Amagi Brilliant Park both a visually impressive and wholly enjoyable anime.Recommendations: No Game No Life - Seiya and Sora are similar arrogant and good at getting the job done. Both are set in a fantastical world with magic, with a mixture of drama, comedy and fanservice. Also both need a season 2! hair.

They include manufacturing motorcycles, and owns the Mini and the Rolls-Royce. As much, with all the German engineering under the bonnet and tech-savvy interior, their cars are known to be rear-wheel drive (RWD), in which they handle well on oversteering and horsepower delivery. In 2015, they made a front-wheel drive (FWD) car for the first time, called the 2-series. BMW says it\'s a revolutionary car with all the commercials on saying how great and awesome and passion and won\'t be mistaken as your mum\'s car.That kind of ""revolutionary"" approach brings me to Kyoto Animation...(KyoAni), as they produced Amagi Brilliant Park (Amaburi in short) as the revolutionary anime they have, yet.And that\'s the problem, because it\'s like this: BMW is known for producing RWD cars, it\'s their trademark. It\'s the same way as KyoAni is known for the moe trademark they have established since the K-On--or even the Air era. Now, I\'m not saying that K-On or Air should be the basis for KyoAni\'s products, but like BMW producing FWD cars, is KyoAni doing something similar as they seem to be producing something that is...for their own first time, playing fire with the lesser kind of anime where its fantasy genre written only in paper. That\'s something that KyoAni is not known for.STORY = 7It\'s a story of reviving an amusement park (eponymous as it is), filled with magic elements, packed with reasons of how important the Amaburi amusement park is for the magical creatures, and plot and characterization ignites from there.Being magical, logic is excused here as most of the characters are the usual teens (Kanie-kun and Sento Isuzu are both 16) with their hands full of trying to revive the Amaburi itself. I mean, talk about legalities and debits and credits, net profits, taxes--put them in a box and throw \'em out the window. Rather than logic, you\'d better just focus on these: there\'s the fanservice team, a perfectionist-- rather narcissistic kind of male character, a princess who must be Dekomori\'s cousin, and a soldier from the magical land, and oh--living mascots, and supporting characters. All of them are tasked to attract 250,000 visitors for the Amaburi in a span of 3 months. At first glance, it has a huge potential, but somehow if it\'s KyoAni we\'re talking, we\'re demanding it to be KYOANI, the same way as if you\'d get a BMW and you\'re demanding it ofc to be a BMW (and not something from let\'s say, Hyundai).What actually happened was like, we expected KyoAni, and we got something that resembles JC Staff. Because even if I\'m not using K-On as the yardstick of this all, and I dunno if the Amaburi magic worked in your senses a little bit too well, but we\'re expecting KyoAni itself to be as moe-music-friendly as K-On, or sublime as Hyouka, or light-hearted slice-of-life as Tamako Market, or romcom as Chuunibyou, or flaring as Kyoukai no Kanata; perhaps even as memorable-dramatic as Clannad, and as emotional as Air. I could go on to be as wacky as Nichijou, or otaku-approved as Lucky Star, or as demanding as Haruhi Suzumiya.In Amagi Brilliant Park, what did we get exactly? We get ""revolution"". We get the ""new KyoAni"". See, this is just like how BMW made RWD cars for so long and suddenly started building FWD\'s.CHARACTER = 6They\'re as memorable as a shopping list: you remember them as you know what to do with it. It also has the KyoAni prowess of somehow, at least somehow, exercising character development.Again, as I\'ve said earlier, the story itself has a huge, and I mean very huge potential. KyoAni has made 23- or 24-eps back in the past, perhaps longer episodes can do well as to give enough space for the development, in which the plot will be delivered with characters that transcended as the number of episodes progressed.Kanie-kun was rigged from the start to be complex but unchanging \'til the end. Sento Isuzu is the ""best hot heroine"" according to otakus and fandoms and those from the magical doujin-land; I don\'t see why--except that she\'s the new fantasy material with her physical hot body and fanservice--but character-wise, she\'s the KyoAni\'s version of what a kuudere is, but that\'s it: she was predictable and nothing new or magical or developmental that happened to her. There\'s also Dekomori\'s seeming cousin, Latifa-sama, seems to be good enough as the foil character, but flat. The K-On look-alike fanservice team of Sylphy (resembling Mugi), Muse (resembling Yui), Kobori (resembling Mio), and Salama (resembling Ritsu) did well on their fanservice role, had a one-episode dedication for their development and was leave-able after.Then there\'s the trio of mascots: Moffle, Macaron, and Tiramie, whose main purpose was maybe, to become comic reliefs. Though Moffle is more of serving as a complex character to help junction the plot and explain the reasons. The other two, you will find them funny, that is, if you\'re a goober.SOUND = 8Usual J-pop songs with KyoAni-esque trademark in them since Hyouka, so I really don\'t need to complain. Picking the right seiyuus for the right roles have also been important, and with Ayako Kawasumi\'s performance as Moffle--and she\'s renowned as Saber--that\'s already a plus.ENJOYMENT = 5It\'s like enjoying what you can do with a tap water. You can put juice powder on it, ice, and stir.Amagi does that very well as you\'re hoping to get KyoAni elements but every episode seemed like it\'s convincing you on how ""new and revolutionary"" this is. Really, it\'s like BMW convincing you of their new and revolutionary 2-series.This is like convincing yourself that you\'re watching KyoAni\'s Amagi Brillaint Park and not Kagaku-railgun.If you\'ve gone to BMW and saw the 2-series yourself, it\'s pretty much like that: you\'re expecting a BMW, and it is revolutionary only because you\'ve never heard a front-driven BMW before.Somehow, people love Amaburi in a way that it\'s more sexy that you\'re seeing more skin, more Sento Isuzu, more of those fanservice fairy team which means more eyecandy, then less on moe-ness, more on read-between-the-line jokes, less on KyoAni trademark and feel in the end.OVERALL = 6If KyoAni defined this as their new quality, their new trademark ""flagship"" anime where from here on, they\'re going to be making more anime this way, then more otakus will rejoice. The minority here ain\'t otaku: we enjoy KyoAni as we like enjoying good quality shows that won\'t waste our time. But majority wins, I reckon.Ultimately, my review seems, as I want to say it, I derived it and wrote it thinking to be the KyoAni that I know, or used to know. It\'s like missing a friend who died or went away, and you know, you can\'t put this into exact words.What I can say is that, despite giving this as a rating of 6 because it\'s still a generally good anime to watch, but somehow it doesn\'t look like KyoAni at all. Really, it just looks like JC-Staff material. Revolution is a good thing, but a lot of times it\'s difficult. Acceptance is not the issue, because there\'s trademark in every namebrand: whether BMW, or Coke, or Marvel, or McDonalds, or Levi\'s, once you\'ve attached yourself to a namebrand, you\'ll ultimately know and feel it with its trademark. Amaburi just kind of lost the touches there--or if they haven\'t then they\'re the new trademark of KyoAni. It\'s still KyoAni by namebrand, but like the BMW 2-series, finding that out to be 3-cylinder front-drive is Hyundai material--when we\'re expecting for a BMW.Verdict: The majority screams for Amagi Brilliant Park is the new KyoAni. But I kind of miss the old KyoAni. (KyoAni), as they produced Amagi Brilliant Park (Amaburi in short) as the revolutionary anime they have, yet.And that\'s the problem, because it\'s like this: BMW is known for producing RWD cars, it\'s their trademark.

It also has the KyoAni prowess of somehow, at least somehow, exercising character development.Again, as I\'ve said earlier, the story itself has a huge, and I mean very huge potential. KyoAni has made 23- or 24-eps back in the past, perhaps longer episodes can do well as to give enough space for the development, in which the plot will be delivered with characters that transcended as the number of episodes progressed.Kanie-kun was rigged from the start to be complex but unchanging \'til the end. Sento Isuzu is the ""best hot heroine"" according to otakus and fandoms and those from the magical doujin-land; I don\'t see why--except that she\'s the new fantasy material with her physical hot body and fanservice--but character-wise, she\'s the KyoAni\'s version of what a kuudere is, but that\'s it: she was predictable and nothing new or magical or developmental that happened to her. There\'s also Dekomori\'s seeming cousin, Latifa-sama, seems to be good enough as the foil character, but flat. The K-On look-alike fanservice team of Sylphy (resembling Mugi), Muse (resembling Yui), Kobori (resembling Mio), and Salama (resembling Ritsu) did well on their fanservice role, had a one-episode dedication for their development and was leave-able after.Then there\'s the trio of mascots: Moffle, Macaron, and Tiramie, whose main purpose was maybe, to become comic reliefs. Though Moffle is more of serving as a complex character to help junction the plot and explain the reasons. The other two, you will find them funny, that is, if you\'re a goober.SOUND = 8Usual J-pop songs with KyoAni-esque trademark in them since Hyouka, so I really don\'t need to complain. Picking the right seiyuus for the right roles have also been important, and with Ayako Kawasumi\'s performance as Moffle--and she\'s renowned as Saber--that\'s already a plus.ENJOYMENT = 5It\'s like enjoying what you can do with a tap water. You can put juice powder on it, ice, and stir.Amagi does that very well as you\'re hoping to get KyoAni elements but every episode seemed like it\'s convincing you on how ""new and revolutionary"" this is. Really, it\'s like BMW convincing you of their new and revolutionary 2-series.This is like convincing yourself that you\'re watching KyoAni\'s Amagi Brillaint Park and not Kagaku-railgun.If you\'ve gone to BMW and saw the 2-series yourself, it\'s pretty much like that: you\'re expecting a BMW, and it is revolutionary only because you\'ve never heard a front-driven BMW before.Somehow, people love Amaburi in a way that it\'s more sexy that you\'re seeing more skin, more Sento Isuzu, more of those fanservice fairy team which means more eyecandy, then less on moe-ness, more on read-between-the-line jokes, less on KyoAni trademark and feel in the end.OVERALL = 6If KyoAni defined this as their new quality, their new trademark ""flagship"" anime where from here on, they\'re going to be making more anime this way, then more otakus will rejoice. The minority here ain\'t otaku: we enjoy KyoAni as we like enjoying good quality shows that won\'t waste our time. But majority wins, I reckon.Ultimately, my review seems, as I want to say it, I derived it and wrote it thinking to be the KyoAni that I know, or used to know. It\'s like missing a friend who died or went away, and you know, you can\'t put this into exact words.What I can say is that, despite giving this as a rating of 6 because it\'s still a generally good anime to watch, but somehow it doesn\'t look like KyoAni at all. Really, it just looks like JC-Staff material. Revolution is a good thing, but a lot of times it\'s difficult. Acceptance is not the issue, because there\'s trademark in every namebrand: whether BMW, or Coke, or Marvel, or McDonalds, or Levi\'s, once you\'ve attached yourself to a namebrand, you\'ll ultimately know and feel it with its trademark. Amaburi just kind of lost the touches there--or if they haven\'t then they\'re the new trademark of KyoAni. It\'s still KyoAni by namebrand, but like the BMW 2-series, finding that out to be 3-cylinder front-drive is Hyundai material--when we\'re expecting for a BMW.Verdict: The majority screams for Amagi Brilliant Park is the new KyoAni. But I kind of miss the old KyoAni.', ""I don't why people write long reviews a** reviews, cut down to the chase folks! Also, why is this anime rated a 7.72? This is a masterpiece! In my opinion.Story: 8/10Alright, when it comes to story, it's cliche, but in a excellent way. Read the synopsis. It's there right? I don't read the synopsis anyways, but to summarize the synopsis from what I've just watched, Kanie-kun (main character) becomes the 'chosen one' to save the park  --> Sento (also main character) takes him to Amagi Brilliant Park --> shows him around the park as they are in a dire situation --> Kanie-kun is informed...that he has less than three months to save the park and has to reach 250,000 visitors by the end of July 31st to save the park. BAM! That's how the story starts.(By the way, do not drop this anime because of episode 1. Things will start to pick up, I promise.)Sound: 8/10The OP matched the tone of this anime, as there was everything you can expect from the opening to the anime itself. The OP could never have done better. The ED was also great as well!Art: 10/10When it comes to the background and character designs, this anime is best as what it does when it comes to that. To the background and to the character designs, they were indeed fun to look at.Character(s): 10/10When it comes to the characters, there were a lot of characters. I mean, a lot. But each one of them were rememberable as each and every one of them had a quirky but unique and fun personality. Overall, this character lineup are the best I've seen in an anime. I loved all the characters in this anime. My favorite were Tiramie and Macaron, and you'll see why. Also, some of the characters names are reference to rappers, and you'll also see why.Enjoyment: 10/10I enjoyed this anime from beginning to end! Enjoyed the anime, OVAs, and specials. I binged watched it in one day. I definitely recommend this anime for everyone to watch!Overall:The story may be cliche, but it's uniqueness and creativity is what makes this anime never seen before. The art is excellent as you'll never get tired looking at the screen! The background to character designs are colorful and fun to look at. Your eyes will always be attached to the screen from beginning to end. Once you reached the end of an episode, you'll be wanting some more. The music is catchy and light-hearted as it does not get tiring to hear. You'll have a fun time learning from each of the characters personalities as each and one of them have sense of humor. You'll find each character is lovable as the story progress on. Most importantly, my enjoyment of this anime was a fun ride, as I never got bored watching this anime. Binged watched it from beginning to end. Also, give the OVAs and specials a shot as well! Amagi Brilliant Park, is indeed a brilliant park. Once, you'll reach the end of this anime series however, you'll be begging for more! Truly a masterpiece!P.S. By the way, expect fan service on its way during the first two episodes in the beginning of the anime. Just a heads up!P.S.S.

I hope there's a second season with romance!"", 'Ok, so the anime is over, Amagi Brilliant Park or Amaburi, pretty much a theme park where the main theme ""This is [not] a fantasy,"" ok, I can live with that, but really this is one good fantasy based anime where main theme goes around the supernatural humans living in the park, but enough of that, here are my ratings for this anime:StoryLike I\'ve said, it was one good fantasy based anime where a the fate of the theme park, that is about to get down on the dumps, rest on the shoulder of one guy-and you\'ve probably guess it, it\'s a guy who shares...the same name as Kim Kardashian\'s hubby, Kanye West, geeez I hate that guy. So, the story line was unique, sine we don\'t see a lot of magical being living among the human population and in a modern time. Also, the plot doesn\'t depend on the usual harem [cu\'z there isn\'t any] or the fanservice [where, there are quite a few] to entertain us audience, rather, the plot balances the slice of life element with a touche of drama and comedy. But, I still can\'t fathom the fact that is the usual high schooler who should grow up fast to do a job that should done by a grown up, so it\'s a 7 for this part.ArtI would have liked the illustrations of nearly every background and building in the anime, I would have like the way them mascots were drawn, but ther was still an ecchi element in the anime art pertaining to the characters, and I\'m referring to Sento\'s work outfit, I wuld have like seeing her wearing a professional business suit and high school uniform, but not her work clothes that is serious crime of fashion. The Elementaro\'s on the other hand, looked good in their street clothes, but in their work uniform........let\'s see, Muse and Salama really does make them look like performers, Sylphy, looks like a whore, while Koboli looks more like a stripper, since she is the only one whose panty is showing and if this anime has an fanservice element, it would be her. Nevertheless, one part of me like this animes art and another part of me is making a fuss over Sento\'s work clothes and Sylphy ad Koboli\'s work outfit, so, it\'s gonna be a 6 here.SoundI\'m giving it an  for the opening ""Extra Magic Hour"" by AKINO, and the closing ""Elementario de Aimashou"" by by BRILLIANT4 . I also like the karaoke scene where the Elementaro were stuck in some castle and have to sing a song \'Fantasy Time,"" so, it\'s an 8 for the sound.CharacterOk, I don\'t if it is true that Original Creator,  Gatoh, Shoji really, did based his characters name from famous rapper or movie stars, but one thing I know that, I didn\'t see any character name after, Soulja Boy, Snoop Dog, Pharrell or Rhianna... Ok, so lets go over to some of them:Seiya Kanie- I really can\'t fathom that he was left with the job that should be done by a grown-up, thought at time I kinda hated him for his Devil in Prada attitude towards the park\'s personnel, but then again it was that attitude that save the day for Latifa, so for him alone I have one reason to give this part a 7. I still don\'t get why his name was taken from Kim Kardashian\'s hubby, Kanye West, I nerve like the guy\'s rapping style, but I like his bad boy attitude.Latifa Fleuranza- I kind like her sweet and innocent traits, also her being this helpless hundred  year old girl {if that\'s how old is she} trapped in a  year body was something else, since it does add to this anime\'s sweet touch, so she is another reason why I\'m giving this part a 7.Sento Isuzu- I kinda like her for being this gun toting bitch who knows how to put those mascots in check, since it adds to this anime\'s comedy element, but I kinda hate her for being the cause of the park\'s further demise since it was her trigger finger that scares the shit outta everybody. It rather ambiguous if she has any romantic feels for Kanie nor does Kanie have any feelings for her, so one more reason for a  7 in this part.Moffle- Is one bad mascot that\'s funny.Tiramie- Is one perverted mascot that adds to this anime\'s comdey element.Macaron- Well, let\'s just say that he is part Moffle and part Tiramie in terms of his attitude.Elementaro- For a while they did provide the kind of spunk that adds to this anime\'s entertainment value, thought , Koboli still looks like a stripper and Sylph looks still looks like a whore, so it\'s my last reason to give this category a 7. Maybe, Orginal Creator,Gatoh, Shoji  should have given Muse the name Beyonce, Salama as Nick {Manja}, Sylph as Jennifer {Lopez} and Koboli as Rhianna.Enjoyment and Overall, where I giving both of it a 7.EnjoymentWell, it was enjoyable to a certain point, but I still can\'t fathom that such job is left to a kid.Overall-It was good, but not that good, since the anime as a whole indirectly makes the older characters like Ashe a fool.-Cu\'z there is their is a plot hole that conflicts Latifa\'s as to how she was able to remember Kanie when her info states that every Aug, she undergoes a kind of rewind that she\'ll forget everything as what has transpire during the course of her life. Then again , she is one sweet character.- There is also a plot hole as to how the wizard who to put a curse on Latifa manages to still be alive, when info states that Latifa\'s father had him killed, but then again, for a brief moment as  Takaya Kurisu, he did provide a certain climax to the anime.So, with my review done, I leave it to you muchahos out there to watch and judge for yourself. the same name as Kim Kardashian\'s hubby, Kanye West, geeez I hate that guy.

Everywhere you look inside are in shambles and everything has just fallen apart, forgotten by society. And now you have to make it popular once more, in 3 months.Is it possible?Amagi Brilliant Park tells the story of a boy in his attempts to revamp and bring this park into glory once more. This is what I think of this series.Story: 9/10So in short, it's about a boy who is forced into helping the park's staff attract more tourists into their park. Seems simple enough, which I find to...be really great. This is because 1) it's really simple to understand and follow their main motives without being drowned in subplots and 2) It really allows for other subplots to develop that bulks up the main plot as well.Art: 9/10The character designs are beautiful and very unique. The incorporation of the diverse, magical staff of the park (which I found to be particularly cute) as well as the humans (whose designs exceed my expectations) brings a wonderful-looking cast into play. The park itself doesn't look to bad either from a view.Sound: 8/10In regards to sound, I found the OP and ED to be perfectly fitting to the whimsical and comedic theme of Amagi Brilliant Park. Just listening to it brings a good vibe to you. The OP is one of the things that really got me into the anime series and the ED is alright, although I frequently skip it.Character: 9/10I personally love the characters and their diversity. I admit that I first expected the characters to be the typical kind that matches their designs. Fun-loving, cute, and friendly. They are, but they have so much depth that their character development interests me. Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron's characters really makes me love Amagi to a whole different level.Enjoyment: 8/10I really do enjoy Amagi Brilliant Park and I always look forward to the new episodes every week. It contains humour, comedy, a great theme, and pretty much anything you'd expect in this series! One thing I've got to say is how they build upon the development of a theme park, which is a nice approach since I also love theme parks since I was a child. I look forward to this.

By that I mean I wasn't expecting to like a slice of life about an amusement park as much as I did when I first watched it. I'd say re-watching it still warms me up to this day. I found it by chance, after seeing some pretty funny screenshots of Seiya being a narcissist as well as looking through all of Kyoto Animations works, I decided to watch this to kill some time.The time I took watching it was well...spent to say the least. It is a wholesome and heart warming series with plenty of loveable characters with unique and enjoyable personality's (especially Seiya's Narcissism in some scenes). While It did have a unique one, didn't have too much of a complex story and was easy to follow and watch without paying too much attention to the finer details (I'm not saying they weren't there though). It can be a tear jerker in the later episodes for the faint of heart, but it's not too bad. This series felt like something I could vibe to. Laying back with a cup of tea and snacks while re-watching it recently became a habit.As for the Art and sound, both were superb. A staple of KyoAni's works, the animation is top notch and the voice acting in both sub and dub are marvellous (personally I preferred the Dub version).Overall I would highly recommend this show to anyone who wants to chill out to a wholesome and light-hearted show without having to worry about needing therapy afterwards. spent to say the least.

Basically the show is about their daily experience, and how they gradually try to attract more guest.Story:I am not giving any spoilers, so don't worry. Talking about the plot, amagi brilliant park has a simple and straight forward plot. However it is still interesting and enjoyable. There are quite a lot of humour throughout the show, so it doesn't bored me to...death. Although the pacing might be slightly slower at times, but it's mainly because they only pass 3 months for the entire 13 episodes. There aren't any plot holes in the show as well so the story is quite a solid one.Art:The show is done by Kyoto Animation, so the art is great. Things are vibrant and nice, characters and background are nice looking too. The movements are also smooth and natural. Their animation follows more towards the exaggerated kind, which makes it humorous at times.Character:They did quite good on characters. Everyone certainly get a decent screen time in the show. Hence the character in the show is really good. We get to know everyone personality in depth and especially the male character where he get quite a bit of character development, where they even talked about why is he selected as the manager.Overall:It's a good and fun show to watch, definitely not a masterpiece but it definitely won't waste your time watching.

Roller coasters, pools, mascots, and food are staples of such areas. It\'s a time to relax, a time to just enjoy what the attractions have to offer. At its core, an amusement park is nothing more than a place designed to bring fun to the customers who visit it. In Amagi Brilliant Park, they challenge such a broad statement, finding that there is more to ferris wheels and play castles.STORYAmagi literally starts with Isuzu, an employee of Amagi Brilliant Park, holding a boy...named Kanie up with a gun. She asks him to come with her to her job, and makes a very strange request of him.The anime does something rather curious: it brings to light the problem, doesn\'t address it directly in the middle, and picks it back up again by the end. That is to say, there is seemingly no central conflict despite there being one. This honestly shouldn\'t work; common story-telling elements have basic frameworks involving drama and resolving it. The only ""villain"" is the park itself. So, how does Amagi get away with it? The answer is in the comedy. For all intents and purposes, the show is a comedy first and drama second.To this end, the anime decides upon an anecdotal premise. It\'s essentially a series of short, segmented stories that build upon one another. The drama is taken care of indirectly until it can no longer take such an approach. That is, until the ending demands a swift resolution. Kanie and Isuzu investigating a closed-off arena, ""Ironbeard"" invading the pool, and them looking to hire multiple new people seem distracting or out-of-place within the story. But the entire purpose of what they\'re doing is to solve the issue at hand without having the audience worry about it.Talking more specifically about the comedy, Amagi goes about achieving it in a variety of ways. It utilizes character quirks (such as with Tiramie and Macaron), visual gags, observational humor, and dialogue jokes. All of this is possible because, again, the setting provides the foundation. The areas they visit are not only magical in nature, but also unique enough between them to give a vast amount of scenarios in which to present the comedic moments. That is to say, it isn\'t technically the characters, the plot, or the writing that brings about the comedy, but instead the environment that evokes it from them.As a final note, one must talk about the ending (not the final episode). Looking at it realistically, it is one of the largest plot contrivances in existence. While it may have a one-line explanation, it comes about without rhyme or reason. By all accounts, it should be treated as a massive negative. But alluding back to earlier, the anime was never interested in the drama. It was simply there to get the characters in one place. So it being solved in an unsatisfactory way is quite lame, but falls in line with the show\'s overall focus. And where does this ultimate solution originate? The answer is, once again, the environment.Tying these thoughts into one, where are the comedy, drama, characters, villain, and story all found in? The answer is the setting. It\'s there in the title; this isn\'t an anime about Kanie realizing he is no longer bored, it\'s not about Isuzu falling in love, and it isn\'t even about Latifa overcoming her illness. It\'s about what the park is, what it brings, and how it connects everything together. In other words, it\'s literally an anime all about Amagi Brilliant Park.ANIMATIONKyoAni comes through once again across the board.The art for the anime itself is vibrant. Filled with an explosion of different colors, the show is never afraid to have a wide palate during any given situation. Everything just screams ""fun,"" as an amusement park should. On top of this, the detail is usually apparent, from the background scenery to the lighting. Since the anime\'s focus is on the setting, a lot of attention is rightly paid to it.The character designs are given just as much detail as the environment itself. The main cast see intricate employee outfits and modern, casual clothes. The remaining employees embody specific roles, and are drawn (jokingly) as such. For example, Wrench is literally a wrench and Jaw is a shark. It sounds simple, but they look the part while being given more facets than typically deserved.The actual animation maintains the stride created by the art before it. As examples: explosions, both quick and slow character movements, differing facial expressions, multiple objects in motion, etc. It\'s a plethora of techniques that keep the experiencing from ever feeling dull.CHARACTERSAmagi actually contains a weak main cast supported by a strong side one.Technically the star of the anime, Kanie exudes confidence. His arrogant attitude and unwavering determination allow him to be the leader that the park needs. Not afraid to speak his mind, he often butts heads with Moffle and the other employees due to his ambitious plan to renovate the land. While he begins the season being rather unforgiving, he ends it coming to the realization that there is more fun to be had doing what one loves as opposed to brooding. This development is rather awkward, with him not entirely changing his ideals until moments before the finale. Simultaneously, he proportionally provides the least amount of comedy given the amount of screen time he holds. His snide remarks and sociability make him cool, but still a rather flat character.The literal Princess of the park, Latifa is a young girl with a heart of joy and a smile that could melt ice. Classy, proper, and kind beyond measure, she only has the well-being of the people attached to Amagi within her mind. Physically weak, but a master at cooking, she is usually found within the kitchen making another batch of sweets to be shared. The majority of the drama within the show revolves around her, and since the story ignores it, she, too, is sidelined for a large portion of the anime. Contributing cuteness rather than comedy, this is the correct choice, even if it causes her development to be clipped.Isuzu, loyal subordinate to Latifa and right-hand-woman to Kanie, is pure sex appeal. With a great body and brains, she lets her magical guns do the talking for her. Her speech and attitude are mostly unemotional, due to her lack of exposure to regular, human interaction. Surprisingly, she is unintentionally daft when it comes to simple tasks. But this actually allows her to be one of the funnier cast members. The feelings she has for Kanie remain sheltered at almost all times, once again causing her to fall into the camp of underdeveloped characters. She\'s sexy and beautiful; there is no doubt about that. Sadly, she isn\'t much more.Where the mains falter, the supports come through with flying colors. This is mostly attributed to their overall better hilarity, but also by their constant inclusion and unique moments (for example, the final episode).Excluding Tiramie and Macaron, the lesser cast bring about a nice amount of comedic variety. Wanipi\'s (the alligator) fretting over losing his job, Eiko\'s (the ""AV"" woman) calm narration despite the situation, and Tricen\'s (the triceratops) endless hunching provided the anime with a nice set of characters that performed both of their jobs -- both in and out of the show -- wonderfully.Arguably the strongest humor-wise, Tiramie and Macaron are brothers-in-arms. The former is perverted to a fault and the latter is always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Together, their antics bring much discomfort and troubles for Kanie, Isuzu, and everyone else. They actually enjoy going along for the ride, hoping to see what crazy new events will ensue. They\'re pretty one-dimensional, but for them, that\'s perfectly fine.As a final aside, it\'s important to take into account the overall purpose of the show once more: the park\'s influence on everything within. If we look at each character/group of characters, this becomes apparent. Kanie\'s minimal development is created by good times he had while working there, Latifa\'s problems were solved by the land, and Isuzu is able to show off her assets numerous times due to the place\'s current status. Even the side characters are connected, with the park providing them not only their jobs but the venues in which to enact their gags. In a way, one could look at Amagi Brilliant Park as its own character, giving every other cast member the ability to be who they are because of it.SOUNDThe OP is an interesting one, with its orchestral feel and rough singing. The slow build-up, clapping, and background vocalists cause it to be quite memorable.The same cannot be said for the ED. It\'s okay, with the varying singers given an opportunity to sing along to the nice drum beat. The background instruments give it a fairy-like vibe, while the ending, trailing effect ends it on a whimsical note.The soundtrack is okay for what it is. It provides the necessary tracks at the right time, with carnival-esque tunes and happier arrangements filled with saxophones and bells. Sadly, there is nothing to listen to outside of the anime.Voice-acting-wise, everyone involved performs above average in their respective roles. A nod should be given to Ai Nonoka as Tiramie, Ryoko Shiraishi as Macaron, Ayako Kawasumi as Moffle, and Ai Kakuma as Isuzu.ENJOYMENTThere are many laughs to be had with this one. At the same time, the show also incorporates everything else an anime viewer has come to expect: ""moe"" and even fan-service, despite the studio backing it. Watching Tiramie just be himself, seeing Isuzu in a bikini or pirate outfit, and having Latifa act as adorable as possible were always enough to have me come back every week. The only facet really missing is the romance. It touts itself as being one, but the romantic elements within are very minimal, making for a highly unsatisfying relationship between the main couple.Another aspect of the show that brings even more smiles are the girls of Elementario. Sylphy, Kobori, Muse, and Salama each have their own personalities and quirks, making them both all-around fun and individually exciting. They are actually given the most development throughout the entire series, going from a haphazard group to a sensational music troupe. Of course, this is done by the park per usual, serving as another example of the show\'s ultimate goal.Even if the place will never truly exist, Amagi Brilliant Park is a fun time to be had. With an interesting set of stories, quirky characters, and color galore, the ""Magic Hour"" is never a wasted moment.SUMMARYStory: Good, the park literally sets the stageAnimation: Great, art, character designs, and actual animation are all vibrant and wonderfulCharacters: Fine, weak main cast, strong supporting castSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, good VA workEnjoyment: Good, nice laughs, cute, with unsatisfying romanceFinal Score: 7/10 named Kanie up with a gun.

It was the Full Metal Panic team coming back for the first time in almost a decade to adapt a Shoji Gatoh light novel about some dude saving an amusement park. It was called a ""slapstick drama"", whatever the hell that means. It had the rat with a hat from Fumoffu. I wanted it to be Fumoffu, but I read a bit of the manga beforehand and knew it wasn\'t going to be like that. As such, I went into the show with cautious expectations.Then I discovered that...the main character was Kanye West as a Japanese high schooler. Then I found out that the cast included a bunch of weirdos like a perverted pink dog, a tough-talking sheep, a shark who turned into Jaws when splashed with water, a masked wrestler who acted as security, and a triceratops who does not hide his desires well. Then I realized that despite taking place in ""reality"", the show was about as unreal as could be. Then the show started parodying old classics like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Rambo, and...um...KISS? And it finally clicked with me around the halfway point: I was watching a Takahashi sitcom except made by today\'s standards.Let\'s look at this a bit further: Amagi is about a teenage boy getting roped into saving an amusement park because the employees are magical beings who need the energy generated by customers in order to survive in the real world. The one in particular who needs said park to survive is the princess, because of a curse placed on her due to her dad reneging on a deal he made (in other words, her dad was a dick). It turns out that the boy met the princess once as a child and swore to make her smile, thus establishing a connection between the two that will pay off now that the boy has grown up. From that description alone, you\'d probably expect some sort of sappy Disney-esque love story where the main character uses his charisma and such to save the princess, and indeed you wouldn\'t be far off the mark.But then things take a darkly comedic turn once you realize why the park is shutting down in the first place: because the management is f*cking terrible. The employees are a bunch of lazy assholes who have pride in their jobs, but they have no work ethic. They close the park on Fridays. They take unscheduled breaks when they\'re not in the mood. And no, there is no outside interference causing this to happen. The park simply sucks because the employees are a joke who don\'t evolve with the times, and now they\'re paying the price by having their very existence threatened. You know, just like real companies and the people who make them that don\'t evolve, except greatly exaggerated because the employees are live animal mascots or humans who might as well be mascotsAnd as time went on from that realization, I became more and more convinced in my claim. Yes there is a plot, and the show does work towards it throughout its entire runtime. But whilst shows like Arakawa and Zvezda use the comedy to tell a touching story, Amagi simply uses its plot as an excuse to tell jokes related to its wacky cast and company management in general. Even when the show dips into the serious territory, it\'s just so that they can setup punchlines for later, sometimes in the same episode. Kanye has a past as a child-actor, but it\'s never really used more than as an excuse to justify why he\'s so good at managing things. Fiddy Cent (Sento Izuzu to all you plebians) has a fight with Kanye over her behavior, but all that comes out of it is her gaining a crush on our hero, as well as for a later episode to use the results of said drama as a springboard for its comedic story (that admittedly, wasn\'t all that funny). I\'ve heard people complain about the princess drama, and yeah it wasn\'t very good. But at the end of the day, it\'s just an excuse to add necessary tension to the show\'s end goal (whilst adding a man-eating plant chomping on the three stooges), as well as a reason for the show to continue in the future. It didn\'t change the game like Chuunibyou\'s tonal shift did. Hell, the actual resolution of the ""save the park"" plot was mostly just an excuse to have the characters suffer for our delight.That\'s exactly the same sort of structure that Ranma and Urusei Yatsura had, isn\'t it? Each show set up a plot in its opening episodes - the males getting engaged to the females - and there is some progress regarding that throughout each show until it reaches its end (well, not really the Ranma anime) but most of the time, it\'s just used as a high-concept justification for all sorts of wacky adventures that add to its large cast whilst causing said cast to suffer for our delight. And what differentiates it from other LN trash that try something similar like Kore Zombie is that the situations, including the ones that aren\'t very good, have imagination to them and are supported by a cast of hilarious idiots whose saccharine appearance betrays their gritty personalities (again, like a real amusement park employee). Not everyone works of course - looking at you, Dornell - but the final piece of the puzzle that makes me love Takahashi\'s sitcoms as much as I do is because the majority of the cast is f*cking hilarious. From Kanye to Tiramie to Macaron to Okuro, these characters never failed to put a smile on my face with their antics.So if Amagi is so much like my favorite anime sitcoms of all-time, does that mean that Amagi itself is one of my favorite anime comedies of all-time? Um...no.One thing I don\'t like about Takahashi is that she can\'t really do serious very well, and it doesn\'t help that KyoAni has a reputation for mishandling that sort of tone at a worse level than her, themselves. Even if it\'s necessary for future laughs to land and it only takes up an episode at most, it\'s still not that fun to sit through unless you turn it into a joke by the end of the episode. And whilst KyoAni do turn serious situations into humor more often than you\'d expect from them in this series, there are times where they slip into their old habits. Episode 4 may been necessary to give Fiddy and Kanye more of a personal relationship, as well as show the weaknesses in Kanye\'s business strategies, but it still wasn\'t very fun to watch because the dramatic tone felt over-reaching and the resolution was quick and sappy. It\'s the second-worst episode (worst being Episode 9 with the focus on the Elementario) IMO, so thankfully the show doesn\'t really slip into that territory again.But then we get into the princess\'s stuff. I won\'t go into detail regarding it, but whilst I didn\'t hate it as much as some of my colleagues since it worked fine as a plot device and never really got in the way of what really went on, that didn\'t change the fact that the resolution to her problems was lame, played entirely straight, and was poorly built-up to the point of Deus Ex. Yeah, I know she\'s still cursed and all - because otherwise, she\'d be able to leave the park - but c\'mon!The biggest reason why this show doesn\'t sit amongst my favorite comedies though is that despite getting all the fundamentals right, I didn\'t find Amagi Brilliant Park to be gut-bustingly funny. Its quality is more akin to the later seasons of Ranma in that there\'s a few laugh-out-loud gems buried under a bunch of mildly interesting stories that are more weird than hilarious. Or to put it in more modern anime terms, Amagi Brilliant Park is to KyoAni what Ouran Host Club is to Bones: A decent show overall and much more preferable to the studio\'s usual - and more popular - output, but not something I\'d consider a must-watch because the laughs are mostly moderate and it dips into the serious territory a bit too much for my liking. I can\'t really explain why the laughs didn\'t come as often as I wanted other than some awkward timing, focus on a character I didn\'t enjoy, and so on and so forth, but the bottom-line is you can\'t force yourself to laugh and Amagi just didn\'t cut it in regards to what I prefer from my humor.If they do make a sequel to Amagi Brilliant Park sometime down the road, hopefully it\'s in the vein of Fumoffu where you can just forget the plot, focus entirely on the laughs, and the laughs will actually produce, well, laughs. Because as is, this property isn\'t a good enough indicator that KyoAni has recovered from the hole they dug themselves into with, well, everything not directed by Takemoto, post-Clannad. It\'s a fun show overall. It\'s nice to see that the Takahashi formula can still exist by today\'s standards. But it could have been so much more. the main character was Kanye West as a Japanese high schooler. Then I found out that the cast included a bunch of weirdos like a perverted pink dog, a tough-talking sheep, a shark who turned into Jaws when splashed with water, a masked wrestler who acted as security, and a triceratops who does not hide his desires well. Then I realized that despite taking place in ""reality"", the show was about as unreal as could be. Then the show started parodying old classics like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Rambo, and...um...KISS? And it finally clicked with me around the halfway point: I was watching a Takahashi sitcom except made by today\'s standards.Let\'s look at this a bit further: Amagi is about a teenage boy getting roped into saving an amusement park because the employees are magical beings who need the energy generated by customers in order to survive in the real world. The one in particular who needs said park to survive is the princess, because of a curse placed on her due to her dad reneging on a deal he made (in other words, her dad was a dick). It turns out that the boy met the princess once as a child and swore to make her smile, thus establishing a connection between the two that will pay off now that the boy has grown up. From that description alone, you\'d probably expect some sort of sappy Disney-esque love story where the main character uses his charisma and such to save the princess, and indeed you wouldn\'t be far off the mark.But then things take a darkly comedic turn once you realize why the park is shutting down in the first place: because the management is f*cking terrible. The employees are a bunch of lazy assholes who have pride in their jobs, but they have no work ethic. They close the park on Fridays. They take unscheduled breaks when they\'re not in the mood. And no, there is no outside interference causing this to happen. The park simply sucks because the employees are a joke who don\'t evolve with the times, and now they\'re paying the price by having their very existence threatened. You know, just like real companies and the people who make them that don\'t evolve, except greatly exaggerated because the employees are live animal mascots or humans who might as well be mascotsAnd as time went on from that realization, I became more and more convinced in my claim. Yes there is a plot, and the show does work towards it throughout its entire runtime. But whilst shows like Arakawa and Zvezda use the comedy to tell a touching story, Amagi simply uses its plot as an excuse to tell jokes related to its wacky cast and company management in general. Even when the show dips into the serious territory, it\'s just so that they can setup punchlines for later, sometimes in the same episode. Kanye has a past as a child-actor, but it\'s never really used more than as an excuse to justify why he\'s so good at managing things. Fiddy Cent (Sento Izuzu to all you plebians) has a fight with Kanye over her behavior, but all that comes out of it is her gaining a crush on our hero, as well as for a later episode to use the results of said drama as a springboard for its comedic story (that admittedly, wasn\'t all that funny). I\'ve heard people complain about the princess drama, and yeah it wasn\'t very good. But at the end of the day, it\'s just an excuse to add necessary tension to the show\'s end goal (whilst adding a man-eating plant chomping on the three stooges), as well as a reason for the show to continue in the future. It didn\'t change the game like Chuunibyou\'s tonal shift did. Hell, the actual resolution of the ""save the park"" plot was mostly just an excuse to have the characters suffer for our delight.That\'s exactly the same sort of structure that Ranma and Urusei Yatsura had, isn\'t it? Each show set up a plot in its opening episodes - the males getting engaged to the females - and there is some progress regarding that throughout each show until it reaches its end (well, not really the Ranma anime) but most of the time, it\'s just used as a high-concept justification for all sorts of wacky adventures that add to its large cast whilst causing said cast to suffer for our delight. And what differentiates it from other LN trash that try something similar like Kore Zombie is that the situations, including the ones that aren\'t very good, have imagination to them and are supported by a cast of hilarious idiots whose saccharine appearance betrays their gritty personalities (again, like a real amusement park employee). Not everyone works of course - looking at you, Dornell - but the final piece of the puzzle that makes me love Takahashi\'s sitcoms as much as I do is because the majority of the cast is f*cking hilarious. From Kanye to Tiramie to Macaron to Okuro, these characters never failed to put a smile on my face with their antics.So if Amagi is so much like my favorite anime sitcoms of all-time, does that mean that Amagi itself is one of my favorite anime comedies of all-time? Um...no.One thing I don\'t like about Takahashi is that she can\'t really do serious very well, and it doesn\'t help that KyoAni has a reputation for mishandling that sort of tone at a worse level than her, themselves. Even if it\'s necessary for future laughs to land and it only takes up an episode at most, it\'s still not that fun to sit through unless you turn it into a joke by the end of the episode. And whilst KyoAni do turn serious situations into humor more often than you\'d expect from them in this series, there are times where they slip into their old habits.

She wants me to manage the park and improve it!""""LOL, so what did you say to that?""""...I accepted.""And there you have it, the premise of Amagi Brilliant Park or Amaburi.  Admittedly I didn\'t jump on the bandwagon immediately, but from past experience I knew what Kyoto Animation was capable of, so I decided to go along for the ride...and man was it a fun one.Story...(7/10):The premise of the anime pretty much sums up the story; the MC, Kanie Seiya, is given 3 months to improve and attract 250,000 visitors to the failing Amagi Brilliant Park.  A simple premise to say the least.  However, the anime makes great use of pacing to make up for it.  The park doesn\'t just turn into DisneyWorld overnight.  Kanie, as perfect as he thinks he is, is only human.  Under his control, the park is slowly brought together, is put through many tough situations, and utilizes many trial and error methods to improve itself.  This whole process made good use of the anime\'s crazy and diverse characters and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Art (9/10):Done by the renowned Kyoto Animation, the art was every bit as good as I expected it to be.  Many bright colours are used throughout the anime, which contribute to the happy and lighthearted mood.  The characters designs are numerous and very unique, almost childish, which definitely contribute to the atmosphere of a cheerful amusement park.   I just don\'t know what else to say, I\'m a KyoAni fanboy :3Sound (8/10):The OP ""Extra Magic Hour"" is a really energetic and upbeat song that actually left a big impression on me, and made me genuinely interested in the anime.  The cheerful and optimistic beat really captures the mood of the anime and is definitely noteworthy.  The OST and ED are less overwhelming, but still fit the mood of the anime nicely.Characters (9/10):The vibrant colours and upbeat opening would all have gone to waste if it weren\'t for the diverse cast of characters.  The main characters aren\'t particularly noteworthy. You have the self-confident and perfectionist MC Kanie Seiya, the serious and busty Sento Isuzu, and Latifah, the overly nice princess.  The large cast of supporting characters, however, make up the flesh of the show.  You have everything from perverted pink cats to closet otaku weasels to gigantic timid red dragons, all of which contribute to the show\'s humour and even the plot since many episodes focus on the introduction and development of these characters.Enjoyment (9/10):This anime was one of the most hilarious and colourful things I\'ve seen in a while and the end of every episode left me thinking ""wow it\'s over already?"".  I enjoyed pretty much everything the show had to offer, especially the catchy OP, the diverse characters, and the subtle fanservice (more Sento pls).Overall (8/10):Again, I jumped on the Amaburi bandwagon just to see what KyoAni would bring to the table this time, and I can say I\'m definitely not disappointed.  Overall, I\'d recommend this to people looking to relax after a serious and intense anime or just anyone who enjoys comedy.  In conclusion, I\'d say that Amaburi was definitely a rollercoaster of a show.""Dang, why would you accept a job like that?""""Uh, their croquettes were good.""

The universe and story are interesting and the anime is quite funny, but it has major flaws that I suppose (and hope) are due to the date it was released, which results in a lot of uncomfortable scenes.The female characters are only there for fan service and/or to be helped by the main character and/or for the romance with the main male character, and in the last episode the adult women are reduced to the status of mother or housewife...The redundant male side characters are perverts and appear very often only to objectify female characters. There's even one (an adult, of course)...who fails to rape a high-school girl by possessing a high-school boy's body. This character is even disappointed. This is never questioned and the friend who defends the victim is treated as if she didn't care about her friend but just wanted to make herself look good (it can be seen as logic in the scene, but any sane person would never have resolved the situation like that).- Version française -Une grande déception.

Amagi Brilliant Park is another show directed by Kyoto Animation veteran Takemoto Yasuhiro whos work includes Hyouka, Koboyashi's Dragon Maid, and more.  Its original run was back in 2014 but ever since then I never knew what hidden gem existed. I would consider Amagi Brilliant Park (ABP) to be underrated in the Kyoto Animation library as I haven't seen many people discuss this show especially with it being one of the greatest anime comedies to come out in the last decade. The beauty of this show is that anyone can find enjoyment in it...and its high rewatchability. Each new watch offers a new experience and it'll always make you laugh in one way or another. ABP has become one of my top anime just thought I'd say that.STORY 8/10Picture this mossy pathways, rusty chairs & tables, and soulless employees, the perfect ingredients to create the worst theme park experience. We meet our protagonist Kanie Seiya who recruited by Sento Isuzu to visit the one and only Amagi Brilliant Park. Kanie then is dragged to a meeting with a real-estate company and discovers that the park will close if they cannot meet the quota the real-estate company has set. This is where Kanie Seiya comes into the mix. Kanie is tasked to fix the park within three months while attracted visitors to meet the quota.So that brief synopsis is basically a summary of the plot and first episode. We follow Kanie through these difficult months as he works to get this park to a brilliant standard. Each episode we are thrown into a new situation with the characters as they work to solve the situation usually in a comedic fashion. Compared to all of the other Kyoto Animation shows none of them compare with its comedy well since it is built around comedy. Throughout the show, we do see character development and progression but the comedy is at the forefront.The show does have some magical elements such as how the workers are from a magical realm and use the park to stay alive by feeding off the visitors happiness at the park. Now doesn't have deep dives into the lore and such (unless they are discussing a situation around Latifa) but it's easy enough to follow to the point you don't question it. The way they build the laws of magic in this world feels natural and simple. Whenever the show delves into the magic aspect it feels underwhelming, to say the least, and this can be seen with Princess Latifa and her predicament.**SPOILER FOR THE SECTION BELOW**So basically in the past with Princess Latifa, the original manager of Amagi Brilliant Park had a curse placed on her so that when it hits August 1st she loses all her memories and remains the age of 14. This has happened to her for the last 10 years but she uses the magic the park provides to negate the effects but because of its rapid decline this caused the curse to play its effects.The way the show handles this subplot can feel underwhelming and it did in my case as it only reappeared in the latter half when the quota was nearing its end. Without this subplot, there wouldn't be any stakes and so not a reason to care but the consequences are the same for all the maple landers due to the risk of closure. To say it smaller terms it was very underwhelming.**SPOILERS END HERE**CHARACTER 8/10We have our three main characters Kanie Seiya, Sento Isuzu and Fleuranza Latifa with Kanie and Sento having more screentime. The supporting characters include all of the staff of the park but there are specifically three characters sharing the screen majority of the time them being the mascots Moffle, Macaron, and Tiramie. These three mascots a cute mouse, sheep, and cat respectively are the best subversion within the show and this is where a lot of the comedy can be found.Moffle a cute brown mouse with a green hat on the outside but has a short temper is hot-headed and would fight you at the drop of a hat. Moffle is not afraid to get aggressive with visitors but exclusively gets into fights with Kanie. Moffle is the uncle of Latifa so he is very protective especially when it involves his family. Unlike the other two mascots, he isn't as perverted. Tiramie a pink cat with the magic of nature who also possesses the power of being a massive scumbag, pervert and womanizer showing no remorse for his actions which often invites a scolding by Isuzu. Macaron a white sheep who possess the skill of music except he is like Tiramie but tamer with being a pervert and scheming. One major fact about him is that he is divorced and has a daughter that's in the custody of his ex-wife. These three mascots get into all types of schemes and shenanigans except Moffle isn't as involved with their pranks and such.Kanie Seiya is our narcissistic & egotistical protagonist with a superiority complex. Despite these negative personality traits, Kanie is still a compassionate man who cares about his fellow friends & employees. Though he maintains his superiority complex throughout the show we watch him become more open with people about his feelings. Then we have our expressionless secretary Sento Isuzu. Sento is usually the one putting out the fires of the comedic conflicts with her magic guns e.g. fights between Kanie and Moffle. Though she is often blunt and cold we do get to see her sensitive side once in a while and a couple of other expressions.Each episode places these characters in new situations and the comedy stems from the character interactions and dynamics. Though one issue I do have is with its fan service as it's very confronting. The fan service isn't handled in unique ways like the panty shot in K-On but it's blunt with its delivery and sometimes it can be awkward sometimes.ENJOYMENT 10/10It's very good what else can I say. My experience may differ due to having a nostalgic feeling for theme parks and the show encapsulates that energy of a working park perfectly. Mileage may vary depending on what makes you laugh but I say give it the 3 episode rule.CONCLUSIONGive it a watch for some brilliant comedy but if you're looking for the classic Kyoto Animation slice of life literally watch any of their other shows. I rate it a 9/10 and its high rewatchability. Each new watch offers a new experience and it'll always make you laugh in one way or another.

I rate it a 9/10"", '""Amagi Brilliant Park"" is an anime produced in 2014 by Kyoto Animation and based on the homonymous light novel written by Shoji Gatoh and illustrated by Yuki Nakajima. The series has thirteen episodes, to which is added an OVA published in 2015.The story sees Seiya Kanie as a protagonist, a high school student with a brief career in the entertainment world behind him. One day he is threatened with a musket by his classmate Isuzu Sento, who forces him to give her an appointment. The chosen location for the exit is Amagi Brilliant Park, an amusement park on the verge of bankruptcy. Unexpectedly, the princess...of the ""Land of Maple"", Latifah Fleuranza, asks the boy to assume the role of director and to save the park from the imminent closure.One of the essential points of the success of an entrepreneurial activity is surely made up of human resources: the amusement park staff, thick and heterogeneous, will therefore be the subject of a general deepening, accompanied by a certain renewal of everyone\'s habits and way of working characters. The four fairies of the Elementary, for example, will learn to collaborate and improve their harmony, or the beautiful Isuzu, cold and indifferent, will begin to open up and do her best for the good of the park. Excellent work on the protagonist: the charismatic Seiya, while retaining the typical narcissism that distinguishes him, will begin to show less apathy towards what is happening around him. But the strong point of the characters is, in my opinion, represented by Moffle, Macaron and Tiramy: endowed with strong personalities that are completely out of place with their adorable appearance, the three mascots play a key role within the comic side of the anime.In conclusion, ""Amagi Brilliant Park"" is a light and pleasant soul, which lets itself be looked at and appreciated. The screenplay does not present any original or striking developments, nor do the characters bear an important psychological introspection. However, the sympathy of the latter, a good amount of hilarious gags and a very pleasant graphic section for the eyes can give the viewer a cheerful and little committed vision.Pretty music, cute ending. The opening deserves a lot! It is truly beautiful and full of rhythm and life.The cast of the duplicators is excellent: Kouki Uchiyama breaks through giving his voice to the protagonist and Ayako Kawasumi, the famous Saber of ""Fate"", gives us an amusing and amusing interpretation. If you believe that Uchiyama did his best with Tsukishima of ""Haikyuu !!"" or Yurio of ""Yuri on Ice"", you are mistaken: in my opinion, Kanie Seiya\'s is her best performance and her voice fits him divinely.

The four fairies of the Elementary, for example, will learn to collaborate and improve their harmony, or the beautiful Isuzu, cold and indifferent, will begin to open up and do her best for the good of the park. Excellent work on the protagonist: the charismatic Seiya, while retaining the typical narcissism that distinguishes him, will begin to show less apathy towards what is happening around him. But the strong point of the characters is, in my opinion, represented by Moffle, Macaron and Tiramy: endowed with strong personalities that are completely out of place with their adorable appearance, the three mascots play a key role within the comic side of the anime.In conclusion, ""Amagi Brilliant Park"" is a light and pleasant soul, which lets itself be looked at and appreciated. The screenplay does not present any original or striking developments, nor do the characters bear an important psychological introspection. However, the sympathy of the latter, a good amount of hilarious gags and a very pleasant graphic section for the eyes can give the viewer a cheerful and little committed vision.Pretty music, cute ending.

The anime is (mostly) about how he tries to achieve this goal.The story is more character driven than plot driven. There is a main storyline but it is ""interrupted"" with some side stories which sometimes were very interesting and others times mediocre. Overall they had no direct impact on the story but were relevant enough to be included.I appreciated the fact that this anime didn\'t have deep backstories for the characters or complex lore which made it easy to follow....The characters have distinct personalities but it\'s a matter of preference whether you actually like them or not.I must add that some scenes made me feel slightly uncomfortable. There\'s some ""classic"" fanservice which can\'t be ignored but in addition there are some side characters who are pervy so it became one of the focuses of the plot. The main story ends in the 12th episode so the 13th episode not only felt unnecessary but also made me feel more uncomfortable.All of that aside, I liked the rest of the anime. It had great main characters, it was funny, the animation is beautiful, it is simple to follow and really made me excited to work and make a difference in the world myself.

Never expected that I would enjoy this anime this much, it was surprisingly good!It was a big question where this anime is about, my hopes were not so high at all at the beginning. The first episode gave me a great impression, the main character saw how bad the situation was at the Amagi Brilliant Park. First, he didn't want to help them but after seeing them suffering he finally agreed to take the role of a manager. I got really excited to see how they will improve their amusement park and the characters as well, in each episode they...were growing and growing which I really love to see.The characters were great, some of them were really hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing.

I lost some interest watching it at some point, but being the otaku I am, I don't tend to leave anime behind without completing them first; so watching a few more episode got my interest back.

There is just something about her character i like that i can\'t really describe.Latifa  ( Princess) is in tie for the most interesting character....She actually has a curse on her that is actually kind of sad.

What could go wrong?The story of Amagi Brilliant Park starts off suddenly and with barely any warning; Our protagonist, Seiya Kanie, is staring down the barrel of a modified musket in the hands of the ever-so lovely Isuzu Sento (who\'s got plot always bouncing off her chest). At this point, she blatantly threatens to kill Kanie if he doesn\'t take her out on a date to the dilapidated amusement park, Amagi Brilliant Park. Turns...out the park really is a wreck, and Isuzu actually works there as assistant manager. This is when she pleads Kanie to help save the park from being shut down in a few months’ time by becoming its new manager. A skeptical, but curious Kanie reluctantly agrees, and the true story of Amagi Brilliant Park begins.To call this anime not funny, not original, and not entertaining is a blight on humanity. Throughout the whole anime, I was never bored or annoyed once. Every episode is unique and enthralling, and all of the major-minor characters get decent amounts of attention and screen time, and they\'re all (for the most part) pretty likable.Seiya Kanie, the main protagonist, is a stuck up but really intellectual jerk with an ego who would ""fall for me if I could,"" [Episode 1, to himself]. But his ego is one of the few things that actually make him likable and offers a breath of fresh air from your usual run-of-the-mill protagonists. To help save Amagi Brilliant Park, he becomes a pseudo-dictator that prioritizes the park amongst all else. Most episodes deal with the implementation of one of his plans to improve the park, and ultimately attract more guests. However, most of these plans rarely go without miscellaneous hitches, and that\'s where the fun and puns begin!By himself though, the anime would have been a flop. Accompanying him in the anime is a wide assortment of colorful characters, ranging from Moffle the battle-ready mouse, Macaron the uninspired sheep, and Tirami the perverted Pomeranian dog. Among these characters are the last two main characters, the gun toting Isuzu Sento and the lovely princess of Amagi, Latifah Fleuranza. Although both of these characters are extremely likable, both could have used some more development, along with Kanie himself. Character development is one of the series’ shortcomings, but for a simple Comedy, this isn’t a huge issue.Art style wise, I felt like it could have been more a bit more vibrant and energetic for an anime centered around a theme park. It can feel dull at times, but most of the time I found myself laughing too hard to even care. This anime also completely NAILS facial expressions, like wholly sheet man. From the rape faces of the kids to the evil grins of the mascots, I haven’t seen expressions this funny since Noragami. It’s also worth noting this last episode went above and beyond their normal standard art, and created a truly breath taking scene, and according to MAL, we have yet another episode incoming!Sound wise, it’s nothing really special. Don’t come in expecting an Aldnoah Zero or Madoka Magica level OST, but it’s just good enough to compliment it for being effective when it needs to be.If you haven’t already guessed, Amagi Brilliant Park is one of the funniest animes I, and most of my friends have ever seen! If you’re a Comedy lover, you have no excuse not to watch this. If you’re a fan service lover, you also have no excuse to not watch this (but even if you dislike fanservice, there’s just enough to not become annoying).

The show is basically a guy trying to save a runned down theme park as the story progresses you understand why the theme park needs to be saved which was actually quite sad. All in all the story kept me hooked because of how funny it actually was from the dirty jokes to the funny gags the show excelled in that area which is what it mainly is about.Art- not...gonna get too much into this because most animes these days the art style kinda look the same not a knock on anything or anyone but this anime looks great visually.sound- T'was ok the music aside from the opening and ending didnt really hit me with a home run or anything just ok.character- Funny characters since the theme of the anime was in a theme park there has to be many acts and different types of people running stations or performing acts and this anime really does good in that from the stupid funny characters the protective funny characters or just the funny characters in general its really good also to add the princess her character is kinda the generic cute nice kinda thing but her art design and her story is touching as it should.enjoyment-  i liked it because i needed something really funny not stressful to watch and that had a decent story that makes you invested in the story although it didnt need the 13th episode.... i enjoyed it a lot one of the better anime i've seen and enjoyed.overall- 8/10 funny just quite funny not relateable for obvious reasons but the entire show from start to finish was a great ride id watch it again if i had time gonna get too much into this because most animes these days the art style kinda look the same not a knock on anything or anyone but this anime looks great visually.sound- T'was ok the music aside from the opening and ending didnt really hit me with a home run or anything just ok.character- Funny characters since the theme of the anime was in a theme park there has to be many acts and different types of people running stations or performing acts and this anime really does good in that from the stupid funny characters the protective funny characters or just the funny characters in general its really good also to add the princess her character is kinda the generic cute nice kinda thing but her art design and her story is touching as it should.enjoyment-  i liked it because i needed something really funny not stressful to watch and that had a decent story that makes you invested in the story although it didnt need the 13th episode.... i enjoyed it a lot one of the better anime i've seen and enjoyed.overall- 8/10 funny just quite funny not relateable for obvious reasons but the entire show from start to finish was a great ride id watch it again if i had time"", ""A funny, comedy anime with some hints of romance and superior animation and graphics quality.It's very enjoyable and very funny.

It's not doubt, a good anime to watch and you won't regret picking it up.The story is somewhat simple, get 250,000 visitors to the park before the deadline.

It\'s busy, and remarkably mundane. Although I\'m told that management insists the staff adopt a happy attitude in the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" at all times (even more so in Tokyo Disney, which, fun fact, is in Chiba prefecture), I would imagine that it\'s a constant challenge to plaster a smile on your face when you\'re around kids when the preparation was stultifying, dull, and boring. I would be very surprised if a good number of...the staff at the big theme parks aren\'t like the mascot trio drinking themselves silly after a hard day\'s work or otherwise finding some way to completely deflate.The story of Amagi Brilliant Park (""AmaBuri"") sits on two rails: comedy (mostly slapstick, which is KyoAni\'s forte), and drama. To be honest, the drama did feel like watching someone play a Rollercoaster Tycoon scenario while being trolled by the loan shark, especially with the rolling counters at the end. Some of the slapstick looks straight out of The Three Stooges, which is perfect because we have 3 mascots, and there\'s always a little bit of circus clown/mime in both The Three Stooges and theme park mascots because a good slapstick act means you must get the audience to laugh without words. It\'s harder to perform than it looks, but I bet it\'s a bit easier to draw it.The drama\'s ""challenge du jour"" motif (reinforced by the episode titles) did a decent job of driving the story forward, but sometimes this was just distracting filler (e.g. the Seiya Suit episode and the OVA). Nevertheless the buildup to the climax is well-executed, and that final plot twist makes me hope for a second season (I kinda doubt they\'ll green-light one, this wasn\'t a bestseller).Like any good comedic show, every character has a funny weakness, and the show mercilessly explores the weaknesses of just about every main character (with the possible exception of Sylphie) and even some of the bit characters.The soundtrack is a bit like ""easy listening"" or ""elevator music"" with better instruments. Now, that sounds like a bad thing, but KyoAni did something rather cool with it-- a lot of the tracks are theme music to the rides and attractions at the park, so they recorded the music played back over inexpensive loudspeakers. I think this was a nice touch, creating the illusion that we\'re actually at a run-down theme park. The opener, Extra Magic Hour, is by one of my favorite bilingual artists, Akino with her brothers and sister. While it\'s not a Yoko Kanno tune, it certainly puts one into the mood for going to a magical amusement park, and the opening animation evolves as the cast grows-- nice touch. The ending is catchy, and yet, like the song that\'s sung by the same quartet in one episode, feels like a way to push yet another idol group and record sales.I think the main weaknesses are the characters of Latifa and Isuzu-- Latifa could\'ve been an automated croquette dispenser in a dress, and it wouldn\'t have mattered for most of the show. Isuzu was used as moe fodder, making her a recurring target of Macaron\'s/Tiramie\'s pranks or flying into a quiet jealous rage when she sees Seiya with another girl. Sometimes it was funny, other times I wished they would write something better for Isuzu like during the big rain storm.I\'ll toss in a couple of counterpoints to the argument that Seiya couldn\'t possibly run a theme park business. (1) It\'s FICTION. It\'s heavily fantasy-themed fiction. This is a stretch of the imagination, not an outright mathematical impossibility. Save your critical wrath for the latter. (2) Seiya, Isuzu notes in her research, is a genius-level overachiever with show biz experience. I would not be surprised if he absorbed a lot from his manager and countless producers during his brief career as a child actor. Remember, a theme park is show business, and while actors often don\'t get involved in the business side of the industry (they really should, IMHO it\'s one of the reasons why they struggle to stay afloat), it shouldn\'t be too much of a stretch to imagine a genius-intellect former child actor knowing why this act is in trouble and how to fix it. the staff at the big theme parks aren\'t like the mascot trio drinking themselves silly after a hard day\'s work or otherwise finding some way to completely deflate.The story of Amagi Brilliant Park (""AmaBuri"") sits on two rails: comedy (mostly slapstick, which is KyoAni\'s forte), and drama.

Excellent animation and character designs,...I love how goofy some scenes where,like when Macaron was putting the pill inside Sento's bento. Also even the background characters had faces. The only thing I didn't like was Kanie's character design. Excellent art and animation made me give it a 9/10, though there's nothing unique about it.SoundThe voice acting was great, I liked Sento and Tiramie's voice actors, I think there's no problem with the voice acting in this anime,the only thing lacking was the bgm, it was forgettable and the only OST I remembered in this anime was the OP which was decent. So unmemorable bgm and OP but great voice acting made me give it a 7/10 rating.CharacterThis anime was clearly character driven, most of them were fairly decent though other than the main cast, the side characters were also good and were fun to watch, especially the elves or the three human girls.  Though the lack of a clear antagonist and backstory, were disappointing, Kirisu Rakku rarely had screen time and never actually felt like an antagonist while only bits and pieces were explained from each of the main character's backstory excluding Latifah, I was satisfied with her backstory. So I give it a 8/10.EnjoymentThis was a very enjoyable anime indeed, it made me laugh many times and kept me hooked for a considerable time, though I guess it was a bit too short, the pacing was also a bit too quick which made me lose a bit of interest but nevertheless this is a very fun anime to watch. 9/10OverallGreat character's, decent plot,fantastic art,enjoyable episodes,good voice acting and lack of a clear antagonist,backstory and fast pacing made me give this anime a 8.5.

So I give it a 8/10.EnjoymentThis was a very enjoyable anime indeed, it made me laugh many times and kept me hooked for a considerable time, though I guess it was a bit too short, the pacing was also a bit too quick which made me lose a bit of interest but nevertheless this is a very fun anime to watch. 9/10OverallGreat character's, decent plot,fantastic art,enjoyable episodes,good voice acting and lack of a clear antagonist,backstory and fast pacing made me give this anime a 8.5. I am eager for a second season of this."", ""As a huge fan of Kyoto Animation I couldn't wait to dive into this anime!Having watched almost every anime of Kyoto Animation I have to say that Amagi Brilliant Park is unique on its own and yet another stunning creation.While most high school comedy animes are of course set in a school environment this one takes place on a very magical place, Amagi Brilliant Park!Story - 8The story is fairly simple yet entertaining, the main character Kanie is set out to save a amusement park from the brink of extinction.There aren't really a lot of plot twists and unexpected events but that doesn't mean the...story is bad.Sometimes the process alone of seeing people come together and overcome harsh trials is heartwarming, Amagi Brilliant Park did a great job at presenting that.The only complaint here is that the last episode isn't actually part of the main plot, so for those of you who don't like OVA you can just skip it if you want, as the anime's ending is actually ep. 12.Art - 9Oh it's the part where we talk about Kyoto animation's art again, I mean are there really any explanations needed here? The art is very refreshing, the colors are vibrant and exciting, the characters feel much more alive than those of any other anime. The art just feels like it's on another level. In short, Kyoani's art is love, Kyoani's art is life.Sound - 7The music in Amagi Brilliant Park wasn't anything particularly special or very memorable, but it did achieve what it was made for, it set the mood very well and didn't stand out too much. I think a 7 is justified here as I think an 8  or higher should only be given to music that touches your heart.Character - 8I really liked how the main character Kanie seemed reluctant at first, but quickly makes up his mind because of the dire situation the park is in and the consequences it has if the park breaks down. This really shows that deep down Kanie is actually a very good person, that tsundere side of him makes me go cringe in joy. What slightly disappointed me was that you don't get to see a lot about Sento, the girl that lured the savior in. Other characters played a very comical part and were very entertaining to watch, my fav was definitely Tiramie.Enjoyment - 9Even though this anime is not a masterpiece by any means, I still got a lot of enjoyment out of it. The comedy was great and made me breath more air out of my nose numerous amount of times. Even though the ending wasn't anything out of expectation, I was still quite touched by the moment.ConclusionThis anime is definitely recommended for people that like comedy, the anime also contains a slight bit of drama but I'd say the comedy in this show is worth the most. For those of you who are perverted and like fanservice, there is some of that as well but luckily not enough to overpower the anime.note: I didn't spell check so there might be some mistakes. story is bad.Sometimes the process alone of seeing people come together and overcome harsh trials is heartwarming, Amagi Brilliant Park did a great job at presenting that.The only complaint here is that the last episode isn't actually part of the main plot, so for those of you who don't like OVA you can just skip it if you want, as the anime's ending is actually ep. 12.Art - 9Oh it's the part where we talk about Kyoto animation's art again, I mean are there really any explanations needed here?

I feel like i stepped into a new and magical world, and that alone made me smile.The characters are a lot of fun. The animation is pretty as shit too. I'm not going to talk about the story as you should just go into it not knowing anything.This is one of the rare shows that just make me happy. It gives me a sense of joy. Though i don't think this show will be for everyone. But it's worth taking a look at. Anyway, happy watching . "", ""It's a good time. That's it. I had a lot of fun, but it wasn't the intellectually stimulating kind of fun. Main character isn't super interesting, but everyone else is. The story and it's ending aren't great, but that's okay because this show has an illegal amount of charm. There was not one episode where I didn't smile. It's very fun and very easy to watch.

I mean it's thereCharacter: I felt really close with alot of the characters and some had almost no development or reason for me to care about them (i.e. antagonist, Dornell, studder chick). Arguably the best female lead in the fall season IMO. I'm pretty sure 50 Cent over here smiles less than Rei.Enjoyment and overall : 8/10 Really kept me watching throughout the whole anime.

Their dialogues are clunky, confusing, lacking in direction. It sticks out like a sore thumb, and completely missed the drama of the moment. Chuuni had been somewhat saved by the ridiculous action scene. Tamago Market on the other hand, suffered greatly and Kyoukai no Katana was not much better. Yet, they are still dreaming of an original, great hit.But I digressed, Amagi Brilliant Park.Among the millions of light novels floating around, that plays to...Kyoto Animation\'s strength then, this one is probably one of the best out there: not out right comedy nor drama, a mixture of both is their sweet spot. They have a good sense of what\'s ""moe"" (creeps me to say the word) and understand how to bring the character\'s ""moe"". They skilfully comb through the source material, picking out what works, and take it to the next level. The story premise is simple: Girl, Park, Bet, Win. Since there isn\'t a lot to dwell on, KyoAni has the high ground, again. Their character building has always been really easy to swallow. The way that the characters are slowly delivered to you instead of info dumping (thanks to the source material somewhat) is what Kyoto Animation do best when they have no need to write the dialog themselves and instead focus on directing, pacing and music. Other than characters, comedy is another aspect of Kyoto Ani that has helped them in the past and it was also shown here. While not outright laugh out loud, Kyoto Ani comedy always helps lighten the mood of the story somewhat and still give a sense that they are adding to the plot. Most of the comedy ties with the characterization so rarely it becomes nonsensical although this could also largely be thanks to the source materialKyoto Ani art is rarely a weakness although in this case they seem to be unable to cheat by using real location so various points in the show have stark contrast to the detailed environment of other places. They probably had this coming although to be fair, creating a believable location is extremely difficult. Believe me because I tried environmental design and to create a life like location it could take months just to make one. Character design is hard to argue or distribute points due to the design is already made by the source material although judging by the work Kyoto Ani made on them it is quite well done but I am somewhat dissatisfied with Sento due to her stiff image, not what I imagine but I guess that is closer to the source material.In terms of sound this one left quite a small impact. The sound has always been KyoAni with both good and bad points. Their soundtrack is rarely fantastic but always up to standard. It always fits the show really well but seems like it was made for the show rather than made by the artist. This always set the good one and the great one apart, although I am not sure which one is ultimately better though as I have my Haruhi soundtrack from them since forever because it is just really really good.I would recommend this if you are an avid KyoAni fan but saying that is utterly pointless. For people who are quite new this show is not a bad choice to get into KyoAni stuff. Their stuff is often quite similar to this except for their older endeavour before they sell their soul to the devil called merchandise.If you want to look beyond this show read belowNow onto the larger point I made before. KyoAni is shit especially when it comes to things they make on their own and so this one capacity for memorable   moments is actually not beyond calculation. Honestly though after this I am confused as to what their confidence would be. Would their confidence rose and they continue to try pushing their own creativity forward or would they understand their limitation (particularly in the directing department) and go back to adaption, something that have propel them into the air. Though it might be because of Tatsuya Ishihara that shows were good but this one is pretty nice in itself so I still believe they do have talents for reading and understanding comedy drama adaptation. Another thing to point out about Ishihara is that whenever he\'s not there their success is mostly from comedy heavy stuff so maybe there\'s a slight pattern. Their recent Euphonium is quite nice so I hope they are back on track with adaptations. I do miss their Key adaptations very much because after them the other Maeda adaptations sometimes left a little and in some cases a lot left to desire while their partnership always manages a full course meal that for some reason I just can\'t rewatch. Their next one is from their own publication so chances are actually 25-75 but I ll take it because it\'s Ishihara again.

The main characters are fun and interesting, while the story has many humorous moments. By no means is this a deep or intellectual anime, but rather 'fun'. The main plot is solid enough in it's entirety, although towards the end of the anime the true antagonistic force that initiated the whole situation is revealed and 'dealt with' in a un-fulfilling manner, almost as if to allude to a sequel, of which there is yet to be one. But for me it was never about the plot, but rather the journey. The...show has its serious moments and thankfully never unravel into a montage nonsensical slapstick madness. It's coherent comedy; it's not harem/romcom stupidity.A sequel would though be nice; and I would definitely watch this anime again. Good clean colorful fun. show has its serious moments and thankfully never unravel into a montage nonsensical slapstick madness.

Good clean colorful fun."", ""To be honest, I only knew about the series when a certain club used it as a cover. Then I got curious and found it. At first, I thought ti would be another slice of life anime, since it's kyoani and everything, but I was wrong. There were so many things in this series that got me hooked.Let's start off with the plot. Normally, anime protagonists would be shy, timid, normal, etc. But the MC for Amagi was different. Instead of going with the typical normal character, they went with a narcissistic smartass. And that's a good thing, especially when the plot has magic involved....Most series would fail to bring magic and real life together because it often turns into action. But not this series. The concept of slice of life was still eminent. It's also because of this harmonious combination that the characters became memorable.Next off is the characters. Now you may argue that the MC is just a rip-off of another character from another kyoani anime, and I don't blame you. That's what I thought as well before I learned what kind of guy he really was. Next up is Sento. For some reason, when trying to figure out her personality, I thought she was the typical cold-hearted beauty. Boy, I was wrong. Actually, she was more human than other cold-hearted beauties out there. She also had her own set of weaknesses, but that's what makes a character real. I'd like to talk about the other characters, but if I did, this review would be too long.Another category that caught my eye was the soundtrack. Usually, as long as I saw an anime, I wouldn't give a damn to the BGM. But this series broke that habit. The music blended well with the atmosphere of each scene, all the while maintaining the amusement park feel of it.I'd like to talk about the art style, but it's kyoani, so there's really nothing to say that hasn't been said yet.Overall, it was an enchanting anime. IT was cute and relaxing but also tension-building. I recommend this anime very much if you're tired of all the shounen magic power cliche.You're just one step away from experiencing the magic of Amagi brilliant park!

Well the show wasn\'t exactly bad, but it could have been amazing if it had been a little more cohesive.Story: 7the premise of this show is really cool and unique, the main problem I have is this: inconsistent tone. I think if it had gone all the way with the wacky ott aspect of the story, making it completely surreal and fun it would have worked far better than trying to force subtle character drama into a show that...has talking walrus pirates. If you\'re gonna have characters that are basically giant stuffed animals, then you shouldn\'t take yourself so serious. I mean the main characters are all named after rappers, I really don\'t care about their subtle drama I want to see them fucking about in an amusement park. If there is drama it should be way over the top like the rest of this world is. Why even have the main character be in high school, it only comes into play in literally one episode. Have him be an adult. It doesn\'t have to go all out comedy with it, it should just be more fun and play up those surreal aspects more, to feel more fantastical rather than trying and failing to ground these characters in the real world. That said, some of the girl characters are well written enough to carry the story so it\'s not actually bad, it\'s just disappointing because I could see it being so much better.Art: 9In terms of character design and backgrounds, there is no argument that this show is beautiful. All characters have distinct designs that reflect their personalities and make them stand out, even in this large cast. The backgrounds are stunning and really feel alive.Sound: 6The music for this show is good, but not appropriate unfortunately. The OP is great, sets the tone for the show and is suitably wacky and over the top. However the BGM  seems to take itself way too seriously, a reoccurring problem for this show. It\'s never clear if a scene is supposed to make us feel happy or sad, if it\'s comedic or dramatic because they use the same music for all types of scenes even when it doesn\'t fit. The music on it\'s own is pretty strong but it just feels out of place with the world the characters inhabit. In general, the voice acting is passable, nothing incredible but it does it\'s job. Foley is also just sort of there, nothing outstanding but nothing actually bad either.Character: 7To be frank, I\'m a sucker for some cute girls, and these girls are cute as h*ck. I can\'t complain there. But they are not the cutest, in fact by kyoani standards these girls are pretty lacking. What makes shows like k-on, tamako market and hibike! euphonium so good is that the characters feel real as well as being cute. They have full personalities and aren\'t just a combination of light novel troupes. This show uses the common tactic of just giving characters one trait, and that\'s their whole personality, rather than actually having them be well rounded and human. There\'s the rich girl, the kudere, the clutz, the girl who\'s always on her phone, etc. If I asked you to name one more personality trait of these characters, you would struggle because it doesn\'t exist. And the MC, well, I thought I\'d get something interesting here. In the first episode it\'s revealed that he\'s very narcissistic and I thought ""hey, this could be interesting, a main character who isn\'t just a blank insert character and actually has flaws and a past"". But instead, it\'s barely mentioned again until the very last episode really. And the whole thing about him being a former child star is never explored properly either. Where are his parents? Why did he quit being an actor? Why was he chosen to help the park? Why is he quiet at school? All these questions are asked and never answeredEnjoyment: 7It\'s fun, the characters are generally likable and the plot is just tangible enough to keep you watching. Strong start, weak middle and strong ending (not counting episode 13 because what even was that, the show already ended they just put an extra episode for no reason)Overall: 7Disappointing, but only because I had high expectations going in. The first shot of the series is of the muzzle of a gun, a very strong opening, but unfortunately the rest of the show doesn\'t quite deliver. But it is laugh out loud funny at some points, and the girls are cute. If you\'re a busy person and don\'t have time to waste, skip this one. But if you\'re a lazy weeb like me give it a shot, you might just be surprised. has talking walrus pirates.

This anime, along with its OP, is one of if not my favorite all time anime. The OP for sure is my favorite. Such a cheery and fun song. The anime just brings so much nostalgia from my early days. It\'s like my go-to comfort anime. The comedy is great and always gets a chuckle out of me and you will probably like it too as long as you can take a joke. The story is pretty basic all things considered, but the wonderful characters and their...interactions bring this anime to life. Every episode is a fun little self-contained adventure, with a nice overarching story. I saw this anime very early in my ""anime-watching career"" and I still rewatch it all the time. That\'s what I\'m doing right now and it\'s why I\'m writing this review. Please give it a shot, don\'t take it too seriously, and have fun singing and clapping along to the OP :) interactions bring this anime to life.

Everyone have different tastes in anime so i don't know about you . If you have not watched this yet , what are you waiting FOR? Short summary : Its about a high school student managing an amusement park <--- This high school student do not have any friends . So its kind of cool to watch this kind of anime :D Romance very little but still satisfying to watch :) For me , i really like this kind of anime which the main character does not stand out in school yet he is so cool...XD I think even cooler than Hikigaya Hachiman :) I don't understand why it is 7.76 maybe because some people just do not like that the romance is too little . Well , i also want to see the romance developing in season 2 but i still don't know about season 2 yet (Currently) .I really liked the main character a lot :) Too much even more potential to be better in season 2 :) XD I think even cooler than Hikigaya Hachiman :) I don't understand why it is 7.76 maybe because some people just do not like that the romance is too little .

Highly entertaining, all in all.- Well written (albeit not the most developed) characters.  As the plot progresses, you definitely form enough of a connection with these people that you want to see the park succeed.  Because of that I give props for execution.- Great execution of backstories throughout.- Unique idea that stands out among other anime.- Good voice actingCons:...- (SPOILER ALERT) Would\'ve liked to seen a more conclusive ending to the story arc regarding Latifah\'s curse and the evil wizard.  The way that arc concluded seemed a bit muddled and confused.  I feel like because of that a second season is warranted. (SPOILER END)- This is very obviously a plot-centric series.  Because of that (as mentioned previously) the main characters aren\'t as developed as they should be (particularly the two main leads.)  This is a bit of an issue, but I wouldn\'t say it ruins the show as a whole.Overall:I was pleasantly surprised by this.  I wouldn\'t go so far as to call it ""underrated"" per say, but I do think it deserves some more attention than it seems to get.  The story and concept stand out for their originality.  It kind of reminds me of some of the video games I\'d play when I was younger like ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" and ""Mysims"".  The amount of creativity they throw in regarding the theme park concept really does a good job of world building, plot development, and in some cases character development.  This will definitely be a series I will remember, and most likely re-watch in the future.  Its manages to be really fun, while also having a lot of heart and creativity thrown in the mix. - (SPOILER ALERT) Would\'ve liked to seen a more conclusive ending to the story arc regarding Latifah\'s curse and the evil wizard.

First review coming up.Amagi Brilliant Park (AmaBuri) is a story of Kanie Seiya, a student who is full of himself, is asked (forced) to run a dying theme park by Sento Isuzu. I won't elaborate - that's what the synopsis is for.Story :The concept of this story is pretty unique. It is pretty episodic, in the sense that each episode is an arc of it's own (mostly) and you get comedic moments throughout the show that isn't really repetitive or boring, it's decent. Each arc also focuses...on the park members and developing them, as well as the Main Characters, Kanie and Sento. Overall the pacing is good and the focus of saving the park is kept intact.Art :The art is pretty. It's not too jarring, and it has it moments where an episode seems to have a higher budget than another, but overall it's good.Sound :The opening and ending tracks aren't bad, they were catchy when I was listening to them the first few times, but not enough for me to be absolutely addicted. The soundtracks fits the show well. None of them really stood out, but they were good nonetheless.Character :The character development was good, and as mentioned above, each supporting character was developed well in the own story arc. We also got to see Kanie's growth as a person, as he gets more mature with the way he interacts with the other characters by the end. Minor Spoiler : His ego is still ridiculously high. Sento got developed well as well, seeing as she was sort of an airhead at the beginning, using her gun more than her mouth but she realized that you shouldn't point guns at people if you're running a theme park.My problem was with Latifa. MAL lists her as a main character, but I felt that she wasn't developed very well. She has her moments, but she was mostly there as the ex-manager of the park. This caused the end of her character arc to be pretty abrupt in my opinion.Enjoyment :This anime isn't a must watch on everybody's list, but to anyone who likes comedy anime, you would probably enjoy it. I certainly enjoyed it and I think the ending was well done as wellOverall, I would rate Amagi Brilliant Park 8/10I hope my first review was not too bad, and thanks for reading! on the park members and developing them, as well as the Main Characters, Kanie and Sento.

There's not a whole lot more I can say about it since it is really the characters and comedy which make this show shine.Each character has a distinct personality which blends well with every body else's and leads to some brilliant humor. Although...they aren't the most 3 dimensional and don't get a lot of development it doesn't feel as though any of them are lacking anything.I'd recommend this to anyone who wants something that manages to stay on the lighter side without being dull or generic. they aren't the most 3 dimensional and don't get a lot of development it doesn't feel as though any of them are lacking anything.I'd recommend this to anyone who wants something that manages to stay on the lighter side without being dull or generic."", 'The anime is funny and have charismatic characters, a great production and beautiful scenes.The best thing in the anime is the characters, they gonna make you watch until the end, have some ""mysteries"" about the past, but isn\'t a great contribution to the anime., the biggest point here is the comedy and how the characters react to each other. Don\'t have a big characters contruction (just a little) but the characters fby himselfs are cool.The biggest fall of the anime is when he tries to be serious, cause he can\'t, YOU can\'t see that story and really get serious, mainly because the Deus Ex Machina...thing, or just because is a bizarre plot.The anime is cool, but sluggish and don\'t have great plot.

But then again it's a kind of anime that isn't nor epic nor bad, it's average in most ways except the characters, which I found great.

I completely understand and respect their opinions of course as this show has more personal love and connection to myself than nearly any other piece of media I've ever seen.On first glance this show is one of the most by the numbers things you've ever seen, but in my eyes...Amagi Brilliant Park encapsulates each and everyone of the reasons as to why I cherish anime as an art form so much, it has one of the most bombastic and outlandish concepts ever and this is further amplified by the colourful and vibrant way Kyoto animation brought it's world and characters to life, anime is quite simply the only industry where you'll see a show about a failed child actor becoming the manager of a magical theme park where the mascots are crude and violent, and if they don't reach 250,000 guest in three months each and everyone of them will die. If that concept sounds utterly ridiculous that's because it is and the sheer absurdity is a major pull factor for me as it's simply so entertaining to experience. The story is so simple yet so engaging, this is thanks to the many pieces of the puzzle that keeps it going, the world, the characters, the music, it all comes together to create a truly unique anime experience.For a show that's relatively unheard of the animation is simply stunning, it's smooth and makes the colourful and insane world of Shoji Gatoh's original story come to life to it's fullest potential, a theme park is meant to be a land of magic and wonder, and this aesthetic and mood for the show is achieved perfectly by the immense talent of the show's director Yasuhiro Takemoto, who I regard as the modern day Miyazaki for his insane creativity and under appreciated talented.The characters are also a huge reason of my sheer love for this show, they're entertaining and very humorous, and for a rather simplistic show they have quite fleshed out arcs in certain points of the show, Kanie Seiya has become one of my all time favourite characters due to his presence in the show being so strong, he may not be an expertly written character like most of them in this show, but his overall demeanour is such a joy to watch and he really brings an entirely different vibe to each and every scene he's in. the rest of the shows characters offer the same as Kanie does, with a lot of their up tight or at times innocent persona's constantly clashing makes for some truly entertaining and funny moments, some other stand out character would of course have to be Sento, Latifa, Moffle, Latifa and Slyphy for being stand out character which are just amplified further by the amazing performances from each and everyone of the Japanese cast.The music is something I see being overlooked a lot in this show, a lot of the same tracks throughout the show but it never feels repetitive, as the music is so vibrant and full of life that all it does is so much more to the already upbeat aesthetic the show has.There's only one thing I didn't like in this show, and that was once scene in the early episodes of the show, in which it does the usual sexualisation of female characters that's seen far too often in anime, the scene see's a lot of the pro-dominant female characters dress up in bikinis for an advert, this scene is simply tasteless and sticks put like a bad thumb, I sigh every time this scene comes on as it's simply unneeded and adds nothing to the story and characters.I don't think I can put into words the different emotions I felt while watching this show, the amount of joy I felt while watching it for the first time will never be matched for me ever again. I watched this show at one of my lowest points in life, and this show made me feel happiness at a time when I'd forgotten what being happy meant. It has brought me closer to my friends and loved ones in ways I could never imagine, and the best part of it all is that I still feel the same way on every rewatch, the most recent of which was with my girlfriend who also has a love for this show. Overall, Amagi Brilliant Park is by far one of my favourite pieces of media of all time, simply down to the fact it values being entertaining to watch than being a masterpiece, and that is something not seen as much in the media anymore and something I deeply respect. This show is flawed and isn't perfect, but I can promise each and everyone of you this is one of the most fun and enjoyable shows that's bound to put a smile on your face even in the darkest of days.

Acknowledging the weaknesses of both KyoAni and Gatoh, it smartly avoids an overly complex plot, and the premise is simple: get enough visitors to their theme park to keep it open. While there are darker elements of potential homelessness, character death, and emotional trauma, they take a back burner to the more whimsical tongue in cheek fairytale land and slapstick situational comedy. The episodic writing and character interactions are top tier, reminiscent of Gatoh’s bigger IP, Full Metal Panic, especially Fumoffu, FMP’s third season.

One can take a few logical steps to see who the studio was making fun of with that name.Kanie is tasked with being the prophesied one that will save the theme park of Amagi Brilliant Park. Da fuq kind of prophecy is that? The theme park has hit a rough patch and hasn't been getting many visitors to show up to the park, so it's Kanie's job to fix that...and hijinks ensue.Amagi Brilliant Park has an ensemble cast of players, but by far my favorite...were the two supporting characters Macaron and Tirami. These two characters are so awful that they were upset at a certain point that there was a happy ending and nobody got killed. Other times they're up to no good doing less than benevolent things to other workers at the park.Another great character is the lead mascot Moffle. He's the typical entertainer with a bad temper that often gets into fistfights with Kanie and visitors to the park. It is rather hilarious to see a midget bear animated going full jeet kune do and knocking someone out.It's refreshing to see an anime where the lead male doesn't end up with a harem by the end. There are plenty of female supporting characters that he could have ended up with too. A romance subplot does exist, but it's hardly fleshed out and doesn't go anywhere. This is the most frustrating part with Amagi Brilliant Park because the male lead and female lead do like each other, but it's a total letdown in the end.Still, as far as comedy goes, this show is top notch. were the two supporting characters Macaron and Tirami.

What an interesting show. Magical creatures named Maple Landers, a princess from another world, a tsundere and an egotistical main character all trying to run a theme park together. What could go wrong? This show was quite entertaining, and well executed. I would recommend this 12-episode series for a quick burst of weird humor, awkward moments, and a decent amount of fanservice.Art/Sound: What else can I say? KyoAni art/sound is among the best in the anime industry. The determining reason as to why I decided to watch the show was because the art/sound looked good. I mean, how many shows out there...haven\'t you watched because it just didn\'t look good? And about the fanservice, yes, there\'s plenty. I personally don\'t care if there is or isn\'t any- it doesn\'t add or take away from my experience. But being a studio that focuses around high school girls, KyoAni is pretty good at what they do.Character: Keep in mind this is a 12-episode series, there isn\'t too much room for character development. However I was surprised with how much KyoAni was able to fit in this show. The biggest one to me was the development of Sento, who used to be a borderline abusive director (before Kanie came in), and who in I believe episode 6, undergoes a big transformation that allows her to change the way she looks at things. Kanie himself starts off as kind of a douchebag in the beginning of the series, but evolves into having a very deep heart for the people of Maple Land, especially for Princess Latifa. I also thought Moffle was a very interesting character- how he starts off hating Kanie in the beginning, to sort of developing a mutual respect for him in the end. Overall, this show has no shortage of interesting character development.Story: So without spoiling anything, I\'d say the story is somewhat cohesive. There is a problem/conflict in this show, but it is not the main focus and is only used as a method to drive the plot forward (aka, the story is the reason behind why they need to get 500000 visitors to the park). It is rushed to make things fit into the twelve episodes, and there is a resolution at the end, but it doesn\'t really bear much impact on the viewer. After learning of the resolution, I just said ""eh that\'s cool"" but didn\'t really think much more of it. But as I said, this show focuses a lot on those interactive, weird, funny moments between the characters rather than wowing you with a creative plotline and plot twists. Go watch shounens for that. (HxH and FMAB are good ones)There were some moments in the show that were too awkward even for me, where I cringed and fast-forwarded. But many moments were very well timed/funny and captured the essence of anime. Overall I would recommend.Thanks for reading! haven\'t you watched because it just didn\'t look good?

You keep saying that over and over, until its been almost a year since the original viewing of the ad. For a while, this was me and Amagi Brilliant Park. I finally sat down, bought the DVD, and I loved it. Not just love, I adore it, it's become one of my new favorite comedies.The story is pretty good, but it's not amazing. It's just insane enough to help ever other element jump off a decent...sized diving board into a pool of creativity and wackiness. I love the idea that amusement parks are homes to creatures from magical worlds. It's a little bare bones as far as a narrative goes, but it has enough fun and creative spark to it that helps me overlook that.One of the best parts of it is that it nails the characters down perfectly. Kanie is kind of an ass, but that's why I really like him. He isn't some pushover like a lot of anime characters you'll find in this type of anime, he's got balls, and he's not afraid to do whatever possible to keep the park open. He has a big ego, he isn't really a softy, and even though he's still a decent guy who's helping everyone, he isn't afraid to be pushy if needed. I like that. Sento is also more fun than I thought she'd be, I figured she might just be the sexy character. But, similar to other attractive characters like Yoko from Gurren Lagann or Takao from D-Frag, she has a fun personality. She's usually more reserved in her emotions, but when she shows them, it's fun or dramatic. Plus, her constantly using her gun is hilarious. The mascots are comedy gold, the anime is relentless with punishing them (more often than not, its completely deserved, which helps separate it from anime where punishment towards characters for comedy feels more more spirited than funny). They are just constantly hysterical, and I love how it pokes fun at how similar Moffle's design is to the mascot from Full Metal Panic, that bit of self-awareness really worked for me. The rest of the cast is pretty good, though Princess Latifa is a bit of an issue for me. She sticks out for not being as fun or funny. She's an okay character, but she doesn't leave much of an impression.The animation is surprisingly pretty great throughout the show. Often times you'll see an anime like this that has episode 1 syndrome, where episode 1 looks better than the rest of the run, aside from maybe the finale. Just about every episode here looked great, which was a pleasant surprise.The comedy is of course hilarious and off the walls, full of punishment and character based comedy that works 90% of the time.My only issue is again, Latifa, as her big character moment towards the end of the series was not as strong as they would've wanted, at least to me. Plus, the villain reveal was pretty lame and unnecessary.Overall, I love this anime. sized diving board into a pool of creativity and wackiness.

A highly underrated and unknown anime with lots of great points to give.The story was quite simple but ingenious: we need to reach 500000 visitors or the park will close. But then the story complicates, and again, and again... until we can´t get out. Nice and great to see.Art was quite fair, nothing outstanding but well done. Sound was amazing. OP, ED and insert songs are incredible, and the OST was perfect for it. Also those funny inserted sounds made everything look better.Characters are not...generic at all, everyone is great. We have the narcicist, the kuudere musketeer, the deredere lovely and cute princess, the drunk fighting stepdad who wants grandmother´s terrains, the crazy ass sheep, the dumb and extremely pervert cat (yes, it is a male), the four elements each showing incredible personalities and I could go on...

Funny things can quickly become blasé if the comedic beat is off. This is something that plagues a lot of standard anime series. They can write a joke, but they don't take the time to present the joke. And that's what makes Amagi Brilliant Park so impressive: Episode after episode the comedy feels perfectly showcased.

But absorb these kinds of shows like a sponge and this was no exception. While it initially wasn\'t as testosterone driven as a comedy series like Gintama or Digagi Kashi, which is totally what I was expecting, Amagi Brilliant Park instead offers a more light novel approach without having to boast a great deal of noise and delivers a great deal of character.STORY: I enjoy an anime that gives me the plot in a matter of minutes instead...of wasting 16 minutes of the first episode only to cram a cliffhanger conclusion that forces me to watch the next episode. I should WANT to because I\'m enjoying what I\'m watching, not forcing myself. What\'s great about the story of saving the park is the series establishes its goal right off the bat, so as a viewer, I\'m immediately invested in this, and as more details follow about the importance of said plot, it makes me want to watch even more. I would go as far to say the journey to save Amagi Park is almost like watching a Kickstarter trying to reach its stretch goals, and that makes it fascinating. Each episode searches for a new way to draw more customers to the park, so I began to become more engaged and wanted ultimately for them to succeed. The frustration the cast exhibits when being pressured to overcome such insurmountable odds feels authentic. The stakes are very high for them to succeed, so when they begin to fight amongst themselves, it\'s justified. Most anime I watch just have the heroes bickering amongst themselves for no legit reason, other than to stretch the drama for as long as possible (Tiger & Bunny\'s second half was like trying to watch someone pedal a bicycle uphill through mud). SCORE: 7ART: As noted, Brill Park\'s (as the kids call it) deep and enriching color palette makes it very easy on the eyes. One of the things I noticed immediately is the very large ensemble of...for lack of a better phrase...interesting character designs, including (and I can\'t make this up) a sentient 4 foot wrench, masked luchador security guards, and a passive, fire breathing dragon! The mascots, Moffle, Macaron, and Tirami, are incredibly adorable, though I admit, it took me about 5 episodes to figure out Tirami\'s gender. There\'s a lot of great things of various shapes and sizes to look at in Amagi, but I do have a major nitpick: the main character Sanie\'s overall design. Maybe it\'s just me, but I\'ve just about had it with anime\'s short, messy, black-haired protagonists. When did this become the default look for male leads? I can\'t think of a more boring character template, and there\'s so many sporting this same look! Why not give me something interesting to look at, at least a different hair color? Sento, the female lead, is super busty and shapely, but I can\'t stop staring at her bangs. They look funny to me, as if an extra set of bangs overlap her original ones.While Amagi\'s physical gags and jokes aren\'t anything I haven\'t seen in the last 11 years, they are kind of funny. I wished actually that it could\'ve been a bit zanier and produced new jokes, but perhaps its more reserved approach can be appreciated. SCORE: 7CHARACTERS: I can honestly say that Sanie is the kind of lead character the anime world benefits greatly from. ""Lead"" is the key word, because when the opportunity is presented to him to make a change, he accepts it with great aplomb. I had hoped that the series played more on his conceited and arrogant nature, Sanie is the perfect complete character that guides a cast of characters that are essentially schtick. That isn\'t particularly a knock on the cast for being shallow, but it\'s a little true. The crew members of Amagi Park are a little one note, Sanie and Moffle seem to be the only two dimensional personalities among the cast. Sanie\'s determination to create revenue for the park resonates throughout and he finds a way to be an inspiration for everyone. In some ways, I forgot he\'s a high schooler. Moffle, whose closest to Sento and Queen Lafita, is grizzled and discouraged. While he doesn\'t believe much in Sanie, he pushes onward, feeling the inevitability that the park is doomed. He\'s the only park member who wears his somber expression and he bears a great weight with the task at hand. Sento, on the other hand, as a female lead brings little to the show other than breasts and a small skirt. She has moments throughout, and her laconic, by-the-books attitude is something I\'ve learned to appreciate over the years, but she\'s pretty much cosplay eye candy that would bring attention to the series that probably wouldn\'t look otherwise. Nothing wrong with a cute girl to promote your show. SCORE: 8IN CLOSING: Amagi Brilliant Park may not bring much new to the comedy anime table, but this show is incredibly enjoyable. Its large cast of bizarre and adorable characters, charming story, and precious conclusion makes this one of my favorite feel-good anime titles of modern times.

Amagi Brilliant Park is a refreshingly different entry that proves that Kyoani can still continue to distinguish itself. The show is about a ludicrously bad amusement park with comically bad attractions and likewise dull ""cast members."" In order to prevent the park from closing, a former child star named Seiya is literally forced at gunpoint into attracting a few hundred thousand visitors in just a few months.This series, for the most part, is a relatively light, comical watch with cute Kyoani antics and...a (strangely) lecherous group of supporting cast members. It\'s an entertaining watch as you see the park slowly but steadily improve into something more befitting its name. As a unique entry with a likeable cast and surprise appearance from Bonta-kun\'s derivative, I\'d definitely give this a try. Just don\'t expect Fumoffu-like comedy as Seiya is no Sousuke.Animation:The animation is crisp and modern with a bright and saturated color palette. Backgrounds are decently detailed though the sky in particular is nicely drawn, especially at sunset. The characters are well drawn and easily distinguishable. You get a lot of different creatures as cast members and the more human members all likewise get the Kyoani moe treatment; just try to watch the entire thing and not think ""that was cute."" Facial expressions are very good, especially considering the supposedly fixed expressions of the mascots.There is light action in the form of attractions (shooting stuff) and Isuzu shooting people into submission. Given the light nature, I wouldn\'t expect anything too serious about the action. There is occasional fan service, though mostly of a verbal, suggestive nature from the trio mascots and the weird dinosaur who has to ""hunch over"" all the time.Sound:I think the OP is a bit over the top in terms of tonality but the melody is bright and fitting for the show. The ED is a slower but more traditional pop piece sung by the four elemental girl fairies. The show has an above average BGM suite with some particularly nice tunes; most of the tunes are nice and calming.The show also has a great VA cast with strong performances all around. Kouki Uchiyama does a great job of giving Seiya a lot of confidence to match the narcissist personality and Ai Kakuma does a likewise great job voicing Isuzu, giving her an overall emotionless demeanor but with occasional outbursts of cuteness. The main mascots are also voiced by extremely experienced VAs to round out a pretty good team.Story:The story of Amagi is pretty simple. Seiya is hired to try to reinvigorate the virtually lifeless park. As you can guess by each episode\'s title, there is a particular theme in each episode. However, at the end of each episode there is a summary of the number of visitors for that day as well as an overall summary of visitors so far in the year; just to make sure you recall how dire their situation is.Despite how bad things are, the show carries on with a hopeful and happy tone until two thirds through the show. Once you know the real reason why it is so important for the park to survive, things start getting serious. The show quickly becomes very engaging and the rising action builds quickly to a somewhat expected climax. Nonetheless, the show resolves in a nice but somewhat bittersweet end.There is a good mix of a lot of elements (comedy, management, showbiz, occasional ero) but there are definitely still some residual open questions at the end of the show. There is a fair amount of emphasis on a childhood memory of Seiya though it is never fully explained, and the entire conclusion, though conclusive, arguably leaves room for further expansion (perhaps an OVA?). Regardless, the combination of the unique setting, premise, plot, and characters worked to make this a pretty enjoyable ride.Character:Amagi has a large but entertaining mix of characters. You\'ll be spending most of the time with the conceited yet able Seiya, often accompanied by the cutely muffled personality of Isuzu. You\'ll also often fall victim to the antics of the lecherous mascot trio and take a few detours with the four fairies. Though I always preach against having a large cast, it\'s somewhat unavoidable given the nature of the setting; and given that, I think they did a great job of differentiating all the characters and giving them a strong sense of presence. Personally, I found the ecchi-minded mascots hilarious considering their normally child-friendly appearance. Moffle is no Bonta-kun but still very fun nonetheless. Overall, expect lively personalities with good chemistry all around. Just don\'t expect too much relationship development, as it\'s only lightly played with.Value:This refreshingly unique watch definitely has the KyoAni touch. It can get a bit off track with random asides and the magical elements are a bit underdeveloped at times but overall it\'s a fun watch with a comical, yet occasionally tense plot and likeable characters. There probably won\'t be a need to rewatch the show but I wouldn\'t be surprised if there is an OVA or second season. a (strangely) lecherous group of supporting cast members. It\'s an entertaining watch as you see the park slowly but steadily improve into something more befitting its name. As a unique entry with a likeable cast and surprise appearance from Bonta-kun\'s derivative, I\'d definitely give this a try. Just don\'t expect Fumoffu-like comedy as Seiya is no Sousuke.Animation:The animation is crisp and modern with a bright and saturated color palette.

It seems to have a little of some things, but they never went all the way. Take, for example, the romance. Although it was heavily implied, nothing actually happened. Comedy... passable, but I\'ve seen better. The story and plot were fairly interesting. A broke and failing park that needs to reach a certain quota to...stay afloat, and of course fantasy is mixed into all of it. Personally, I think it would\'ve been more interesting if there wasn\'t magic, seeing as the main reason they included it was for Latifa and her situation.This brings me to the characters. Mediocre, at best. I had high hopes for them from watching the first episode. I absolutely fell in love with Kanie and his narcissistic personality. I was even hoping to see more into his backstory, but that didn\'t really happen as well as I thought. In fact, I believe the reason so many characters had such little background to them was due to the story trying to focus on all of them at once and then failing to explore deeply enough.Art, as per usual, was wonderful. The opening was wonderfully preppy and cherry, something that was reflected in the anime most of the time. The ending was a fair bit calmer, but still good.As a last note, one things that especially irritated me was how they took the last episode and made it a filler. The anime should\'ve ended at episode 12. It was not only the climax of the events occuring before it, but it ended on a open and positive note. It was perfect. In fact, just after watching it I was confused as to why there was 13 episodes listed. And then I watched episode 12. It contributed nothing to the storyline other than ""a day in their life"" after the climax. Very disappointing.tl;dr: Want something complex and interesting? This isn\'t the anime for you.

Although it did have its fair share of flaws, they were overshadowed by the sound of my laughter and the smile on my cheeks.Story: 7The story is unusual to say the least. Magical creatures led by teenage boy to save an amusement park from shutting down. However, the outrageous plot and the exaggerated over-the-top characters bring the story to life with a joke for everyone, regardless of age. The episodes are handled well with a ""spotlight"" theme of bringing each character and their personality/history on stage....As well the story still remains focused on the impeding danger of their situation whether it be lack of visitors, funds, or other motives. Although we recognize the drama and grave nature of the park and its inhabitants, Amagi Brilliant Park does not become overwhelmed by its plot and does not appear forced, a difficult feat to pull off. The audience never loses sight of their circumstances and is able to empathize with their victories and failures to achieve their goals.If there is anything to reprimand Amagi Brilliant Park, it would be that there are some plot holes and loose ends as the story\'s background makes an appearance. Additionally the actions of the characters can seem somewhat indecisive in nature, temporally losing impact of what they have done. However, it is not only the characters who come off as ""wishy-washy"" but also parts of the plot which seem to be out of place or too forgiving, losing the gravity of failure and consequence. Many of these shortcomings can be attributed to the 13 episode count, which when taken into consideration can allow these flaws to be overlooked.Art: 8Kyoto animation does it again. Unlike many other studios, Kyoto animation\'s quality is for the most part consistent and recognizable. Art is appealing to the eye and well defined. The characters look alive and the few panorama shots we do receive are nothing short of gorgeous. Although I feel that additional details could be added to make the background sharper and more distinct, no objective complaints can be made about Amagi Brilliant Park\'s animation nor its graphical quality.Sound: 7Amagi Brilliant Park\'s soundtrack is well done and runs smoothly for the most part. Songs performed by the Elementario in particular strike as memorable and honestly quite catchy. Background effects and emotional triggered songs are for the most part accurate to the scene at hand, however some reused tracks feel somewhat off from the feelings that they are trying to convey.Side Note: The Elementario song is called Subarashiki FUN!TASY. Thank me later :).Characters: 8Due to the brevity of the 13 episode series, we are not able to fully explore the characters to their fullest potential. As soon as character backstories are told, the anime has to switch gears to remain on track with the plot. However, character development is still very apparent and involves the characters overcoming the prejudices of one another for the sake of a greater goal, or coming to terms with the character\'s faults with subsequent growth. Each persona is unique and keeps the audience engaged. Despite appearances, the none of the characters can be classified to anything truly generic, a breath of fresh air for many seasoned anime viewers. Even static individuals can be entertaining by being placed in funny circumstances which keeps the show fresh and inventive.Enjoyment: 8I was pleasantly surprised by Amagi Brilliant Park. I came for a comedic thrill ride and was not disappointed. Even I laughed more than I would admit. The personalities sold the show and kept my eyes glued to the screen, especially on what Macaron and Tiramie would scheme up next. Any personal nitpicks of mine would likely be that I was left hungry for more after the series came to an end. I felt attached to the characters and would have wished for more time to get to know them over the 3 month park timespan.Overall: 8Amagi Brilliant Park serves as testament that drama and over-the-top elements can blend in harmony. To anyone still on the edge of watching the show, come for the story and stay for the laughs!Recommended?: YesRewatched?: Yes As well the story still remains focused on the impeding danger of their situation whether it be lack of visitors, funds, or other motives.

There\'s the occasional harem that deserves my attention, but most of them are just boring and generic, especially Kyoani harems. This is not one of those harems. For starters, I\'m not even entirely sure I\'d call this a harem, since not a lot of romance actually goes on and there\'s really only two female ""love interests,"" so it\'s more of a show that happens to have a high female:male ratio and a love triangle that\'s never really acted on, which is nice. This show is refreshing...to say the least, since it has such a nice mix of charm, comedy, adult themes, and heartwarming moments that blend together into what Amaburi is.Story: 8The story is definitely something original, or at least I think so. Kanie Seiya is a narcissistic ex-child star with excellent reflexes and a sharp, witty attitude. One day he\'s dragged to a ratty old amusement park by his classmate Sento (at gunpoint, I might add) and is told that it is her beloved amusement park that she wishes to reconstruct so it may have more visitors and won\'t be in danger of shutting down. She believes Kanie is the key to making Amaburi a fun place again. From there, quite the plot twist happens, so I\'ll keep from going too in-depth with it, but it\'s a pleasant surprise that will make you want to keep watching.Amaburi is semi-episodic, with each episode introducing a new problem that Kanie has to solve in order to save the park. However, there IS an underlying plot that keeps each episode moving with a goal, and it\'s a pretty fun ride getting to that goal (no pun intended).The only complaint I have with Amaburi\'s story is its habit of introducing plot points that seem pretty important but never picking them back up again. Kanie\'s career as a child star seems pretty important, but as the show goes on, you find yourself forgetting about it, since it\'s never relevant to the plot and never comes back up again. Some pros to the plot include its originality and its fun style of storytelling.Art: 9It\'s Kyoani, what do you expect? Bright, fun colors. Smooth, swift animation. My only downgrade is the fanservice, which I have never been a fan of. It\'s not super in your face, but it\'s really not necessary either, and takes away a lot of good screen time that could\'ve been used for something else.Sound: 10This show\'s OP and ED are incredible. They fit the mood of the show perfectly; heartwarming, fun, and leaving you wanting more. Along with that, the OST in-show is also beautiful, and no music seems to be out of place or forgetful. Definitely a fine OST, no complaints.Character: 7This was sort of a tough choice, as I considered giving it an 8, but I found myself wanting to grade this criteria a little harsher. The MC is a fun character, since he actually has a personality, unlike so many Kyoani/harem male leads. His character is one of the most fun I\'ve seen in a while, and he never forgets who he is. He grows kinder and more selfless over time, but he\'s still himself by the end of the series; narcissistic, witty, and sassy. He\'s definitely one of the more fleshed-out male leads I\'ve seen Kyoani do, I just wish they went into his past a little more.Sento is another interesting female lead, since I wasn\'t expecting her to change as much as she did. You can see how much being around Kanie had affected her, and her development is pretty impressive. Despite this, she and Latifa, the other main female, still fit the harem MC stereotypes that I hate so much, which is why I gave this criteria a 7 instead of an 8.Some of the side characters like the less relevant mascots and other performers at Amaburi were a whole lot of fun, and did get some pretty nice character development, but I\'d have liked to see more from them.Enjoyment: 8I really did love Amaburi, as it was so refreshing to see such an interesting mix of adult and child themes in a show. Just when I thought we\'d seen enough mushy kid-show scenes, it slaps us in the face with one of the cutesy mascots smoking or getting drunk and cat-calling waitresses. I\'d definitely recommend this to someone who wants a more original story while also maintaining a good plot and interesting characters. to say the least, since it has such a nice mix of charm, comedy, adult themes, and heartwarming moments that blend together into what Amaburi is.Story: 8The story is definitely something original, or at least I think so.

Five episodes in, I had to stop watching because, apparently, I’d forgotten to download episodes 6 and 7. Then I got really mad with myself for that colossal mess-up which I couldn’t readily fix because, well, my internet had the downs.Naturally,...the hunger hadn’t been sated so I began sniffing through all the other numerous folders in my PC where I could have downloaded an anime by accident and forgotten to watch it. Finally, I had managed to find Amagi Brilliant Park (along with its special episodes) in a folder containing Shoujo manga…Ah, so I was hankering for a comedy manga. Yes! That’s right. Nanatsu no Taizai was coming along fine but could Amagi Brilliant Park prove to be better in that field? Well, that’s pretty much the only area where it excels.As you can see from the synopsis, Amaburi (short for the whole name) is basically about how a non-musical highschooler Kanye West is coaxed into helping the management of the Amagi Brilliant Park bring in 250,000 visitors to meet the year’s 500,000 visitor quota or else the park would get shut down. That’s it. There are no twists or other huge plot developments that will make you go, “OOOoooooh kukukukuku! Naruhodo.” (Oh, hehehe! I see.) It’s just a straight-forward comedy about saving a failed business. If you want to give it funny title then ‘Theme Park Tycoon: The Anime: The Adaptation” will work quite nicely.Since this is a full-on comedy show, no two shits are giving about backgrounds of the people who work in the park. Most of the characters are from some magical Disneyland called ‘Maple Land’ and you’re just expected to go with that. Hell, up till episode 6 I was still reluctant in accepting the ‘magical beings’ shtick because even Maple Land was treated as some recurring gag. Also, the tension created using plot devices pulled out of the arse of a rabbit in a top-hat doesn’t really help much. They seem like episodic afterthoughts – not planned to be in the story and therefore being very cheap.Basically, what I’m saying is that the concept of Amaburi is neat but the story is just a mess. If you’re going in for the story then you’re in for a huge disappointment because this Kyoto Animation work follows in the vein of ‘K-On!’.Thankfully, all I wanted from Amaburi was the funnies and I got it by the bucketfuls after the second episode when the jokes finally leave fan service territory. Hilarious skits about alcoholism; an episode in which Kanye falls sick and the three crazy mascot guys take turns filling in for him at school and making a huge love triangle fiesta, another episode where one of the mascots takes his trainees to an underground wrestling arena hosted by a kindergarten, and many weird skits involving references and mention of panties. I seriously needed the hard laughs provided by this show. Really made my day brighter. (I binged Amaburi).Just like any other comedy-focused anime, the characters of Amaburi belong in Dimension One. If someone’s a perv, then he’s likely to stay a pervert. Except for Tricen the Triceratops. He’s a very well written perverted dinosaur. The only character that gets any actual development is Kanye the MC and, to be honest, he’s the only one who deserves it seeing as this is a comedy and all.The animation, in my opinion, isn’t anything special considering this is a KyoAni show. I need spectacularly beautiful cherry blossom petals and really smooth movement that’ll make scenes from this show a frequent pick for AMVs. I’m not saying the animation is bad – it’s actually pretty good. I’m just saying that KyoAni was just really tame with it and I don’t like that.The music’s nothing special. Nothing to talk about here!Overall, Amagi Brilliant Park gets a 7.25 out of 10 from me. If not for the story being literally all over the place and melodrama for the sake of melodrama, then this show could have been a smidge better. The scoring also largely suffers from the ‘magical’ ending which I really disliked. Still, it’s a fun show for the lols. Watch it if you want to binge a comedy while waiting for someone. the hunger hadn’t been sated so I began sniffing through all the other numerous folders in my PC where I could have downloaded an anime by accident and forgotten to watch it.

I need spectacularly beautiful cherry blossom petals and really smooth movement that’ll make scenes from this show a frequent pick for AMVs. I’m not saying the animation is bad – it’s actually pretty good. I’m just saying that KyoAni was just really tame with it and I don’t like that.The music’s nothing special. Nothing to talk about here!Overall, Amagi Brilliant Park gets a 7.25 out of 10 from me. If not for the story being literally all over the place and melodrama for the sake of melodrama, then this show could have been a smidge better. The scoring also largely suffers from the ‘magical’ ending which I really disliked. Still, it’s a fun show for the lols. Watch it if you want to binge a comedy while waiting for someone.', 'It sounds simple, maybe even boring for whoever imagines it might be a serious series among others in Fall season. You can always find it either funny or silly, such enjoyable full of laughter series to relieve your stress without sweep your logic away, because here we can also feel the suppressors are on its way. Citizens of magical realm called Maple Land are living their life in a poor amusement park, alienated by visitors and organized badly, the only reason that make all of the citizens / staffs here still do the job is because all of the staffs need magical power in order...to live, and the method to get the magical power is created by happiness of man having fun in their park.The park is in critical state which needs dozens of visitors to make it keep alive, otherwise it will be changed hands as a provision if the amount of visitor insufficient. To save the park from closing, Seiya is hired by the owner, Latifa Fleuranza--the princess of Maple land-- (whom Seiya met before when he was a young boy) to be a new manager, and help Amagi Brilliant Park to overcome the needed visitors, around 250,000 visitors in 3 months.[somewhat SPOILER] Kanie gets an ability to know what\'s on person\'s mind after his doubt to Latifa made this princess gave him the ability by her magic power. Behind all of this (already) serious matter, later found that the life of Latifa-sama, the Highness in this park, is on the line as well as the park. Summary, to save the park means to save Latifa-sama\'s life too. Latifa Fleuranza always be a 14 years old girl, memory erased after a year on Aug 1st due to the curse she got from a witch that betrayed by Latifa\'s father promise to be able marrying Latifa when she was child.Pretty much the brief summary of story is explained, the plot and the tasks they need to be done in a short time is all about how to attract guests to their lovely home, or say amusement park. One by one, every lil possibility they use intellectually, sharply, elegantly, to achieve their only goal \'til the end of July. Even if on every eps we will force to face the new problems and find the solution, the show is succeed to bring joy. It\'s also helped by the characters.Not much characterization is involved here, the involvement is wholly centered on the park itself by the characters or the staffs of Amagi Brilliant Park. Let me name Moffle, Tiramie, and Macaron, these mascots that leave such impressions, like trio clown they are freaking funny. No need to worry the show has enough unique female characters, Sento Isuzu, Latifa Fleuranza, and the Elementario. They are the center of story, a fateful encounter of main hero, Seiya Kanie, and the park workers, their secrets indeed a serious matter but those are all brought up with millions of laughs.I\'m pleased by the visualization, bright and vivid color, firm line and nice body curve, delight scenes as if it\'s a real amusement park. It even makes the abandoned park seems well-maintained, it\'s just how it was organized badly.In a long time I haven\'t heard steady beat and pumping heart theme songs, and found Amagi Brilliant Park OP song is catchy enough, sung by AKINO with bless4 ""Extra Magic Hour (エクストラ・マジック・アワー)"".

I keep coming back to give each episode another chance, but I get more and more put off by the male MC, Kanie Seiya. He's just a straight up douche bag. At times, he shows glimmers of potential in his actions, but he seemingly partakes in such actions for the sake of his own interests and furthering as a narcissistic individual.I may be making a grave mistake in putting this show on hold....I see a fairly universal consensus of the gem that this show is within the genre of romantic comedy. Yet being a HUGE fan of romantic comedy, I've found this show to be a complete dirge thus far. It's been hard to watch, yet even so, I want to keep trying. I feel as if I'm missing something. I'm so detached from most of the characters and struggle with relating to them in their various facets that I'm tempted to drop it and probably will, at least for the time being.This reaction is puzzling to me, as I'm usually not picky with anime. As a genre and means of story telling, I admire many of the ideas that are offered within the entire sphere of this art. Yet this series has been a real bore, a real pain and an immense chore to continually watch.

Yet given different characters or different character qualities, I feel like so much more could be done with this series.

Thus far, she seemingly takes an interest in Seiya, even as he addresses her tactlessly with little remorse. I hope in continuing with this anime, that their relational dichotomy can provide a grounds for Seiya to get off of his high horse. But hey, I didn't write this story. I can only hope though...After exhausting my personal feelings regarding the story and characters, I suppose I'll briefly sum up some of the other aspects of the show...Art- The artwork is gorgeous, vibrant and colorful. Definitely a perk to this series.Sound/Music- Sound quality is great, music is meh. I still haven't taken a liking to the theme song at all. The vocalist sounds like a Japanese Katy Perry, and I can only handle so much American Katy Perry.Enjoyment- I really haven't enjoyed it all that much.

(I review and describe the anime with a pizza analogy)Amagi Brilliant Park is like a classic pizza, it's fun and simple. It's not trying to be revolutionary and on the surface it looks like a mediocre pizza. But just because it isn't revolutionary doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable to eat. But if you stop for a moment and appreciate its taste, beyond its surface it actually has some complex flavours to it, however it would take a while to appreciate it beyond its surface as a fun light hearted pizza that most people can enjoy.It may have weak and simple flavours, with...simple and basic ingredients but because it has so many fun and simple ingredients that in itself makes for a new flavour that is a delight to enjoy. This is a rare case where Quantity actually beats Quality.If you're looking for a gourmet or deluxe pizza, Amagi ain't it.

This is no coincidence, this is merely the result of high IQ individuals meticulously crafting the zenith of human pleasure. Ok, that sentence didn\'t need to exist, I just wanted to...make this intro longer. Moving on.Narrative:Amaburi narrative is episodic, but each individual episode does retain meaning, and actually does present to be of use in future episodes with the characters and achievements that are made in the individual episodes. For something episodic, that has more coherence than anything I have seen with the episodic formula, this works incredibly well and gives off that building nature towards the end goal of this anime. In saying this though, I suppose the episodes in themselves are probably not the most inventive. Whilst they do lack some individuality to them I wouldn\'t necessarily call them bad.The only factor helping there is execution.Amaburi\'s execution of their episodes are fantastic, and whilst this ties into enjoyment as you will enjoy what is made from it, I must still concede that this has some relevance to the narrative\'s writing, this anime is enthusiastic and what is presented only goes to show such a case.One thing that gets me with Amaburi is its lore, and its attachment to tell it, for an anime that is supposedly in its own cloud doing whatever, it takes great consideration into the background of what everything is and why it is. There isn\'t a problem with this, but Amaburi isn\'t the best at neither shifting the tone in telling this nor expanding, it only serves as ""hey, this really cool thing (has/will) just happened, but let\'s go back to what we were doing though."" It isn\'t as half-assed as I make it out to be, but such ambition never seemed to hold its own landing, and honestly, the last episode even checks out and verifies everything I have just pointed out. I suppose the lore behind the park is interesting, but it should have gone the whole way to make it more than just some background you will care less about. Still pretty good stuff all in all.As for the characters, I really like them. They lack development, though that isn\'t to worry about, as stated, this is episodic, and more so dedicated to the comedic side of things, but don\'t be discouraged. What I really like about these guys is their personalities and how they interact in different situations, everyone here is able to compose themselves in behaviour that fits their attitudes and the situation, it is like a ""what would you do in this situation"" but be more honest to yourself. When a goofy character wants to mess around, they will, but when the situation calls for an aligning change, they will change accordingly, in other words, these guys function like normal people. I suppose this is less true for characters like Sento and Kanie, but other side characters seem to check out with no fuss, hell, they are quite memorable people, namely, Moffle, \tTiramie, Macaron, and the members of the Elementario, I suppose some more but they are more minor characters. Sento and Kanie are both more on the development side of things, more so Kanie, who also has more backstory. It is usually just how they perceive situations though and what they will do about it, I mean, both start off in a somewhat odd position, but the pair better each other out as they go on, I think they become a loveable duo in where you may also like who they are as people as well, both have something about them that just makes them cooler than the rest. I suppose characters in this anime are nothing short of just fun people all around.Audiovisuals:I am going to first start with audio because that was so baseline I remember nothing of it, only the catchy OP and decent ED. Literally, nothing else to comment on.As for the visuals, I was fooled into believing this was something out of today\'s time, I really did think that this was released around 2018/9 time but had a look and the date says 2014. This is way ahead of its time and KyoAni sure did make some fantastic animation for their viewer, good fluid flow, polished character designs, almost magical scenery that is shown off. I suppose in today\'s standard this isn\'t as great as it was as back then, but I will be ranking this off of the standard of when it was released, which only leads me to praise it more for what it has done. For anyone who needs a matchup in my opinion as to what it would score in today\'s standard, I\'d say 7/10. Yes, it is still good. Great stuff really.Enjoyment:Amaburi has one purpose, to entertain, both the park and the anime, and entertain it does. Despite all that is cliche, this anime is sure funny as hell and had me laughing multiple times. To be fair, comedy anime usually make me laugh a lot, so take this with a pinch of salt if you are more serious than what my reactions happen to be. That isn\'t to say that it isn\'t going to be funny, it should do for fans of comedy, or those that don\'t have ridiculous standards. Clever jokes in the midst of good execution and the idea to make things a little more bombastic than meets the eyes, really, universally, this is quite the enjoyable anime.Overall - 7.3 (7)----------TLDR Review:Story - 7: Episodic, but knows how to do connect the different characters and achievements altogether. Lore is pretty ambitious but it doesn\'t hold up.Visuals - 8.5: Great for its time, would even be good in today\'s standard, pretty much the usual but enhanced in every way.Audio - 6: Just basic OST. OP and ED are good though.Character - 7: Normal people with personalities to call their own, not a lot of development or other growth.Enjoyment - 8: Very funny, good comedy indeed.Overall - 7.3 (7)----------Quickly going to rate how good of a kuudere Sento is+ Cool, rational, expressionless+ Shows emotion when situations concerning feels arise+ Hot and looks beautiful+ Has guns that come out of her body- Not enough screen time- Lacks focus sometimes(8/10)I went surfing on my ptw that I usually never use and thought that I\'d go with Amaburi, I remember seeing it in a compilation somewhere on YT but don\'t actually have a lot of memory on that. Anyways, what a pleasant anime to watch, something I would for sure recommend to people moderately into the anime medium. This looks as if it lesser hyped works of KyoAni, but it was something that was pretty good of itself regardless. I\'d want a season 2 imo, but I honestly do believe that the chances are it won\'t happen, oh well, I could try the light novel if I have time. This was also one of those anime where I left it on hold for the longest minute (10th May - 19th July), was just laziness really, though I am currently going over things I have leftover. At the end of the day, Amaburi is probably something I\'d look back at thinking only pleasant memories, like my times at theme parks, even though I am not a fan of rides like rollercoasters... make this intro longer.

The animation and the dub of the anime is done pretty nicely. All the characters look good and funny.

The thing is to see the series and have a good time, and in my opinion Kyoto Animation has succeeded. It is an anime to de-stress and watch it without worry.What attracts the most is obviously the designs of the characters and the animation, worthy of Kyoto Animation quality as always. The drawing style is phenomenal, when I see...this, I remember why I don't want 3D scenes to fit into anime. 2D is unique, and there are effects that can only be achieved with it.

Examples would be bad Character, Story, Art, Sound, etc.Some anime like this one, lack in the character and story department but EXCEL in the art and sound department.Why don't I elaborate a bit more?[Story] 5/10 - While the anime starts off with a bunch of questions, it really does take its sweet damn time to develop a story worth getting into. In fact it uses a cheap tactic to...get the viewer to care more near the end of the series, but said tactic is used in a lot of different anime so I can't be too picky about it.If you are going to establish stakes or consequences you gave to do it early or the actions and decisions the characters make wont well make a difference.There are very small moments in this anime where the main character is trying to decide on something at a meeting or attempting to figure out a solution to a problem. These scenes are fantastic! Not only do they show well character! They show his unscene or unread thoughts, which can make a difference in writing a compelling story.[Art] 10/10 - This is a prime example of giving credit where it is due! The art/animation is amazing. Is it the best thing I've ever seen? No. Not by a long shot, but it's still really good! The creativity in the animators really shows in this anime. Having a very diverse cast of characters, each with their own cute little design and uniqueness to them. Even the side characters who get around 20 seconds of screen time per episode, have a unique design that fits their character.The animation is really nice too! It's very smooth and rarely choppy.Backgrounds and scenes are just gorgeous too. Especially when they are the focal point for some scenes![Sound] 9/10 - Minus a fairly okay OP the sound design is pretty good. It fits a fantasy world, it fits the amusement park vibe. The music rarely distracted me, in fact there is only one scene that completely took me out of the mood. Other than these minor complaints there really isn't much else to say. Only thing I can think of is that the ED was damn good.[Character] 5/10 - This goes hand in hand with the story. A lot went wrong here and it's pretty obvious went made it go wrong. The main characters are flat and boring... They rarely even change and at the end of the character arcs it left me feeling empty. Now there is nothing wrong with having a few flat characters but when your main character is flat and so is the supporting lead it makes scenes where their characteristic would help with some comedy or even convey a specific thought or emotion, fall flat on the ground, all bones are broken, hospitalized permanently bad. I don't know if this was on purpose or that they just didn't design characters correctly? It's still a mystery to me.[Enjoyment] 8/10 - Like most comedies, they don't require an intersting story to be funny. This anime gave me a few laughs and inspired many memes from certain characters having completely different faces than they usually do. I had fun watching it.Do I recommend this? Yep!Why? It is a great show to watch with friends, due to it's weirdness and wackiness factor.[Overall] 7.5/10 - Not a perfect, not a bad, not a great. but just plain good.

So were all the mascot characters. The concept is unique and pulled off well. Everything that the concept had to offer felt present. It explored the concept in the way it should. The main struggle is good and handled well. It has a satisfying solution.Now for the bad. Sento is a good character but she get so many poor storyline which prevents me from enjoying her character properly. However their a character who's personality is to be stupid. This character makes me cringe every time I see them on screen. We never...were given a reason to care about Latifa. Thus there isn't a sense we will have a meaning full loss if she were to disappear. Any and all sympathy for her comes from her situation and not her character. Her character is non existent. An episode dedicated to her would fix my main gripe with the story. If we instead were given time to explore her character and how she thinks, we would care for her. Instead her character is situation driven and not character driven. Lastly how her situation was resolve was lazy. It was wave away with magic that was only explained after the fact. And the explanation was also lazy.Overall a few bad episode and how the secondary conflict was resolved prevents me from enjoying the show. I have low ratings for this first season. However in a second season, I'd probably give it a higher rating like a 7 or 8. It is very unlikely they will repeat the storyline that brang it down in the first place. Thus without these plot points, the show exponentially goes up. A season 2 is needed for this series to make this show shine. This first season is just poor.

There's not much Romance here but there are indeed a lot of character developments. KyoAni adaptation style usually revolves around sticking different chapters of different volume together. For example this adaptation has bits and pieces from Volume 1, 2, and even 3. Thankfully it's still made into a condusive story so that's not that big of a problem. KyoAni is very consistent with their animation and I appreciate it. The animation is always very smooth...and that adds to the enjoyment. Thanks Akino from Bless4 for making one of my most memorable anime opening ever, the ending is also good though. And characters! The characters has downright amazing chemistry. They just seem like a very good cast. There are also some character development included, but if you are more into that I'd really recommend reading the novels. It's not wrong to say that I really-really enjoyed this adaptation. So much that I instantly read the novels. I'd suggest you a try if you like comedy and a sprinkle of drama. and that adds to the enjoyment.

You want something different concept wise (In a sense of comedy)This story sets in a hint of a fantasy(?) world where the MC is given responsibility to restore a near abandoned amusement park. And unlike a lot of the comedy anime that tries to set a different concept, this series really sticks to its roots, and gradually illustrates the development of the amusement park to an extent that I actually would like the series to be longer to explore this in more profound depth....In essence, this series is not an ""everyday school romcom"" that follows all its corresponding cliches.2. You are looking for a decent light-hearted anime.Sometimes we just want to get away from all the deep and dark part of anime, and if you are looking for a series to get away from the dark aura of Death Note, PsychoPass etc, this is a perfect getaway without feeling like you have watched a load of nonesense. (I mean typical cliche harem light-hearted series)3. You do not want an element of romance.Romance can be a pivotal factor of the genre of romcom, and this is what defines a good romcom from a bad one. But many of the times, romance element can come with its drawbacks such as: dense characters, low quality harem and fan service (key here is \'low quality\'), annoying tsundere and drifting from the main concept of the story. Amagi Brilliant Park offers no romance element, so it you don\'t like the factors I mentioned above, this might be the light-hearted anime for you.4. You want a comedy anime with a \'plot\'.What I mean by it has a plot is that the story is constantly heading somewhere. This is because the MC has a goal to develop the park into a certain standard within a time limit. So if you are not down for situational comedy (like Daily lives of High School Boys, Nichijou and Sket Dance), there\'s a good chance you will like this.With that being said, I DO NOT recommend this series if:1. You are looking for a top quality pure comedy series (obviously)If you want something that will make you laugh your arse off, this is not it chief. I\'d recommend something like Gintama, Nichijou, OPM, Daily lives of HSB if you want something really good. (or Seitokai Yakuindomo, Grand Blue or Hinamatsuri for something a bit less mainstream)2. You want romance (harem?) as well as comedy.Despite the occasional annoyance and misunderstanding, tsunderes can be cute, and you get none here. As well as MC\'s harem. And also fan service. Although I would say there is a ship, the characters have close to zero romantic encounters in this series.3. You are searching for a well written story.Although I would say the concept of this anime is very nice, it is quite a predictable plot. There are also some random characters and its Disney-like ending is dodgy, anti-climatic and doesn\'t make a whole lot of sense. But this is not the point of this series, as it is focused on comedy and it may not bother most of the people. This doesn\'t impact the comedic aspect of the series at all, but if you are bothered that the plot is noticeably weak at times, you may want to avoid this series.In essence, Amagi Brilliant Park is not a brilliant comedy series, but if you are looking for some chuckles or a general light-hearted plot to take away some of your boredom, this is the series for you.

I am very exited and I hope that it helped you!)(I don't really have anything...else to write because I am not a professional and as I already mentioned, this is my first review.) else to write because I am not a professional and as I already mentioned, this is my first review.)"", 'Amagi Brilliant Park is an anime that brands itself as a dramatic comedy. I was recommended this anime because it apparently shared some similarities with Konosuba (and I can see how some people might reach that conclusion). I think it fails to accomplish some of its goals, i\'ll try to go over each factor in detail.(some spoilers)The plot of this anime is pretty straightforward. The protagonist is immediately approached by a girl and told that he needs to help her save a theme park from being shut down (for some reason - it\'s never really made clear why some random high schooler is chosen for...this purpose). This comedy brands itself as a comedy, and while it does have plenty of humor mixed in, I think it lacks soul. Some comedies, like Konosuba, do a great job of making the comedy a part of the story itself. It doesn\'t feel forced or tacked on. This anime, by comparison, takes itself way too seriously at times and tends to abruptly inject its comedy where you least expect it. It felt like the writers couldn\'t decide on whether they wanted a lighthearted comedy or a super serious drama. There were plenty of scenes that would have benefited from some comedy but instead all you get is some boring interactions between characters that you really don\'t care all that much about.Speaking of characters, I have beef with the character writing in this anime. The protagonist is somewhat poorly written. He\'s a narcissist, which tends to be a rarity when it comes to MCs. Giving the MC a character flaw that isn\'t ""introverted"" or ""awkward with girls"" is always nice. Other than that he\'s kind of a gary stu at times. Somehow this random high school teen knows how to manage a damn amusement park, which is kind of wacky in my opinion. They could have at least tried to write in some details into his character that would make it a bit more believable. Or failing that, try to write the anime in a more comedic fashion and poke fun at how a teenager is managing an amusement park. There are many approaches they could have taken that would have made more sense.Isuzu is also kind of poorly written. There\'s a weak romance subplot between her and the MC (for some stupid reason) that mostly just irritated me. It\'s like the writers couldn\'t decide whether they wanted this anime to be a romance or not, so they half-assed this romance between her and the MC. At the 12th episode the MC almost confesses his love for her but ends up running away instead. What a waste of time. Isuzu is also kind of a typical busty heroine and it feels like she\'s mostly kept around as eye candy. Occasionally she shoots someone with her rifle or gets embarrassed when someone points out she has a crush on the MC. That\'s basically the extent of her character.A lot of the other characters are so tertiary that the anime barely goes into much detail on them. There\'s Moffle and his other sidekicks that act as comedic relief and a bunch of other staff members that don\'t get enough screen time to really be worth mentioning.Art and music were fine. Nothing awful but nothing exceptional.Ultimately this anime feels like it can\'t decide on what it wants to be. It has comedic moments, but not frequently enough to be consistently funny like other comparable comedies. It has moments of drama, but the strange setting and weak character building in this anime makes it hard to take seriously as a drama. It has moments of romance, but they are so sparse that you could barely call this anime a romance. Like I said earlier, it feels like this anime lacks soul.

I give it a weak 6.', '(NOTE: Spoilers only at the very end.)Amagi Brilliant Park was a random recommendation from a friend that I chose to check out and honestly, more people should. It\'s not the most mind blowing thing ever, but it sticks to its strengths and delivers on what it sets out to do. It is after all at its core a comedy series about a bunch of wacky and whimsical characters from a far away magical land trying to live amongst the humans and manage an amusement park. To me at least, the humour lands consistently and every episode got some genuine laughs out of me.The premise itself...is simple enough, the visuals are nice, albeit unimpressive, but the story itself flows very nicely and the dialogue is really good too. All the characters are really varied and have very unique and interesting designs, as well as very engaging personalities. It\'s the interactions between them that bring the best moments the show has to offer. Near the end, some emotional stakes are added too, and while they are a bit contrived, they do the job well of adding weight to everything happening and add a powerful twist to the ending, which in and of itself was very well executed and joyful. The main conflict wraps up nicely in the 12th episode and the final 13th episode is mostly just an epilogue but is also one of the most glorious shitposts ever animated. Worth watching the whole thing just for that. Oh, and everything I said also applies to the OVA, that\'s basically just more of the same. There\'s a good reason why it\'s also called ""episode 14"".SPOILER: My only major criticism is how throughout the whole anime, it\'s not just implied but outright shown that the stoic main characters Kanie and Sento have strong romantic feelings for each other, and several times near the end it seems that one of them will finally pull the curtain back and share how they truly feel with the other. However, this never happens and that plot thread was left unresolved. This to me is the biggest missed opportunity here. You have these two stone faced characters that show barely any affection of any kind towards any person, clearly having a huge crush on each other, you can feel how this is meant to build to an epic moment where they finally confess and let the tears of joy flow, but sadly this never comes to fruition. I haven\'t read the manga this is based on, so I don\'t know if this is something that happens there but didn\'t make it into the anime adaptation, but in any case, the anime left this pretty major subplot unresolved and that bugs me. It doesn\'t detract too much from the overall experience, since the focus is the comedy after all and that remains consistently strong all throughout. However, I still really wanted to see that big moment and get the payoff of all the buildup. is simple enough, the visuals are nice, albeit unimpressive, but the story itself flows very nicely and the dialogue is really good too.

Near the end, some emotional stakes are added too, and while they are a bit contrived, they do the job well of adding weight to everything happening and add a powerful twist to the ending, which in and of itself was very well executed and joyful. The main conflict wraps up nicely in the 12th episode and the final 13th episode is mostly just an epilogue but is also one of the most glorious shitposts ever animated. Worth watching the whole thing just for that. Oh, and everything I said also applies to the OVA, that\'s basically just more of the same. There\'s a good reason why it\'s also called ""episode 14"".SPOILER: My only major criticism is how throughout the whole anime, it\'s not just implied but outright shown that the stoic main characters Kanie and Sento have strong romantic feelings for each other, and several times near the end it seems that one of them will finally pull the curtain back and share how they truly feel with the other. However, this never happens and that plot thread was left unresolved. This to me is the biggest missed opportunity here. You have these two stone faced characters that show barely any affection of any kind towards any person, clearly having a huge crush on each other, you can feel how this is meant to build to an epic moment where they finally confess and let the tears of joy flow, but sadly this never comes to fruition. I haven\'t read the manga this is based on, so I don\'t know if this is something that happens there but didn\'t make it into the anime adaptation, but in any case, the anime left this pretty major subplot unresolved and that bugs me. It doesn\'t detract too much from the overall experience, since the focus is the comedy after all and that remains consistently strong all throughout. However, I still really wanted to see that big moment and get the payoff of all the buildup.', 'Every once in a while, you need a solid goofy anime to help you trudge through the sea of Action and Slice of Life that you see every day. Amagi Brilliant Park fits pretty well into that slot for those that need it.Story: Following Highschool Student Seiya Kanie, you get to watch him use his narcissistic personality and know it all attitude in order to help restore a failing amusement park. The park is more than meets the eye though as all the workers are creatures from a magical realm. The story is lighthearted yet falls on serious tones when it comes to the...notions of having to save the park, and this plot will never be forgotten as it sticks true to its story without falling off on any unnecessary tangents.The Art and Sound of Amagi Brilliant Park are nothing to go crazy about, but they are very whimsical and childish (In a good way). It is definitely befitting of the story that it is following.Characters are very enjoyable and loveable for the anime and there are a wide cast of them from; Magical Perverts, Otakus, In Need of Anger Management Uncles, A Girl Who Solves Problems by Shooting Them, and Lolis. The character development may not be too massive, other than changing work ethic which is pertinent to the actual plot of the story.Overall Amagi Brilliant Park is a nice feel good anime that entices feelings of a nitty gritty Disney World, but with the magical feeling that Disney World used to deliver to you when you were a child. Can not go wrong with a watch here. notions of having to save the park, and this plot will never be forgotten as it sticks true to its story without falling off on any unnecessary tangents.The Art and Sound of Amagi Brilliant Park are nothing to go crazy about, but they are very whimsical and childish (In a good way).

For example, they have Moffle who goes after his shift and drinks. It\'s a decent plot none the less and entertaining enough but not much beyond that. There are 14 episodes including the OVA, I\'ve watched them all and really all you need...are the first 12, that wraps it up, I don\'t see how the 13th wasn\'t an OVA as well. They could\'ve explored Sento a lot more with those episodes and it makes you believe that they do from the synopsis of the episode but they don\'t really and it just feels kind of stale without it because all it does is hint at a romantic option.Another thing they didn\'t explore too well was the villain, it seemed kind of shoehorned in there and it feel it easily could\'ve made something out of it. They go through some improvements of the park in each episode like ""more employees"" ""more motivation"" ""more safety"" ""more attractions"" stuff like that and it works and it gives you a sense for these characters, not just why they want to reach their goal. I like Kanie just because they pronounce his name ""Kany-ae"" and he seems the most fleshed out in a way.Overall this is just a kind of for fun average anime, I didn\'t feel drawn to it but I wanted something to watch. are the first 12, that wraps it up, I don\'t see how the 13th wasn\'t an OVA as well.

The first episode started out a bit weird and I honestly don’t blame some people who dropped it, but as the story progresses, you’ll find yourself binging it till the end. The concept of the story, wherein they have to get 500,000 visitors, may be typical (bc honestly we know how it ends), but the process of how it is shown in each episode is so random (in a good way.) We are introduced with weird characters and strange plots that make us curious to see how it...all fits in the end.Art: (9/10)No wonder the visuals are so gorgeous, its studio is KyoAni! The details of every scene and the fluidity in animation is just breathtaking. The drawing of Kanie is so good that I honestly have a crush on him hahaha. Even Sento and Latifa looks so beautiful.Sound: (7/10)So happy to hear one of my favorite VA’s, Uchiyama Kouki, who voices Kanie Seiya. Also, the intro is such a bop and the sound effects nicely fits when portraying humor.Character: (7/10)At first glance, I was a bit appalled seeing the unusual characters, especially the mascots. It honestly didn’t make the anime look attractive. If they were drawn normally like the other 3, maybe the views would escalate a bit. That is, my first thought when I started watching this show. Over the time I’ve come to realize the reason why they were drawn that way and eventually loved each character on the show.I was honestly hoping for a little more romance between Kanie and Sento ❤️ Haha. They had such good chemistry (not to mention both are good-looking) that I felt giddy even at the most normal interactions. Hopefully in the next season (if there is one), their relationship gets to expand a bit more.Latifa, on the other hand, is a beautiful character. But because her presence wasn’t revealed much throughout the episodes, I couldn’t really empathize with her. SPOILER-is!:The twist in the end was good, but it didn’t really leave a deep mark that could get myself to tear up.Enjoyment: (8/10)Let me just say that this anime is COMEDY GOLD! The humor in this show is just so ridiculously good that I had to repeat some scenes just to get a good laugh. Also, the build-up of improving the amusement park was exciting and I enjoyed each episode with all of its randomness that comes along with it. Lastly, the ending was just utterly wholesome. I knew they were gonna make it, but I never expected that the process would be so thrilling.Overall: (7/10)Honestly, it’s not KyoAni’s best work, but it is really entertaining. If you’re looking for a feel-good anime, then I would really recommend this. This anime is really underrated and if you’re hesitating because of some of the weird characters (I get it bc I too felt the same way), don’t worry you’ll eventually surpass that feeling and start loving their quirks. all fits in the end.Art: (9/10)No wonder the visuals are so gorgeous, its studio is KyoAni!

The ending as well was alright you can obviously tell what was gonna happen at the end when it came to the task they had to do.Characters: Now the main character is alright he has some back story so it shows why he is needed by the other people and why...he is the best for the job, however, this guy is narcissistic and really don\'t like characters that do that, but this guy every once and a while will brag about himself and it annoyed me a bit, but the one redeeming thing was obviously the love interest or the main female characters I guess you can say she is ""waifu"" material and she made me chuckle a couple of times so she did help redeem it for me, but with the rest of the characters is nice because they all are different beings ranging from fairies to an actual dragon and I like the fantasy aspect of it.Art: The art itself was alright every once and a while the animation went above the expectation and I did enjoy that. They also go into a lot of detail when it comes to certain kids in the show that really weirded me out so sure I was a bit creeped out, but I will acknowledge the detail that was put onto these kids.Overall: I did like the idea of the main story it was very creative and unique in its own way because I\'ve yet to see another anime that\'s done this.

It\'s funny, charming, and made smile. The jokes are well written and use good characters that make for some hillarious moments (for ex: there are several cute mascot characters that actually have the minds of dirty old men). However some of the non-comedy ends of the writing tend to fall flat. The main character is supposed to be a self loving narccisist but he rarely ever actually acts like it (in fact he often acts the opposite) outside of a few scenes in the first and last episodes. There...are several things mentioned or briefly started (romance between characters, the main character\'s backstory etc) but never really explored. Despite this there are still some tense or dramatic moments.I would reccomend this anime to anyone looking for a fun ""save the rec center"" type comedy who wouldnt mind a lackluster story. are several things mentioned or briefly started (romance between characters, the main character\'s backstory etc) but never really explored.

The concept is unique: a former child star is hired by a royal guard from another world to act as the manager for a failing theme park desparately in need of improvement, lest the fantastical inhabitants of the park be doomed to starvation once the park closes. The choice of characters in this anime is amazing, and the naming inspirations are brilliant. With our protagonists Seiya Kanie (a clear nod to Kanye West) and royal guard Isuzu Sento (50 Cent), the comedy is brilliant of the hapless, bored and clearly apathetic Seiya...being pushed to brilliance by the cold, gun-toting, and violent guard Isuzu. Rounding off the comedy is the hilarious trio of old men/cute magic fairies Moffle, Macaron, and Tiramy (whose perverted actions always get the three into trouble). A trio that complains all day and gets drunk like old men from work, brilliant! Some other stand out characters are the triceratops accountant Triken and Ōkuro, the stoic wrestler-mask wearing head of security. Finally, there is the princess herself: Latifah Fleuranza (Queen Latifah), whose curse has more horrifying implications that this anime initially reveals.

Don't expect the involvement of a whole lot of magic in the show as it is used just for the basic construction of the plot, the anime makes it look obvious that the plot was not much of a concern to the writer than the character developments and comedy.It is...a fairly good anime when entertainment is concerned.

This anime can overall be be described as wacky as hell - and it knows it. I mean, it is a story of Kanye West being asked by 50 Cent to get some oversized plushies in order so that they can save Queen Latifah. There is no explanation whatsoever for why each of these characters are named after these people, other than to add to the absurdity of it all. It pushes every single aspect of the story to the very edge of ludicrousy and beyond, and the viewer is left with the choice to either accept all the craziness or step away. I have to say, I was tempted to just back away on more than one occasion.The first two episodes were interesting enough, but then it was pretty much downhill from there. I was bored with more episodes than I enjoyed, and I had to push myself to sit through most of them. The opening scene with Sento pinning Kanie to the wall with her gun and bluntly asking him to go to the amusement park with her was pretty good in that it caught my interest, and the initial scenes with the two of them at the park were pretty good as well, but after that my interest quickly waned. The only episode that I actually fully enjoyed (please note, this is not a spoiler!) was the one where the other park employees had to dress up as Kanie in a ridiculous outfit and pretend to be him, so he wouldn\'t lose his attendence at school, which ensued in some funny moments.The story as a whole is mostly made up of what seems like random situations relating to the park employees, who are all magical creatures in the form of animal mascots, especially a hot-headed mouse more or less identical to the one seen in ""Full Metal Panic!"", a drunken, inappropriate sheep, and a perverted, pink kitten. There is also a bipolar shark, an autistic ferret, a level-headed dinosaur with glasses, a bunch of disfigured moles, a dragon for some reason, and some underwater pirates used as a some sort of halfway-point plot device. However, these characters are just not all the interesting, and their jokes get old very soon, so the parts of the story that focuses on them - which is, unfortunately, the main part - is, despite being completely wacko, rather trite.Kanie and Sento are not that great characters, either, but I would much rather follow them and other human characters than I would the ludicrous mascots. Or, actually, I take that back, as it really is only Sento that I would rather follow. She might actually be the only decent character there is (although, it is kind of like being the best house in a terrible neighbourhood - not that wonderful, when you really think about it).Also, I have no idea why Kanie actually had to be a high school student. It would make much more sense for him to be older, since he effectively takes on a full-time job. Plus, we don\'t really follow his school life at all. But apparently, every anime character out there just has to be a high school student, whether or not it makes any sense for the plot.The best thing about this anime is, in my opinion, the artwork, which is (as expected from Kyoto Animation) superb. The character designs are great, the backgrounds are neat, and the colour sceme is fitting, lively and vibrant. The character designs of the human characters, namely Kanie and Sento, are especially well-done. In addition to being the only decent character, Sento is most certainly also the most appealing one. If you\'re into hot anime girls, she is almost reason enough on her own for you to pick up this anime. The designs of the mascot characters are pretty good as well and probably what made them at least tolerable. The sound is fine, but not great. The opening theme is pretty catchy, but other than that, there was nothing really special about the music or voice acting.Overall, I wasn\'t very impressed with this anime, but I didn\'t hate it, either.

Despite this, it usually makes sense and the ways the plot advance...is by the effort and work of the cast, that almost never acts out of characters, they are pretty consistent. Also, the moments where luck is what resolve the issue, its used as a comedic element, so is hard to be harsh on it since it\'s made on purpose and of personal opinion.The main characters have decent development, you really get to know their personality and a bit of their backstory, but just what is important so this series doesn\'t fill you with dumb and unnecessary data that is not relevant.

I'll make this without spoilers.The story is not really complicated but it makes you keep watching the show, they need to reach 500000 visitors on the park before the 31th july, nothing incredible original but something that is nice.The art feels great, is nice, detailed and looks beautiful. The music is also great no complains on this departement.My favourite part of the show, by a longshot, are the charcters, they all are fantastic, even...the supporting characters are great, they don't feel like airheaded characters, it's just the opposite, they feel alive. Seiya is a capital A asshole, a narcisist and he thinks he poos gold... well that last one I made it up, but you understand me what I mean. Isuzu has become one of my favourites waifus, smart, beautiful and a total bad ass with quite a temper and, with some tsundere momments but not being retarded which is quite nice for a change to be honest.So if you have been so dumb like me and you didn't watch this show on 2014 watch it now, don't be like me, don't be stupid. the supporting characters are great, they don't feel like airheaded characters, it's just the opposite, they feel alive.

A lot of the same jokes hurled over and over, few enough interesting characters to carry a comedy, and not particularly interesting enough scenarios to create a memorable situation comedy.Amagi Brilliant Park, in my opinion, just seems to...fall short. It has a lot of potential. Like the main character, Kanie Seiya, and Isuzu Sento, are potentially good characters. It's just... nothing is done with them.

The hardship the characters went through were too easy to predict the how the outcome will be. Characters depth was basically nonexistent and there's no emotional impact either.

It has all the elements of a great anime, but fails in certain areas that can\'t be redeemed - no matter how hard they try.Amagi Brilliant Park is an anime about a guy named Seiya Kanie, who is tasked with becoming the manager of a park and bringing in 500,000 guests by a certain date. During the course of his stay at the park, he meets various characters and comedy ensues.This comes from Kyoto Animation, and like most of their work, the animation is top notch. Nearly every single scene...seems like a painting. I couldn\'t help but admire the attention to detail, especially in the opening credits.As for the sound, Kyoto Animation once again succeeds with a awesome soundtrack that fits the series well. It\'s fun, poppy, and warming. In particular, the OP is phenomenal and definitely ranks in my top 10 opening credits songs of all time. It feels as if you\'re going on a rollercoaster and at the end is the start of an episode. It gets you in the right mood.The real downfall of the series is the story. It\'s painfully boring and uninteresting. Since Amagi Brilliant Park is only 13 episodes long, everything felt rushed and uninspired. Before watching this anime, I didn\'t really have a clear picture of what it was about. I was hoping it would be a slice of life anime that follows a group of characters who work at an amusement park. But no, Kyoto Animation had to add this dull story, which I\'m sure is part of the source material. Drama is sprinkled throughout the series due to the story. Sadly, it just doesn\'t work. I never felt scared or worried for any of the characters. I knew that, without a shadow of a doubt, things would end up in a positive light for everyone.Speaking of the characters, they are pretty weak. The main character, Seiya, changes overtime as you would think. He starts off weak and becomes a stronger character due to his predicament. Isuzu, who is the girl that brings Seiya to the park in the first place, never changes. The way she is presented when we first see her is how she stays for the rest of the anime. There\'s also a princess character, Latifah, who doesn\'t really do much of anything. She has a bit of a backstory and the plot is kind of connected to her, but I never felt like she was an important character. There are other human characters as well, but none of them have any real depth. The only characters I felt truly connected with were the mythical creatures who worked at the park. They were fun and had a ton of personality. Whenever they came on screen, I knew things were going to be at least a tad bit enjoyable. Also, a ""villain"" is introduced in the series later on. He kind of appears and then vanishes and we never see him again. Not sure why Kyoto Animation even bothered putting him into the show at all. He\'s useless and not threatening at all. Perhaps the villain has a bigger role in the source material.Amagi Brilliant Park isn\'t bad by any means. The humor is well done and goes at a fast pace (for the most part).

In other words, it does next to nothing to bring the main conflict to its end, which in turn, is pretty weak to begin with.What should probably be expected from an anime with a weak plot is great characters,...as that would at least pique an interest. However, characters are probably where the show's at its worst. The two main characters are probably the only ones who felt relatively enjoyable to me, but they fall flat compared to many other show's characters out there, and are in no way interesting enough to carry the show on their shoulders through character development or personality at all.That being said, I did enjoy some of the episodes, mostly because of the vibrant animation and likeable soundtrack and upbeat opening. The mascots often ruined some episodes for me though, which was a shame.All in all, I do think many people would find this anime enjoyable and a good watch, so I would tell you to still give it a try.This anime just wasn't for me, that's all. as that would at least pique an interest.

I feel on a whole this anime has several strong points for those who like very specific slice of life type shows, with a little fantasy thrown in, but there were a few concerning points.Mainly my issue with this anime is the pacing, for an anime that is only thirteen episodes some episodes felt so slow and long I almost began doing other things waiting for things to pick up.  It's a fairly standard plot, fairly normal anime guy gets...put in with a bunch of weirdos and solves their problem, said normal guy also has some dark secret (aka his past), and finally fairly normal guy begrudgingly states that his life is more interesting and fulfilling with this crazy rag tag group.For some reason however, some of the episodes felt so long and drawn out, and you never get a really good explanation as to why the main character was chosen for the job.  He also has a pretty complicated (for a A type main character) backstory that never gets delved into (---spoilers--- fear of heights, something with his mom?).  It feels as though the animators had a pretty funny concept, and instead of making every episode crazy and hilarious, there were these minor attempts to make it more 'deep' then it needed to be.  I thought on a whole it was funny, and the last episode was very suspenseful, but in the end I wish there would have been more filler episodes about the characters rather than non-plot episodes with just the main character.  I'm still on the fence about how it should be changed, but as it stands I don't see it getting a second season or drawing a huge range of fans. put in with a bunch of weirdos and solves their problem, said normal guy also has some dark secret (aka his past), and finally fairly normal guy begrudgingly states that his life is more interesting and fulfilling with this crazy rag tag group.For some reason however, some of the episodes felt so long and drawn out, and you never get a really good explanation as to why the main character was chosen for the job.

Spoiler alert!StoryThe show focuses on the efforts of Seiya Kanie and Isuzu Sento to keep the titular park running. The park is maintained by the inhabitants of a magical kingdom, who live off the happiness generated by the park's visitors, making the park's...continued existence vital for the workers. Despite the ridiculousness of the premise, the show manages to develop with surprising pathos and fun. While the show's bread-and-butter is comedy (and it's really good at it), Amagi Brilliant Park can be serious and dramatic when it needs to be. (8/10)CharactersThe show delivers a quirky and fun cast of characters for viewers to get emotionally invested it. First off, we have our protagonist Seiya, an arrogant and narcissistic jerk who can do the right thing with enough prompting. Through circumstances beyond his control (more like a magical gun aimed at his face), he becomes acting manager of the titular park and has to keep it up and running. His secretary Isuzu is stoic and serious, and yet the show manages to find ways to put her in comedic scenarios, and somehow it works! The highest authority of the park is Princess Latifa, who constantly advises Seiya and Isuzu on how to manage the park.The supporting characters are also a lot fun, such as the troublemaking mascots, the fun-loving Elementario fairies and the maintenance crew. Despite the problems they give Seiya (or perhaps because of them), they are fundamental part of what makes the show so fun and Seiya realizes how vital they are to the park's continued survival. (9/10)ArtThe show's visual style is absolutely beautiful. Everything from the character designs, the movements, the backgrounds and the lighting looks gorgeous and it's clear that a huge part of the budget went into the animation. By its presentation alone, Amagi Brilliant Park is already a good show. (7/10)SoundThe opening song is very fun, but my favorite part of the show has to be the vocal performances by both Adam Gibbs (Seiya) and Molly Searcy (Isuzu).

Also this is more of a rant about the plot than a review so there\'s that.Spoilers below:So the entire plot revolves around the princess being cursed by the ""evil"" wizard to reverse her age until she disappears. But if you give it just an extra second of thought, the wizard saved the kingdom from a rampaging dragon that will wipe out millions and doom it for good, and all he asked for return is the princess. The king agreed to this, then later regretted...it and banished the wizard from the kingdom, basically played him like a fiddle. Then the wizard got mad and cursed the princess, and nobody else. So after all, it\'s the king that\'s a PoS who is too weak to defeat the dragon and save his own kingdom, who agreed to give his daughter away but then regrets it, which ultimately doomed her from the curse. The king had a choice, give his daughter away so the entire kingdom can be saved, or burn with his daughter alongside the entire kingdom by the dragon.

Amagi Brilliant Park is another one of Kyoani’s self-aware-almost-to-a-fault anime that laughs in the face of the fourth wall, and its absolutely shameless pop culture references such as the OP above are reminiscent of the studio’s earlier self-aware works such as K-On! and particularly Lucky Star. It also happens to be the studio’s second adaptation of a Shoji Gatoh work, the...first being Full Metal Panic.With that line already established at the beginning of the review, it’s only sensible to talk first about the show’s music. Like many other Kyoani works, the opening is fantastic and absolutely iconic: this is one of the few shows I’ve seen where skipping the OP is never an option. The ED is quite a bit more forgettable, but still above average, while the rest of the show’s soundtrack does not particularly standout but is never intrusively bad either.Next let’s take a look at the art. To say that Kyoani has come a long way since their earlier Gatoh adaptations would be an understatement. Amagi suffers from none of the occasional animation quality lapses that afflicted Full Metal Panic, and it’s very clear to me that Takemoto really developed his more modern “color and light galore” style in Amagi that his work trended to toward the end of his life. Amagi has a few really brilliant frames, and in general the anime breezes through the art quality checklists. Even some of the frequent action scenes – such as Kanie and Moffle’s fistfights – lend themselves well to the comedic side of the show without being too jarring.Disappointingly, the characters are more of a mixed bag and probably one of the show’s weakest points. Interestingly, I find both of the MCs to be quite strong: Kanie in particular avoids several of the industry’s most banal tropes by being neither a character your identify with nor a character you aspire to be. He is a narcissist, self-absorbed individual who unfortunately possess the smarts and aptitude to back up his egotistical person. Unlike so many other run-of-the-mill male protagonists, Kanie is unique in his unlikability, and that’s why I like him so much as a character. Next comes the other MC, Sento, who fortunately possesses the same sort of unlikeable uniqueness that behooves Kanie’s character. She is aggressive and unpersonable, and like her male counterpart comes off as self-seeking, going so far as to threaten Kanie at gunpoint and instill him with magical powers in a last-ditch effort to save her park. Yes, before you object, I know that both characters exhibit stereotypical tsundere qualities, and I’m not denying it, but I’m impressed with how nicely the pairing of two characters who literally only care about their own interests works in this show, particularly in the earlier episodes. And even though it is a comedy, the legitimate growth that both of the MCs experience throughout the course of the show when learning to respect and leverage each other’s unique strengths make it seem almost like the premise for a successful and uplifting drama. Almost, were it not for……the remainder of the cast. As much as I appreciate the uniqueness of the two main characters, I find the rest of the show’s figures lackluster. Princess Latifa is technically the third MC but possesses none of the unique qualities that set Kanie and Sento apart. She’s a typical “afflicted by some vague curse that grants her eternal youth” type of character, and unfortunately little more beyond that. Part of me wants to think that she only exists to create a weak love triangle, but the sheer absence of her character from any important parts of the already-almost-nonexistent plot make this a shaky assumption. I almost suspect her character exists entirely to give the series the typical “curse is broken yay” and further push the writer’s already-impressive self-criticism of the very genre they adapt in their fairy tale story, but as a character Latifa has relatively little to offer to the show.The rest of the characters are perhaps worse. First of all – there takes a lot of people to run a theme park, and there’s a lot of them, ranging from the actual humans to the Maple Landers. And in somewhat uncharacteristic-of-Kyoani fashion, they are almost without exception flat, showing little in terms of character development. Again, perhaps this is a tribute back to the oh-so-true Lucky Star motif of the side characters fading into the background, but that purpose isn’t as obvious here. The rest of the cast is either only funny or only a bunch of perverts, without a whole lot of room in-between. And to expound some more on the second category would require its own section: the fanservice.If you’ve seen my other reviews it’s pretty much clear that I’m not a fan of sexualization in anime for the sake of pleasing the audience. Now Kyoani has used it for more noble purposes in the past, such as to drive character development (see: Haruhi), or is mock the motif in anime as a media (see: Lucky Star), but such doesn’t seem to be the case in Amagi. Devoting not one but two (with several more sporadically) of the more prominent side characters to the sole purpose of making crude jokes and statements gets stale quickly. Amagi suffers from the same curse that afflicted the studio’s first adaptation of a Gatoh work in Fumoffu, with both Bonta-kun works showing so much comedic promise without the need to constantly sexualize its characters. It’s honestly kind of gross, and drops my rating (and watch-time…) of this show by a considerable amount.Amagi Brilliant Park is first and foremost a comedy, and thankfully one that none of the show’s writers attempt to disguise as another mediocre drama or romance. And, when the show isn’t suffering from its typical “how do we pervert this” tendencies, it’s really funny. Perhaps a better way of phrasing it would be to say that Amagi is a fun anime to watch. Will you gain anything redemptive from its mainly-episodic storylines? A little – there’s a few episodes where the character development-thirsty side of the writers can’t help but show, and those are wonderful. But will you laugh? You better. And will you clap on-time during every OP? You don’t have a choice. first being Full Metal Panic.With that line already established at the beginning of the review, it’s only sensible to talk first about the show’s music.

Instead, you get a narcissist and self obsessed male main character (whose name sounds like Kanye; how very fitting), ultra cringe pervy male side characters, sexist/cheesy dialogues, forced vulgar jokes, typical sexually objectified and intellectually challenged female characters, nonsensical/boring/bland plot and storytelling.

Fairy Tail OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9982/Fairy_Tail_OVA,"['Get ready to have some fun with some of our favorite friends from one of the most prominent guilds in all of Earth Land. From the same series that has been running for over two years, Fairy Tail\'s author Hiro Mashima here brings fourth not 1, not two, not even 3, not 4, but 5 OVAs.Fairy Tail: Youkoso Fairy Hills! is a series of special episodes 26th, 27th and 31st volumes of the manga. If you\'re a faithful fan of FT, then you\'re in the right place. The four episodes incorporated does not much have story by themselves but they do have one thing: entertainment....Hell, most people who\'ve seen the original series would know that Fairy Tail is one of few series in the anime industry that has watchable fillers. And of course, these OVA episodes are watchable as well.That\'s right, Fairy Tail isn\'t always about battles but sometimes is about fun, fun..and fun.These five OVAs are standalone episodes that are nonlinear. In other words, there is no direct story or expansion from one episode to the next from this bundle. Don\'t face palm yourself yet though because they all are all amusing to watch in a variety of reasons. In fact, comedy is one of Fairy Tail\'s greatest aspects and it shines through in these episodes. (only in terms of comedy though...not else worth more adding)The OVA themselves contains characters from the original series consisting of Team Natsu -The outgoing LucyThe over hyperactive NatsuThe naked GrayThe tough and boss Erza ""Titania"" ScarletAll of them get their moments in these episodes ranging from being a bunny girl, wearing a cat/neko costume, the school uniforms, being a kid all over again, and beach fan-service. Speaking of which, the fan-service does shoot off the charts occasionally in these episodes. Unlike ecchi series though, they are for comedic purposes. Like I said before, Fairy Tail brings out laughter, fun, and entertainment rather than the typical ""accidental shower walk-ins"".The Fairy Tail atmosphere is still there though with some action scenes and the OST. Hiro Mashima likes to play with some of his typical battle shounen scenes often from the original series. In these short episodes, he brings out his skills of creating humor and that he did quite so-so from my perspective. It\'s a welcoming aspect from the original series that has high levels of energy to induce entertainment rather than the more serious fighting scenes anime fans watches in so many long running shounen today. It\'s not something serious to take into light.The artwork of the series remains generally the same. Beyond the fan-service, the characters are drawn like from the original series with similar edges, proportions (including those boobs), and backgrounds. It\'s sort of like the typical shounen artwork you see in many of today\'s anime series. Fairy Tail doesn\'t have the best art but it gets the point across.The soundtrack of the OVAs remains generally the same although two different OP and ED songs are used. Aya Hirano and Tetsuya Kakihara does their roles and gives their songs a magical rhythm . It\'s not too exciting but it gets to the point that reflects on the FT atmosphere.All in all, these Fairy Tail OVAs are a fun watch. Don\'t take it serious. Just don\'t. If you do, you won\'t enjoy this as much as some other fans. The original main characters return in this so it makes it worthwhile to watch them all have their fun, awkward, and entertaining moments.If you\'re having a bad day, watch this to brighten it up.If you\'re bored with your life, watch this to make your life more fun.If you\'re tired of waiting for the latest FT episode from the original series, watch this to pass some time.If you\'re frustrated about today\'s other onsen/""beach"" OVAs in other anime series, watch this to laugh at themIf you want to just enjoy some typical Fairy Tail entertainment, watch this to appreciate.Ultimately though, these OVA episodes connected together are just of something amusing to watch but don\'t expect much out of it, even if the above are how you felt before watching.

It was just a little surprising to see it from something that's easy to just view as a kid's show.A couple episodes seem like they could canon material and have some interesting lore about the world or some of the characters, but the high school slice of life parody is...obviously not one of them. It just plays on a lot of Fairy Tail story beats while shifting the genre.

It's stupid sometimes, funny sometimes, but overall it's just nice to see the characters again. "", 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood sets itself apart from the acclaimed ""original"" Fullmetal Alchemist series back in 2003 by staying loyal to the manga. An important part of the manga was the 4-Panel Comic section  at the end of every volume. These humorous comics were comedic parodies of significant events that transpired in the current volume.Their ability to take a serious event that elicited major emotions from the readers and turn them into something funny and laughable was something that the 16 episode, 2 minute ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - 4-Koma Theater"" OVA series brought back with the DVD/BD releases of the show.If you can recall...the type of animation that Brotherhood had during comedic parts of the show, apply that style and ONLY that style to the 4-Koma Theaters and you have a grasp of what animation style the OVAs have to offer.Whether you watched Brotherhood in Dub or Sub, The 4-Koma Theaters are available in both. This means that all the original voice actors return for these 16 short clips. There are no Opening and Ending themes for these clips, not counting a simple ""duh-duh-duh-DAAAH"" in the beginning of every clip and a short jingle at the end of every clip that plays as the credits roll by.Every main character, from the Elric Brothers to the mannequin soldiers, make at least one appearance in the OVA series. For long term fans of the show, it is nice to see some beloved characters make a light-hearted and fun return in this manner.Overall, The Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood - 4-Koma Theater OVAs deserve a chance to make you laugh and remind you how special Brotherhood was. As with all comedic series, not all the clips will make you laugh, but there are plenty side-splitting gags throughout this OVA series (I\'m looking at you Scar and Bradley in episode 15 :P) to keep you coming back for more.

A must watch for anyone."", 'It\'s unfortunate that so many brilliant animated shorts in Japan are largely obscure to western audiences. It\'s also unexpected that a Japanese comedian, going by the pseudonym ""Tekken"", was able to capture the hearts of millions with two short, dialogue-less, and crudely drawn animations. The following covers the first of the two, entitled ""Furiko"" (otherwise known as Pendulum).You don\'t need words to tell a beautiful story. It\'s such a rare thing to see in recent anime, but Takefumi Kurashina takes the medium and strips it to its rawest form - basic animation, simple music, and an uncomplicated plot. Telling the story of a man\'s journey...through life and love, the narrative is done beautifully and flows effortlessly, and is an entirely silent affair. That being said, Furiko plays on its simplicity with great success, with the emotions of its characters pulling through in every fleeting scene. The narrative is pushed along with the frame being captured in a swinging pendulum, only stopping when the man pauses to realize the beauty in his life. Like a swinging pendulum, life moves on, and these realizations are far and in between life\'s tragically brief existence.The music accompanying the man\'s story is perfect. It\'s a vague statement, but one that isn\'t really given out lightly. The lyric-less song begins with four piano chords, which repeat themselves throughout the entirety of the story. With the repetition of these chords matching up with the incessant swinging of the ""pendulum"", violin melodies are added as the story progresses, similar to Pachelbel\'s Canon in D. Like the story, the melody\'s buildup has a beginning, a climax, and an end, bringing everything back to the same four chords used at the beginning of the piece. Ashes to ashes, so to speak. It very much reflects the whole aspect of life as a journey, marked at the beginning and end with life and death.I\'m not a big fan of the word ""tearjerker"", but in Furiko\'s case, tearjerker is most definitely an understatement. In three, short minutes, Furiko accomplishes to do what dozens of long-running episodes might not - emotionally captivate you with simplicity, subtlety, and an endearing story. through life and love, the narrative is done beautifully and flows effortlessly, and is an entirely silent affair.

As a result, the family passes behind, no time for us and without he realizes, he finds himself in retirement.When he realizes all this, it's too late ...

I was worried this would be like another short film called House of Small Cubes in that it aims for the heart strings but by featuring such a generic life it doesn’t gain the impact from pulling off such worn sentiments in art. To my surprise, Pendulum is far more personal and doesn’t try to represent every man’s life so much as a specific one, and thus its emotional impact is more...defined and we know the actual significance of the imagery as it actually feels like the narration of a man’s subconscious hang-ups.

It has everything a sob story needs to work. A sweet relationship, melodrama, family issues. It's got the entire formula. Despite this unoriginality, it still presents itself successfully, in that, its cheerful to sorrowful fall is still worth the while to watch....The audiovisuals are interesting, with watching this, there is a noticeable theme presented with the pendulum in itself. The pendulum acts as a camera for most of the duration of the story with the pendulum bob being the screen that physically shows the story. This was quite a nice idea on Tekken's behalf for a story about time, it truly does show that time always keeps moving, even when are at the highest in life, to the most dreadful. The actual visuals were made up from what looked like a whiteboard marker, with grey shades underneath. Quite a basic set to create from, but with a simple story, comes a simple structure. The sound, if I am not wrong, was piano chords with what sounded like a string instrument to pair with it. Consequently producing a sound that was fitting for growing with time.For enjoyment, due to its manipulate nature, I couldn't see why I would give this anything 7 or over, though, its clever presentation made for it to be a better watch.If you have 4 and a half minutes to spare, I would recommend this, although, it isn't anything special since stories like these are rather common even for when it was released back in 2012.

Similar to Up, Furiko takes us on a quick and enjoyable albeit clichéd journey of two people falling in love. The story of Furiko could probably fit into a dozen animes/ mangas, which may result in some disliking it because it brings nothing new to the table, but I still found it enjoyable. Probably because I'm a sucker for stories such as this.  Anyway, the story proceeds as such: bad boy saves model student from other bad boys and she falls in love with him. He...gets annoyed at first but eventually gives in and changes himself for her. They grow up, encounter their share of monetary issues, they power through but in the end she gets a terminal illness. I knew it was coming, but it still made me feel sad nonetheless, especially when he tried to slow down time.Short films in recent years have had an emphasis on animation, so it is a nice change when it comes to Furiko's hand drawn animations, with further emphasis placed onto the animation and story. The animation and drawings incite a sense of nostalgia, because it is very similar to old school animations with the character design and movements. The story and animation move at a nice pace, allowing the viewers glimpses and suggesting how their story proceeded while not bogging them down with the details. Considering that it was created by a comedian who named himself after his favourite fighting game, it is an impressive result.The music is a big reason behind why I rate Furiko highly. The melancholic music fits Furiko very well even though the same BGM is used throughout the entire short film that shows the life of two people. The music in the beginning scenes with the high school invokes a sense of nostalgia, and compounds the sadness of their problems and the eventual loss of the girl.Overall,  Furiko is what every short film should aspire to be. In a time where everyone is trying to make their stories more complicated and issues contrived, Furiko chooses to use an already over-used story and simply made it interesting through the animation and music.

Most of us already know that but forget it again and again, and sometimes needs to be reminded of it.The second thing was, to remember that one day we all will die, that is why no matter what happens we should be careful to not regret our actions, each day we spend is a day lost, a day that we can't take back. Before we sleep we need to ask ourselves, did I do anything today that I regret? Was there anything that I would had wished to do differently? And if you find anything at all that you wished you could do differently, then you must again remind yourself, you don't have an eternity to fix it, so you must fix it now, while you still can.

Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka III,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40454/Dungeon_ni_Deai_wo_Motomeru_no_wa_Machigatteiru_Darou_ka_III,"['Did you know that the real translation of “Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka” into English is “Is It Wrong to Seek Encounters in a Dungeon?” - “encounter” being the random encounter mechanic from the classic JRPGs like Final Fantasy. If you “seek” random encounters, you probably are deliberately grinding XP to get ahead, but you’re also risking to overexert yourself or run into something you can’t deal with. I.e. that is a meaningful question without one right answer, the risk versus reward deal. And then there is a double entendre on top of that, “encounter” can be a “rendezvous” with...a girl - be it a Sword Princess or a blue dragon loli. This is just one example of this series having more substance than meets the eye, as Danmachi, for all of its mainstream popularity, still happens to be a pleb filter anime that your average wannabe connoisseur of arts is too low-IQ to like (while simultaneously believing in the opposite).Season One was a straightforward generic isekai, being distinguished only by the high quality of execution. Since I can hear autistic screeching all the way from here, do note that “isekai” as an anime genre name means action-adventure fantasy with JRPG mechanics, or even more precisely, the “SAO clone” (the same way “first-person shooter” is the “Doom clone” genre). Any arguments to the contrary, particularly the ones based on the semantics of the words “another world” (which is NOT how “isekai” translates from Japanese) are an exercise in mental deficiency.Anyway, the “depth” (quotes to emphasize the fact that many people that like using this word as a praise of anime shows they like wouldn’t recognize depth if it bit their ass and held on) of Season One of Danmachi comes from the fact that it took the building blocks of SAO and treated them as speculative fiction. The MC is overpowered and wins every fight. The MC has a harem. JRPG mechanics are a thing. That’s our baseline. Instead of using these elements mindlessly, or attempting to reject/subvert them, the story tasked itself with building a world where they make logical sense. E.g. the MC is swarmed by women because he is physically attractive, has a pleasant personality, and is a famous prodigy (“bElL iS gEnErIc sELf-iNseRt” - a low-intelligence wannabe critic). Add on top of that Greek Mythology, core ideas of which (the inevitability of fate; a hero’s place in the world; gods walking among men; etc) the author has managed to capture on a level that flies over the head of 99% of the audience - and you get the objectively best non-comedic isekai there is.Meanwhile, Season Two tries to mix things up, managing to check a lot of boxes on a midwit’s list of things that make an anime series bad in the process. A dip in production values (especially the action sequences). Huge chunks of the source material content that didn’t make it into the adaptation. A story that actually tried to expand its horizons beyond the standard isekai template and do something original and thought-provoking (Ishtar’s “what’s wrong with being a whore” monologue in its 20 seconds has more “depth” than an entire 3x3 of an average pseud) instead of staying in its comfort zone and spinning the wheels - and as every midwit knows, “a show that confuses me by doing something I don’t understand is stupid and bad.”In short, Season Two was better than Season One in concept but worse in execution (even if the pleb opinion would make you believe it’s the worst thing since cancer).All this long introduction was necessary so that I could keep my actual Season Three review short - Season Three is peak Danmachi experience as it combines all the strongest aspects of the first two seasons.More amazing action sequences on the level of Bell vs Minotaur fight - it’s not just that action sequences look good, it’s that they’re episode-spanning and tell a story instead of interrupting (or being interrupted by) a story.More speculative fiction goodness (a comically evil mustache-twirling antagonist is driven to be comically evil by his hereditary magic schizophrenia).More godly shenanigans continuing from Season Two - Yato’s Evil Twin (aka Ikelos) is my favorite new character by far, because he’s here to spell out loud what other gods like Hermes, Loki, or Freya are trying to hide under their facades and platitudes - that the gods are there to play The Sims irl, nothing more, nothing less.More exploration and expansion of the story’s core themes - Wiene’s arc, which spans the entire season, is like Haruhime’s arc on steroids. What does it mean to be a hero? Sure, you want to protect the weak, but who exactly fits the definition of “the weak” here? How are you going to do “the right thing” if you can’t even tell what it is? How about when your close friends consider the right thing to be the opposite of what you think is right and go against you? These aren’t the questions you answer with just doing your best and trying really hard - Punished Bell has to do some serious soul searching.The direction is as good as in Season One. I’ve seen too much anime for my own good during my lifetime. Too often I find myself watching a show that I can recognize as objectively well-made - but still struggling to finish an episode in one sitting because I kinda know what it is doing at every moment. DanMachi III is in the minority of shows that kept me engaged from start to finish and actually looking forward to new episodes - because new and interesting stuff just keeps happening.

But like many shows of its genre, it fails to understand how to keep itself fun. So what does the show do now? Mindless exposition dumps that take up half the episode followed by pointless gratuitous violence of characters I don’t care about followed by even more exposition. It attempts to build up tension and tries to make you care about all these monsters but all of it feels fake and forced.I...fail to see the appeal of the show anymore. None of the characters are all that interesting aside from maybe Ais and even she doesn’t have the screentime to make it worthwhile. The pacing is way too slow and there’s way too much talking. I could feel my brain slowly melting away getting five episodes deep. It’s no longer bearable.If you had any doubts with the series before, stop right here.

No, it is rather about a nice, naïve and pure boy named Bell Cranel who was more or less helpless in the start and slowly and steadily grew both in strength and mentally. Well ,if you are reading this review, you have probably watched the first 2 seasons and know all this, so let's get into this season.(spoilers)The story starts right off the bat in...this season with a wyvern(a type of monster) named Wiene who possesses intelligence which was thought impossible until then. Instead of killing it, bell takes it home since he is a nice and pure little boy. This is where the problem starts: monsters have killed many humans and vice versa which has created a strong hate between and humans and monsters and no one is ready to accept a monster in society which is shown in ep 2. So, how will Bell and the Hestia family protect and help Wiene be accepted by society.This season seems to be continuation of last seasons 'who to save and help', but taking it one level up. Last season where it was a prostitute who were shown despised by heroes, but weren't exactly criminals. But, now it is monsters who have shed the blood of thousands of people, are they really worth saving? I have watched 4 episodes and I can say that this season is distinctly different from the other 2 in the way that, this season has a much more serious and heavy undertone. The show still has its gags but the impending fear and responsibility is shown.their isn't much to say about the art. It's the same as always and I must say that I like the art style of Danmachi in it's bright and beautiful world.The OST is nice and it sticks to you as you listen to it more, not so sure about the ED(didn't really listen to it)OVERALLi am really excited on how this arc will develop and how they will overcome this problem and so far I am really enjoying it. this season with a wyvern(a type of monster) named Wiene who possesses intelligence which was thought impossible until then.

However that is then, this is now. Danmachi is a bad show, it uses dumb plot devices, random harem events, and bad character writing to make a show that kids enjoy.Now what does a kid enjoy? As Scamboli said it: Kids love stories that they could plug themselves into, ""if I was Bell I\'d save that girl and MARRY HER"" or so the thought would go. Or ""I have to save everybody these kids are counting on me"" type deal....Well as I\'ve grown I\'ve realized how awful this plot device can be, don\'t worry about your actual writing skill just think about the kids and maybe they\'ll eat it up. Going back even more, when I loved Danmachi I use to hate the comparisent of Danmachi and Sao. ""ONE IS GOOD"" I said, ""Don\'t compare garbage too good"" I continued. No, these shows are near identical in some unbelievable ways, even more so in how they make me feel. They both got the protaginist who gets random powerups when he needs to save a girl. The plot has no depth whatsoever in any sense. Everything about the writing is bad. There always has to be a villain for the sake of there being a villain. It\'s so similar that I wouldn\'t even be suprised if they were written by the same person.Danmachi s3 focuses on the Monster vs Human debate, they explore the deep in-world discussion between the relationship between the two sides. The humans enter the dungeon, the monsters fight back, etc etc. This could be a good idea if the author could give me a goddamn reason to care. This whole season we are thrust upon a scene in which we have no reason to care about. Bell is our plug in character, he cares because he wants EVERYBODY to be happy. Alright at least he has a reason to care but what about ours? We don\'t have one... The only reason we are suppose to care about this shitty show is that there\'s a cute loli who smiles and acts like a stereotypical loli. I cannot remember anything about her and I finished the goddamn show 10 minutes ago. Going back to that kid mentality, a kid would eat this shit up. ""I would save that little girl everybody must be happy"" or some garbage like that. I\'m not a kid, you\'re not a kid considering you ain\'t mad about this review so what\'s the deal?The characters of this show were honestly pathetic, the charm that everybody once had is gone, everybody is just annoying now (More on that later). But you wanna know what makes it even worse? The stupid jokes we are suppose to laugh at. Guess what, I ain\'t gonna lie, sometimes I did laugh, the jokes were funny every once in awhile. But if I laugh at 5 of the 100+ jokes then something is wrong. I\'d describe Danmachi as that little kid who keeps following you around, he says stupid jokes trying to make you laugh but none of them do, but once in a lifetime you actually laugh and maybe you think ""this kid ain\'t so bad"" but then he tells more shit jokes. You don\'t know how much times I\'d pause during episodes because I hated everything so much.The harem shit is actually getting annoying, there are too many girls, too many to care about. What makes it worse is that there are TOO MANY OF THEM that they all have to share screentime. Thinking about this made me die from laughter after realizing how stupid the thought of it actually was. Also what doesn\'t help is that none of them have a personality trait worth mentioning aside from your standard run of the mill stuff.Everybody in this show had their arcs completely destroyed and forgotten about in replacement for the stupid monster arc that nobody cared about. The people of the red light district had no stake in the show whatsoever and the only time they were shown was to alleviate the pain of the people who liked them. But it\'s done worse in the Hermes and Sword Princess characters, Hermes was once this mysterious figure who felt as if he could control the world, nope he\'s just another loser as well who is nothing compared to Bells beautiful light. The sword princess officially only has two traits, kill monster and kuudere.Ok I have so much to say but I would spoil the whole show and at that point what\'s the purpose of the review. Danmachi is appalling, there\'s nothing good about it, it perfectly represents peoples distaste modern anime and its focus on target audiences. I do not recommend for the life of me that you watch this show unless you\'re trying to get your mean score down.

It appears overall that JC Staff managed to actually schedule production properly this time around and did not overwhelm their workers, the season is passable in production values and overall has a more interesting story than season 1 or 2. This review will expand on these improvements and give an overall score to the performance of season 3.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSStory: 7There appears to finally be some real plot in this series, previous seasons were primarily focused on Bell overcoming strong monsters or getting kidnapped and saving a person...in the process of his escape. This season on the other hand is heavily focused on sentient monsters and the divide between humanity and the creatures of the dungeon. With the introduction of intelligent human like monsters, Bell has to focus a lot more on questioning whether or not he should try to save people even if it might destroy his guild in the process due to how it will hurt their image. He also has to question if it’s worth helping monsters achieve their goals of living on the surface, even if they might still be dangerous to people and not all of them are human friendly.The addition of a moral conflict and having the Hestia Familia become a part of something bigger finally shifts the story into gear and adds significantly to the world building. Monsters and their nature, the cycle of life with monsters, and the overall addition of how gods, humans, and spirits live, helped add new interesting information to the world Danmachi takes place in. This also opens the story up to more potential plot points, such as actually conquering the dungeon, figuring out the purpose of the dungeon, and having Bell really live up to be a legendary hero over just being a dungeon farmer whose day job it is to clear floors for money and items. Bell truly has to make sacrifices this season, his actions are not just to benefit Hestia or to improve himself, they are to end a major conflict and protect people who are being hunted down, he is actually harming his Familia, his reputation, and himself by doing this but he is choosing to do what is right. This overall sets this season apart in story compared to the first and second seasons and it is why the story can finally be considered decent.Art: 7Production values in the previous season were quite horrible, so people may be apprehensive of watching this season, however this season is actually pretty decent looking and there aren’t any significant animation flaws or bad fight choreography. The use of still frames and powerpoint animation has also declined significantly, the backgrounds are still average, the character designs for the new characters are cute as expected. Overall, the art gets a solid 7, it is still pretty average, nothing outstanding except maybe one fight, but there are no obvious quality issues.The sound: 5I enjoyed the OP although I can’t say I enjoyed the rest of the sound track as much as prior seasons, the show does reuse the old soundtrack often however when it is used it usually fits the scene well so a pass can be given for the constant reuse. Combat sound effects were average and the metal clanging or magic effect sounds weren’t very different from previous seasons and not very different or exceptionally good compared to any other seasonal series.Characters: 7The main cast are the same as always, skeptical Lily, the backup male Welf, the busty Hestia, chill Mikoto, along with the additions of Haruhime from the prior season and a monster girl from this season. If you enjoyed the cast before then there is no reason why you would not enjoy the current cast, they are pretty much the same, none of them do anything really out of character, they tell the same jokes and act in the same way.One major difference however is Bell’s growth, he used to care about impressing Hestia or Ais but over this season he stopped aiming to just get stronger or get into fights with Familias that were causing problems, this season he risked everything to do the right thing in the bigger picture. Bell risked his standing, his Familia, his friends, and his life all to save another species at no real benefit to himself, this is a significant change in his character in a good way, he finally became a true hero. This change in Bell is a welcome improvement over the previous seasons, he is on a journey to become a hero, it was about time he actually went and started changing the world.Enjoyment: 7I enjoyed this season way more than the prior season and as much as the first season, overall the production values have recovered, the story has had its pacing improve, Bell finally grew as a character, and a real conflict is present in the story. It took a while but the series finally appears to be going somewhere besides clearing floors or improving the ranking of the Familia, there is an overall larger problem going on and Bell is taking steps on fixing it.Overall: 7This season is a solid 7, it doesn’t have production values as good as the first season but it’s a significant improvement over season 2, the story has also improved greatly since the prior 2 seasons and its still pretty fun to watch. If you enjoyed season 1 of Danmachi then you will likely enjoy season 3, it is nowhere near as bad as season 2 and don’t let that one bad season stop you from watching a decent one. in the process of his escape. This season on the other hand is heavily focused on sentient monsters and the divide between humanity and the creatures of the dungeon. With the introduction of intelligent human like monsters, Bell has to focus a lot more on questioning whether or not he should try to save people even if it might destroy his guild in the process due to how it will hurt their image. He also has to question if it’s worth helping monsters achieve their goals of living on the surface, even if they might still be dangerous to people and not all of them are human friendly.The addition of a moral conflict and having the Hestia Familia become a part of something bigger finally shifts the story into gear and adds significantly to the world building. Monsters and their nature, the cycle of life with monsters, and the overall addition of how gods, humans, and spirits live, helped add new interesting information to the world Danmachi takes place in.

This is the third season and he hasn't progressed one iota from where he started out. He still gets his whiny little ass handed to him in every-single-fight he has with anyone.That's fine enough when you begin a story. A hero has to start somewhere, and a hero who starts out overpowered is not a believable protagonist, but a Mary Sue or Gary Sue. Someone who hasn't earned her/his powers.We're on the third season, however, and...there's no excuse for Bell Cranel being pathetically underpowered while all his opponents are grotesquely overpowered (Ais, the entire Loki Familia, Dix etc).At this point, it's just an insult to the intelligence of the audience. If you can't write good drama without resorting to simplistic David vs Goliath tropes like this, you probably shouldn't be writing at all.It has become insufferable to watch this show now. We as the audience are supposed to root for our hero because he constantly maintains the moral high ground and soldiers through, even when everyone is against him and he has his ass handed to him 10 times per episode. But if episode after episode is about him being pummeled by every person he fights, followed by weeping and/or self-pity, it's really hard to avoid finding him loathsome in the long run.That's not a good place to lead your audience.The first season was pretty funny and fresh. The second season less funny and this third one isn't funny at all. There's no humor in it. It's all about Bell Cranel being a righteous, but insufferable fool who couldn't beat a squirrel with both paws tied behind its back. It seems like he's becoming weaker and weaker because the story needs him to be a martyr hero. And there's nothing more dull than martyrs.Add to that the relegation of all the other characters to the background as mere side notes to Bell's latest harem adventure, and you're stuck with a pretty thin broth here. The entire 12 episodes could conceivably be boiled down to 2 or 3 episodes with better writing.I have gotten tired of this show. Unless something happens to progress Bell Cranel's character beyond the weak sauce soy boy scout he currently is, and give him some actual edge, I'll quit wasting my time on it. It's just not worth the anguish.Cry baby teenage martyr heroes are a dime a dozen in fantasy anime. It would be nice to see something different for a change. there's no excuse for Bell Cranel being pathetically underpowered while all his opponents are grotesquely overpowered (Ais, the entire Loki Familia, Dix etc).At this point, it's just an insult to the intelligence of the audience.

Basically all of my friends dropped the show during the second season (which I don\'t really blame them for) and so I turn to the review section for some much needed catharsis.First of all, I\'d like to start by addressing the art and animation. In my opinion, it felt REALLY lackluster this season. Everything looks so... flat and lifeless, and there\'s this stiffness to the animation that makes it really difficult for me to immerse myself in the story. It just feels like...this entire season was made on a miniscule budget, by people who had no passion left for the IP what so ever.The art is not the main problem I have with DanMachi Season 3, however. That would be the story. In my opinion, it just... really wasn\'t that good, or interesting. I didn\'t care about the ""people"" I was obviously supposed to care about, nor do I feel particularly intrigued by Bell\'s never-ending quest to help everyone he encounters. And when you really think about it, NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THIS SEASON.Spoiler warning for those of you who have yet to finish the season!Alright, so, I can\'t be the only one who thought the story was mad weak this time around. Bell encounters the Xenos, wants to help the Xenos, Xenos goes to the surface, stuff happens and they end up right back where they started again: IN THE DUNGEON. Like, wtf? Nothing of substance actually happened? Hello?The people of the surface did not come to accept the Xenos. The Xenos didn\'t establish a secret base on the surface where they could fulfill their dreams of living under an open sky. Nobody even really knows the truth about the Xenos except Bell and a select few others.They go to the surface, just to go straight back down into the Dungeon again. Everything ventured, but absolutely nothing gained. The only difference it made was that Ais Wallenstein and like one side character in the Loki Familia found out about their existence and came to somewhat accept them. That\'s it. Nothing more.Alright spoiler over.The weak story combined with the mediocre-at-best visuals and uninteresting characters just made this a really bad season for me. I don\'t know if we\'re getting a Season 4, but I have to say, I\'m kinda hoping we don\'t. I feel entirely done with DanMachi at this point, and I doubt I\'ll bother to watch any more of it unless the production quality suddenly skyrockets or the story starts drastically picking up. this entire season was made on a miniscule budget, by people who had no passion left for the IP what so ever.The art is not the main problem I have with DanMachi Season 3, however.

When S3 was announced, I had pretty low expectations and was prepared to feel the same way as I did in the summer of 2019 after S2. I have never been more happy to be wrong.JC Staff absolutely blew me away this season with consistent pacing, great animation and solid direction. This was one of the most pivotal arcs for Bell’s development in the series and it deserved nothing short of a great adaptation. While it wasn’t perfect, it was more than...good enough for me. If you are a fan of Danmachi, either LN or anime, and had an issue with the second season I think you will notice a plethora of improvements this time around and really enjoy it. This season had my two favourite episodes of the entire series and I can honestly say they had movie quality to them.Animation and art wise, I was blown away by a couple important fight scenes in the final few episodes and found JC’s direction methods to be very good for the occasion. I found the OST to be great for a couple of really emotional moments in the second half of the season.Pacing, which was a huge issue last season feels much better in season 3. While there are some omitted scenes, that’s to be expected with a LN adaptation and it doesn’t take too much away from the story. Everything still feels quite complete and there’s not the leaps in logic we saw last time either.Danmachi III is a return to form for the beloved fantasy LN/anime series and lays the foundation for much more to come. I can’t say enough how much I enjoyed it. Danmachi III gets 9 familias out of 10. good enough for me.

About the Animation, this is good, with some low quality recycled panels but that do not affect an important moment since they are used in fill scenes, so meh, it is normal in itself, regarding the plot so far, if it is slow, but covers several things that the series left in season 2 and 1, which I appreciate that you continued.Personally, I think that objectively the series is on the right track, but, for many it may shock them, especially, if you are only looking for action, if so, leave the show or wait, which I do, since both for the OP, As for the winks that the anime gave, great things are coming, without more to say, thanks for reading weight to what is coming.This unfortunately can weigh on certain viewers who do not get used to connecting the dots and looking for more action, if this is your case, I understand that you are tired of the lack of action, I am the same in part, but if you pay attention, there are certain elements that a Future will cover this as the minotaur that the lizard mentioned or Aiz talking to bell, I suspect that 2 epic fights are coming, as happened with the previous seasons.Regarding the novel, I do not follow it, I do not know what will come, but the series that is what gives me to understand with the first 5 chapters, I hope I am not wrong or that this changes, for me the series is setting the stage and according to a friend who follows the novel, and kindly did not spoil me, this adaptation is almost 100% faithful to the novel.Regarding the animation, I can see that it remains the same, bell as a character is growing, including secondary ones such as hestia, ryuu, lilli, aisha, mikoto and haruhime, which is something I appreciate, since they did not forget the secondary characters.

However, the issue handled in this arc isn’t ones that requires as much nuance as the topics the latter arcs of the second season did because what choice Bell will make is pretty clear from the outset and the author doesn’t need to pretend like it’s not. And that...very much works to this season’s benefit I’d say because unlike the later arcs of the second season which felt bogged down by writing that just wasn’t handling it’s subject matter well enough, this season actually feels well written and executed.The entire season ultimately deals with only a single issue, sentient monsters and whether coexistence between them is possible. I suppose you could divide the season into three arcs, but they all kind of blur together as they all flow off of each other seamlessly and thus I just consider the entire season one extended arc centered around that issue. This is also an anime that’s laser focused on that. Most anime usually start off a season by easing the viewer in or some sort of in media res, but this season starts off right in the middle of the action from the literal first frame, and just goes from there. The previous seasons also had some tangents focusing on aspects of the cast independent of the overarching plot, but that too is absent here with everything tying in to the core plot line.In exchange for that it manages to handle it’s overarching plot incredibly well. It isn’t particularly original, as this type of story has been done countless times already, so the key comes down to execution, which was excellent. The plot manages to show off the main cast incredibly well through facing very different types of issues as compared to those the Hestia Family has dealt with previously. It also shows off the various previously established side characters pretty well as the circumstances here result in a very different dynamics between them, especially in regards to the Loki Familia who now essentially serve as antagonists in the second half, but also Hermes and Freya who are both shown to have similar but very different plans for Bell. It also introduces a lot of new characters, the majority of whom are still pretty simple, though even of those many are pretty likable. The ones that really stood out, Wiene, Fels, and Asterius, were amazing though and I’m incredibly interested in seeing more of them. Though it does feel like the cast is reaching some sort of critical mass where it’s going to have to start dropping characters from focus.While the anime dives right into it’s core plot thread from the beginning, it still does have somewhat of a ramp up. The first half is dedicated to slowly building up the context and getting the viewer invested in the new characters and their circumstances, with the second half cashing in on that investment. The first half never felt particularly amazing, but it was no doubt successful at what it needed to do as can be seen in that the second half building on it manages to be pretty much entirely a crazy ride with massive gut punches and intense moments that hit really hard and deliver major emotional impact in a lot of different ways. The final fight too I felt was some of the best action in the series and the ending was a really good way to end the season, feeling like a solid in and of itself but also making me really excited about where the story will go from here.The art and animation are as solid as the previous season, which is pretty solid, though I will note the animation in the final battle was a noticeable step above. The new character designs aren’t all that original but fit well enough that I have no complaints. The soundtrack was pretty similar to previous seasons, but I think it was used way better than previous season and some tracks worked well enough to be pretty memorable. The OP and ED are both incredibly solid, wherein they’re not a major jump above previous seasons but just enough that I found them much more memorable. very much works to this season’s benefit I’d say because unlike the later arcs of the second season which felt bogged down by writing that just wasn’t handling it’s subject matter well enough, this season actually feels well written and executed.The entire season ultimately deals with only a single issue, sentient monsters and whether coexistence between them is possible. I suppose you could divide the season into three arcs, but they all kind of blur together as they all flow off of each other seamlessly and thus I just consider the entire season one extended arc centered around that issue. This is also an anime that’s laser focused on that. Most anime usually start off a season by easing the viewer in or some sort of in media res, but this season starts off right in the middle of the action from the literal first frame, and just goes from there. The previous seasons also had some tangents focusing on aspects of the cast independent of the overarching plot, but that too is absent here with everything tying in to the core plot line.In exchange for that it manages to handle it’s overarching plot incredibly well. It isn’t particularly original, as this type of story has been done countless times already, so the key comes down to execution, which was excellent.

But this time, the ending is different, usually humans and monsters will be friends but not this time. I am also still wondering until now if there are tame monsters in the dungeon. The answer lies in this season. This opened with a continuation of the last sneak peek of season 2, and it was unexpected that Bell was there. Honestly with a story like this the plot still can't beat season 1, but there are still advantages of its own. They focus more on the relationship between the characters, and what I really like is...Bell's consistency. After all that had happened, at the end he always wanted to become stronger. This is a great motivation for us audiences too. Plus a lot of funny things happened in season 3 that were unpredictable. In conclusion season 3 is good and not a letdown. Season 4 will be epic.

You have been warned.Based on a popular light novel series of the same name Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou Ka III which is better known to western audiences as Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon 3 is an action, adventure, and fantasy genre anime that gives us the unique opportunity...to see what will happen if one day Bell and his friends while fighting within the town of Orario’s famed labyrinth was to meet not the fierce and bloodthirsty monsters that they had been fighting since they become adventurers but rather a scared little humanoid monster girl who not only did not attack them but also exhibited humanlike emotions like fear and curiosity and more importantly that of speech.Faced with this curious turn of events Bell and his familia soon make the fateful decision to take the young monster girl in but in doing so they also not only encounter an entire subgroup of similar monsters but also find themselves dragged into a fierce conflict with an ancient familia that’s determined to hunt down the monsters as part of their sick journey to garner more resources that will be used to follow the urge of their blood curse and finally complete their long laboured task of completing an ancient dungeon that predated the labyrinth. But powerful as these foes are, they are but one facet of the problems that Bell and his friends must face for they by taking the sides of protecting the intelligent monsters must also face the core truth of the relationship that exists between the adventurers of the town of Orario and the monsters of the labyrinth which is that of hatred.Now beset on all sides by powerful adventurers including members of the famed Loki familia as well as being ridiculed and labelled as traitors to humanity by standing with the monsters Bell and his familia must use every ounce of their bond, their skill, and their determination to triumph over their myriad foes even if they have to cross blades with adventurers that they know and respect for in this world kindness and morality is something that is worth fighting for if they want to change the world.Having been a fan of the light novel series that acts as the source material for the anime for many years I have to say that I was overjoyed to hear that the series Xeno’s arc was going to be featured as the third season for the series. This arc, in my opinion, was one of the best ones within the light novel as it allowed us to ask a question that until now no adventurer has ever asked before which was If we were to encounter monsters that possess both intelligence and feelings what should we do? The first episode of this season I felt was an excellent one that managed to not only reintroduce us back to the world of Orario and to Bell and his familia gently but also waste no time in introducing the new trial that they will face in this season with the introduction of Wiene a monster that can not only speak but also express humanlike emotion. While previous seasons had served to try and create memorable opening episodes that attempt to entice viewers to come back to mixed effect, I feel that this seasons opening ep was by far the best as it combined not just the familiarity that we have with Bell and his friends but also with a new series of tension and mystery that has the entire purpose of both the adventurers and the town of Orario being featured as part of the layers that have been weaved into the series overall storyline. This aspect in addition to my love of this series served to become my primary motivation in watching this series and by the end of it, I'm glad that I decided to do so.Bell CranelBell Cranel portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of Sword Art Online and Food Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A young adventurer that lives and operates from the famed city of Orario, as well as the famed field leader of the Hestia familia with the rightly earned nickname of little Rookie Bell from his initial appearances, was shown to be a kind, caring, and honest person by nature that was seen to be someone that wore his heart on his sleeve. While by this point of the story an experienced adventurer who alongside his friends have already earned considerable fame from taking on not one but two well-known familia’s in the form of Apollo and Ishtar familia and still triumph over them Bell rather than show signs of overconfidence and hubris as far too many adventurers in his shoes would no doubt show instead shows not only kindness and consideration towards all he meets but also humility and a desire to keep an open mind on matters preferring instead to follow his heart rather than rely on prejudices as so many others have done so.While far more confident in both his own skills in combat as well as far more mentally resilient as a result of his past trials Bell has never lost sight of the core values that serve to define him and always strives to not only fight with all his might but fight honourably and remain steadfast in his beliefs and more importantly protect those that are innocent from coming to harm. This sense of wanting to fight with everything that he has and protect those that are innocent from harm no matter who or what stands in his way can be said to be Bell’s primary motivation as an adventurer and one that has seen him break through every trial that he faced until this point. However, this noble motivation of Bell while certainly one that was sufficient to allow him to take on other familia’s and also allow Bell and his familia to rise within the cities familia rankings was to be solely tested when Bell and his friends encountered something that none of them expected while adventuring within the deeper levels of the dungeon which was that of not only an injured and intelligent dragon girl but also a whole new race of monsters that were not only capable of speech but also possessed a curious desire to not hurt innocents unless given cause too.This meeting of this new race of monsters who called themselves the Xenos while a shock to all within the familia was seen to have a major effect on Bell for Bell like his friends and allies was someone that had been taught through not only knowledge but also hard-earned and painful experience that the monsters that inhabited the dungeon were the sworn enemies of mankind that since eons in the past had been engaged in a never-ending war with humanity that had left countless adventurers and innocents dead or injured. And indeed for Bell whose base foundation revolved around him becoming an adventurer and form friendships and live the life that his grandfather had infused within him with his tales of being the hero that saved innocents while slaying monsters seeing the same monsters that he and his friends had been killing in order to make a living as adventurers came as a rude shock and created within Bell a rare sense of paralysis when facing monsters in the field on account of not wanting to hurt what could also be a sentient monster. While the effects that meeting the Xenos and especially Wiene were to have a lasting effect on Bell’s personality and experience Bell thanks to not only his innate kindness but also his open-minded nature was to only able to form the near heretical and treasonous opinion that not all monsters were hostile and that they like adventurers also possessed intelligence that given time can be used to form an accord with humanity that will serve to bring the war between the two races to an end. While this belief and later his subsequent actions in not only fighting against Ikelos familia but also defending the Xeno's from the might of Loki familia will see him and his familia being viewed as traitors by the cities occupants I felt that this bold move served well to showcase just much how Bell has grown as both a person and an adventurer for here Bell not only has to fight alongside his friends and take on powerful familia’s that were connected with the cities blood-soaked past but also do the unthinkable of defending monsters from his fellow adventurers something that shook Bell to the core. While an almost unwinnable situation it is to Bell’s credit that he was able to overcome this situation with not only his innate bravery but also his grim determination to protect every one of his friends and innocents from harm from whichever quarter to which they may come from by following his own heart and his own desires to see no more innocents be harmed unnecessarily.Overall as a character, I felt that Bell was one that was both well designed and developed extensively within this season. While the two prior seasons of the series had served to establish and develop Bell’s combat abilities and raise him from a rookie to a seasoned adventurer in this season I felt that the focus was on developing Bell mentally via both his meeting with the Xenos that served to expand his view on the world and make him realize that the world of his own was not as black and white as he thought and his sense of mental resilience and a desire to forge a path that he and his friends had chosen for themselves a path others may not agree with but one that they are determined to take in the form of Bell and his familia’s determination to protect the Xenos from their fellow adventurers even if they get labelled as traitors both of which I felt served to expand Bell as a character substantially.WieneWiene portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sword Art Online and Black Bullet fame is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of Bell and Hestia familia’s friends within the series. A member of the dungeons rare Vouivre race of monsters that Bell encounters while exploring the deeper levels of the dungeon at the beginning of the story Wiene from her initial appearances was seen to be the first unusual monster that Bell and co encountered in all their time as adventurers. While the many monsters that inhabit the dungeon were seen to demonstrate a degree of sentience the great majority of these monsters for the most part operated from the lower end of their intelligence cycle relying entirely on their basic instincts and senses to survive against the attention of the adventurers that also operated in the dungeon. However, unlike these monsters, Wiene was from the onset seen to be a different being as she not only displayed a sense of self-preservation but also possessed the ability to communicate with others through speech as well which was a first for a monster on Bell and familia’s part.  While shown to be capable of speech Wiene initially was seen to be a quiet, nervous, and easily frightened girl, and due to her limited experience with both the dungeon as well as with humans she was seen to struggle a great deal with interacting with both with her lack of communication skills and her fear of being with others forming a particular barrier for Bell and his familia that made it difficult for them to understand let alone bond with her. However, despite being fearful of the people and life that she met as well as the world that she saw outside of the dungeon to which she was born in Wiene was shown to be infinitely curious of the outside world which when combined with her innocent nature really served to make her that much more endearing to both us the viewer and to Bell and his familia a fact that went a long way in convincing them that Wiene was not just a normal monster but one that was truly unique a fact that was cemented when they christened her with the name Wiene.However, as the series progresses and more of Wiene’s character and personality is revealed it can be seen that Wiene while certainly happy that she had found and managed to befriend many kind-hearted people such as Bell and his familia also harboured a deep sense of fear and insecurity due to her monster origins and the constant threat that can come from being discovered. While she was shown to treasure the time that she spent with Bell and Haruhime within the familia’s home she was ever mindful of the kind of consequences and injuries that she can cause to others due to her origins a fact that is demonstrated well when she accidentally injured Bell with her claws when she got overexcited an event that was seen to wound her deeply and caused her to retreat deeper in her shell and try to avoid troubling her friends by leaving them. However while certainly fearful of her base nature and the danger that she can pose to Bell and his familia Wiene as a result of seeing the desperate sacrifices that Bell and his familia put in protecting her from not just other adventurers but also from their fellow humans this fear gradually began to lessen and be replaced by a deep sense of trust that she has for them as both reliable allies and also her first real friends within this foreign and scary world a relationship that I felt was akin to that of a family and one that was strong enough to contend with the relationship that Wiene has with her kin the Xenos.Overall the character of Wiene I felt was one that was both well designed and developed with her gradual development from a quiet, fearful and fragile girl who not only knew little of the world that she had arrived at but also knew less about how to communicate with others that inhabited the same world to someone that while understanding painfully the kind of dangers that existed in the surface world also came to understand the fleeting beauty that can come from seeing and experiencing the warm moments of peace and warmth that can come from being able to relax and have fun with people that you care about and trust with your life while enjoying the beauty of the surface world. whether monster or human being able to forge strong bonds with like-minded individuals I felt was an experience that Wiene was fortunate to be able to experience and grow from. In terms of character role while the Xenos within the context of the arc was seen to be the hopes of Fels and his master Ouranos Wiene served instead as the hope for Bell and familia in representing to them that even though she wasn’t human Wiene unlike the other monsters that they had encountered in their career as adventurers wasn’t one that was hostile to them. Indeed to them Wiene while certainly a monster was one that didn’t act as a typical one and instead to them was far more similar to a human being as she was not only capable of speech but was also able to display complex humanlike emotions and feelings such as joy, happiness, sadness, devastation that served to demonstrate to even the ever-suspicious Lili that Wiene and her fellows represented something that none of them had expected from monsters from the labyrinth which is hope in that perhaps one day an understanding between monsters can be reached that will finally end the conflict between the two races.AMVIn terms of animation while the overall designs for Bell and his familia were relatively unchanged I felt that the designs for the new monsters that made up the new Xenos faction were pretty well designed. While the monsters that made up the Xenos were for the most part species that Bell and familia had previously encountered in the dungeon as part of their forays as in the case of Lyd the lizardmen a large number of them were also ones that were new to us such as Ray the Harpy, Gros the gargoyle, Ranye the Arachne and Aude the war shadow. While the gathering of Xenos within the story was intended to showcase just how many monsters within the dungeon had gained sentience I felt that its inclusion of both old foes that Bell had tangled with in the past in the case of Lyd and Asterius and its marriage to these new ones served well to reunite Bell with not just old foes and nemesis’s but also show just how far both Bell and the dungeon had changed since the beginning.With regards to character design, I felt that there were some that managed to combine excellent usages of colour with unique innate personality with this being seen most clearly in Lyd whose red skin colour did well to conceal the warm and boisterous personality that lurked underneath his scales. On the flip side, this effective usage of colour was also used to an excellent effect in enhancing the threats posed by other monsters within the series that is best shown in Asterius’s introduction and his climactic battle with the frontliner’s of Loki familia when he arrived to help evac his kin from the surface. The black skin palette combined with the minotaur's powerfully built body structure and the physical threat its weapons and strength posed to Loki familia I felt served to inject plenty of additional tension into those scenes and served to make the subsequent battle that much more entertaining.  In terms of combat, I felt that this arc featured a great deal more tension than previous arcs which it manages to combine well with the combat scenarios that feature in it to excellent effect. Notable fights that I really enjoyed within this arc included Bell’s fight with Dix within their lair in Knossos that was as much a physical confrontation as it was a mental one, Bell’s first encounter with the Xeno’s in the form of his fierce dual with Lyd whose ferocity and cunning served to add a sense of tension and desperation into that battle, Loki familia’s fight with the Xenos and later with Asterius where they were faced with something that even the elites of Orario had seldom encountered which was a defeat, Ais’s fight with Asterius that to the former’s credit was close to overwhelming the famed sword maiden of Orario and lastly Bell’s dual with Ais in ep11 that was as much painful to Bell as it was to Ais as both greatly respected each other and did not want to fight each other if circumstances had been different. Lastly and perhaps what can be said to be the crowning jewel of this season in terms of fights was the final dual between Bell and Asterius that showed excellently the determination of not just Bell to save the xenos but also Asterius’s desire to protect his kin by facing the one that he keeps seeing in his dreams aspects that made that final fight that much more impactful to the audience.Music-wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Over and Over that was performed by veteran seiyuu singer Yuka Iguchi and Evergreen that was performed by Sajou no hana. Both of these songs while excellent in their own right I felt to me conveyed a contrasting sense of feelings to me when played with the former visualizing a sense of discovery, bonding, struggle, and a determination to fight against almost impossible odds in order to protect one that is dear to you in an attempt to change the world and make people realize that the world that they live in is simply not as black and white as they thought. While Yuka Iguchi’s vocals are as strong and uplifting as ever, I felt that these were complemented nicely by the opening visuals. In contrast to the opening theme the series ending theme Evergreen, I felt conveyed a different sense of feelings and emotions when listened too with this song being calmer and slower that really served to convey the sense of bonds and feelings that Bell had managed to forge with the many individuals that he had encountered as an adventurer of Orario whether they were humans or monsters.Voice acting-wise I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main or support characters. In particular, I felt that Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, Inori Minase, Maaya Uchida, Haruka Chisuga, Yoshimasa Hosoya, Chinatsu Akasaki, and Rina Hidaka all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Bell, Hestia, Liliruca, Haruhime, Welf, Mikoto, and Wiene respectively. Rina Hidaka’s portrayal of Wiene in particular I felt was especially impressive and really served to bring the character of Wiene to life by showcasing her dual sense of fragility and her desire to find a place in this new and horrifying world by bonding with and making new friends with like-minded individuals. While I didn’t cover their characters within character analysis, I felt that Masaaki Mizunaka, Yuuki Takada, and Daisuke Namikawa also did an excellent job at portraying the characters of Lyd, Ray, and Dix Perdix respectively. While only used sparingly within this arc I felt that Saori Oonishi also did an excellent job at portraying the character of Ais Wallenstein who within this arc was seen to express far more displays of emotion than her previous appearances which when combined with her developing doubts to the nature of the monsters that she had been taught to hate really served to make her not only a formidable physical threat but also a mental one to Bell and Wiene as well.Overall conclusionIn overall Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou Ka III I felt was an excellent series that had among its strong points an excellent premise, a strong story that featured a potent mix of tension and emotional moments, characters, combat scenarios, and excellent voice acting. At the same time within the context of the setting, I felt that the series overall plot also served to expand upon the kind of relationship that existed between adventurers and monsters that had been borne out of the endless struggles that had been fought between the two sides as a result of their struggles within the dungeon. While the concept of hunting, enslavement, and downright murder of sentient lifeforms will be downright distasteful to human beings I felt that this dispassionate disconnect that existed within the members of Ikelo’s familia and to an extent among a large percentage of adventurers within Orario afforded us an interesting opportunity to see the level of distrust that existed between monsters and adventurers one that I felt would not rock that much even if knowledge of the Xenos were to become common knowledge. However, while this hatred was a deep-rooted one that will not be easily overturned I felt that this served to make Bell and his familia’s attempt to protect the Xenos from the world even if it meant being labeled as traitors to be that much more endearing as to them Wiene and the Xenos were not mindless monsters that killed without conscious thought but rather they were individuals that had feelings and like humans had their own fears, likes and people that they cared about and treasured as well. Seeing Bell and his familia stand their ground and face the world as they fight to defend the Xenos and later get them to safety I felt really brought into focus the effect that meeting Wiene and the Xenos had on them as well as their own determination to protect the innocents even if it meant fighting their own friends and allies and being vilified by society.While most animes especially those that featured deep and complex plotlines make excellent use of transitions and phases Daimachi being one that focuses on combat and showcasing the teamwork of Bell and co through their established bonds was not one that made use of this. However in this season as a result of the Xeno’s arc that served to maroon them within the city, this served to introduce to the series an excellent opportunity to take away the rather combat-heavy season that this was if only briefly and replace it with not only tension but also a determination to make use of intelligence, creativity, cunning and the bonds that Bell and co have formed with their many allies across the city in order to outmanoeuvre both Loki familia and their famed leader and strategist in the form of Finn a phase that I felt served as an excellent vehicle to end the last part of the season with.Overall Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou Ka III I felt was an excellent anime that managed to in my eyes combine an excellent premise, a well thought out story that featured equal bits of mystery, action, tension, and combat scenarios that were paired with the series trademarked long odds, voice acting, emotional and physical bonds and an insightful look into the kind of relationship that exists in the animosity that stands between adventurer and monster and the kind of struggle that will be needed to secure an understanding between them. As a final score, I would say that Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou Ka III easily deserves a score of 8/10. to see what will happen if one day Bell and his friends while fighting within the town of Orario’s famed labyrinth was to meet not the fierce and bloodthirsty monsters that they had been fighting since they become adventurers but rather a scared little humanoid monster girl who not only did not attack them but also exhibited humanlike emotions like fear and curiosity and more importantly that of speech.Faced with this curious turn of events Bell and his familia soon make the fateful decision to take the young monster girl in but in doing so they also not only encounter an entire subgroup of similar monsters but also find themselves dragged into a fierce conflict with an ancient familia that’s determined to hunt down the monsters as part of their sick journey to garner more resources that will be used to follow the urge of their blood curse and finally complete their long laboured task of completing an ancient dungeon that predated the labyrinth. But powerful as these foes are, they are but one facet of the problems that Bell and his friends must face for they by taking the sides of protecting the intelligent monsters must also face the core truth of the relationship that exists between the adventurers of the town of Orario and the monsters of the labyrinth which is that of hatred.Now beset on all sides by powerful adventurers including members of the famed Loki familia as well as being ridiculed and labelled as traitors to humanity by standing with the monsters Bell and his familia must use every ounce of their bond, their skill, and their determination to triumph over their myriad foes even if they have to cross blades with adventurers that they know and respect for in this world kindness and morality is something that is worth fighting for if they want to change the world.Having been a fan of the light novel series that acts as the source material for the anime for many years I have to say that I was overjoyed to hear that the series Xeno’s arc was going to be featured as the third season for the series. This arc, in my opinion, was one of the best ones within the light novel as it allowed us to ask a question that until now no adventurer has ever asked before which was If we were to encounter monsters that possess both intelligence and feelings what should we do? The first episode of this season I felt was an excellent one that managed to not only reintroduce us back to the world of Orario and to Bell and his familia gently but also waste no time in introducing the new trial that they will face in this season with the introduction of Wiene a monster that can not only speak but also express humanlike emotion. While previous seasons had served to try and create memorable opening episodes that attempt to entice viewers to come back to mixed effect, I feel that this seasons opening ep was by far the best as it combined not just the familiarity that we have with Bell and his friends but also with a new series of tension and mystery that has the entire purpose of both the adventurers and the town of Orario being featured as part of the layers that have been weaved into the series overall storyline. This aspect in addition to my love of this series served to become my primary motivation in watching this series and by the end of it, I'm glad that I decided to do so.Bell CranelBell Cranel portrayed by veteran voice actor Yoshitsugu Matsuoka of Sword Art Online and Food Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A young adventurer that lives and operates from the famed city of Orario, as well as the famed field leader of the Hestia familia with the rightly earned nickname of little Rookie Bell from his initial appearances, was shown to be a kind, caring, and honest person by nature that was seen to be someone that wore his heart on his sleeve. While by this point of the story an experienced adventurer who alongside his friends have already earned considerable fame from taking on not one but two well-known familia’s in the form of Apollo and Ishtar familia and still triumph over them Bell rather than show signs of overconfidence and hubris as far too many adventurers in his shoes would no doubt show instead shows not only kindness and consideration towards all he meets but also humility and a desire to keep an open mind on matters preferring instead to follow his heart rather than rely on prejudices as so many others have done so.While far more confident in both his own skills in combat as well as far more mentally resilient as a result of his past trials Bell has never lost sight of the core values that serve to define him and always strives to not only fight with all his might but fight honourably and remain steadfast in his beliefs and more importantly protect those that are innocent from coming to harm. This sense of wanting to fight with everything that he has and protect those that are innocent from harm no matter who or what stands in his way can be said to be Bell’s primary motivation as an adventurer and one that has seen him break through every trial that he faced until this point. However, this noble motivation of Bell while certainly one that was sufficient to allow him to take on other familia’s and also allow Bell and his familia to rise within the cities familia rankings was to be solely tested when Bell and his friends encountered something that none of them expected while adventuring within the deeper levels of the dungeon which was that of not only an injured and intelligent dragon girl but also a whole new race of monsters that were not only capable of speech but also possessed a curious desire to not hurt innocents unless given cause too.This meeting of this new race of monsters who called themselves the Xenos while a shock to all within the familia was seen to have a major effect on Bell for Bell like his friends and allies was someone that had been taught through not only knowledge but also hard-earned and painful experience that the monsters that inhabited the dungeon were the sworn enemies of mankind that since eons in the past had been engaged in a never-ending war with humanity that had left countless adventurers and innocents dead or injured. And indeed for Bell whose base foundation revolved around him becoming an adventurer and form friendships and live the life that his grandfather had infused within him with his tales of being the hero that saved innocents while slaying monsters seeing the same monsters that he and his friends had been killing in order to make a living as adventurers came as a rude shock and created within Bell a rare sense of paralysis when facing monsters in the field on account of not wanting to hurt what could also be a sentient monster. While the effects that meeting the Xenos and especially Wiene were to have a lasting effect on Bell’s personality and experience Bell thanks to not only his innate kindness but also his open-minded nature was to only able to form the near heretical and treasonous opinion that not all monsters were hostile and that they like adventurers also possessed intelligence that given time can be used to form an accord with humanity that will serve to bring the war between the two races to an end. While this belief and later his subsequent actions in not only fighting against Ikelos familia but also defending the Xeno's from the might of Loki familia will see him and his familia being viewed as traitors by the cities occupants I felt that this bold move served well to showcase just much how Bell has grown as both a person and an adventurer for here Bell not only has to fight alongside his friends and take on powerful familia’s that were connected with the cities blood-soaked past but also do the unthinkable of defending monsters from his fellow adventurers something that shook Bell to the core. While an almost unwinnable situation it is to Bell’s credit that he was able to overcome this situation with not only his innate bravery but also his grim determination to protect every one of his friends and innocents from harm from whichever quarter to which they may come from by following his own heart and his own desires to see no more innocents be harmed unnecessarily.Overall as a character, I felt that Bell was one that was both well designed and developed extensively within this season.

The season has some nice character development especially with Ais and Bell and Syr and Bell.The art is the same standard but more polished this time. It follows the same style of...usage with magic and such details which is nice for consistency.The OP and ED are great. The general SFX for battles and such is epic and a shining example. Emotion can be really felt when needed.Characters develop a whole lot and you see ideals of people and others. You see some wish only for a status quo whilst others accept that things need to change and others fear it. Aside from complex emotion on the story, you have people like Ais question who she is and Syr being the cutest girl you can ask for. Anya and Chloe the catgirls are also shown a bit more which is amazing too.The season has a few moments where it is somewhat dull but in the grand scheme of the show, it does pace quite well. The season this time is again worth watching with an OVA announced to be a sort of bath time by the looks of it.9/10.

The reason I like and hate the story is the same thing. The way he is indecisive about all the things is what sets the plot and that is what annoys me the most. It\'s not that I fully hate how indecisive he is, it shows the hero is a...human after all and I like that, it\'s how long the story writers have him indecisive that I hate. And the fact that, the whole reason for this ""indecisiveness"" is for plot extending. Also, the things he wants to say, he doesn\'t say and the time he says it feels more like he tells them not coz he truly feels it but because others have told him or ""That\'s what a HERO would do"".The whole anime could have been titled ""The Indecisive Hero"" and nobody would have any trouble believing in it. The extent to which his indecisiveness goes is beyond frustrating. After watching series like One Piece and others where even though we have a goof of a MC, the thing I liked about them the most is that they always knew what to do and they ""do"" what they wanted from the start, they take a decision from the start and stick with it. Here, sometimes it feels the whole plot is just a filler the creator made to increase the story length by making the MC take nearly the whole season to actually make a decision and the story then simply completes 20 minutes after he does make a decision.Even though I like the story, I don\'t like the protagonist of this story at all. The writer could have done better with the pacing or the decision making time of the MC.

Not in a very bad way, but it always made me question what goes in the characters' heads at certain times. Nonetheless, the anime series has kept me entertained for 3 seasons and I don't regret watching a single season.If you are reading the review, I expect you are already knowledgeable of the previous seasons, but nothing changed that much in terms of character development - same characters, same virtues, and an ever-expanding storage of girls. However, if I had to start over...and watch this show from the beginning, I am not sure I would be too excited about that.Now to be honest, the budget for animation definitely went for the fights and I was glad to see that. It was better than most harems out there and I can't stress it enough because it subconsciously makes you expect from it as much as from some of the best-selling shows at some point.As always, in certain scenarios, I found a lack of sound effects, but those might not be very important for you. This season has been packed with a lot of information and important hardships that were inevitable sooner or later.To be blunt, I enjoyed the anime for what it is, and if we get more sequels, I will continue to watch them just as I used to up to this point. It is not a bad show per se, but someone new to the series might not be too keen on going in for the 3 seasons straight away depending on what type of person you are. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable and intriguing journey. and watch this show from the beginning, I am not sure I would be too excited about that.Now to be honest, the budget for animation definitely went for the fights and I was glad to see that.

One of the things that really bothered me about the second season was the pacing, and the overall amount of tangents that Bell and company had to chase down. It was fun but overall bothered me because it detracts from who we want to follow, Bell.This season instead decides to follow bell\'s perspective of the events surrounding him and keep him as the primary focus, a welcome change.

The whole story is surprisingly similar to something i wrote in 6th grade, and it just isn\'t that great. This latest season in particular is really bad, throwing in whole new sides of the story and new mechanics for us to try and fit into our interpretation of the world, and...you really can\'t make sense of the show without just thinking ""oh, so i guess that\'s a thing now"". The story really relies on the viewer just accepting everything they see, not questioning motive or incentive.Art - 10What can I say, other than it\'s beautiful. The studio really put in effort for this show, making it at least visually appealing for the Danmachi fans.Sound - 10Again, this was aced. the art and sound really make the show a lot better, and while the lack of a good story might turn some away, just listening to a fight scene gives at least some immersion.Character - 4Being honest, the characters of this show are really forgettable, usually one-dimensional gimmick machines. Bell, the main character, is the one nice guy protagonist that really doesn\'t make any romantic advances, but for some reason still has a plethora of women around him for no reason. On that note, even the women around him barely have anything resembling a personality. Hestia\'s main quality is being way over possessive, and Ais\'s only real quality is being kind of dumb. Welf and Lili do actually have half decent personalities, and I might even go so far as to call them good, but they never really do anything in the show so i wont let that influence the score.Enjoyment - 6While the characters may not be to great and the story may suck, that does\'t necessarily mean it\'s bad as a show. If you watch this show for a good laugh or to be on the edge of your seat during a well choreographed fight, hey it might as well be a 10.

In contrast to the first and second seasons, the third season dedicates all 12 episodes to a cohesive and captivating narrative. It introduces new and compelling characters while significantly expanding the story's scope. The action scenes maintain their high-quality animation, and the characters remain visually appealing. The pacing is flawlessly executed, consistently propelling the narrative forward without any sluggish moments. Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka III eclipses its earlier seasons, leaving viewers eagerly anticipating what lies ahead. "", 'Despite me putting it as ""Masterpiece"" in my Anime List, I\'ve decided to make it officially an 8.5!StoryUnlike the previous two seasons, Bel finally meats his match. Let me explain:Most action-adventure anime follow a trope of ""hero triumphs over evil"" to justify the acts of the protagonist. While Dungeon follows a similar type of genre, it takes its own approach and diverts itself from that mainstream path to create its own unique place. Obviously I don\'t mean every anime like this one does that, it\'s just for a general comparison. For example, in this one, the finale results in the protagonist fighting against his rival,...in this case ""evil,"" and instead of winning, falls short of victory. Combined with the social-political themes between factions (the different Familias and public opinion), this resulted in a kind of satisfying yet anti-climactic ending that makes you wanna see what comes next.CharacterBefore I start off on saying why I enjoy the character of this anime, I wanna address the issue a lot of people share of ""one-dimensional"" characters. You see, sure, there might be some one-dimensional characters, but the anime isn\'t about them, and never was. They might have the spotlight for a bit, but the primary focus is how the protagonist(s) react to and overcome/convince them to change.Now... speaking of character, I want to follow up on the social-politics I mentioned earlier in the Story review. Dungeon does a beautiful job of bringing Monsters and Humankind underneath the same roof, two sides of the same coin and makes you sympathetic towards their cause just as you might be to your average human character. The original author of the manga made fantastic characters for this, and I applaud him for it, even if I do dislike the the whole romantically dense protagonist type of characters. I mean, gods, I despise them. But hey, Bel isn\'t that bad and you get used to it pretty quick.OverallOverall I\'ll give this an 8.5/10. I skipped over art, sound, and enjoyment because I\'d have both very little and quite a lot to say depending on the subject, so I did my best to keep it short with as little spoilers as possible, and if there are a few, I apologize!Anyway, TL;DR, I recommend this!

Overall a solid season, From Bells and Asterius's fight to Wiene being Wiene, love the series and the characters, outside of Lily, Wiene is my favorite, especially after she rips off her own wing and fingernails.

An entire franchise, even. And that character is Wiene, despite all who may praise or defend her character.

We want to see Bell's growth, not this nonsense, this moral dilemma about monster rights.Danmachi started as an ecchi slice of life, much like Konosuba. That's why it got popular in the first place, and it was supposed to stay that way. Thankfully the next season restores the status quo to a...degree, but the damage from this season has been done. Because of Wiene, Danmachi's reputation as an ongoing franchise has taken an irreversible blow, similar to how Psycho Pass did after the release of the infamous season 2.

It\'s surely closer to the same than it is different, but I\'d like to point out a couple of the differences.For starters, this is definitely the darkest season as far as tone and content. Season two dipped a little bit into dark territory with a red light district and sex workers and that kind of thing, and I absolutely appreciate that this anime isn\'t afraid to dip its toes into dark territory, but this season is absolutely even darker.The...other key difference this time around, to its detriment in my eyes, is the abandonment of key mechanics. There is absolutely zero leveling up or learning new abilities at any point in this season, which was strange and somewhat disappointing to see, and this, like most of the nitpicky criticisms I will outline in this review, are likely attributable to its short, somewhat rushed 12 episode run time.The pacing here was OKAY. The first two episodes are on the slow and underwhelming side but from there it picks up significantly. There was a satisfactory amount of action and fights within the confines of the episode count, including a great battle near the end that felt like it had weight and build-up behind it, and after the first two episodes this season never felt slow. Not a lot of time is spent in town or at home or in extended dialogue sequences- for better or worse. This is a double edged sword in that things definitely moved along and upon reaching the end I could have easily (and would have liked to have) watched 12 more episodes, but the tradeoff is some aspects in this season, the most egregious being the introduction and character building of new character Wiene, felt rushed.For me, that\'s the single biggest shortcoming of the season. I wasn\'t personally able to connect with Wiene or grow attached to the character and it felt like the other characters bonded with her and they all decided they love each other and will risk their lives for each other far too quickly. Perhaps we are supposed to infer some amount of a time skip in the first few episodes where everyone is bonding but this is never stated or even hinted at and if it\'s NOT there then we\'re to assume these characters got ""I\'ll risk my life for you"" levels of bonded in a matter of days, which isn\'t super believable for me.This anime isn\'t the most egregious offender I\'ve ever watched by anime means, but yet again this season it felt like Bell had main character plot armor on multiple occasions. At level 3 he should simply never, ever be able to keep pace with a level 5. Likewise, being cleanly cut across the chest by a much, much larger, stronger opponent wielding a weapon the size of Bell\'s entire body should absolutely kill him or make him bleed out, but he\'s able to take blows like this and bounce back very quickly with regularity.One thing I\'ve always appreciated about this anime, and it continues in this third season, is the strong development and purpose of side characters, of which there are very, very many. None of them feel there just for convenience or like one-dimensional throwaways. Rather, they all have their own personalities, motivations, opinions and flaws. Even within the small Hestia Familia there is not unanimous agreement on how to handle the events of the season and the characters do not all mindlessly agree to help their buddy because of the power of friendship or any of that nonsense.I don\'t consider this a spoiler since it lasts for all of a minute and a half, but this anime kills off a character and then revives them almost instantly, completely wimping out and taking the lame and cheap approach. I HATE when animes do this. Grow a pair and leave the character dead or don\'t kill them in the first place.Finally, these two points are more a BLU RAY issue rather than an issue with the anime itself, but for sure I noticed lines/not smoothed out textures in many scenes, especially up close scenes and darker scenes, and also the back of the blu ray box gives away way too much plot and ruined the early episodes for me because I already knew where it was going.Overall I really like this series and almost all my grievances about this season, or any of the other seasons, are minor and nitpicky more than anything. If you enjoyed the first two seasons there\'s no reason to believe you wouldn\'t enjoy these as well. Season four is coming out this year as well so in theory we shouldn\'t have to wait forever to continue this journey.OBJECTIVE RATING- 8~PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8 other key difference this time around, to its detriment in my eyes, is the abandonment of key mechanics.

I enjoyed the first season quite a bit. The second season wasn\'t bad but nothing special. This third season, however goes beyond mediocrity and it\'s straight up bad.This series has a lot of problems. The biggest problem is it\'s main character. He\'s your usual ""goodie two shoes"" witch I don\'t mind so much but unlike most anime characters that want to achieve something or become great, this guy just goes whetever the wind blows and basically gets stepped on by everybody.Not only is he boring but...he seems to be there just for every other character to fall in love with, or just take care of like a lost puppy dog and it grows old quick. It makes this series unwatchable when the main character is such a door matt who\'s only personality traits are that he\'s a good boy and he wants to bang Ais.At first I could ignore this but in this season several people die and get kidnapped because he simply doesn\'t have the BALLS to do what he wants or what needs to be done, only what other people tell him. So unlike other  shounen main characters like Naruto, Luffy and Ichigo he would let his friends get killed just because he doesn\'t want to break the rules.Another thing that ruins these series is his ""Argonaut"" attack that is basically an ""I win whenever I need to"" button. Seriously how could they allow this Deus Ex Machina to just be built into a character and just appear when you need it? it\'s riddiculous.Then you got the literal Jesus Christ Ais Wallenstain. She doesn\'t talk or basically does anything. She\'s just there to show up and one punch every bad guy there is. If the Argonaut skill wasn\'t enough then you got this girl and her ""always win"" guild. If you don\'t like them then too bad because they will keep showing up, even tough I couldn\'t care less, only to wrap everything up because they\'re that awesome. They even wasted time and money making an Anime about them called ""Sword Oratoria"" only to find out that the girl who is perfect and never speaks makes a terrible main character. It\'s a bad joke and if you find anyone that likes that Anime then capture them because we need to study their brains for science.The rest of the Anime is basically cute anime girls with a small pinch of story line and some drama. If you don\'t like cute characters then you won\'t like this either. I see a lot of people saying this sucks it\'s a ""harem"" but honestly that\'s probably one of the few good things about it.Bad Story, Bad Characters, A few fun adventures a few waifus. 4/10 he seems to be there just for every other character to fall in love with, or just take care of like a lost puppy dog and it grows old quick. It makes this series unwatchable when the main character is such a door matt who\'s only personality traits are that he\'s a good boy and he wants to bang Ais.At first I could ignore this but in this season several people die and get kidnapped because he simply doesn\'t have the BALLS to do what he wants or what needs to be done, only what other people tell him. So unlike other  shounen main characters like Naruto, Luffy and Ichigo he would let his friends get killed just because he doesn\'t want to break the rules.Another thing that ruins these series is his ""Argonaut"" attack that is basically an ""I win whenever I need to"" button. Seriously how could they allow this Deus Ex Machina to just be built into a character and just appear when you need it? it\'s riddiculous.Then you got the literal Jesus Christ Ais Wallenstain. She doesn\'t talk or basically does anything. She\'s just there to show up and one punch every bad guy there is. If the Argonaut skill wasn\'t enough then you got this girl and her ""always win"" guild. If you don\'t like them then too bad because they will keep showing up, even tough I couldn\'t care less, only to wrap everything up because they\'re that awesome. They even wasted time and money making an Anime about them called ""Sword Oratoria"" only to find out that the girl who is perfect and never speaks makes a terrible main character. It\'s a bad joke and if you find anyone that likes that Anime then capture them because we need to study their brains for science.The rest of the Anime is basically cute anime girls with a small pinch of story line and some drama. If you don\'t like cute characters then you won\'t like this either. I see a lot of people saying this sucks it\'s a ""harem"" but honestly that\'s probably one of the few good things about it.Bad Story, Bad Characters, A few fun adventures a few waifus. 4/10', ""Reviews on MAL are so opinionated I usually try to stay far away from the review section. However, watching Danmachi III frustrated me so much I need to vent somewhere - as every other reviewer also fails to provide an objective analysis this is the perfect place. Anything past this point may be a mild spoiler, although I made sure not to be specific.The main reason this anime frustrated me to no end was the bad plot devices. There was one group in this season that could be classified as evil, and they were dealt with fairly early on. After that, the plot is only...about one faction being seen as evil even though they're not, and trying to keep this faction safe. The whole time they could prove they aren't evil pretty easily and pretty much all reasonable people would at the very least accept a ceasefire, but no, the author reserves to right to make any character temporarily brainless just to keep the plot going. So they don't prove anything, no one else listens to reason, and the anime happens.Other than this everything feels dragged out - the last episode is a completely random and unnecessary addition (although when it comes to action and animation it is the only good episode). Like I said before, characters consistently pick the worse option because the plot must happen. Everyone is black and white. If the masses see you as the biggest scum there is but then you fight a monster? Boom, favourite hero. Of course this also applies the other way around.Some more classic action/fantasy anime pet peeves that appear a lot:- Strategy? Completely abandoned whenever a random new plot point is added.- MC loses against weaker foes then somehow fights on par with the strongest enemy introduced yet.- Forced misunderstandings: basically, one character will say they like pears and then another will disagree for the unrelated fact that purple is a colour.- The MC is seen as a special person with certain righteous beliefs that should be common sense. The goal is to get you to relate, but the result is you end up hating everyone else.- People randomly being other places. Running somewhere? Bam, ambush. Would there have been time to prepare one? No, but plot must happen!- Time not consistent. Oh, this things happened in place X? Dang, well if we take into account the time it took for that news to reach us, how long it takes to prepare an intervention team and to travel there we should be there... Pretty much instantly after it happened. Right?- Someone has a certain opinion A. Small thing happens which probably happens all the time enforces opinion B. Big thing that's a momentous breakthrough enforces A. And of course the character now believes B, because reason doesn't exist...- Someone else has opinion B. Said big breakthrough enforcing opinion A doesn't change their mind, but something much more minor relatively does...- Power levels all over the place. A will easily overpower B, only for B to then easily fight A along with two others... No powerups or explanation, just 'cause.- Same thing basically, overpowered characters could catch an arrow with a glare yet an underpowered character will be able to slip away because... Why exactly?- The list goes on, but I'll stop here. If you have some pet peeves of your own please message me, let's talk shit of bad tropes together.Main problems are with story and characters (and indirectly my enjoyment). Animation felt worse than before but that's not really a problem imo. Nothing special about the sound. I thought episodes were shorter than before (bigger outro) but could just be me. I got the impression this anime was only made to cash in on the success of the previous seasons, definitely wouldn't recommend. about one faction being seen as evil even though they're not, and trying to keep this faction safe.

Mediocre is one of the words that you can describe this danmachi season. Niche plot, cringe characters, and average, yet, disappointing season.To be honest, the only reason why I\'m still watching this anime is because of the first season; I\'m just hoping it would at least become decent. This season is pretty much the anime\'s worst season. It was simply unbearable to watch. Overall, it was not a good season. Watch it if you like the first season and hoping it would be better, and skip or postpone it if you don\'t like wasting your time. ', 'Wow, its been what 5 years since the first season? And they have still kept the same theme running through it. Heres the thing about this show, is it the best? Maybe not, Does it have the most drama? No, Does it have good waifu material? I mean...Hestia bestia according to me 3 years ago, but I\'ve got to say is this season is a improvement to the whole show. You can see the studios improvement through the show life, just as Bell improves throughout the show so to the writers, animators and the whole show crew in general have improved dramatically. It background sound...was excellent in the battle scenes, the drama and characters have evolved from just being surface deep characters to throw at Bell just to see what would happen and being a excuse for ""character motivation"" to real breathing characters, even Hestia has gotten a little less annoying.The real  difference between this season and the first season is so remarkable that I find myself wondering if they are different shows,  with the Xenos arc being a far cry from the first season arc, because now you understand all the characters motivations and driving force, such as when you here why Aiz wants to kill Xenos to protect everyone from the monster and the pain Bell goes through fighting her.All of this to say, I think the show has improve dramatical of the time it was made and why you should give it a chance, even if you thought previous seasons were really bad. was excellent in the battle scenes, the drama and characters have evolved from just being surface deep characters to throw at Bell just to see what would happen and being a excuse for ""character motivation"" to real breathing characters, even Hestia has gotten a little less annoying.The real  difference between this season and the first season is so remarkable that I find myself wondering if they are different shows,  with the Xenos arc being a far cry from the first season arc, because now you understand all the characters motivations and driving force, such as when you here why Aiz wants to kill Xenos to protect everyone from the monster and the pain Bell goes through fighting her.All of this to say, I think the show has improve dramatical of the time it was made and why you should give it a chance, even if you thought previous seasons were really bad.', 'You know, in some bastardized way, despite the content that’s shown here, Bell still is technically picking up girls in a dungeon. While I’m certain the intention of the series’ title was supposed to be metaphorical, I can’t help but feel like it’s also supposed to be literal too at this point.Story:Deep in the Dungeon in Orario, a young vouivre is born with little to no understanding of who she really is. She’s a monster, yes, but one who seems to have some kind of intelligence more akin to a human rather than that of her feral kin. It’s here where out of empathy, our...rabbit protagonist happens upon her and takes her home much to the concern of the rest of his familia and the general sentiment among people and adventurers given their relationship with what’s essentially the town’s xp farm. Thus creating a moral dilemma that pits our protagonist against the town that’s grown to see him as a hero.Spanning about three or so volumes of the light novel, Danmachi III feels more like a larger overarching story akin to the first season instead of the stapled together arcs that came with the series’ second season. Which makes the whole thing feel a lot more cohesive and a lot more engaging as a result. As for content, the story takes a drastic left turn into something that’s both completely different to what we’ve seen before, yet works especially in context to Bell’s ‘heroic’ character and everything that’s been built up with him to this point. The main ‘gimmick’ of this arc lies within the Xenos, monsters that’ve gained intelligence to the point of being able to communicate and emote like humans do, and questioning the idea of whether or not they’re like their feral counterparts whom the adventurers kill, or should be treated with respect like you would any other human. Less a racial allegory and more of a ‘what if’ scenario that challenges a fundamental belief within the world of the story.This ever-present question creates a lot of discourse within the story of Danmachi III, and it does it to an extent that doesn’t give a clear solution to the problem by the end of it. Which is something I love about this season because for all parties involved, especially in the second half, it’s less about who’s right or wrong and more about the personal beliefs and motives of the characters involved in context to the Xenos and where they stand in the world. Characters usually on the same side fighting each other, and the world of Orario play an even bigger part to everything given how the repercussions of what happens in the story affects bystanders involved. This mix of emotions gave the story so much more oomph and engagement that I’ve never previously seen or had with Danmachi before.By contrast though, the pacing and the rushing to get to the ‘good part’ makes the show suffer a little big especially in the beginning parts where everything is established. It’s an unfortunate setback that pays off when the show commits to giving the show its rightful climax, which is really only a downside because it shows how much a 12 episode time constraint can give a series. But aside from that, Danmachi III is a really solid season that asks some tough questions for the series and explores challenges that Bell has to resolve in order to make him a more fitting protagonist in the middle of all of this drama and such. Aside from a few pacing issues (and changes from the LN that are apparent but I personally know very little about unfortunately), an engaging show all around.Characters:Bell this time more than ever shows off his white knight hero traits and his willingness to save anyone despite adversity. While previously he’s been a major boon and Achilles heel for the series due to his role as the harem main character in a fantasy series, he really doesn’t come across with that fantasy in mind this time around. He faces a surprising amount of adversity for his actions more than ever this time around, and really struggles whenever he has his abilities and beliefs put to the test. He doesn’t feel necessarily strong or overpowered, but still retains an indomitable spirit to do the ‘right thing’ and ‘get stronger’, which makes him an all around better protagonist considering the end results of his fights and the few results he manages to scrape by by the end of it. He just feels a lot better as a protagonist more so than before, and I’m personally really invested in the kind of character we’ve ended up getting with this time around.And to supplement as the ‘girl of the arc’ character that we’ve gotten in literally every part of this story, we have Wiene, a vouivre that Bell finds and befriends who ends up being one of the Xenos. Wiene is a character that I feel like is one that gets better over time, but not as much as Bell does since she’s only a supplementary part of the cast. A majority of her character is set in the damsel in distress trope (again), though slightly different as a result of some of her later character moments, which shine her in a more positive light, although I doubt we’re going to get much of her beyond this point. Still, a decent starting gun to get the story of this arc going, and I think for her character, that’s fine. Though a little bit disappointing given how much she’s just kind of a story plot point.Fels is the last character I want to talk about purely on the basis of their character and the interesting ramifications that come from their involvement in the story. Previously just a really off-hand side character that barely had any screentime, this arc also feels like the ‘Fels’ arc because of how much attention is brought to them and the ramifications that came to create the character named ‘Fels’ as well as their actions to try and aid the Xenos as much as they can. A little Deus Ex Machina at times, but despite that, they feel like a natural part of the cast that only benefits the story due to the new territory that the series is diving into as a result of the wider scope of Orario and the inner workings of the world.The rest of the cast from various members of different Familias, the gods themselves, and even Ais sort of get relegated to different points in the series that add impact whenever the story needs them. Different perspectives on the matter at hand is primarily what they’re used for, and it’s great to have this kind of thing be a part of the series because up until this point, a greater majority of these characters have been on Bell’s side of things instead of either neutral or outright against him with what the case is here. It’s just nice to have the dynamics change a bit, although with the Hestia familia, it’s more of a given that they’re a little sidelined given their names are not ‘Bell’, but it’s nice that they resolved that problem a bit going into the second half.Aesthetics:It kind of feels like J.C. Staff gave Danmachi the kind of backup that it needed, if only just a little bit, because it’s one of the production company’s more popular works right now. While mostly the same, Danmachi this time around feels slightly more higher budget than before, with a lot of focus on the movements in the fights as well as some nicer backgrounds that add some contrast to the normally medieval European style of building that exists around the Babel tower above the dungeon. Knossos and the entire Daedalus district much like the red-light district in Season II give the series a breath of fresh air in its appearance, and I appreciate the change of scenery.In addition, this season is really, really bloody. I’ve said before that Sword Oratorio is better than the original in some ways because it showcases the kind of dangers that these adventurers go through given their dangerous life or death occupation, but this time for season 3, they’ve really upped the amount of gore they’re willing to show off, and I’m all for it. It gave the show a lot more visual flair to the fights or injuries than I expected, and my god some poor artist had to draw all of the blood that goes on here. Which is really only a good thing all around considering the stakes in the fights.Iguchi Yuka’s “over and over” is an alright song that doesn’t…really stand out much to me. The visuals in the OP I feel are a lot more engaging than the song itself. Which when you compare it to some of the older stuff that she’s done for the series, is a little disappointing. Still a decent song, but definitely not as memorable as some of what the first two seasons had when it came to their openings.sajou no hana’s “Evergreen” by comparison is a more emotionally charged piece that plays more towards the empathy and compassion that the series is trying to show with the introduction of Wiene and the rest of Xenos. It’s definitely more in line with what the series is trying to do with its story, but kind of falls in line with its OP sister in being good, but not that memorable to me. But it definitely does have its place in the series, although maybe not for storytelling reasons that I may not fully agree with.Final Thoughts:Honestly I don’t even know why I started watching Danmachi, but it’s definitely lost a lot of traction as years have gone on and other series have taken its place as the ‘talk of the season’. Personally though, I think this is the best the story’s ever been, although that might be because there’s been a lot of build up to this point. Like…three seasons and even a freaking movie’s worth of content aside from two or so OVAs in between all of that material.I think my affection for this season in particular has come from the fact that the story chose something out of left field and committed it to the end. The entire season is devoted to the Xenos and their plight, as well as the outside opposition that comes from seeing the new thing and being afraid of it because of its unpredictability. The rollercoaster of well-known characters fighting each other and the clash of ideals is such a strong storytelling trope that it managed to get me engaged to the end because of how much I was invested in seeing where this story was going to go to reach its completion. That in addition to the story having a surprising amount of worldbuilding and external consequence come as a result of Bell’s actions is again, only really a positive that made the story so much more engaging to me.That all comes only after as a result of a relatively slow and info-dumpy kind of beginning few episodes. Which is ok if only because there’s so much new stuff to get through first, but is kind of a shame because I feel like there was a lot more impact and story that could’ve been shown if only they didn’t rush through everything or maybe had one or two more episodes.

I'm just as confused as you are, trust me). All mysteries of anime productions aside, season 3 didn't stand out to me at all. After all, the premise was identical to that of season 2. At first, I expected an experience hardly any different to season 2, but as it got into the middle episodes, I could confidently say one thing: this is definitely better than season 2, dear god season 2 was so bad. I then realized that this was very reminiscent of season 1 in terms...of enjoyment for me. All the way up to the 11th episode I decided that I would enjoy this one just as much as season 1, which was fun. Then, episode 12 came out. At this point, I'd already been bored of the anime and spent several days without watching the episode. When I finally came around to it, holy shit was I surprised. I'm not going to summarize it, but I'll point out what I gained from that episode.One, I realized just how much the show has changed. There's definitely been some improvement from the characters, the story, and more.WARNING, THE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS, skip to the next paragraph to avoid minor spoilers for episode 12. Two, the deus ex machina. Asterius' deus ex machina was just like any other deus ex machina but somehow, I wasn't all too disappointed by it. The detail about Asterius being the Minotaur that Bell fought was somehow acceptable.Three, the potential for more. The way Bell reacted to the end of his battle, the way Hermes and Freya spoke, everything seemed to imply some more going to happen. Unlike the implications at the ends of seasons 1 and 2, this was an implication that was hopeful for me, genuinely hopeful. I thought that season 3 may have just laid the groundwork for the potential for this show to bloom into something genuinely good in terms of story. I had hope.All in all, most of season 3 was pretty much as good as season 1 which quite a few people can enjoy. To the few people who somehow miraculously discover this review from a newbie at anime reviewing, give the whole thing a chance. If you were turned away because of how little improved, at least watch to the final episode, it was definitely really enjoyable and worth watching the first 11 episodes for. There is hope for this series which I've decided to put my heart into watching. of enjoyment for me.

The way Bell reacted to the end of his battle, the way Hermes and Freya spoke, everything seemed to imply some more going to happen. Unlike the implications at the ends of seasons 1 and 2, this was an implication that was hopeful for me, genuinely hopeful. I thought that season 3 may have just laid the groundwork for the potential for this show to bloom into something genuinely good in terms of story. I had hope.All in all, most of season 3 was pretty much as good as season 1 which quite a few people can enjoy. To the few people who somehow miraculously discover this review from a newbie at anime reviewing, give the whole thing a chance. If you were turned away because of how little improved, at least watch to the final episode, it was definitely really enjoyable and worth watching the first 11 episodes for. There is hope for this series which I've decided to put my heart into watching."", 'Season 3 in the first episode has more fan-service than any other season. Despite that, it seems to have more direction already. It looks cleaner, it seems to know what it wants to tell. Other than that, the third season is noticeably more gory. I think my least favorite thing about this season is the monster noises. Every monster sounds the same and it gets really irritating to listen to them all “make noises.” I gave the third season an 8 (Very Good), because it really seemed to be less like a harem than previous seasons and more like a story about a found-family finding...themselves again after being split up by horrible people. themselves again after being split up by horrible people.', 'This season is much better than the second, but the chance of season 4 continuing on that thread seems slim.Season 3 does a great job of introducing new characters, adding interesting context and lore to the show, and has great animations and memorable fights. However, it still falls into some trappings of the previous seasons, has a few groan worthy cliches, and it can’t quite shake the feeling that all of this is leading to nowhere.The end of the season effectively takes Bell back to the status quo from the start of the season, and there’s little reason to think season 4 will...build off of anything that’s happened here. The previous seasons have felt like siloed shows, and this one is no different. That’s a shame as there really is an interesting kernel here that just needs some wings and an overarching goal that’s relevant in some way to the things happening on screen.

Second season was trash! Way too focused on romantic relationships and tried to develop something so weird in the genre, that trew me off a bit. This third season i felt it kinda went back to the tracks, got action that was even better than the first season but still tried to pervert people too much and focus on how cute is the protagonist.That being said, the new elements introduced to the history, the better coverage of the dungeon itself...and it's monsters and the amazing development of side characters made the show great again.

The overall dilemma that is presented this season is something that will resonate with many people and will keep you gripped throughout.Thankfully, the twists and turns in the story still remain the same, which only reinforces the main issue this season wants to convey. As a manga only reader, this keeps me on for more seasons to come and boredom with the same tropes and twists don't deter me if the story presents a new issue with every season.I do have some issues with this season, but mainly with the show...overall, is that the characters motivation for doing certain things lack substance and I often feel they are not fleshed out enough. However, it does not distract too much from the overall theme of the season.Overall, I think people who were waiting on this third season, should definitely start watching now - you are in for a roller coaster ride. overall, is that the characters motivation for doing certain things lack substance and I often feel they are not fleshed out enough.

It's an good anime, but it could be better"", ""This review hopefully provides a small framework of how the show has developed over three seasons and a bit of insight of how I feel it fared. To note, this is my first review so I am sorry if it is horrific.When I first began watching the series, it was simply to fill the gap between other shows. SAO became dull and repetitive, I had finished a number of other shows I had started and AOT (which is my regular go-to) was on its lovely hiatus, so why not find something new to watch. After browsing my Hulu recommendations, I came upon Dan Machi....The art style was colorful and eye-catching and the abstract piqued my interests so I figured it was at least worth my time to pursue.Season One provides a simple introduction to this story and in the end, does a great job at providing a foundation for which the series can grow. Throughout the episodes, you are introduced to your main character, Bell Cranel, and given a decent amount of backstory for how he got to where he is now. Additionally, you get to meet a number of different gods, whom are named after their corresponding mythological god and learn of the families (called Familia) they have created in this land. Oh, and what land is this? Otario, home of adventurers of all shapes and sizes (and species!) who have come to gain power and glory by fighting monsters in the dungeons below the city. To put it short, you mainly focus on Bell's growth as an adventurer and how he dreams to become a hero. Additionally, we begin to investigate the origin of the dungeon and what is holds within its depths. To some, this may seem like a very weak plotline but to me, its simply entertaining. The action of the dungeons combined with stunning art and sounds help to keep you engaged while to move from episode to episode. The writers don't provide much in regards to in-depth plot but leave plenty of open doors to pursue in later seasons. But in my opinion, its good writing as it allows the show to continue telling a story across multiple seasons rather than repeating the same story over and over again [cough cough, SAO]. Overall rating: Great, I can't wait to see where this goes!In comes Season Two, which should have been the perfect place to continue building upon the plot laid out in season one and provide more character backstories. Instead, you are given very little dialog and are left dragging along with the cliffhangers provided by the first season. To open the season, J.C. Staff does a decent job of summarizing what has happened in the first season. The following few episodes then provide a little more background on some side characters, you get to see the political squabblings of the gods, and all of it is laced with more action and drama. Then, the plot drops off and we are oddly introduced to a Familia of Amazonian prostitutes and a very important fox girl prisoner. And when I say important, I don't mean in any way important to the storyline.... Just the Amazonians and their god's personal grudges. Where this turning point comes from is beside me but someone must have felt it was important to bring to the screen. I feel going into detail isn't necessary as it provides little material for the underlying plot so lets just leave it at this. As anyone could expect, our main character plays the hero and the season ends on a very safe note. Sure, you are provided with a few minor details on the behind-the-scenes workings of the world but all in all, there just isn't anything substantial that comes out of it all. So what's the point. I really don't know but somehow, I still wanted more. The art, the drama, the action, it was all beautifully played out regardless of its pertinence and in contrast to other anime, the fights didn't seem like the same thing over and over again. There was always a purpose, always a reason and it wasn't just to create action scenes. So yet again, I am left asking the same questions: why are things happening they way they are, who is really controlling all of this and what is the end game? Overall rating: Good, but you may be starting to lose me.So here we are folks, here's Season Three. We have met a number of different characters, gotten a bit more backstory on what out main character is pursuing and have even gotten a few glimpses of something bigger that's going on behind the scenes. Season two turned out to be something I couldn't have predicted and at this point, I am just aching to find out what is going on. So what in the world are we going to see now? Introducing.... sentient monsters.... Along with learning who the controlling figures are in the world, you also learn that besides trying to control the destiny of your main character, some of them also know about monsters that are gaining thoughts and feelings. Instead of just saying fine and investigating, our main characters new pursuit is to find these monsters and somehow welcome them into society. If there is anything I've learned from every other show that's tried this, its that that wont be that easy. So here comes the action packed battle of those who want to protect the monsters and those who only see them as monsters. Through twists and turns, we end the season with another random side story and have been teased with just a little more information of what's truly going on in the world. I understand the anime is based off of the manga and the manga alone is doing well, but at some point you need to look at what you are creating and think about how that will translate to your viewers interests. As I have repeatedly said, the art, the action and idea of the show are beautiful, but they are too simple to maintain your attention for 5 years alone. All you could hope for is substance and instead, we get another random wrench in the story that distracts you from the overall plot. Overall rating: ???????In the end, I love this show. It is incredibly simple in regards to the story but provides stunning art, plenty of action and enough foreshadowing that keeps you tied in. Frustrating as it may be to be teased with what is going on behind the scenes, there really is enough to keep you interested and sometimes, that is all you need from a show. Many people are looking for the next best thing and a story that is going to change anime or TV for the future, but there isn't anything wrong with shows that just present another adventure. If you are looking for something to watch, I would give Dan Machi a shot. The series has an overall rating of 7 so it definitely has something going for it that many people enjoy. Thanks for reading!

I often found myself tapping the right arrow key to skip past scenes that felt like the writers raided my grandmothers kitchen for old worn out cookie cutters. because that's what the new characters and story arc are for this season is for the most part; just paint by numbers levels of character dimension and story beats. "", ""Going into this season with zero expectations (after what happened with the second season), I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Not wowed by any means, just happy it was average. Let's get right into the anime basics.Story; In the misty dungeon, you see a girl running away from a bunch of adventures. With luck on Bell's side, he runs right into her. Being a little conscious at first because she's no regular girl and is actually a Monster known as a Vouivre, he hesitates to help her help. But Bell could never leave a defenceless girl, covered in wounds and blood all alone to...be attacked and chased by adventures. He covers he up, and sneaks her back into Orario where his Familia hesitantly takes her in, and slowly warms up to her. She gains knowledge from the human world, learns what the sun feels like and even gains the name Wiene. Although every day seemed happy, it couldn't last forever because humans, monsters and gods were never meant to get along. See whats happens when Wiene wants to be excepted into society, what the Hestia Familia will have to do to protect her and realize that not everyone is as nice as the originally seemed. Art; It was interesting to see all the different types of monsters, how they lived and the battles they had to face with the humans. Sound; The OST was cute this season, the ending song always left me with a happy feeling. Characters; It was easy to love the cast this season. You got to see all the good sides of the main cast (excluding Lili and Hermes...), and gained a new character to love.Overall, this season didn't shock me in anyways. It made me happy, sad and all the basic emotions at times. I was a little disappointed with a certain character during the last two episodes (I wasn't expecting it, and It won't give any character development for the next seasons to come (from my perspective anyway)). I'm ready for the fourth season to come out this year, but I've learned to not get my hopes up. So far nothing will surpass the first season, and I've been turned off from attempting to read the manga/light-novel. be attacked and chased by adventures.

The concept of adventurers getting stronger by killing monsters and monsters getting stronger by killing adventurers was too simple of a concept so they had to give us this 12 episode drawn out lecture all because a tiny minority of monsters are sentient. Its reasonable to not like monsters because it should be common sense to not like them, they have killed a lot of people and because a few are ""good and are sentient"" does not change that fact. This season goes well out of its...way to demonize adventurers and make them look evil which is a startling contrast to season 1 where they were all mindlessly slaying monsters before.While in season 1 Bell had to work to earn his wins, in this season he wins because plot makes it so and because he ""believes"" he can win and thats good enough. I know a lot of animes have the main guy do his speeches but with Bell its ridiculous, its like hes using talking no jutsu to beat his enemies instead of fighting them. It feels like hes trying to speech check his way through fights like its some kind of D&D match except his charisma is too low and he fails it every time.Infuriatingly this is now the second season in a row where our mouthy hero Bell Cranel has had no development and has not gotten stronger, the only thing that has grown is his harem and its now expanded to a catalog of over 10 girls.

As if this show didn\'t make me groan in agony enough watching it, it decides to flip the audience the bird by going ""oh hey, you want to see Bell develop and get stronger? well you are going to have to wait til next season stupid""', ""Danmachi is an example of a series where it's impact didn't match it's hype. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it still has some kind of charm that draws you in and wanting to see what happens next.While the concept of danmachi is interesting this season focuses on a more intense topic of the danmachi universe. However the story felt mediocre, like the story was kind of not thought all the way through. What the story fails massively at was the lack of consequences our characters suffer through. Our main character makes this choices so quickly without thought, never reflecting on the worst...case scenario. It doesn't make a story interesting when the tension and all the build up for it is gone and also missed opportunity for character development. Something big happens in the climax of this season while fans will find it a miracle. I see it as cheap shock value. It's a very bad of a decision that was on the author's part.Characters are still bland as they come. Bell the boy scout and hero of our story didn't seem to change at all throughout these events. He's still a wimpy generic MC and by now through all these things he's been through is just annoying for his character. While at the same time he's still being drooled over by many women that are constantly being added unnecessarily to his harem. Hestia who doesn't appear much in this season still can't avoid the boob shots and butt shots from JC Staff. The other characters are ..... fine? there's just nothing that really makes them stand out because of how poorly focused and fleshed out they've been to make me even care. It makes it more like they're there to give Bell a helping hand.The art and sounds are were the anime is at it's strongest. Danmachi has a wide range of talented VAs and sound design. However in the animation department you can see where the animation was iffy and just alot of still images. One episode there was barely any movement, it's just still frames or moving heads. The fight scenes are ok as well but some of them happen off camera or the frames skip.In the end the show didn't live up to it's expectations and got drowned out by other anime shows from this season that did much better on what danmachi fails on. case scenario.

It\'s basically the same old thing as the other seasons were, but a little bit better in my opinion.After a pretty bad S2 i was hopping into S3 with little to zero expectations, just to waste those 20 minutes once a week.It came out resulting probably the best Danmachi season so far ( it\'s not a great accomplishement considering which series we are talking about, but it\'s an improvement ) even if it\'s still full of problems.STORY: 6The plot is not...even that bad, i see what they tried to do here, but the realization feels flat and lackluster.Basically Bell saves this monster that was being attacked by some adventurers and brings her into the Hestia Familia\'s mansion. They later give her the name ""Wiene"".She can properly talk and have feelings like a human but she\'s still biologically a monster.Later on Bell and crew discover that Wiene is not the only entity able to speak and feels emotions, there are a lot of other monsters like her and they are called ""Xenos""; they live hiding in the dungeon while being supported by the guild.Bell makes friends with them pretty fast and suddenly realize that humans and monster are no different and feels regret for all the monters he killed through his life.These Xenos have the dream to be able to go outside the dungeon.Long story short they manage to escape from the dungeon but in a violent way with the result being that the people are afraid of them and hating them even more than before and a lot of adventurers are in charge to kill them.That\'s where one of the biggest flaws of the show is: these creatures managed to escape the dungeon, they can properly talk and have a conciusness but still can\'t manage to even say ""ah"" in front of anywone who isn\'t from Bell\'s squad... Obviously being able to speak is a huge matter since they could be able to interact at the same level with humans but no. they prefer to remain with their mouths shut for absolutely no reason. So basically from episode 6/7 onward the plot just keeps feeling forced and badly writtenART: 5Danmachi is a thing since 2015 but it feels it\'s a show from 2005 and i swear to god i don\'t see ANY improvements on the technical side of things. The drowings are not really that detailed even in close-ups shots; the background drowings are even worse ( ehi, at least they\'re not CG ).The lighting and the shadows are basically not existent.The animation feels, for whatever reason, like it\'s lagging or something: 10 second before you have a fluid and smooth transition, 10 second later you have like a 6 FPS poorly drawn pile of pixels.In the whole series i haven\'t noticed even a slight increase of the standard quality of animation, zero sakuga, zero dynamic camera angles, zero remarkable special effects... nothing.And it\'s not like JC Staff isn\'t good enough to provide them; just last season they had Railgun that was a lot above avarage in term of artistic quality.Sound: 5Other that the sound effect of dying monsters there\'s literally nothing remarkable in this category. Not a single memorable OST and the other sounds/musics are just pure avarage.I guess the voice acting in good, at least.Opening/Ending are irrelevant for my judgementCHARACTERS: 6Danmachi is not really famous for his legendary characters ( outside for Hestia that, let\'s be real, is just a busty loli whit a mild personality ) and this season doesn\'t really change the game.The old characters have pratically zero character development, despide all the ""shit"" that happens; the new characters feel like they are relevant just for this season and will be easily forgotten in the next ones so they\'re not really that interesting.The only character that has his good moments is Bell. You can feel the internal conflict he\'s going through being the bridge between humans and monsters, between good and bad, between predators and preys. He tries his best but realizes for the first time that, no matter what he does, every decision will make someone happier and someone sadder.The way he stands before the transformed Wiene in front of the whole Loki Familia was a good moment, not gonna lieENJOYMENT: 6We all know that Danmachi is not a masterpiece nor a great piece of animation, but it\'s still somehow decently entertaining. The fantasy setting isn\'t even a favorite of mine but it never made me think ""i\'m dropping this shit"". Despite all the cons it\'s still enjoyable.Being 20 minutes once a week or a binge session, time flies when i watch Danmachi and i don\'t even know why or how.The only thing that keeps me from giving 7 on this aspect is that the power, lvl and stats system is still a mystery that has been poorly explained in S1 and never touched again after; If you set a show in a world where characteristics are the key and you don\'t focus on them you are missing the point.OVERALL: 6Danmaci is a light series, there\'s no need to be too harsh on it since it\'s not ""pretentious"" in the first place.If you can just shut down your brain for a bit without being too critical you can have good time.As i said i actually think this third season is the best among the three so overall i enjoyed this ride.PS: SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH ^.^ even that bad, i see what they tried to do here, but the realization feels flat and lackluster.Basically Bell saves this monster that was being attacked by some adventurers and brings her into the Hestia Familia\'s mansion.

I was going to truly drop this if it wasn't for the fact that I've been watching since it came out. The ONLY good thing, and that kind of saves a little this season is how they took a core narrative element from the first season and integrated it in the form of re-match at the last chapter to show how the main character is in a different place now, coherently showing it in the result of the match. That is all....They had something really interesting as a central ethic and moral dilemma but... nothing comes out of it, or perhaps the fact that nothing can really change, which is surprisingly not manichean for a show like this, but the way they handled it... not good.

His stat and equipment and the like. This season didn't have any of that, and just had a rather predictable (not that predictable is always bad) and generic moralist story. Ais Wallenstein has been rendered completely unlikable too, which really sucks because her and her relationship with Bell was built up so much. Anyway, I wasn't really a fan of this season. There was a kind of interesting b-plot running throughout it surrounding Daedalus, but it felt abandoned towards the end for...the sake of a much less interesting plot about Wiene. the sake of a much less interesting plot about Wiene."", 'I’m just going to run through each aspect then give a conclusion/tl:dr.Story: the story of Dungeon is sour to the taste. Something about it doesn’t sit right with me. Other seasons never bothered me but this one had so much weird twisting to it. It gave me a feeling of “wowowowowo, another plot twist”. If you’ve read a bad mystery book you know the feeling.Art: Banging. Only word to describe. I only caught myself twice thinking: “wow that looks dumb”. I don’t know how many times I went: “HOLY CRAP THE TAKEDOWN!” During fight scenes. Just generally sweet fight scenes and all the girls...“big personalities” are drawn well but not annoyingly horny animators style. Only complaint is that op spoils too much and without spoiling myself why don’t some mouths move when they talk.Sound: BANGING! Loved it. Sweet. The roars of monsters and the clashing of swords never sounded better. You can hear the impact and I love it.Music: mediocre. Never cringed at it but like, never vibed to it.Character: out of all the character I only felt that gros actually changed. The rest didn’t feel like they did anything and bell effectively reverted back to his post season 1 stage. but now like a bodybuilder he’s moved past impressing girls but instead is wanting to beat his rival in (god please no) season 4.Enjoyment: the pacing was pretty terrible. And although the good comes with the bad and the bad with the good, there was way more bad. Fight scenes and a few other superb scenes are the only ones that were really enjoyable. Some episodes I left with the thought “this was a good anime, rip”. It just wasn’t enjoyable most the time.Conclusion: although the last episode was clearly hinting at another season I felt this season and any more to come are unnecessary. Let’s this anime die peacefully. Because if that doesn’t happen it’s corpse might get damaged being stuffed into its grave(think new Star Wars trilogy). “big personalities” are drawn well but not annoyingly horny animators style.

The structure of the plot and scenes, as well as the result of the events. I understand what this season was getting at and this could have been interesting. Unfortunately, the writing style is just dull, lacking in originality and deterring.The season dealt with an important topic.""When does a boundary between monsters and humans begin"" and this was understood subtly. Unfortunately, little effort has been made to...get this whole plot going. The episodes just ran, the story happened, and you had a final battle.What surprised me, however, was the actual final battle that season. Not only was it dynamic and visually handsome, but in some ways unexpected.However, this season also had some characteristic highlights. On the part of Bell and the new female protagonist. Most of the supporting characters have largely been meaningless after doing their part on the right or wrong issue.On the part of the plot you got at least slight hints about the dungeon and the possible roles of some key characters. The monster hunt was still in the foreground.The intro was average. I noticed positively the increase in the Osts and the quality.In terms of animation, it mostly felt like season 1 and apart from the final fight there was nothing remarkable.The biggest problem with Danmachi is that the series isn\'t bad for the most part. Had someone more capable sat down on this story, we would definitely have gotten an interesting ""Adventure"" title.Unfortunately, the quality is not convincing in the least. At least the final season achieved every claim to be considered average. I personally liked this season, but it hurt me as well. get this whole plot going.

Bell doesn't really have anything much going for him, and surrounding him by attractive women does not make him an interesting character but rather just hammers home that mediocrity. The women themselves are also very basic archetypes with nothing much going for them, which doesn't help. The plot this season focuses on dungeon monsters who can speak and are more like humans, with one in the form of a young girl of course attaching herself to Bell and leading him to declare himself on the side of the monsters because of bloody...course it happens that way.

Honestly, I was just kind of bored with this whole thing."", 'The most recent venture into the dungeon with DanMachi Season 3 has managed to accomplish nothing over twelve episodes and more than two months -- the whole season is filler through and through. Season 3 is plagued with the worst of the prior seasons, with none of the heart or character moments to make up for it. Simply put, season 3 was a disappointment.Warning: There will be some minor spoilers discussed in this review.-Story-Bell Cranel, the hero of DanMachi, has his world turned upside down when he rescues a vouivre -- a human-like monster with the ability to speak. After taking the creature home...and giving her a name (Weine), Bell and the Hestia Familia learn she is not only capable of speech but all the same emotions as themselves. Over the season they befriend a whole community of sentient monsters in The Dungeon, who are hoping to live a peaceful life away from the threat of adventurers. With this new knowledge, Bell realizes he can no longer kill monsters indiscriminately like he had before -- but not everyone sees it this way. There are people who refuse to see humanity in these monsters, and they have Bell and Wiene in their sights.As is, this is not a bad concept for a story -- taking something that was previously clear cut to the characters and adding some gray area. It\'s clear Bell struggles with this new information; he knows he can\'t decide the value of another life so similar to his, but the monsters in the dungeon are still a threat. There\'s a lot of conflict built-in to this plot; it\'s nigh impossible for monsters and adventurers to co-exist no matter how hard the Hestia Familia tries, or how many minds they try to change. Ideologies clash and Bell has to stick to his beliefs as allies turn against him.Unfortunately, in practice it isn\'t as dramatic. With little convincing, Hestia and the rest of the Familia support Bell\'s choice to harbor Wiene and welcome her as one of their own. The Ikelos Familia -- the group of poachers who had been hunting monsters like Wiene -- are shown to be utterly deplorable, with no redeemable beliefs or qualities. This may be a clash of ideologies, but the Ikelos Familia do nothing to deserve viewer support or sympathy. This is done best with the Loki Familia, who are understandable in their drive to keep monsters out of the surface world, and put down the ""uprising"" shown in the final episodes. By the time the credits roll on the final episode, however, this leaves little impact on the characters or the world of DanMachi.-Characters-The characters in this arc are the clearest evidence that this season was filler. Wiene, the inciting actor in this drama, is quickly reduced to another name in Bell\'s harem. She\'s a loli trope who clings to Bell like a younger sister, who\'s motivations are centered around what would make Bell happy, what Bell would do, how to be closer to Bell. In fact, it\'s this way for all of the once colorful cast of heroes in the Hestia Familia, including the goddess herself. Instead of acting of their own volition, every single character takes part in an echo chamber to support every one of Bell\'s decisions. Even Hestia, who clearly has concerns about bringing a monster to the surface world, only shares smiles and nods with Bell when he plans anything. A plot that was ripe with conflict and development becomes barren as even Bell\'s closest allies don\'t even hesitate against him.On the other hand, there\'s Ais Wallenstein -- a character who has goals in very clear opposition to Bell. It sounds like a fantastic setup: as part of the Loki Familia, Ais wants to kill all monsters (on the surface or otherwise) in order to protect the city, become more powerful, and maintain her Familia\'s impressive status. All reasons why she and Bell would clash, heightened by the personal friendship/mentorship they share. Bell\'s accelerated growth (the Liaris Freese skill) is based on his feelings for the blond sword master, so a threat to their relationship could jeopardize his growth or entire adventuring career. So much interesting is going on here, but of course falls flat by the end. While the pair do have an impressive fight near the end, Ais eventually sees things Bell\'s way (like everyone in his social circle) and by the time the season is over the status quo has returned. The Liaris Freese skill is never mentioned, and they are shown training together again. No lasting impact was done on their relationship, and the pair end the season just like they were at the beginning.The same thing happens to Wiene. The most important thing to Bell all season, the reason he put himself and his familia at risk, is brushed away by the end and moved to an unidentified location within the dungeon. The relationship between Bell and Wiene ends the season exactly how it was before the season: like she wasn\'t there at all. That\'s filler, where ""nothing of value was gained or lost.""-Art and Sound-Like the other entries in the series, season 3 brings competent animation to the table. Despite being explored over three seasons and a spin-off series, the Dungeon always looks exciting. New floors look unique and old ones keep consistent. I appreciate being able to look at a floor and recognize it from past adventures -- it buildings the geography of the world and makes it feel real and explorable. While there is nothing jaw-dropping to see in Season 3, the animators employ some interesting camera shots to make basic scenes a little more exciting. The conflict of the story lends itself to some meaningful fights, and the animation keeps up. These battles driven by emotions were easily the best part of the season, and the voice actors amplify that tenfold. When the characters are given the opportunity to act, their faces do well conveying their feelings, and the voice artists know what to do to get that same feeling from you.The worst part to me, was how much I wanted this to be good. Every episode I started thinking ""this will be the one where it gets good"" and it would finally all come together. Then everything would happen like I laid about above and disappointed me, but I still got sucked in. Twenty minutes later they\'d end with just enough of a cliff-hanger, just enough thrill, that I\'d start the cycle all over again the following week. In the final week, the season ended and I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me; it never got better, and it never paid off. Thinking back, so much happened in seasons one and two, the story covered so much ground. Instead, it opts to get in Bell\'s way and keep him planted where he started -- and no growth is a fatal sin for any adventurer. and giving her a name (Weine), Bell and the Hestia Familia learn she is not only capable of speech but all the same emotions as themselves.

Instead, it opts to get in Bell\'s way and keep him planted where he started -- and no growth is a fatal sin for any adventurer.', 'tl;dr a social commentary little mermaid story but its only shonen qualityThis will probably contain spoilers.I have not read the manga, but am a fan of this anime series and its characters regardless of the various failings both have. However, I was not impressed by S2 and certainly not by this season. It\'s deviated further from the original idea of a boy-becomes-hero and monster slaying, and I frankly have no clue where it can logically go from here.The issue with this season is rooted in its premise. In introducing sentient monsters, the creators have attempted to introduce a new level of depth to consider. Yet...while the understanding that your enemies are not truly ""monsters"" is valuable and indeed commendable in reality and realistic media, social commentary in anime is difficult to do well and unpalatable when done poorly. At no time during this anime did the viewer feel truly empathetic to the monster\'s cause beyond a heavy-handed ""look at the monsters suffering now feel bad."" Twelve episodes is simply not enough time to properly explore this idea without giving off a feeling of hurried artifice and it is this feeling that detracts the most from enjoying this season.I will not say that there weren\'t poignant or memorable moments, especially in the latter half of the season, but as a whole this season did not live up to expectations, and I hope for a return to more of the feel of previous seasons. while the understanding that your enemies are not truly ""monsters"" is valuable and indeed commendable in reality and realistic media, social commentary in anime is difficult to do well and unpalatable when done poorly.

Honestly the show was trying its best present the viewer with a commentary on inequality. Sadly it falls short on this for me. Why? Because of Bel, in this power fantasy isekai there is never any doubt the MC will come out on top. He will always have higher ground morally and just has to talk to get to be right on most occasions. The message the creator was trying to gets overshadowed by what is convenient to the plot. This...is what made me dislike this season there was potential but it was squandered.Spoilers on characters ahead.Some of the characters were even more unlikable this season for me it was the glorified pack mule. While initially having a valid reason to act the way she did it get thrown away because like every female character they want their bell rung by Mr. Cranel. Therefore the loli vampire had to feel her pack mule wrath. The villans could not get any more generic and were disposed of as easily as the message that the anime was delivering. At least I got to see Bel get clapped.AnimationThey didnt bother to animate some of the characters speak.In the end I knew what I was getting into watching a power fantasy. Still I had some expectations when it came to the premise this season presented. Sadly Bel has to always be Jesus and be in the right and everything was resolved accordingly to what benefits him the most. is what made me dislike this season there was potential but it was squandered.Spoilers on characters ahead.Some of the characters were even more unlikable this season for me it was the glorified pack mule.

In the first two seasons, we saw something different not completely world-breaking but it wasn\'t cliche either it was a balance of almost there just needs a bit of a push. They should have added another season between seasons two and three to really bring it together.They executed this really poorly though. In the first two seasons, there was a lot of harem stuff going on and that has its own charm but it looked like the writers were trying to branch out more into...the adventure/fantasy categories. While this isn\'t a bad idea to keep the anime going they also wanted to keep the harem scene going so it ended up just being a pile of harem adventure mix which was very overbearing.

I\'m sure everyone agrees that it\'s nice when an anime has good plot twists, the plot twist you see in is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon you can see from a mile away, they are very basic and seen a million times before.There is one main reason that I rated this season a six instead of a five and that because of the characters/character development.

There is so little that changes things that the whole season is merely a stale rehash of the same dungeoneering tropes. It's not about the intrigue of gods about Bell and the narrative that should be story changing about the monsters and...the social hostility and history towards them is just so weak that it really sucks the soul out of the season. The melodrama is high, the climax highpoints are low. There is little wonder introduced and it is frustrating seeing everyone behave as one handed sidekicks.While narrative, sound, and plot structure aren't broken and it could certainly be worse, it does little to be good.

Grappler Baki (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/287/Grappler_Baki_TV,"['This is an anime everybody should see. The story may not be as deep as keshin or love hina but still this is a good anime. If you ever want to see a cool anime give this one a try. It may seem like a bad anime at first but it is sort of like the anime berserker. You will defintely want to see more. An anime with figting scenes all the and a nice story line. What more can you ask for. Yeah!!! ', 'The synopsis of ""Grappler Baki"" couldn\'t be more boring and unoriginal; a teenager seeks to become the most powerful fighter in the world.However, the execution of this hackneyed concept is what\'s extraordinary.For starters, there are hardly any monologues or emotional flashbacks, and absolutely no cute, ""funny"" scenes of the main character being hit by a girl. Instead, each episode is filled with brutal, highly entertaining fights, most of them featuring the hero, Baki, getting the absolute piss beaten out of him.Getting multiple bones shattered, having one\'s ankle exploded, one\'s eye nerves severed, being thrown out of a window on the third floor, swallowing glass, having...one\'s mouth torn apart by a giant beast-ape, being hung execution-style by a rope, or having one\'s bloody, unconscious face repeatedly stomped by a fist or foot are all a part of a typical episode for Baki.Most appropriately, there is almost a complete lack of ""good"" and ""evil"" in this series; every character (with the possible exception of Yujiro), even the most brutal and dirty, is shown to have a good, friendly, honorable side, and similarly, even Baki has a vicious, uncomprising part to his personality.In a comical but oddly appropriate twist, Baki befriends the Yasha Ape whose eye he gouged out and which almost tore his mouth off, or Yakuza boss Hanayama, who almost killed him on several occasions.In fact, he becomes friends with almost everyone he fights in the series, showing that these fights are simply the tool for him becoming better and stronger, not the product of his desire for violence.Thus, on a pure entertainment level, the series is great; gritty fights featuring original attacks, unique fighting styles, and non-stop action mixed with a peculiar sense of humor.With all that said, ""Grappler Baki"" works on a deeper level also.While the show revolves around fighting, it\'s really a metaphor for the struggle and sacrifice anyone faces in achieving the absolute pinnacle in their field of interest.Through Baki\'s non-stop training, fighting, and overzealous desire to improve at the risk of his own life, the hero is someone that a viewer can emphasize with, as he attains his ability more through practice and physical sacrifice than natural ability.Despite all this, Baki is repeatedly beaten down by his invincible father Yujiro, the king of fighters. Thus, rather than being a simple story of a fighter\'s rise to the top, it\'s the story of a typical human giving everything to achieving his goals, succeeding, but ultimately, not being able to fulfill his greatest desire.In addition to this, there are a number of refreshing ""real"" aspects for an action anime here, such as the lack of female fighters, and the ""dirty tactics"" (biting, eye-gouging, kicks to the groin, attacks from behind) that every single fighter utilizes, including Baki. (Once again obliterating the ""good"" and ""evil"" that so many animes rely upon)Finally, another reason I love this series so dearly are the unforgettable characters; while Baki is a unique, macho badass in his own right, Orocho Doppi and Karou Hanayama are some of the most unique, likeable, and downright cool characters in any anime ever.This can be extended to most of the characters on the show too; they all have their own quirks, sense of humor, fighting styles, and contrasting outlooks on life.This feels a lot different than most animes, where there are essentially only two or three character prototypes which everyone is modeled upon.Thus, Grappler Baki is not only a great series for anyone who enjoys fighting and combat, but anyone who wants to see something different and unexpected in an anime. one\'s mouth torn apart by a giant beast-ape, being hung execution-style by a rope, or having one\'s bloody, unconscious face repeatedly stomped by a fist or foot are all a part of a typical episode for Baki.Most appropriately, there is almost a complete lack of ""good"" and ""evil"" in this series; every character (with the possible exception of Yujiro), even the most brutal and dirty, is shown to have a good, friendly, honorable side, and similarly, even Baki has a vicious, uncomprising part to his personality.In a comical but oddly appropriate twist, Baki befriends the Yasha Ape whose eye he gouged out and which almost tore his mouth off, or Yakuza boss Hanayama, who almost killed him on several occasions.In fact, he becomes friends with almost everyone he fights in the series, showing that these fights are simply the tool for him becoming better and stronger, not the product of his desire for violence.Thus, on a pure entertainment level, the series is great; gritty fights featuring original attacks, unique fighting styles, and non-stop action mixed with a peculiar sense of humor.With all that said, ""Grappler Baki"" works on a deeper level also.While the show revolves around fighting, it\'s really a metaphor for the struggle and sacrifice anyone faces in achieving the absolute pinnacle in their field of interest.Through Baki\'s non-stop training, fighting, and overzealous desire to improve at the risk of his own life, the hero is someone that a viewer can emphasize with, as he attains his ability more through practice and physical sacrifice than natural ability.Despite all this, Baki is repeatedly beaten down by his invincible father Yujiro, the king of fighters.

They are people that are portrayed with reasons of what they do. And what&rsquo;s also good about this anime is that it&rsquo;s very fast pace. You can watch like 4 episode and you feel like maybe 15 to 20 minutes have passed by. But what I really didn&rsquo;t like is in the last 45% of the season with the time skip,...some of the characters like the cop that was watching Baki and Emi&rsquo;s assistant who also watched over him are now written out and I thought they had very significant roles.With the art, I really like the character design a lot. Especially 13 year old Baki. He has this cut physique and yet he does have an innocent look to his face. Especially the eyes which I like about it. But what&rsquo;s disappointing is that Baki&rsquo;s scars from the oav are not at all drawn in this version though they are briefly talked about in the anime itself. And Yujiro comes across as a clone of the mixed genes of MMA juggernaut Fedor, Violence Jack, and Brolly from DBZ. And the other characters who come in later on in this anime are based on real martial artists and pro wrestlers such as Mas Oyama, the founder of Kyokushinkai karate, Japanese pro wrestling legends Giant Baba and Antonio Inoki, and Jiujitsu legend Rickson Gracie. So martial arts enthusiasts should be able to love this for those influences alone.Once again, before I get into talking about the fights, I will protest the use and definition of the word grappler and how I felt it doesn&rsquo;t at all apply to a majority of the fights and Baki&rsquo;s fighting style, which looks like a mix between Shotokan Karate and Muay Thai like you see in the movie Kickboxer with Van Damme. I don&rsquo;t like how there is very limited emphasis on grappling. But every now and then, we&rsquo;ll see a rear naked choke that does little to no damage, and an arm bar attempt which does nothing as well, and typical wrestling suplexes. But there is the Hanayama character who grips the person&rsquo;s arm and destroys their bicep and blood vessels which I think is a bizarre move and is nothing more than a fictional Indian burn. But I would like to see techniques like the omoplata, the triangle choke, and the guillotine choke.I think if a true grappling element was implemented than it would be more exiting in my point of view. I practice grappling arts and striking arts. I have black belts in judo and in Tae Kwon Do, and I currently practice kickboxing, brazilian jiujitsu, and mixed martial arts, and there are times I&rsquo;ve seen in the fights of this anime that I think true grappling you see in brazilian jiujitsu, kousen judo, and in catch wrestling could have applied. I think seeing an effective submission is just as fun as watching a KO punch or kick, or a vaporizing kamehameha.But other criticisms people may have it how crazy these people can take pain. I swear, to do half of the crap they&rsquo;re doing, you got to take serious steroids, PCP or some performance enhancer. Since the characters are not fighting in officially sanctioned bouts, they are free to take such drugs. Yujiro probably took serious roids and PCP. Hell, Nick Diaz beat Pride lightweight champion with a beautiful gogoplata while testing off the charts on weed. The closest I can back up this assumption to some extent is when Baki fights Gaea. Who can manipulate his own adrenaline. Which is bizarre but I guess that&rsquo;s a cool concept. He brings new definition to adrenaline junky.The music I really like in this one. The opening them Ai Belive and I forgot the name of the ending theme are really cool in my point of view. I think the style and execution of the songs fit more for Initial D, another favorite anime of mine with one of my favorite soundtracks, but I think it&rsquo;s enough to represent the fast pace and explosive nature of Grappler Baki as well. The background music itself also invokes and entices the mood and really pulls you into it. Some of the tracks reminds me of an old school Virtua Fighter game which makes it cool in that kind of way, I guess.The dub is ok. I think it has intensity but I don&rsquo;t think it compares to the Japanese version at all. Surprisingly, despite how awesome the Japanese cast is, there are little to no big names in the Japanese version. The only big name I could recognize is of course Baki&rsquo;s seiyuu, Kikuchi Masami, who is most known to some of you as Tenchi from Tenchi Muyo, and Keiichi from Ah My Goddess. I think this gives Kikuchi a different kind of approach to his other characters that are losers, while this time his character has a tough exterior with a soft heart and I think he portrays that very convincingly where you feel his character.OK to conclude my review, I&rsquo;ll get back into the subject of drugs and fighting. In case some of you don&rsquo;t know, 10th Planet Jiujitsu chief instructor and my cousin&rsquo;s instructor Eddie Bravo, who beat reigning Abu Dhabi champion Royler Gracie in the 2003 quarter finals happens to be a marijuana advocate and he&rsquo;s the reason why Fear Factor host and UFC commentator Joe Rogan is also a weed dude. He claimed he invented his techniques such as his rubber guard while under the influence. Considering Nick Diaz&rsquo;s victory over Gomi, I am starting to believe him, but in no ways am I advocating the use of drugs, nor am I consider taking up drugs. I just say after watching this anime, I am starting to reconsider how these guys fight like crazy ass mofoss. But putting that aside, I strongly recommend this anime despite my criticisms of it based on my passion and experience with the martial arts today thanks to MMA. It is high paced, explosive, has drama, and an excellent cast of characters. If you love extreme brutal action, then this is foryou. some of the characters like the cop that was watching Baki and Emi&rsquo;s assistant who also watched over him are now written out and I thought they had very significant roles.With the art, I really like the character design a lot.

All these characters make up the base of Baki the grappler. But lets not forget our favourite devil (Yujiro Hanma), yes you all hate him at first, but you actually end up actually liking him, the way he breaks up fights, his annoying weird voice and his devilishness :PThe story is about baki, a 13...year old kid, training martial arts since he was 3 years old, and having his father (yes that messed up psychotic bastard) as an idol or a goal for his life. But at 13 years old, he left his controlled training and started running his life by himself, however coming to realise that his father is really a psycho and not some loving person, he aims to defeat him.Baki then goes through several stages of his life, including defeating a 20Ft Ape with his bear hands, fists, and feet.The funny thing i have to say about this (and i know someone already mentioned this in another review but its so true), everyone here takes steroids. Its like DBZ almost but not with the rapid unexplainable expansion of muscle and the sudden change in hair pigment colour and random yellow lines of supposedly fire that doesnt seem to burn the skin.I mean, the one scene where baki (when he has orange hair) sitting on the river hillside, he is so big for his size and age, its pretty obviouse hes on roid rage. And lets not start on Yujiro. Dude that guy takes the pain like its nothing, and his face.... I swear he pumps roids in his face too... Just looking at his neck and how thick it is...But even then, people like Hanayama, Baki too, they all take so much pain yet they dont suffer much for it. Do you think you will still live if you got kicked against a tree, and due to its impact the tree split in half at the base? I think you would die most definately.A funny part of this anime that i remember was when Baki was climbing up a hill (this is on one of the earlier episodes), and has numerouse experiences of hormones or adrenalin or something. It reminded me of something we all do when we are very excited, and we are with the opposite sex (unless we are homosexual where its the same sex, or bi where its either sex) and we rease alot of white sticky stuff... Yes, do you go ""UHG"" when you have a sudden climax of hormonal release? I dont think so.However, with all the steroid crap, climaxes and paracetamol they take, it still is an amazing anime. What i love about it is that it was so seriouse, and had a true fighting spirit within. It never got into comedy (which isnt bad, but for this anime, comedy would have probably sucked, baki would have turned out to be some dense weirdo, and it would have been something like hajime no ippo or historys strongest diciple kenichi, which arnt bad, they are also my favourite animes :) )The sound, well the music are all pertty good.

Whether that's something good or bad will depend on your tastes.  When this came out, I'm sure it looked amazing and I must admit I am a fan of that 'older' art style of anime.  Everything art wise is very 'odd' or quirky for this show, the way Baki looks, the design of his father..Yujiro Hanma, the villain of the series has a very striking design.  His muscles are horrifyingly creepy looking, he's completely, totally despicable and...  he vaguely resembles Akuma from Street Fighter.Okay, I've yammered about the art and how it's both unique, yet dated.....The story is basically...  meh.  It's your typical kid fights to overcome odds thing but the action is always intense and full on badass throughout.Character wise - there's very little depth to anyone other than 'I must beat so and so', outside of one episode where Baki and his mother deal with their relationship.Overall.  I'd call it a solid '6'.  There's a lot to like if you enjoy fighting and big displays in your show, but, other shows have developed their characters while also juggling these big fighting displays much better.  Not bad, but not the best. The story is basically...  meh.

Not bad, but not the best."", ""There are a lot of things to consider when grading this anime as it has some strong points but a lot of flaws, so let's get started.The story is about a 13 years old boy named Baki who wants to get as stronger as he can be for one purpose: to defeat his father. The story is at weak as it sounds as there's nothing else to support it. In theory there's another reason for this as well, as Baki wants to get stronger to be admired by his mother to finally be loved by her (she loves strong people.......). There's nothing else to say...about the story as that is all there is to it.The art is not that bad (given that this is from 2001) and shows what needs to be shown. The details of the body of each fighter are spectacular as it show muscles that I didn't even know they were there. The background is somewhat repetitive as you get to see either the same place of the city or a jungle.The music falls into what I like to call the almost-annoying-yet-not-so-much category. Every tone brought me to an 80's movie due to the unfitting-ness of it with the anime. There are about 3 types of music and they get abused often enough to really question their selection.Character development.......an enormous flaw.There are a lot of characters in this anime due to the fact that Baki has to fight to become stronger. You do get to see some difference between them, however they all seem to be based from a generic character. Almost all of the characters that appear get none to little background to support them nor a motivation for their actions. You get to wonder who the hell is each one as you only know their name before fighting. The second half of the show is worse as a supposed &quot;girlfriend&quot; of Baki comes out of nowhere and all you get to know about her is her name. Even the background of Baki's father and mother is left untouched (except for an episode that &quot;tries&quot; to explain something about them). They could have done a better job if at least with the main characters.After all this flaws why the hell did I enjoyed the anime? Well, if there's a strong point with this anime it should be the fights. They are well done and show the different kinds of martial arts from the world, so you get to see some action that is worth the multiples mistakes done with this anime.A warning though; if you're going to see this anime with fansubs (not DVD subs, those may be right) you'd better know japanese, because the available versions of it have such an awful translation that you barely know what's happening (goes from &quot;unfinished sentences&quot; to &quot;things said that are not translated&quot; to &quot;bad translation&quot; to &quot;things that are never said but put in the transation&quot;). about the story as that is all there is to it.The art is not that bad (given that this is from 2001) and shows what needs to be shown.

Well guess what; this anime is also like that. It’s about a boy that wants to be the best fighter and to surpass his father, the strongest man in the world. The catch is, it’s way more focused on being brutal than telling a moral message about friendship or spicing things up with something other than fighting.If you got tired of watching fighting shonen or sport series that are wasting a lot of time on not being...about the action, Grappler Baki is where you go to, assuming you can tolerate bad animation and horrible openings. Seriously, if you want to get your blood pumping when you begin watching an episode of pure manly action, you don’t throw a lame pop song, sang by a girl in the opening.And I get why they did that. Females in the series are damsels in distress, existing only as rewards for manly men who beat the crap out of each other. Listening to girl singing while the protagonist is training hard is telling you subconsciously that everything is done for the pussy and that all the pain and suffering the hero is going through will have a reward at the end. It’s just a cheap hook to keep teenage boys watching a show about guys who want to be the strongest for the sake of being the strongest.You also don’t use cancer CGI models. I get how it saves money, but if you don’t bother to render them properly or cover them by drawing over them, then it looks horrible and not awesome at all, which happens to be the main appeal of the show. I mean, if you can somehow look past it, it’s still amazing for its brutal fighting, which includes all sorts of nasty attacks no typical shonen would use. Scratching the eyes, biting the ears, kicking the nuts, attacking without a warning, and so on. The early episodes were merciless, as there was no honor in fighting and winning was the only thing that mattered.Second arcUnfortunately this was diminished in the second arc, where everybody was fighting before an audience with a referee and you had to follow a few rules because you were doing it to prove how powerful you are and not to win no matter what. In fact, the second arc took away most of the charm in general and became an almost typical fighting tournament, despite constantly saying it is dangerous and merciless.Even the plot was damaged because of it. During the first arc things were moving at a reasonable pace. You were following a single character as he was travelling around the world and facing all sorts of challenges with no rules or referees to limit what you are allowed to do. It also had meaningful character growth, as Baki gets constantly stronger and learns new tricks. The handful of opponents he faces get some screen time as well so their backgrounds can be fleshed out.The second arc ruins everything. There is no actual growth since nobody there gets stronger from his battles. There are also about 30 fighters, most of which are one note, and they all get a rather equal amount of screen time when it’s their time to fight. Meaning you don’t focus on someone for too long and because of their sheer number almost nobody feels important or memorable. Also, every battle takes place on the exact same arena, which quickly becomes repetitive and dull to look at. Also, you can’t use dirty tricks, field tactics, or dirty tricks, because there is a referee and rules to follow. The fights are still kinda fun but there is very little engagement.And I have to stress how darker the first arc was, despite having a lot more absurd elements during its battles. Everybody was constantly grumpy and ready to choke the life out of their enemies, while the only relevant female was the psychotic mother of Baki, constantly mistreating him so she can have sex with his even more psychotic father. It was edgy at times, but it was also much more enjoyable than the second arc that had a comic relief midget and a dull schoolgirl acting as a generic platonic girlfriend.What I am getting at here, is that although the story was never something special, the first arc had a linear plot where every major character was somehow significant and was getting fleshed out. The tournament arc had everyone waiting for their turn on the ring. Until then, they had nothing to do besides being spectators who were stating the obvious for what is going on in the current duel. There is no plot to speak of and it quickly became boring. The show is all about muscular guys training and fighting each other just to see who the biggest badass is. In vacuum they are all different and cool, but when binging the show you clearly see how none of them feels important because of their sheer number and lack of permanent focus.I also have to point out how a big part of the appeal was also Baki’s relationship with his crazy ass father. The two of them are the flagship of the whole series, and we don’t get much of it. Baki stops evolving in the tournament and becomes almost of a blank self insert. His father’s backdrop gets fleshed out, but he is still not doing something other than being a jerk who keeps making his son suffer as means to keep getting stronger.Third arcThings seem to improve during the third arc, since the plot goes back to be being about dirty fighting, field tactics, and stealth. It is quickly proven to suffer from the exact same pacing issue as the second arc, with the addition of constantly cutting away every few minutes. Basically, a bunch of convicts go after Baki but they are constantly bumping on the 30 fighters from the previous arc. So again, there is no focus on a few characters. On top of that, since those 30 fighters are no longer standing idle as spectators, they are now constantly jumping in to intervene, or the convicts constantly do tricks to escape and leave the battle inconclusive. On top of that, a fight that is at large is constantly stopped and the scene changes to show us what someone else is doing at the time thus ruining the fun.Basically, the third arc has the same problem that plagues all stories that go past a tournament. You either never again show the fighters that took part in it, thus making it even more clear of how meaningless it was to spend time on them, or you keep them all around and you need to find something for them to do. The cast was now over 50 fighters doing their daily routine or bumping onto the convicts, making the plot extremely fragmented and unfocused.On top of that, even if you somehow make a compilation of the fights so they will seem uninterrupted, they are still going to be horrible to look at. The CGI is now everywhere and it makes the characters look like something out of a Playstation 1 era. The android animation is also extremely cheap, as most motions are essentially stills that slide instead of actual motion. Most of the badassery is lost because of it.I also need to point out how messed up the power scaling is. You never get a clear picture of who is stronger than whom, with the only exception being Baki’s father, who is the strongest man in history. At one scene it seems like A is stronger than B, only to somehow be proven weaker than C, who lost to B. For example, in the first arc Gaia was referred to as the second strongest person in the world, and then the second arc introduces all those fighters who are supposed to be even stronger. Then the third arc introduces the convicts, who are supposed to be even stronger, yet they all get defeated by the lower end of the fighters of the second arc.The dirty tactics many are using could be used as a justification for why some can get the upper hand in cases where normally they would lose. But as it turns out not even that makes much sense, since the convicts are all crazy powerful on their own, and their dirty tactics are actually making them underperform. Plus, Baki gets a power up in this arc not through training or through some realization but because he lost his virginity. I kid you not; the show treats sex as a power up.We also don’t get an actual finale, since the story ends without a resolution and it’s yet another case of go read the manga, where you get a whole bunch of arcs that keep going forever. There is never any clear objective or end point, making the whole thing being literally about endless pointless fighting.Down to it, Grappler Baki is cool at points, but as a whole unfocused and badly directed and animated. It stands no chance next to better produced titles, even if their action is nowhere close as brutal. about the action, Grappler Baki is where you go to, assuming you can tolerate bad animation and horrible openings.

Yes the art is not so cute but its roughness backs up the tough story of a son trying to win the love of his mum and to an extent his dad... though fighting. The most interesting part to this anime is the fight match ups where you would have judo against boxing or street brawling against chinese kenpo for example and the best part, there are no rules. Plenty of blood and plenty of unique action where each fighter has their own techiques....Story is unpredictable and very intriguing... once i started i couldnt stop, a must for for fighting anime lovers such as Dragon ball Z, naurto (minus the whole energy ball things... a lot more real) Story is unpredictable and very intriguing... once i started i couldnt stop, a must for for fighting anime lovers such as Dragon ball Z, naurto (minus the whole energy ball things... a lot more real)', ""First of all, the bad stuff. The art is not easy on the eyes and quite inconsistent. For instance, Baki looks like a completely different person once he ages. Storyline is pretty much non-existent and very generic of fighting animes (fight - train - fight again - train - win ultimate final fight).It's not a challenging anime to watch at all. Nothing unique about the way its done. Pretty much the same as stuff like Tenjou Tenge. But having said that, the entertainment value is enormous. It's very gratifying to be fed action scene after action scene. Fights were well choreographed and exciting to...watch (even though you knew in the end who would eventually win).Very much worth watching because its a no-nonsense blast for fighting anime fans. If you've never watched a fighting anime before, this would be a good start! watch (even though you knew in the end who would eventually win).Very much worth watching because its a no-nonsense blast for fighting anime fans.

That's what Baki the grappler is all about.It starts off with the main character Hanma Baki a fearless 13 year old delinquent who is hot headed and isn't afraid to pick fights with anyone, just to test his fighting skills. Baki would charge his way through the crowded street gang of a 100 young punks...but in baki's eye's he only see's 4 people all together, ready to fight he charges.Secretly Baki was being watched by his mother's employee, to see how he was progressing. Baki goes back to the gym and his hot headed attitude kicks in. The boy goes completely insane for the lust for strength and power. His lust for power has been growing for quite sometime. His mother gets wind of it and knows her son is becoming a man. The way Baki was presented in the story is intriguing to me. His goal is to be the strongest fighter on the planet. Doing this will take more than just a hot headed attitude, rigorous training, a few broken bones, and bloody fists. Does he have what it takes?Eventually during his encounters with other fighters he makes new friends, even if they had fought each other. It's all about respect for a martial artists. Along the way you'll notice that most of the fighters Baki encounters have backstories, getting to know a little more about them personally. Character development has done well to explain itself. I thought the way they handled there reasoning for fighting was good enough. While watching this I could see Baki growing, training, fighting many challenging foes in the near future.Opponents that fought the youngster were reasonable enough to keep me from turning away from my screen. The different fighting styles made the fighting scenes more enjoyable because all the fighters had different strengths and weaknesses. It took me only a day to watch this, but none the less it was really fun to see some action done right most of the time.Baki the grappler is definitely fast and tends to skip most of the boring moments, the anime got me all hyped up. While I was watching this, my head was filled with many unanswered questions. Could a 13 year old with execeptional fighting skills actually exists in this world? Could I be this strong when I become 13 years old? Many questions have gone through my head and till this very day I still wonder about it.What awaits this young fighter is a tough and rigorous journay. Through many hardships Baki must fight bigger and even stronger opponents that rival his level. He must become stronger than he is now, because his father is waiting for his son to improve himself. Baki the grappler is filled with action, a ton of fighting scenes and a story of a young boy training to become the strongest man alive. but in baki's eye's he only see's 4 people all together, ready to fight he charges.Secretly Baki was being watched by his mother's employee, to see how he was progressing.

Many questions have gone through my head and till this very day I still wonder about it.What awaits this young fighter is a tough and rigorous journay. Through many hardships Baki must fight bigger and even stronger opponents that rival his level. He must become stronger than he is now, because his father is waiting for his son to improve himself. Baki the grappler is filled with action, a ton of fighting scenes and a story of a young boy training to become the strongest man alive."", '""If someone is born a male, at least once in his life he\'ll dream of becoming the strongest man alive.""This quintessential phrase of pure poignant basedness is the mantra by which Baki is made. This is a real man\'s show! This story will make you grow a second penis. The characters are MEN, the plot is MEN, the message is MEN. You\'ve heard of Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, well this is BIG MEN DOING MAN SHIT, a genre that is sadly dying as of late. But what can you expect, the based masculine male is the biggest threat to those hungry for power, that\'s...why they\'re stuffing all the food and drinks with soy and estrogen to make men weak. But the innate male desire for strength of body, mind and spirit cannot be undermined and it will find a way, just like testosterone makes its way through the bloodstream. We will always find a way to climb any mountain!Jokes aside, this right here is Baki. Quintessential Baki. It\'s a simple story, but honestly, there is comfort and fun to be had in its simplicity. There is no overly deep worldbuilding here (yet), no huge overaching story, no world threatening cataclysm to be stopped. This is just the story of a big strong boy and his desire to become the biggest strongest boy so he can defeat his menace of a father. It\'s a classic coming of age story and a classic journey of growth and self improvement. If you also love martial arts like I do, they play a huge role here and this is one the best martial arts stories to be found in classic shounen anime. The fights are great, the dialogue is snappy, sharp and to the point, the visuals are quite nice and the soundtrack is really catchy, with a distinctly oldschool charm. The characters aren\'t some profound philosophical allegory, they are simple, but charismatic and engaging people that will definitely keep you hooked from beginning to end.Now, this specific adaptation is not without its flaws. For starters, this released in 2001, which is already old, but its still newer than things like One Piece, Naruto or Shaman King. Despite that, it actually looks like its 10 years older than it really is, with a very retro artstyle and animation approach that aligns much more with classic 80s battle shounen than it does with more modern ones. It feels much closer to Fist of the North Star or Yu Yu Hakusho than the others I mentioned before. This isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, I personally enjoy oldschool media or newer media with an oldschool aesthetic, but here the show also comes with some of the drawbacks of the era. Firstly, the animation can drop the ball sometimes. Some segments are barely animated, some aren\'t animated at all and are basically shaky slideshows and animation bits get reused frequently. Also there are numerous unnecessary recaps across all the episodes that ultimately hurt the pacing of the story. Hell, one of the episodes in the middle of the season is just a recap of everything that happened up to that point with barely any new information being shared. It\'s very annoying, it\'s obviously a cost cutting measure but this was sadly something that was commonplace during this era. We can all be grateful that it fell out of favour.All in all, I know most people today will go straight to the newer Netflix Baki anime, but I still think that this classic deserves a shot too. It\'s really enjoyable and really captures the essence of Baki and of this classic epoch of anime. It won\'t blow your mind or move you deeply with groundbreaking storytelling, but this was never the point. It has that same lovable testosterone-filled heart that classic action movies have. It\'s just a very fun collection of macho nonsense. And it\'s damn good at what it does too. Now if you excuse me, I must go lift weights this very moment to become the strongest in the world! why they\'re stuffing all the food and drinks with soy and estrogen to make men weak.

What is also cool about this version is Baki start of as 13 year old, and than grows up as the season goes a long. You see how he has changed, and matured as well. What is also cool, is how he develops a friendship with the opponents he defeats...as well.The art, sound, and music, and this anime is really amazing too, and i loved the opening theme song, its just epic on another level, and makes you want to train haha.Its an anime I believe anyone can get into, even if your not a fan of fighting animes, or animes for that matter.Really enjoyed it and might re-watch it again in the future. as well.The art, sound, and music, and this anime is really amazing too, and i loved the opening theme song, its just epic on another level, and makes you want to train haha.Its an anime I believe anyone can get into, even if your not a fan of fighting animes, or animes for that matter.Really enjoyed it and might re-watch it again in the future.', ""“There is always a stronger opponent” - is the non-ending loop that this series seems to be stuck in.Let me preface this by saying that 13 years old Baki is the best version of himself yet. I don't know if that's an unpopular opinion or I'm just too much of a Shounen struck to know better, but it is what it is.This show established itself as one of the most bizarre and weird Anime experiences I had the pleasure of enjoying, it's ridiculous and takes itself lightly, never too serious and desperate and that's what was the most fun. You'd think a show about martial...arts would get stale and boring by the end of the first episode, after all, there is only so much you can do with throwing fists in the same direction only at different targets, but no, you're still missing out on the crack version of it all, that is, the acid trip known as Baki.This show was a festival in spirit, with so many characters and so many names that you end up somehow resonating and remembering for the long run, better yet, the exchange of blows strangely makes them relatable and better to understand, they say you never know how hard a wall is until you throw your punch at it and this was all true with the character arch types in this series.Baki as a character feels like a greater than life, loud dreamer on a non-ending chase for greatness, or at least, his 13 years old did, and it was amazing, his relationship with his surroundings was amazing in all the weird ways which make it the more unique and interesting to follow. Yujiro Hanma too, unlike any other meathead in Anime really does leave an impression, his aura is hard felt, his intimidation radiates all over the screen, and his presence is always strong and encompasses everything and everyone around, definitely a runup for the best neutral antagonists out there, there is potential here and I'm excited to get to know more. I could run out of words here before I manage to appreciate every other character, Yuri, Hanayama, Yumi, Doppo, Tokugawa, Kato, Strydom, Gaia, Shinogi, and so on, all were amazing match-ups for Baki which makes it the more exciting and tempting to know who's next.This is not a problem but it does get repetitive, there is always, somehow, a bigger, stronger world champion that was never foreshadowed or name-dropped until the point they are introduced as an opponent, it does feel like the author was making up a story as he went on, never having a clear ending in mind which also has the advantage of seeming more like adventure and coming of age story, you never know what would hit you next, but you're all on board for it.Overall: 7.2/10 arts would get stale and boring by the end of the first episode, after all, there is only so much you can do with throwing fists in the same direction only at different targets, but no, you're still missing out on the crack version of it all, that is, the acid trip known as Baki.This show was a festival in spirit, with so many characters and so many names that you end up somehow resonating and remembering for the long run, better yet, the exchange of blows strangely makes them relatable and better to understand, they say you never know how hard a wall is until you throw your punch at it and this was all true with the character arch types in this series.Baki as a character feels like a greater than life, loud dreamer on a non-ending chase for greatness, or at least, his 13 years old did, and it was amazing, his relationship with his surroundings was amazing in all the weird ways which make it the more unique and interesting to follow.

By fresh I mean that it is a first that brings something new to this industry with such repetitive and generic animes, and this is surprising, since Baki itself is very simple.Baki\'s story is good, simple, and entertaining. As the scoop says, Baki is a 13-year-old who under the supervision of his mother grows stronger, learns different martial arts techniques and fights against different enemies. All this to surpass his father from him, considered the strongest being in the world and nicknamed the ""Ogre"".Baki as such does not...have a strong enough reason to defeat his father, that is what I find interesting, since he is being forced into something he does not want, but then the push would enter that would drive Baki to fulfill his objective until the end. day of his death, and that would be the death of his mother, which causes Baki to go into anger and challenge Yujiro in one of the most epic battles in anime.The art and animation are very bizarre, but I love them, as they transmit a lot of power in the blows, and the aesthetic is very original.Finally, the negative points.The fundamental thing I consider is that Baki abuses the factor ""this character is the strongest in the world"", and this is bad. It gets to a point where you can\'t take power levels seriously due to how absurd everything is, let alone expect something from a character. The best example would be that the anime says that the soldier Baki fought with is considered to be the second strongest being in the world and in the end he is a smoke seller ...Another thing I hate is that it does NOT make sense for Baki to befriend all the guys he fights with. For example, the smoke seller who was considered the second strongest man, who previously intended to kill him without problems, now suddenly become friends for no reason.For these negative points, Baki just seems good to me, but it is not an anime that I would watch again or crazy. have a strong enough reason to defeat his father, that is what I find interesting, since he is being forced into something he does not want, but then the push would enter that would drive Baki to fulfill his objective until the end. day of his death, and that would be the death of his mother, which causes Baki to go into anger and challenge Yujiro in one of the most epic battles in anime.The art and animation are very bizarre, but I love them, as they transmit a lot of power in the blows, and the aesthetic is very original.Finally, the negative points.The fundamental thing I consider is that Baki abuses the factor ""this character is the strongest in the world"", and this is bad.

Maybe if they had introduced fewer characters and enriched/explained a few more, it would be more interesting to watch and the story would be better and more complete.Script (Score: 4): Baki\'s script is probably the worst part of the anime, extremely cliché and vague. Everything sounds repetitive and underdeveloped. With a great script the anime could be much better, since the...characters are good and the ""intention"" of the anime is good too.Characters (Score: 8): The baki characters are good. Baki, despite being more of the same main character as all the shonnens, has a really great charisma and everything behind him sounds interesting and exciting.Also highlighted for the characters: Emi Akezawa who brings a sexy and mysterious side to the story, Kozue Matsumoto who brings a cute side and Mitsunari Tokugawa who is one of the most charismatic and funny characters in the entire anime.Quality of design, animation and sound (Score: 7): For an anime from 2001, everything is ok in that sense, I believe the fight moves could be much better, but I don\'t have much to complain about.I recommend Baki for people who don\'t care too much about the story and script, people who really like martial arts and also for those who haven\'t watched many animes yet.PT/BR:Historia (Nota: 5) : A Historia de Baki não é das melhores, tem vários furos, muitas coisas mal explicadas e sinto que teve uma ""pressa"" na hora de escrever/publicar. Talvez se eles tivessem apresentado menos personagens e enriquecido/explicado mais alguns, seria mais interessante de assistir e a história seria melhor e mais completa.Roteiro (Nota: 4): O roteiro de Baki é provavelmente a pior parte do anime, extremamente clichê e vago. Tudo soa repetitivo e mal desenvolvido. Com um grande roteiro o anime poderia ser bem melhor, uma vez que os personagens são bons e a ""intenção"" do anime é boa também.Personagens (Nota: 8): Os personagens de baki são bons. O Baki, apesar de ser mais do mesmo personagem principal de todos os shonnens, tem um carisma muito grande e tudo por trás dele soa interessante e empolgante.Destaque também para os personagens:  Emi Akezawa que trás um lado ""sexy"" e misterioso para história, Kozue Matsumoto que trás um lado fofo e Mitsunari Tokugawa que é um dos personagens mais carismáticos e engraçados de todo o anime.Qualidade do desenho, animação e som (Nota: 7): Para um anime de 2001, tudo está ok nesse sentido, acredito que os movimentos das lutas poderiam ser bem melhores, mas não tenho tanto para reclamar.Eu recomendo Baki para pessoas que não se importam muito com a história e roteiro, pessoas que realmente gostam de artes marciais e também para quem ainda não assistiu muitos animes. characters are good and the ""intention"" of the anime is good too.Characters (Score: 8): The baki characters are good.

I made a mistake. My mistake was to watch Baki 2018 from Netflix. That's how i found about the earlier series of Baki The Grappler so after i finished the first season of Baki 2018 i came into these series and i learnt a lot of the things i found for undone in the netflix anime. I like the entire idea of a kid from rich family who decides to live by himself. The first years of Baki are introduced to us really well. It is really original story....His dad as a main villain is great idea. You can see him being the strongest and Baki trying the achieve even more power than his father so he can actually beat him but at least in this first season this thing do not happen. Baki goes through a lot of lessons just because he wants to defeat his father. He made a lot of friendships just from fighting. The transition from young ages of Baki ending with him loosing his mother on his first  fight with his father to the 5 years more grown Baki is great. He seems stronger, smarter and more peaceful. The ending of this season is really devastating. You see this all grown up Baki who is a lot stronger then before and then his father comes in and kick his butt with 0 sweat and this hypes you for the next season because you wanna see how much stronger can Baki get.

Its majorly different, down to how Baki looks, the story and much more. The 2018 Baki Anime, was set halfway through the story, during the deadliest Criminals arc thing, where shit gets crazy, but these 24 episodes are subdued, even though their still crazy. Bakis more like a Shounen Protagonist here, he strives to become the strongest man in the world, to surpass his father Yujiro Hanma. He trains tirelessly, and gets down when he fails, but then breaks boundaries, much like...Goku, or Makunouchi Ippo from Hajime no Ippo.Story: 8/10 Like said before, its much more different from the 2018 Baki Anime. Starts off the story from the beginning, when Baki was not as buff, and not as strong. The story is actually well paced, and easy to watch, and really easy to binge, which I'm always happy for. It doesn't have as much as the craziness that happens later in the manga, but still, some absurd things happen, such as Baki fighting 100 highschool delinquents, and fighting a giant ape.Art: 7/10 The animation and art is much different from the Manga and 2018 Baki Anime (expect more referencing of the 2018 anime, because its almost impossible not too) Instead of actually taking the Author's style of illustrations, they take a much more normal looking Anime and manga style, which almost never gets in the way of the action. The action is also great, when Baki fights, it feels like he is, in the beginning, when he's fighting 100 people, the fighting is so smooth and well paced, it makes you just feel oddly satisfied.Sound: 6/10 Now the low rating is not bad, it can be good, but the way the characters talk is hilarious, especially in the dub. Often times, I found myself not seeing any subtitles below when somebody is talking in the sub, sorrowing my expierence. The dub is not any better, the character's talk like they playing the character,  not that they are the character. Many of the lines can be awkward, and down right funny, when Baki uses Endorphins, its down right hilarious how he goes OOOOOOH, and his brain lits up with stars shooting out of it. The opening is really catchy, and always fun to watch, so I advise not to skip it. The music is also good, with much of it being similar to Synth Wave.Characters: 9/10. The characters are always the good part of these kinds of bizzare and wacky shows. Much like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, you watch and read it for the characters, not much the plot. Hanma Baki is the best out of the characters, the only motivation he has is to surpass his father in strength, who is said to be the strongest man in the world. And it feels genuine, it feels like your seeing a boy who strives and trained all of his life to surpass his father, it weirdly works. The side characters are also wacky, just for the fun of it, his mother is oddly sexual, straight up kissing Baki on the lips once, and only giving him tips to make him stronger, but she does risk her life in order to save him. I felt impressed, when I saw that Baki and his mother have a strong resemblance, not just the same hair color or eye color, like other manga and shounen series, like Naruto, Bleach, Black Clover, BNHA Etc. He has the same lips and mole as his mother, which makes it feel like Baki is her son.Enjoyment 9/10: I think I enjoyed this way too much, and way more then the 2018 anime. Its fun, its wacky, and makes me feel like I'm watching Jojo's Bizarre adventure, but its a martial arts anime.Overalls: A great Anime and Manga series,  I highly recommend it to Anime fans, Manga Fans, and even Martial Arts fans.

Hanma Baki is the best out of the characters, the only motivation he has is to surpass his father in strength, who is said to be the strongest man in the world. And it feels genuine, it feels like your seeing a boy who strives and trained all of his life to surpass his father, it weirdly works. The side characters are also wacky, just for the fun of it, his mother is oddly sexual, straight up kissing Baki on the lips once, and only giving him tips to make him stronger, but she does risk her life in order to save him. I felt impressed, when I saw that Baki and his mother have a strong resemblance, not just the same hair color or eye color, like other manga and shounen series, like Naruto, Bleach, Black Clover, BNHA Etc. He has the same lips and mole as his mother, which makes it feel like Baki is her son.Enjoyment 9/10: I think I enjoyed this way too much, and way more then the 2018 anime. Its fun, its wacky, and makes me feel like I'm watching Jojo's Bizarre adventure, but its a martial arts anime.Overalls: A great Anime and Manga series,  I highly recommend it to Anime fans, Manga Fans, and even Martial Arts fans."", ""I just got done with the final episode and have moved onto the next season upon writing this. I prior to watching this was a huge Baki the Grappler fan regarding the manga. I very much enjoyed the manga, however the first season of Baki falls short for me. Some of the problems I have with the first season are as follows; the art is inconsistent and tends to look weird at times, the anime cut out very enjoyable parts of the manga, the anime was at a too fast of pass. The feeling really isn't there for me, and the manga was very emotional...for me. The mangas story starts off differently and gets you into the characters and world much faster, giving you a better sense of the atmosphere. Orochi is in the beginning in the manga and its Orochi what else can I say :D. Finally, This adaptation is fine, but could be better. To add, there are a lot of awesome moments in the anime and the characters are dope, just wish the, og, manga would get finished translating to English. for me.

For the time though, the art is pretty decent.Sound 7/10 – Similar to the art, it was decent but there is...room for improvement. Maybe I'm just being strict as I recently finished Bleach.Character 6/10 – The characters were far too generic, I find myself comparing the characters to a show like One Punch Man, which had such diverse and unique characters, I’m hoping the next few seasons have better characters. Baki and Yujiro are the standouts in the show, which bodes well for the future.Enjoyment 7/10 – A few comical bits, sprinkles of potential romance and good fights. I feel like it could potentially reach a 10 if a few things had been done differently.Overall 7/10 – A solid 7, if I had watched it 15 years ago then maybe it would’ve scored higher. I look forward to watching where it goes though. room for improvement.

It manages to have a good plot of a boy trying to make his mother love him despite it not being reciprocated as a motivation but once the events of Emi Akazawa in the middle of the series the plot changes to a revenge story. Despite being simply action the majority of the time it does manage to do very well dramatically when it does. The best part of the series is the world building in the story by showing the fighting classes of the world which fall under the King Of Fighters character Yujiro...Hanma.Art)The art is a big downfall of this series. It is fine at first glance but the low budget put into the series brings it down a few pegs. Character movements include in this at times as the movements are obviously just an image moving side to side with no other motions so it looks almost like a cut out. However, these moments are relatively few and far between still. Another issue is that the characters are sometimes very overly muscly. The muscles of many characters have a crazy amount of muscle that does bother some people.Sound)The sound of this series does well and while the back round songs aren\'t really memorable they some up the violent situations well. The 1st opening theme does some up the show perfectly with an all out testosterone filled shock. However, the 2nd opening is likely the worst opening I have ever seen and is very annoying because the animation used is old crapy 90s technology which, regardless of how revolutionary it could have been for the time, comes off horribly and is unable to demonstrate the character\'s abilities at all.Characters)The characters in this series are very generic really. Personality wise they do not really have much going on. Almost every character is a fighter or ""grappler"" as they refer to themselves and this defines their lives and character. The most memorable character of the series Yujiro Hanma is an interesting character in his simplicity but is still simplistic. Yujiro is a wild type man who is King Of All Fighters and wants nothing but a good fight in life. Im not saying characters are bad, they just have this common characteristic with little diversity.

Day and night he actively searches for any strong opponents from professional boxers, war veterans, monsters to gang leaders etc.Baki \'s reason for his hunger for fighting and to be strong is his father Yujirou. Yujirou is portrayed as the best fighter in the world, he is a scary and intimidating monster  man who is almost something non-human because of his strength and brutality (he can frickin stop earthquakes with his fist)....He is the main driving force for Baki to seek more strength and power. Baki\'s mother, Emi Akezawa, is a lady who is obsessed to Yujirou. She kinda loves Yujirou more than their own son and does everything to satisfy Yujirou. She trains Baki to be a strong fighter fit to be Yujirou\'s son as per Yujirou\'s request. BothYujirou and Emi have their own interesting back stories.The fighting is good and no ""aura\'s"" (e.g. Nen, Ki, Hamon etc.) in here. Just pure brawling, grappling, wrestling, kick-boxing, karate, boxing and other real disciplines of martial arts. The strength of this characters however are mind bending and somewhat unreal. For example is Baki who is only 13 years old, there are no 13 year olds who possesses a body like that and can beat up bigger juiced up humans and monsters alike. But it is entertaining nonetheless, without their almost supernatural strength, Baki wouldn\'t be as epic as it is. The 1st half is a street fighting inclined while the 2nd half focuses more on a tournament.Animation is good but not consistent. Sometimes you\'d drool from the great fighting scenes where each panel was drawn to (not perfection) but atleast above average and the animation was so fluid, and sometimes you\'d be disappointed by the other fights where they looked like they were drawn by some lazy amateurs. But it was all manageable to watch anyway so I had no problem with it. Sound is okay, I like the background sounds and they fit each scenes.Overall, Baki is as entertaining as any fighting anime. It\'s hard to get bored watching a 13 year old boy with epic monstrous strength beat up bigger, badder foes with monstrous strength of their own. He also beats up non-living things and animals and its fun seeing him wreak havoc. It\'s not all mindless action though, you\'ll also enjoy some heartwarming back stories here and there. I recommend this to anyone specially those fans of the fighting genre.My Personal Rating: 8/10 He is the main driving force for Baki to seek more strength and power.

However, together, its just really entertaining.Let\'s be real. This anime is just one long meme. It knows what it is, who are the people who\'d watch it, and caters to them. The story, characters, situatiions are ridiculous and comical. You got one character that kills polar bears with his bear hands, and another who\'s alternate personality is a feared war hero. Not to mention, the main character and his friends are overpowered 13 year olds beating on grown men. You see where I...am going with this?At the time of this review, the art is a bit dated at this point as is the music. However, its not dated enough to stop anyone from enjoying the series if they were to start here today. Give it a try. am going with this?At the time of this review, the art is a bit dated at this point as is the music. However, its not dated enough to stop anyone from enjoying the series if they were to start here today. Give it a try.', ""Punching bag named Baki, is the real title I'd place on this show. It has a very simple premise which doesn't carry the show but gives it enough excuse to glue other ideas on to in attempt to create a coherent story. This story is neither deep nor good, just barely serviceable to provide yet another excuse for yet another fight.Our main character wants to get stronger, even though at any point in any episode we are told he's already like monster. Episode after episode we are told he is strong, he advanced and overcomes hurdles and yet you don't get any of that from...actually watching the fights. Every episode there's someone stronger and by the time you realize there are like 50 strongest people between the most strongest and second strongest. It's a mess and you really don't get a sense of scale. Sadly you rarely see him training or doing anything that can be cleverly reincorporated later. There are no techniques or knowledge he gains throughout. Every fight starts with him getting beaten and standing up again and again and again until somehow the opponent loses. It's repetitive and painful to watch.Am not talking about art and style since the show is pretty old at this point. It's okay but it certainly doesn't stand out from others from same period. Choreography on the other hand is not good. Certainly better than slide shows we got with Fist of the North Star. Here things are at least animated, but sometimes they look as if they are cheating with physics.Overall, give it a 3-4 episodes if you like the premise. That would give you the idea of what's to come. It doesn't get better, just more of the same. I watched 16 episodes out of boredom and nothing else to watch, but it became too boring to continue. Definitely not a show for binge watching. actually watching the fights.

Definitely not a show for binge watching."", ""Grappler Baki is a shonen anime about a kid who dreams of beating up his abusive father. Before he can achieve that dream, he must defy the laws of gravity, physics, and mortality using shonen magic which, in this series, happens to be adrenaline. Along the way, he meets other social misfits who sometimes want to beat him up, but mostly just want to kill him, so that they can brag to their friends about how they murdered a child. Luckily for them, Baki is the protagonist and quickly befriends his would-be killers after he defeats them. While this is happening, his father Yujiro, who...is the ultimate badass, grows bored of watching his son's prolonged and futile tantrum, and decides it would be more fun to behead endangered species, attack political figures, volunteer for terrorist watchlists, and somehow not be hunted down toward every corner of the Earth. We also learn about Alzheimer's and how showing three or four flashbacks of the same scene within 10 minutes can worsen the symptoms. Eventually, Baki and the viewer overcome this crippling disease together to reach the pivotal moment where he finally has the chance to achieve his dream, much to the dismay of his sociopathic mother Emi who, up to this point, had only been helping him get stronger because she was using him to fulfill some sick delusion that a mass murderer would feel romantic attraction toward her. Thankfully, despite having 13 years to think about this, she realizes it is wrong to use her son as a sacrificial lamb and futilely steps in to stop the beating, only to be CQC'd to death by her love interest. I will give credit where credit is due and say this show accurately portrays what a hybristophiliac would likely experience if they got their wish. The last few episodes focus on a time skip with Baki entering underground death tournaments against a variety of opponents, not unlike Bloodsport, culminating in a fight between Yujiro and one of the higher-ups. Baki ultimately doesn't get his rematch, instead having to fight a villain-of-the-week, and the season ends with a teaser for the inevitable sequel.The main problem with Grappler Baki is that it is a typical shonen from beginning to end. It has everything you would expect. Training, drawn-out buildup for fights against boring villains, too much talking, befriending would-be killers, constant flashbacks, neverending story, you name it, it has it. It doesn't do anything different and while it is more grounded in reality than others that have outright superpowers or magic, it ultimately remains just as dull because it retains all of the cliches that the others have. It isn't anything remarkable and it isn't disastrous. It achieves its goal of setting up the premise, then remaining in stagnation with glimpses of progress in order to keep the viewer tuned in for next week's episode. The fights happen and people don't shut up. The fighting is constantly interrupted by characters who we don't care about giving live commentary like they're on ESPN, or the fighters politely standing still so that one fighter may finish their inner monologue. While this may be a problem in virtually all shonens, it is still frustrating because it would be much more interesting to simply watch the fight play out with no interruptions. There are also many instances of reused animation and some particularly jarring moments, such as in episode 10 where you can clearly hear Baki snap someone's neck and that character survives. The show presents the fights like they are a serious threat and mortality is constantly at stake, but with the exception of Emi and the Yasha Ape who are killed by Yujiro onscreen and offscreen respectively, no one ever dies from the fights. Baki’s opponents may intend to kill him and while we obviously can’t have the main protagonist get killed, there is still a certain lack of tension this series has when we know either Baki will defeat them or they will let him and their other opponents live.Speaking of jarring, there are entire episodes where it would seem the animation was completely outsourced, because the show goes from its usual style to looking more like the Titans from Attack on Titan with very disturbing, fish-like eyes and creepy faces on every character. Episode 10 is the first instance of this and at first I thought maybe this had something to do with the tension of that episode’s situation, where Baki is dropped in the middle of a jungle with the goal to dispatch an extremely lethal militia group. Maybe they were going for some kind of Vietnam PTSD look. But as the episode goes on, it’s clear that it was just outsourced to terrible animators and it happens again in one of the later episodes. I guess constant exposition that hangs on still shots, reusing animation, and shoving constant flashbacks in our face wasn’t enough cost-cutting for the animators. That brings me to my next point; the studio seems to think that the audience has short-term memory loss, because we see flashbacks of scenes that we have already seen before more times than I can count. One particular moment that continually gets flashed back to is after Baki has defeated the Yasha Ape and how he feels bad for attacking him. I counted at least 2 flashbacks of this scene and there was probably another one during the recap episode. There was also at least one flashback to a flashback that another character was having where he and his sister were being attacked by wolves. I think there may have been occasions where there were flashbacks to scenes that occurred within the very same episode. There are so many flashbacks that you will probably get dementia after watching this series. By the time this series came out, it was possible to catch up on what you missed by either looking up plot summaries online, watching reruns, or renting the DVD. Having so many flashbacks is completely unnecessary and serves as an annoyance and a distraction in addition to padding out the runtime.Most of the characters of Grappler Baki are forgettable or bland. Baki himself is respectable enough. He has a clear goal and motivation and we can feel sympathy for him because of his terrible parents. We want to see him succeed. Yujiro is a lot like Dio Brando in the sense that his character is little more than villainy for the sake of villainy and that he is the impossibly strong shonen antagonist. We can laugh at how unbelievable his actions are. Emi is a cold and sociopathic character who uses her son for her own gain, then pays the ultimate price when she realizes the error of her ways. I suppose we can feel bad for her like the show wants us to, if we can ignore that she intended to sacrifice her son and that she fully knew what the consequences would be, and that she had no issue with it until she saw those consequences first-hand and suddenly decides that now it’s the wrong thing to do once it is too late to stop it. The rest of the cast are completely forgettable stock villains who become friends after getting curb-stomped. What was most laughable was the giant teenage yakuza boss character that the show spends one quarter of its length building up to a fight with, and how the most predictable twist occurred; he does what he does because his mother is dying of cancer. Boohoo. Cue tears. Now that suddenly makes me like this boring, angst-ridden character. We can laugh at how little time it took the writers (or should I say author) to come up with that. The rest of the stock characters do not stand out one bit and all of them are generic villains. We can forget about them.The last quarter or so of the series revolves around the underground tournament, where a slightly older Baki competes against opponents in the hopes of getting into a rematch with Yujiro. Obviously, this never happens because it’s a shonen and the plot is never allowed to end until the law of diminishing returns kicks in. At least we are treated to a dozen fights with villains-of-the-week. As I previously mentioned, the second-to-last fight is between Yujiro and one of the higher-ups who organize the tournaments. Yujiro beats him to death and leaves. However, the next villain-of-the-week uses shonen magic-I mean Hokuto Shinken-I mean “advanced surgical techniques” to revive this character, to the relief of no one except the extremely annoying, tiny old man who runs the tournament when he isn’t failing at comedic relief. The character should have stayed dead so that there would be some gravity to the situation and so that there would be more emphasis on going after Yujiro, because then it wouldn’t just be Baki who has a bone to pick with him. It is also anticlimactic to end the series on a fight between Baki and a villain-of-the-week. The order of the fights should have been swapped, and had that fight ended with that character dying, it would have made a great cliffhanger for the next season. I didn’t expect the plot to have a conclusive ending or wrap up by the end, but they could have at least tried to make it more enticing. Sometimes it doesn’t hurt to take the story in a different direction than the author. But that would have taken talented writing, something which this formulaic rush-job clearly didn’t have.The animation, when it isn’t being outsourced to meth addicts, has a distinct-enough look that makes it stand out a little bit. It has that early-2000s look where everything seemed like there was more attitude or experimentation behind it. It looks fine enough during static shots. In motion, it does enough to get the point across and not much else. There aren’t too many memorable shots. The 1994 OVA is more pleasing from an artistic standpoint because it was cel and achieved with what was probably a low budget, but I won’t lie; it wasn’t that impressive either. The music of the series is one of its high points, with an energetic and happy OP song to contrast with the somewhat dark tone of the series. The ED song is a similar case, except it is more relaxed. The background score does its job and suits the fights well, but with the exception of one or two tracks, it is mostly forgettable.Overall, Grappler Baki suffers from too many cliches, too much predictability, and too much stagnation. In effect, that makes it a victim of its own genre. You understandably may not choose to watch a shonen series for a brilliantly-written story, but because of the painstaking buildup to fights with boring and forgettable villains, and then the fights themselves being not-so-impressive and continually interrupted with mindless chatter explaining to us what we can already see with our own eyes, you will be left bored and tired. Most of the positives come from some of the technical aspects rather than the very thin and drawn-out story, characters, or fight scenes. The only character development there seems to be is Baki getting stronger and hating Yujiro more than before, and bad guys turning into good guys. You will be left disappointed at the ending, and while you may consider watching the second season, be warned that it does not conclude the story and consists of entirely filler. Basically, everything bad about this season is all there is in the next one. Instead of watching this series, watch Bloodsport and the original Mortal Kombat. You will get much more fun out of them if you want to see deadly tournaments with enjoyable fights. Otherwise, don’t waste your time watching this series unless you love repetitiveness and monotony. is the ultimate badass, grows bored of watching his son's prolonged and futile tantrum, and decides it would be more fun to behead endangered species, attack political figures, volunteer for terrorist watchlists, and somehow not be hunted down toward every corner of the Earth.

At least we are treated to a dozen fights with villains-of-the-week. As I previously mentioned, the second-to-last fight is between Yujiro and one of the higher-ups who organize the tournaments. Yujiro beats him to death and leaves. However, the next villain-of-the-week uses shonen magic-I mean Hokuto Shinken-I mean “advanced surgical techniques” to revive this character, to the relief of no one except the extremely annoying, tiny old man who runs the tournament when he isn’t failing at comedic relief. The character should have stayed dead so that there would be some gravity to the situation and so that there would be more emphasis on going after Yujiro, because then it wouldn’t just be Baki who has a bone to pick with him. It is also anticlimactic to end the series on a fight between Baki and a villain-of-the-week. The order of the fights should have been swapped, and had that fight ended with that character dying, it would have made a great cliffhanger for the next season. I didn’t expect the plot to have a conclusive ending or wrap up by the end, but they could have at least tried to make it more enticing. Sometimes it doesn’t hurt to take the story in a different direction than the author. But that would have taken talented writing, something which this formulaic rush-job clearly didn’t have.The animation, when it isn’t being outsourced to meth addicts, has a distinct-enough look that makes it stand out a little bit. It has that early-2000s look where everything seemed like there was more attitude or experimentation behind it. It looks fine enough during static shots. In motion, it does enough to get the point across and not much else. There aren’t too many memorable shots. The 1994 OVA is more pleasing from an artistic standpoint because it was cel and achieved with what was probably a low budget, but I won’t lie; it wasn’t that impressive either. The music of the series is one of its high points, with an energetic and happy OP song to contrast with the somewhat dark tone of the series. The ED song is a similar case, except it is more relaxed. The background score does its job and suits the fights well, but with the exception of one or two tracks, it is mostly forgettable.Overall, Grappler Baki suffers from too many cliches, too much predictability, and too much stagnation. In effect, that makes it a victim of its own genre. You understandably may not choose to watch a shonen series for a brilliantly-written story, but because of the painstaking buildup to fights with boring and forgettable villains, and then the fights themselves being not-so-impressive and continually interrupted with mindless chatter explaining to us what we can already see with our own eyes, you will be left bored and tired. Most of the positives come from some of the technical aspects rather than the very thin and drawn-out story, characters, or fight scenes. The only character development there seems to be is Baki getting stronger and hating Yujiro more than before, and bad guys turning into good guys. You will be left disappointed at the ending, and while you may consider watching the second season, be warned that it does not conclude the story and consists of entirely filler. Basically, everything bad about this season is all there is in the next one. Instead of watching this series, watch Bloodsport and the original Mortal Kombat. You will get much more fun out of them if you want to see deadly tournaments with enjoyable fights. Otherwise, don’t waste your time watching this series unless you love repetitiveness and monotony."", ""As I finished the first episode of Baki, the thought crossed my mind that there wouldn't be much to say about it. And I was right. Don't expect anything original from this anime. It follows the same old story of a buffed-up brat who wants to be the strongest man in the world. He pushes himself through over-the-top training, life-or-death situations, and brawls against a hundred thugs, a 2.5-meter-tall kid, or some kind of mutant ape to achieve his dream. As a result, he keeps getting stronger, meeting stronger dudes and beating them with stronger blows.This show is filled with cheesiness, and sometimes, it's god-awful...and hard to digest. You can expect to see typical cliché characters who are too full of themselves with their manly nonsense, long and tiring speeches during fights between the combatants, explaining their techniques, remembering their oh-so-touching pasts, etc. The typical useless side characters in this show comment on the fights by making some insipid observations or getting impressed over the most childish tactics ever.It's quite obvious to me that Grappler Baki is a perfect candidate for a genre parody. I mean, I found myself laughing out loud at times when I wasn't even supposed to. But let's be real here, Baki's story is nothing but an unoriginal, uninspiring, and unsubstantial tale about the pride of a manly man who simply wants to outdo himself by beating the crap out of everyone in his way, which is often portrayed as something positive. And don't even get me started on those two messy, badly executed time skips, which had nothing much going on except for Baki becoming stronger and changing his hairstyle.It's hard to ignore the fact that the characters in this anime lack depth and complexity. Most of them exist solely to be defeated by Baki or his father, engaging in idle chatter during fights or simply filling up some spare airtime. The series swiftly discards quite a few characters, as they serve their purpose as mere cannon fodder. The anime tries to inject some pseudo-dramatic flashbacks during their fights, perhaps in an attempt to falsely imbue them with depth or minimal likability.As for Baki's father, Hanma Yujirou, we learn three essential things about him: He's very strong. He's a former soldier. He's a real jerk. Yes, that's it. His excessive strength fuels an inflated sense of self, making him believe he can do as he pleases. In a fictional world where every Japanese man is either gigantic or possesses muscles larger than their heads, and personal worth is seemingly measured by how arrogant and brutish one can be, there are no surprises.Baki's mother fares no better as a character, perhaps worse, given her lack of utility in fights. Everything we learn about her can be condensed into a sentence: a sadistic woman head over heels for Hanma Yujirou. As the anime progresses, this character becomes progressively grating and irksome.Baki himself starts off as an unlikable brat who lucked into a leading role. He's selfish, immature, and prone to violence. However, he surprisingly morphs into a more polite and tolerable character, with a few redeeming qualities that make him marginally likable. Nevertheless, he remains rather plain, much like the rest of the cast.Overall, I found Grappler Baki to be mindless yet mildly amusing entertainment. and hard to digest.

I really really loved the 2018 version of Baki so I decided to start from the basics and watch the orignial 2001 ""Grappler Baki"" and oh god how dissapointed I was. I won\'t go over about the plot or about the story, i\'m just gonna focus on the personality of the characters.From episode 1 Baki has totally diffrent personallty from the 2018 version and not in a good way. The 13 years old Baki is a very robotic character with...no personallty, every time he cries, every time he laughs, every time he\'s angry, nothing feels humanaic and real, no matter how much the serias will try bring the emotinal side from you, it just can\'t happen. If you want poeple to cry from scenes make sure that the characters are humas and not robots... through out the serias Baki is full of hate about his father Hanma Yujiro ""The Ogre"" for bieng a piece of shit (which he totally is) but the problem is that you really can\'t feel the anger trough Baki\'s hatred, it is not something I can describe in words, the characters are totally fucking robots i\'m not kidding about this one.To sum it up, If your\'e new to Baki I would reccomend to skip trough to the 2018 version but if you want to start from the start I won\'t stop you of course. Baki the 2001 version is a robotic anime with no persoanallty that will leave you with a bad impression about animes in general that came out in the same year.Go watch fucking Boku no Pico or something I don\'t know, just keep away from this anime and skip to the 2018 version no personallty, every time he cries, every time he laughs, every time he\'s angry, nothing feels humanaic and real, no matter how much the serias will try bring the emotinal side from you, it just can\'t happen.

Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/587/Hanbun_no_Tsuki_ga_Noboru_Sora,"['&ldquo;Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hantsuki&rdquo;, as I will call it from now on, is yet another drama and romance anime. It&rsquo;s a really happy and sad anime at the same time, which spans over only 6 episodes. That paradox feeling one gets is quite unique to this series.Story:Though Hantsuki is limited to only 6 episodes, its still a wonderful story which leaves no questions open. The story is about a boy, Yuichi, who is hospitalized due to hepatitis over the winter. He&rsquo;s really just bored having to stay in this hospital the whole time and keeps on trying to escape, thus having...to run away from and deal with the nurse. While in the hospital he encounters a girl called Rika. Amazed by her beauty he kind of falls for her, but she keeps on acting very selfish. After Yuichi figures out why Rika is in the hospital, he begins to understand and feel sorry for her - she doesn&rsquo;t have very long to live.That said, the story goes through how the doctor of Yuichi had a similar relationship with a girl quite some time ago and gets mad at Yuichi because he sees himself in him. It even gets to the point where he lashes out and beats him up. Other then that, the story is all about Yuichi and Rika finding their love. It&rsquo;s really interesting though how, although Rika is acting really mean and selfish towards Yuichi, you still begin to like her character.The story ends both very happy and very tragic, which makes the perfect ending for this show, though it is very short.BTW: Be careful to watch past the ending of the last show.Animation:The animation is very well done. I found the characters to be designed in a very &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; way, making it easier to identify with them. I don&rsquo;t really now what else to say, except the animation at no point bothered me.Sound:The sound, as in most romance/ drama anime, is made to fit the mood perfectly and make the experience more immersive. This show succeeds in doing so.Characters:All but 1 character (the friend of the nurse) are very easy to sympathize with. At the end of the show you don&rsquo;t really hold a grudge against any character, since they all had their reasons for doing what they had done.I found the characters to be very well fleshed out, especially Rika. The show also does a good job showing the situation Rika is in - already ready to die, but yet falling in love.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this show very much. I think that 6 episodes is the perfect length for this series, since it is really fast paced and doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;dick around&rdquo; as many other senseless romance/ drama anime do. I&rsquo;d maybe only like to see an OVA showing how life is after the hospital or after Rikas death. Still, I highly recommend this show! to run away from and deal with the nurse.

Still, I highly recommend this show!', '5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: BITTERSWEETThe simplest way I could described Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora (or simply HanTsuki) is by saying that it&rsquo;s bittersweet. I&rsquo;m sure that the people who have watched this would have a similar opinion.The reason why it&rsquo;s so bittersweet for me is that even with the fun, happy comedic moments (a stack of porn and zebra man), I still get the feeling that something will go wrong, and it does happen. Even if it&rsquo;s like that, I still think it couldn&rsquo;t have gone in the better way, because if things went the way you wanted it to, wouldn&rsquo;t that...be boring (hey this applies to real life too, huh)? It doesn&rsquo;t sugarcoat anything (specifically Rika&rsquo;s condition) and I guess in that way, it&rsquo;s realistic.As for the two main characters, I have to say Yuichi and Rika is the best anime couple I&rsquo;ve ever seen. They have chemistry, and I love their individual characters. They&rsquo;re both so different, but they go well with each other. Akiko the nurse was also hilarious, and I hated Doctor Natsume at first, thinking he was some sort of lolicon, but in the end I understood why he was so protective of Rika.From one shonen romance to another, Kenichi Suzumara (Kyoichi Kanzaki from Boys Be&hellip;) played the male protagonist of HanTsuki very well. I thought his voice was gentle, yet it had a hint of mischief in it, which is perfect for Yuichi&rsquo;s character. Mikako Takahashi (Rika) is another familiar name for me, but her voice was different this time. Her voice was tinier (but resilient). Maybe it&rsquo;s because of Rika&rsquo;s loli and slight tsundere character.Visuals were okay. There wasn&rsquo;t really anything that I haven&rsquo;t seen before in other series, except maybe for the shiny (possibly oily) faces. It kind of bothered me that the characters looked chubby though, but I guess that&rsquo;s part of the cute look they were going for.The music was okay too. It&rsquo;s your typical shoujo music, except this time it&rsquo;s for a shonen romance. I&rsquo;m not a fan of mellow music, but it wasn&rsquo;t really that mellow.The greatest strength of this anime is its story and the character interactions. I overlooked all the other details and focused on the relationship of Yuichi and Rika, and the circumstances around them. That is why I was entertained from beginning to finish. be boring (hey this applies to real life too, huh)?

That is why I was entertained from beginning to finish.', ""I'm really glad I actually sat down and watched this one fully. It only took a day, but what a day it was worth. I've watched many popular romance animes such as Clannad and Konan and can say nicely that, if it wanted to, this anime could have been on their level IF not greater.There are a few things holding it back, though, which makes an unsatisfied feeling. I'll fully explain that through this review.~ WARNING: possible spoilers ~~ Story 8/10 ~The story is nice and not over the top. It's realistic which blends well for it's dramatic feeling. Our main character is sick with...Hepatitis A. Not dangerous but he will be relaxing at the hospital for some time. Quickly we learn our main character is the adventurous type and tries to leave the hospital numerous times for self enjoyment if the nurse doesn't catch him and tosses him back into the hospital bed.Although Yuuichi Ezaki spends time talking to his nurse and a couple of the hospital residents, he seems a bit bored at his bed-resting lifestyle even if his school friends visit him.This seems to change when the nurse brings up a girl from East Ward:Rika Akiba.Yuuichi goes to visit Rika and they slowly grow attached to one another.However, Yuuichi doesn't have too much to worry about.On the other hand, Rika is in a different situation and suffers from heart complications that will keep her from living not too long.The story revolves mostly around the evolving relationship of both these characters as they deal with each others' emotions, pasts, and illnesses.It all comes down to Yuuichi to decide for himself on what he should do if Rika will die soon.It follows a realistic pattern without things getting too hectic from the story. You will greatly enjoy the small comedy and laid-back feeling you get watching this as light drama comes in. You will ESPECIALLY enjoy the sudden random bits of huge drama out of nowhere happens, changing your view of the story or characters as soon as you find out.Dialogue and personality mostly makes this anime what it is which would be a must watch.~ Art 8/10 ~The art is lovely. It's not overly done and is greatly nice. Sure, you may not find breath-taking animations or art, but that's not the appeal of the anime. There isn't a need to focus on that. Even so, it does well to add in little bits and extras to atleast make it look pretty nice. Character designs are nice and background designs are also done well.~ Sound 8/10 ~As the mood changes quite often, so will the music. Although not major, it's small and fits greatly with the mood. It starts at the right moments, not too early or late and displays the current atmosphere of the scene. Is it playful, sad, shocking? The soundtrack goes quite well to display these emotions.The opening and ending themes are also quite enjoyable. They both fit the overall vibe of the anime and were great choices.~ Character 9/10 ~Characters are lovable and easy to grow attached to. Yuuichi is an average high school kid with a kind heart. He's pretty easy going and a bit of a trouble maker. You grow to like his role more and more as you learn about him and see what he does. You'll laugh, you might sympathize with him, and you might even get pissed off. However, he doesn't let down the viewer when it comes down to being his role of a nice, heroic character type.Rika is someone with the slightly stereotypical tsundere personality. Although, it isn't a self defense like most. Rika is naturally socially awkward because of her illness which causes her to act out. She can be slightly mean, judging, and harsh. However, she can be kind, intelligent, understands the idea of justice, and even honest. Her character isn't annoying and quite easy to enjoy.Other characters you will meet and sadly due to the shortness of the anime, wont grow to know too well. However, you will begin to love their roles as you like the nurse's personality, get aggravated at the doctor, root for 'Zebra Mask', and other characters. Sadly, it seems like the story doesn't dwell hard enough to get to the bigger roots of everyone so you can feel attached with every character. Some character don't even seem important at all. With that said, though, most the characters are lovable and hard to forget about.~ Enjoyment 10/10 ~I can't find one thing that I didn't enjoy about this anime. Everything was great. Each episode was great and the story progressed so well. Most focus will be on the characters which the story greatly works hard to display great traits of. It seems each detail, story, information, and everything else in this anime is not only important, but it's tender and loving. The comedy isn't too heavy but noticeable. The drama is consistently existent whether it's light and subtle or heavy and heart breaking. The romance isn't always there, but implied quite well. It's not extremely heavy and greatly focused on the entire time. Although, when it shows, the romance counts greatly. Everything about it doesn't feel too extreme and can grow to moments of on-the-edge suspense when things get hectic. This anime feels unique and without a doubt not feeling like a romantic cliche'. It's touching from start to finish and leaves you with a good feeling of happiness and satisfaction. You'll be constantly surprised and not expecting what will happen and what will be said which is mostly what makes this anime a must watch.Overall:Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora is such a great anime. I didn't know what to expect when watching it. In fact, I was thinking the anime was going to be an average drama/romance. Quickly, however, I was proved wrong. It was well made and well written. Each aspect was taken well care of. What really kept this from getting a higher score you ask?It's potential.This anime has something where it could be great and offer so much but seems to be cut short from time. It was an anime that was squished into only six episodes. Now, yes, not much happens in the anime you'd think as the entire series mostly takes place in the hospital. However, seasons and time passes as you watch and characters change as they speak with one another. Things happen. It feels so....rushed, though. I felt like the anime ended before it even began. One minute, I'm developing into the beginning of a beautiful romance and then it was just over. It was a tasty dish but just too small to enjoy enough. I wanted more from the story, more development, I wanted to learn more about the characters, and just improvement all around. Not because I'm picky, but because there was SSOOOOOOO much to offer.Even though you'll watch this and feel like you didn't get enough, it's still a great anime.If you want a good romance and story, this one is worth checking outIf you have any intention to watch this, give the first episode a chance. You've already finished one/sixth of the series. It's not that long. I'm sure the first episode will already have you wanting more. Hepatitis A.

It seems each detail, story, information, and everything else in this anime is not only important, but it's tender and loving. The comedy isn't too heavy but noticeable. The drama is consistently existent whether it's light and subtle or heavy and heart breaking. The romance isn't always there, but implied quite well. It's not extremely heavy and greatly focused on the entire time. Although, when it shows, the romance counts greatly. Everything about it doesn't feel too extreme and can grow to moments of on-the-edge suspense when things get hectic. This anime feels unique and without a doubt not feeling like a romantic cliche'. It's touching from start to finish and leaves you with a good feeling of happiness and satisfaction. You'll be constantly surprised and not expecting what will happen and what will be said which is mostly what makes this anime a must watch.Overall:Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora is such a great anime. I didn't know what to expect when watching it. In fact, I was thinking the anime was going to be an average drama/romance. Quickly, however, I was proved wrong. It was well made and well written. Each aspect was taken well care of. What really kept this from getting a higher score you ask?It's potential.This anime has something where it could be great and offer so much but seems to be cut short from time. It was an anime that was squished into only six episodes. Now, yes, not much happens in the anime you'd think as the entire series mostly takes place in the hospital. However, seasons and time passes as you watch and characters change as they speak with one another. Things happen. It feels so....rushed, though. I felt like the anime ended before it even began. One minute, I'm developing into the beginning of a beautiful romance and then it was just over. It was a tasty dish but just too small to enjoy enough. I wanted more from the story, more development, I wanted to learn more about the characters, and just improvement all around. Not because I'm picky, but because there was SSOOOOOOO much to offer.Even though you'll watch this and feel like you didn't get enough, it's still a great anime.If you want a good romance and story, this one is worth checking outIf you have any intention to watch this, give the first episode a chance. You've already finished one/sixth of the series. It's not that long. I'm sure the first episode will already have you wanting more."", ""When I first was recommended Hanbun by a friend of mine, I didn't expect much. I thought this would be your run-of-the-mill, unoriginal, stereotypical romance anime.After watching just the first episode, however, I realized that I was wrong.Story - 10Even though the anime is a mere six episodes, the storyline and plot was very well done. What I liked about it the most was that there was not a boring, or unneeded moment; everything was there for a particular purpose. Allthough this kind of story may seem typical to some viewers, I found it to be more than that. At times it could be...very depressing, seeming that there would be no room for any happiness or comedic value whatsoever. But then I would be surprised when they could throw in funny comments or situations, while still keeping the plot intact and staying true to the original concept.Another wonderful thing about the storyline was the ending - it was both a happy and sad moment, but fitting. It answered all the questions that the viewer needed to know, and it was executed very well.Art - 10I really enjoyed the artwork in this anime as well. It wasn't the over-dramatic, big-eyed, crazy style that you might usually see, but a more realistic, simplistic style that fitted the storyline quite well. The scenery was also well done, and as said before, was in a more &quot;realistic&quot; style.Sound - 9Not much to say about it, but the important thing is that it fit. The OP and ED were touching, and were relaxing and easy to watch. Allthough the background music was nothing groundbreaking, it had its moments, and fit the anime's concept quite well.Character - 9Every character was likeable in his/her own way - whether it be Tanizaki the crazy but caring nurse for the more upbeat, comedic moments, or the wonderful chemistry between the somewhat shy Yūichi, and the stubborn, but loving, Rika. The only character that I had trouble connecting at first was Natsume, but by the end of the show you realize that he had reasons for his actions.Enjoyment - 10Obviously, I enjoyed this anime very much, or I wouldn't have given it such a high rating. There were times when I laughed, and there were times when I cryed. Allthough I felt this anime was very depressing at times, it was still very enjoyable to watch.Overall, this was a great romance/drama. It didn't have any excessive crap that you see in some romance anime's now-a-days, and it kept me interested until the very end (and when I mean the VERY end, I mean it. Make sure to stick around after the credits ;) ).So, if you are looking for a good romance/drama anime with no frills attached, then watch this.

I would imagine a hospital being a somewhat orderly establishment—a place where the sick patients can relax (unless we’re talking about a psychiatric ward… which we aren’t). A hospital would most likely be quiet, monotone, and serious, with a somewhat melancholic vibe for obvious reasons.What does this have to do with Hantsuki? Well, this anime mostly takes place in what seems to be a small, local hospital. By the way, this hospital breaks every single rule that can be broken. Even factoring in that this hospital is small (meaning that...it’s bound to be a little weird) and that this is a six episode long anime (meaning that it’s bound to be a little weird), the things that happen are somewhat over the top. Occasionally, it’s funny; other times, the occurrences end up more than a little weird for reasons that I will go over later. For now, let’s just say that the latter take themselves seriously and expect us to take them seriously. The reason why this fails is because there’s a thin line between knowing it would never happen but not minding and knowing that it would never happen so deeply that you find yourself distracted by that fact while watching the anime. There’s a difference between your eyes glittering with an otaku’s delight (ahem, harem, ahem) and finding a frown on your face that resembles the expression of painful constipation. I don’t think Hanbun Sora is that bad, though, and I’m speaking from experience. Do not fret—the only thing related to my personal life that we’ll be talking about today is this anime that I spent my time on.The last three words of the previous statement tie into what Hantsuki is all about. It’s about time—savoring it, using it wisely, cherishing what you had—and even our main character Yuuichi is bound by this philosophy. He is an active teenager who believes more in using his time wisely; even if he is ill, having contracted hepatitis A, he resists recovering quietly in the hospital and treats his boredom by sneaking out. First of all, he does so with ease by just hiding a bit and walking slowly, which isn’t something that I can comprehend. In a hospital, the patients absolutely would not be allowed to wander around the hospital without supervision, and there’s no way that the security would be so light that anyone would sneak out that easily, even with the rebel nurse in charge. Yuuichi does this repeatedly, even taking out another sick patient, Rika, and is never punished except by the nurse, who gives him a bit of a beating that can be chalked up to comic relief. Everything is viewed with such a nonchalant attitude, devoid of reality or logic, until obviously written and somewhat cheap twists come in, and we’re forced to think, “Oh, they meant for this to be important? I see.”In six episodes, we all know that Hantsuki won’t be able to tell what something like Clannad might, but at the same time, the story is simple and shouldn’t have been complicated. It’s about a boy named Yuuichi, who meets an enigmatic girl named Rika. She has a disease but they care about one another, meaning conflict. Twists are expected and even welcomed to spice up the story, but in this amount of time, such an anime should not try so hard at something it won’t be able to achieve. They cram melodrama, love, patient abuse, two people to complicate things, grief, and yearning into six episodes; a melancholic, deep atmosphere is attempted and a cheesy, dramatic, immature one is created. Why? The anime can’t keep up with itself. One episode, something that it seems was meant to be serious happens, but by the beginning of the next scene, that atmosphere is gone or just not well handled, leaving a particularly sour taste because of poor writing.The reason why the twists weren’t well handled of Hantsuki is somewhat attributed to the sound and animation, as, while the art or music in itself isn’t bad, the way that it’s used isn’t all that amazing. There are times when errors can be seen in the art, sure, but the largest downside is the animation in itself. A character does something like, for example, punching a wall in frustration and thanks to the angle, the jarring impact that could have been achieved comes across as dull. This isn’t helped by the voice acting, which I think occasionally came across as emotionless when the emotion was supposed to be at the highest point. Even the expressions are simple. Sometimes the music, which is good by itself, doesn’t fit the scene or an obvious sound is placed in to emphasize that something happened, making the atmosphere fall flat. This is not helped by the cast.Every character has his or her place, every character seems to have a story, and every character moves along the plot, but that’s it. The supporting characters are much more intriguing than the main characters, though they unfortunately get little meaningful screen time or development. The mains, Yuuichi and Rika, have no “in between”—no underlying development. Rika is a brat one second and is sweet the next, as though permanently on PMS. Yuuichi ranges from pushover to “brave” in his stupidity, as though testosterone is being experienced for the first time. He was tolerable until one of his worst moments, where he had absolutely no backbone simply because of depression (and was over it by the next day). The relationship between these two is just there, as though they mutually agreed one day that they loved each other, and we’re forced to think, “Oh? Looks like they like each other. Huh.”It is the sad truth that I found Hantsuki overwhelmingly disappointing. It didn’t fit. It didn’t piece together. I can see why people would like Hantsuki, but the best anime calms the part of my personality that scrutinizes deeply while I am watching. If you enjoy somewhat cheesy, melodramatic love stories, you might just have an opinion that greatly differs from mine. On the other hand, I think too much to enjoy something that is so obviously trying to make conflict and, like a slap in the face, does it in cheap, unimaginative ways.If I could tell Hantsuki one thing, I’d say, “Your audience is not dumb.” it’s bound to be a little weird) and that this is a six episode long anime (meaning that it’s bound to be a little weird), the things that happen are somewhat over the top.

In only short 6 episodes, it's hard to care about the characters. However, its length wouldn't be a problem if they hadn't tried to add so much information in every episode. For instance, in the first episode alone, Yuuichi is already practically professing his love for this girl who's acted like a brat for the previous 20 minutes of screening. It...just didn't feel believable.The characters and their actions felt forced, too. I can't decide if Rika is a major tsundere or just really bratty. Hell, even if she IS a tsundere - which I usually love - I don't like her at all, and I honestly don't know what Yuuichi saw in her in the first place. In turn, Yuuichi needs to grow a backbone. My favourite character was Sekoguchi, and seeing he's got such a minor role, that's just sad.The art was good, the soundtrack decent, but the animation definitively could've been better. There were scenes where the characters' movements looked really unnatural.Overall, I found this somewhat enjoyable. Maybe if this were a full length series - with better character development and an unrushed plot - I'd give it a rating higher than fair. just didn't feel believable.The characters and their actions felt forced, too.

This was the first synopsis I&rsquo;ve read about Hantsuki a few years ago and was immediately excited.  After reading this synopsis one can already tell what the story is like as well as learn of my masochistic tendencies.Hantsuki does sound and play out like a stereotypical Asian drama.  In fact, I hear that there was a live action adaptation of Hantsuki.  However, what makes Hantsuki is the execution of the story...and the short run.  This anime title was only 6 episodes long so they had to focus on the main story of Rika and Yuuichi.  Very little is wasted and everything seems to push the story forward.  Even Natsume&rsquo;s story is related to the main story of Rika and Yuuichi.  On the other hand, Hantsuki suffers from several &lsquo;extremes.&rsquo;  Hantsuki lacks subtly, many of the things the characters do push the borders of reality.  For example, Yuuichi&rsquo;s friend zebra mask, the crazy nurse, and various other events.As for the characters, here where things start to get interesting.  The interactions between Rika and Yuuichi are quite nice to watch as they grow closer to one another.  Rika is a tsundere however, her &lsquo;tsun&rsquo; was too pronounced, especially for the first 2 episodes.  The things she does borders on abuse and can be very uncomfortable to watch.  This is primarily why I stopped watching Zero no Tsukaima II.  I don&rsquo;t find anything funny when one character abuses another in a realistic fashion (think of this, what if the genders were reversed?).  Yes, she has her reasons but, her actions were way too much for me.  Thankfully, she gets better after the 2nd episodes.  In addition, Natsume also does similar things to Yuuichi.  Once again he has is reason but, the things he does are quite extremeMuch of my enjoyment of Hantsuki comes from the 2nd half, when the drama hits.  In particular, I enjoyed the scene with the book and Natsume&rsquo;s own story overlapping.  However, Hantsuki isn&rsquo;t completely sad as there are plenty of comedic moments to lighten up the mood (although its a bit much sometimes).  Hantsuki doesn&rsquo;t fall for the trap of going straight to the drama, as many stories do.  The first half did its job to build up the characters to make the 2nd half, when the drama hits, have more impact.I rather enjoyed the music in Hantsuki.  There are typical violin and piano pieces however, there are a good about of guitar pieces.  In particular, the OP really stood out for me.  The simple use of character stills, minimal animation, symbolism, and music really worked for a series like this.  In addition, a series like this doesn&rsquo;t need the highest budget for animation.  Never the less, I would have liked it if they had spent more money on the animation.

So basically, this boy, has Hepatitis A (Don\'t worry, it almost never is mentioned past Episode 3) and is stuck in a hospital. He meets a girl who has a condition where her heart doesn\'t work so good. From the start, I knew that she was going to die because it was so plainly obvious.Anyway, the story is quite bad. It doesn\'t work well, drags on a lot, and doesn\'t connect alot, along with not making along a sense. I know its 6 episodes but Wolf Children did...more and is a million times better then this even with only 2 hours. It would have really benefited from being longer. I mean, even if they had to throw in a full fillers, it would have made it better.Anyway, the animation is low quality. The budget cuts and workarounds are so obvious to see. Like, sloppy faces, slow movement and action, the camera being zoomed in one image and then just moving, characters being frozen in time, lip flaps etc. The animation was clearly rushed and is so low budget that it\'s hard to watch.The characters are also incredibly unlikeable. The doctor at the hospital, assaulted our main character while intoxicated basically kicking him while he was whimpering on the ground and our MC doesn\'t seem to want to mention it, nor does the guy get in trouble. He also actively tried to sabotage the relationship between our two mcs. He also cheated on his dying wife.Our Mcs are also unlikable. Ezaki, keeps worsening his condition, even though it\'s doing nothing good for him, and Rika is a such a commanding brat. All she does is complain, and she almost never seems to be having fun around Ezaki. But Ezaki somehow fell in love with her in the third episode.Like seriously, all Rika ever did was be a bratty little shit to Ezaki, always complaining, being commanding, bitching etc, but somehow, Ezaki fell in love with her. Like its almost just skimmed over and were just made to believe that they are in a serious romantic relationships. I think the writer forgot what fucking character development was.We also never are told what Rika\'s disease is, so when the author can\'t even provide a name, you know they are a bad writer. The story reads like a bad mediocre fanfiction written by a 10 year old on an ipad. Shit goes from one thing to the next, skimming over stuff, leaving out sections, just forgetting plot points and backstories, just completely not giving a shit etc.Ezaki\'s nurse also abuses Ezaki, hitting him on the head, making him pee in a bottle, locking him inside his hospital room, invading his privacy etc. She also ""punished"" one of her friends, where the lady said ""My Body went flying"". Seems like she has violent tendencies to say the least.The old man was a perverted pedophile who gave a young underage boy various porn magazines and literally nobody seems to have a problem with it.  The hospital is fucked.Also I forgot to mention how Ezaki\'s Nurse\'s friend, literally tried to have sex with Ezaki, when he was 17 years old. They were literally in the bed and she was about to take off his pants. Like seriously, Ezaki just didn\'t give a shit, like he was just braindead.Either, Ezaki had forgotten how to use his brain, or the writer didn\'t care about writing a good scene, so instead he decided not to have Ezaki react to anything happening, so he could just get his mandatory cleavage shot. The sex was only stopped by Ezakis Nurse ringing the doorbell. Then after she found it, she proceeds to strike Ezaki on the face mutiple times, even when he was her patient.Like seriously, did she think Ezaki was the instigator of it? I would blame the fucking grown ass adult for trying to fuck a 17 year old, when she knows he can\'t fully make mature decisions.Like, every single person in this anime is either abusive, bratty, stupid, or a pedophile. The hospital setting is completely unrealistic, the person who wrote this, doesn\'t know what the fuck a hospital is like.Because the patients with deadly illnesses can just walk out whenever they want. Let\'s also not forgot the fact that the writers were trying to portray a ""tragic"" story. But the half assed humour that barely works, the incredibly unlikeable characters, and the odd shift of seriousness, and humourous don\'t make it tragic at all. Well its tragic for the inevitable firing of all the staff there, but not for the story.Oh and to add onto the absolute disaster this anime was, the ending was so stupid, It made me burst out in laughter, and like Cry Laugh for almost 3 minutes. Like it was so fucking stupid, it was so trying so hard to be cool and serious but just failed spectacularly. You need to watch the end to believe me that it was so fucking funny and all for the wrong reasons.The anime completely failed in making me care about the characters and actively made me dislike the characters. It didn\'t have enough time to build them up, nor were the people who made it, skilled enough to make an anime. It completely fails in every subjectJust don\'t watch this anime. Its pretty bad. With horrible animation, character building, characters, art, and story, its just a horrible watch all together. more and is a million times better then this even with only 2 hours. It would have really benefited from being longer. I mean, even if they had to throw in a full fillers, it would have made it better.Anyway, the animation is low quality. The budget cuts and workarounds are so obvious to see. Like, sloppy faces, slow movement and action, the camera being zoomed in one image and then just moving, characters being frozen in time, lip flaps etc. The animation was clearly rushed and is so low budget that it\'s hard to watch.The characters are also incredibly unlikeable. The doctor at the hospital, assaulted our main character while intoxicated basically kicking him while he was whimpering on the ground and our MC doesn\'t seem to want to mention it, nor does the guy get in trouble. He also actively tried to sabotage the relationship between our two mcs. He also cheated on his dying wife.Our Mcs are also unlikable. Ezaki, keeps worsening his condition, even though it\'s doing nothing good for him, and Rika is a such a commanding brat. All she does is complain, and she almost never seems to be having fun around Ezaki. But Ezaki somehow fell in love with her in the third episode.Like seriously, all Rika ever did was be a bratty little shit to Ezaki, always complaining, being commanding, bitching etc, but somehow, Ezaki fell in love with her. Like its almost just skimmed over and were just made to believe that they are in a serious romantic relationships. I think the writer forgot what fucking character development was.We also never are told what Rika\'s disease is, so when the author can\'t even provide a name, you know they are a bad writer. The story reads like a bad mediocre fanfiction written by a 10 year old on an ipad. Shit goes from one thing to the next, skimming over stuff, leaving out sections, just forgetting plot points and backstories, just completely not giving a shit etc.Ezaki\'s nurse also abuses Ezaki, hitting him on the head, making him pee in a bottle, locking him inside his hospital room, invading his privacy etc. She also ""punished"" one of her friends, where the lady said ""My Body went flying"". Seems like she has violent tendencies to say the least.The old man was a perverted pedophile who gave a young underage boy various porn magazines and literally nobody seems to have a problem with it.  The hospital is fucked.Also I forgot to mention how Ezaki\'s Nurse\'s friend, literally tried to have sex with Ezaki, when he was 17 years old. They were literally in the bed and she was about to take off his pants.

They are fairly fleshed out, believable and likeable, although  I sometimes got a tsundere vibe from Rika . While they get enough development to justify it...as good for a 6 episode series, it isnt groundbreaking. the strongest point would be the interaction of these two. The side characters are mostly there for plot purposes or sometimes comedic relief and arent worth mentioning. Overall the selling point would be the relatability of the main cast.Art and Sound:   ( 10/10)Perhaps what I liked most about this show despite the main characters was the music, especially the opening. It fits well and catches the theme of the series very well. The Art is fitting, animation might not be the best but it is fine for a show such as this one. All in all it looks very good.Enjoyment: ( 10/10)If you want something a little bit more dramatic than your typical romance and dont need any fanservice then go ahead and check this one out. as good for a 6 episode series, it isnt groundbreaking. the strongest point would be the interaction of these two.

Its set in a hospital, and outside forces are seeing to it that romance is always put to the test.I recommend this anime to any who like romance anime.

In general, without any spoilers, it\'s about a seventeen-year old boy named Ezaki Yuiichi that gets affected by hepatitis A, thus he had to reside in his small town hospital for a period of time. During his stay, he usually gets bored and goes out to console his boredom, but when he comes back to the hospital, he will occasionally get beaten up by his assigned...nurse, Tanizaki Akiko. One day, Ezaki Yuuichi meets a girl his age at the eastern side of the hospital, where most serious cases reside. Her name is Akiba Rika and Yuuichi eventually finds out that she\'s suffering from a critical heart disease that will eventually end her life. Over time, Rika and Yuuichi get to know each other and fall in love. There are some melancholy and dramatic parts, but it gets evened out with a little bit of comedy that somewhat eases the mood. Even though there are only six episodes in the whole anime, it feels more complete than other animes I\'ve watched. The ending had left no other remaining questions I may have, although it may be pleasant yet sorrowful at the same time.Animation/Art:I felt that the animation of HanTsuki was very well done. I thoroughly enjoyed their unique, geniune looks and I felt that the voice actors did a fine job. Overall, I had no accusations about the animation or the art.Sound/Music:The soundtracks fit the feelings and the meaning of the anime fairly well. It made the experience more tragic yet hopeful. The opening song of HanTsuki did a great job in emphasizing the main, overall theme/idea of the story, and the ending song was peaceful and relaxing.Characters:The main characters, Yuuichi and Rika are obviously my favourite characters because of their personalities and the situation they\'re in. But, some of the secondary characters, such as Yuuichi\'s school friends aren\'t as memorable. Probably because the anime didn\'t give any further background knowledge about them. If they included that, then the anime would have been more interesting. But of course, the anime only had six episodes to begin with, so that must be the reason why they mainly focused on Yuuichi and Rika\'s relationship.

If they\'re well enough to do that, why the hell are they taking up space in the hospital? Not only that, everyone seem to be able to do whatever they want without any consequences. Locking ill patient outside in the cold? No problem! Abusive Doctors?...That\'s okay too. It takes a hell of a lot just to get anyone to raise an eyebrow in this ""loving and caring"" hospital.Other inexplicable elements include the random actions of the nurse\'s friend, who seem to have a touch of madness in her, and the random appearance of this Zebra mask character... but, if you can manage to sweep all these unrealistic elements into a dusty corner of your mind and ignore it, the rest of the drama elements aren\'t too bad, as there are some rather touching moments. Despite the show\'s tendency to resort to the usage of cheap plot devices in order to conjure up melodrama, it\'s during the quiet periods of melancholy when not much is happening that the anime is at its best.

During his stay he meets Rika Akiba, a self-centered girl who has lived in the hospital for a majority of her life due to a serious heart condition.  Without a surgery (with a low success rate), she will surely die.Story:  Although not a stereotypical romance anime, it was nothing that blew me away.  Many parts of the story I found useless;...the time used for these excess things should have been spent focusing on Yuuchi and Rika's relationship.  I wouldn't have minded the additional parts if the anime was longer and it had more time expand on things.

When I found this, I was looking for recommendations to Kimi ga Nozomu Eien (The Eternity You Wish for) (I think, or it must have been Ef - a Tale of Memories/Melodies.), hoping to find a tragic story (which is hard to do), and this seemed to fit the bill. Though I thought it was a pretty good series, I was actually disappointed by how it ended (I will leave it at that to avoid...spoilers) and, to a lesser degree, the artwork in some areas (more on that later).Ezaki Yuuichi has hepatitis (liver infection caused by a virus) and has to skip school to remain hospitalized for a while. He likes to sneak out sometimes, only to be caught and beaten up by his nurse, Tanizaki Akiko. One day, he sees a new girl in the east wing, which is reserved for serious cases. Akiko tells Yuuichi that there is nothing wrong with the girl, but he should go talk to her. He does, but accidentally lies by pretending to read the same book she, Akiba Rika, reads. When Rika finds out, she makes Yuuichi do her bidding to make up for it, and thus begins their bossy relationship. However, when Yuuichi decides to take Rika to Fortress Mountain, where the latter wishes to go, they have a fight, and he collapses on the ground while trying to say something . . .As you would expect from six episodes, the development is quite fast, but not too much. There is time for both comedy and drama, with no fillers. In every episode, important events happen and, at least in most of them, new characters are introduced who affect the plot in one way or another. What is admirable is Yuuichi\'s perseverance despite being sick himself, putting Rika always ahead. This is how a man should act.What is good about this show is the characters who you will grow to love (except for two that you will hate). The protagonist, Ezaki Yuuichi, is a kind-hearted man who wants to leave his small town for possibly Toukyou. On the other hand, the heroine, Akiba Rika, is a hard-to-please girl who has spent her entire life in hospitals, is always angry and bottles up her emotions (except in front of Ezaki). One of my other disappointments with this anime is Mizutani Miyuki, Yuuichi\'s childhood friend, who could have been a rival to Rika for the former\'s affection, but unfortunately never develops to be one; she only appears in the fourth episode and beyond, but it is never explained why she had not visited sooner, despite Yuuichi\'s other friends frequently showing up. Natsume Gorou has been Rika\'s doctor for years, and can be quite cunning; he always remembers someone when he looks at his lighter, and is known for being a very good physician, even among his older peers. The nurse, Tanizaki Akiko, is a young, tough woman that smokes and does not like to take crap from anyone; she has a good heart, though. A perverted old man, called Tada Yoshizou, roams around the hospital, and is on good terms with Ezaki; he has a large collection of pornography books. Another good friend of Yuuichi\'s is Sekoguchi Tsukasa, who can turn into ""Zebra Man,"" which consists of just wearing a mask to conceal his identity in dangerous situations; Yuuichi thinks that the moment they became friends is when he saw Tsukasa searching for a home to some stray cats in a rainy day, and the former offered to help, in spite of not being able to keep them in his place, but Sekoguchi thinks they have been friends ever since they met. Lastly, Yuuichi has one more classmate that visits him sometimes, Yamanishi Tamotsu, but quintessentially has ulterior motives, bothering Ezaki.Like I said before, the art is actually at a high level, yet there are noticeable errors. When Natsume cries (I think it happens in episode three), I could see that one of his eyebrows is missing at the lower camera angle. Even more annoying is the fact that they flashback that very same scene with the very same mistake. Also, a number of times when Ezaki looks at Akiba while they are talking, it feels like his pupils are not really focused on her and he has ""Itou-Makoto-on-School-Days"" slow reactions to important events. I also do not like how Sekoguchi Tsukasa and his brother\'s eyes are drawn similar to a straight line. Other than that, everything is fine.Still, the seiyuu here are pretty annoying. The heroine in particular, Rika, has the same voice actor as Machi, Ayane\'s older sister from Nagasarete Airantou, which I have seen first, who barely speaks, mostly in a very low monotone, so that killed Rika, who is energetic and talks more frequently, for me. Moreover, One Piece fans should recognize Natsume Gorou\'s seiyuu, the same as Sanji\'s (ironically, they both smoke and have a similar personality (i.e., they are realistic; Gorou is not perverted like Sanji (then again, the former is older)), who I have seen first, too. Maybe they was supposed to, but Tsukasa\'s sounds weak and Akiko\'s sounds muscular. They still could do a lot worse, though.However, the soundtrack is brilliant. More so with the opening sequence, but the ending sequence as well, it is one of those songs you want to listen, and watch, over and over again. They are both quiet, sad, soothing and simply beautiful. They hint a sorrowful finale.Despite its flaws, Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora is an anime I am glad I watched. There are a few (albeit important) loose ends, but the show still manages to provide a somewhat-satisfactory conclusion. I intend to read the manga (as I do with all great anime and vice versa) because I felt some things are left out here.

I also do not like how Sekoguchi Tsukasa and his brother\'s eyes are drawn similar to a straight line. Other than that, everything is fine.Still, the seiyuu here are pretty annoying. The heroine in particular, Rika, has the same voice actor as Machi, Ayane\'s older sister from Nagasarete Airantou, which I have seen first, who barely speaks, mostly in a very low monotone, so that killed Rika, who is energetic and talks more frequently, for me. Moreover, One Piece fans should recognize Natsume Gorou\'s seiyuu, the same as Sanji\'s (ironically, they both smoke and have a similar personality (i.e., they are realistic; Gorou is not perverted like Sanji (then again, the former is older)), who I have seen first, too. Maybe they was supposed to, but Tsukasa\'s sounds weak and Akiko\'s sounds muscular. They still could do a lot worse, though.However, the soundtrack is brilliant. More so with the opening sequence, but the ending sequence as well, it is one of those songs you want to listen, and watch, over and over again. They are both quiet, sad, soothing and simply beautiful. They hint a sorrowful finale.Despite its flaws, Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora is an anime I am glad I watched. There are a few (albeit important) loose ends, but the show still manages to provide a somewhat-satisfactory conclusion. I intend to read the manga (as I do with all great anime and vice versa) because I felt some things are left out here.

This will all be explained in the upcoming paragraphs.Story - The story had so much potential but it was ruined by rushed episodes and weird plot, even after finding out more little details about different characters some of the stuff that happened to the main character didn't make perfect sense in my head.The Comedy was...not that great and was sort of placed in as a filler whereas we could have had more development in those sections,  The Romance seemed quite stale due to many forced encounters between the two main protagonists.The story in general was just very rushed which made me feel overwhelmed, to many situations just happened and as a viewer it was difficult for me to react to.The ending in my opinion was very predictable, but that isn't a bad thing, in many ways it was a good thing, but I just didn't see the ending they picked being the appropriate one (My guess is they were going for a sort of 'love conquers all' ending, but what it seemed to me was more of a 'This needed to happen now' ending.Art - The Art was rather well made and displayed, especially most of the night scenes, due to it being based in a hospital however a lot of the scenes where based in the same bland places (which is find I wouldn't expect a hospital to be all happy and such).The characters all had different uniqueness's about them which corresponded to there personalities rather well.Sound - The Sound is not something I really notice that often, if I can hear it well it is good. Each characters chosen voice actor worked well for them and every voice actor was able to portray different emotions very well. During some scenes the music definitely enhanced what you felt during that chosen moment.Character - Each character has there strengths and weaknesses, however I felt some characters were a little over exaggerated to add an extra weird feel to the whole anime (In my opinion the anime was meant to feel more realistic, but a lot of the anime points towards the abnormal).The 'Villain' is not as such a villain but the characters motives for what they do are terrible and to me it doesn't really suffice what they did during some scenes (However this character was most likely made it be disliked by everyone, but that doesn't mean they should do weird things such as in this anime).Enjoyment - Ah. This part. I enjoyed some parts of this anime, but it was definitely to rushed  for my liking, however everybody has there own tastes which means other most likely will enjoy this. I don't think it has much re watch value, especially since it is only six episodes long, you can get the jist of what is happening fairly easy, I don't think I need to re watch the series at all as I genuinely do not believe it would open my eyes to something I missed (Maybe I am being to stubborn but I believe that what I saw was the finished product and I for one didn't enjoy it.)

It deals with Yuuichi Ezaki, a teenager hospitalized with a minor illness, who is set up with Rika, a girl dealing with a chronic heart issue.Some of the strengths of this anime I think include the animation and soundtrack. Despite being just 6 episodes, the pacing never felt rushed and each episode flowed smoothly into the next. The op and ed were both well done in my opinion and fit the mood of the show. While nothing outstanding, the art was well done, and I...liked the setting of small-town Japan. I also think the show did a good job of creating the vibe of being in a hospital. The references to lesser known literature that Rika makes was also a nice touch.The duo of Yuuichi and Rika were alright I guess, the male protagonist is a little too spineless in most occasions and only really does things when other people tell him to. Rika herself comes off a little too sassy and controlling, despite being terminally ill, similar to Kaori in “Your Lie in April”. For those keeping stats, this is probably one of the only anime where the dude gets with the blue-haired girl and not the redhead.One of the biggest problem that the anime has is its characters, more specifically the adults, whose purpose in the show seems just to make Yuuichi’s life miserable. Akiko, the nurse, is played off as some sort of “tough love” character, and is probably the best of the bunch, although her antics towards Yuuichi get pretty mean. Mr. Tada is a pervert, Rika’s mom is a jerk, but none of that compares to Dr. Natsume, who is without a doubt one of the most despicable and biggest assholes in all of anime. He’s a liar, cheater, conceited jerk, who basically spends every scene making our protagonist feel bad. His backstory only makes him seem even worse.Another issue I have with the show is despite it taking on the realities of illness and death, the anime can be pretty unrealistic. Despite the hospital setting, our protagonist sneak in and out with out too much trouble. I’d also like to know what hospital has a staff that spend most of their time smoking, drinking, and physically abusing their patients. The last episode especially struck me as especially improbable, with Yuuichi swinging around the walls of the hospital on a rope like he’s spider-man or something.Finally the last bone I have to pick with this is that the comedy in the anime is completely out of place most of the time. “Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora” has this odd, sexual sense of humor that wouldn’t be out of place in an ecchi show, but sticks out like a sore thumb in something that is supposed to be serious and mature. Nothing explicit is ever shown, but a lot of it just came off as unnecessary and really stupid.All that said I think “Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora” is still a decent anime. No spoilers but the last scene is really beautiful, it’s not a happily-ever-after nor is it a downer ending, it manages to be sign off on a simultaneously bittersweet and wholesome note. The finale definitely made up for the sub-par aspects of the show for me, and while I did enjoy “Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora”, it’s an anime I wish I could’ve liked even more if it weren’t for the aforementioned issues.

In my opinion, it definitely defeats CLANNAD, Air, and (possibly) Kanon.Story: 10/10. It contains a decent amount of realism, but definitely not to the point where the anime gets dull. The story is also short, but yet it feels like it\'s well paced, never feels rushed or dragged on, and I would not have lengthened the series at all.Art: 10/10 I don\'t know. I never failed my Art class, but I wasn\'t godly at it either. Don\'t expect any critique from me, as it is basically invalid. All I...can say is that I enjoyed the animation and art style.Sound: 10/10 The songs throughout the series made the dramatic scenes much more dramatic, made the comedic scenes and overall improved the entire show. The OP accurately conveys the emotions and romantic development that you should expect, and the ED is just as calming and relaxing as the OP.Character: 9/10. The main problem with the characters are the doctors. The nurse, a typical tsundere that smokes in the hospital as well as Natsume, the lead physician for Rika. While they were dislikeable at first (mainly Natsume) their motives were made clear, and showed quite a large amount of character development. All the characters in the series were likeable and the end, and Natsume had been forgiven by me. Unfortunately, Natsume pissed me off so much it had led to me yelling at the monitor, ""YOU SICK BASTARD, YOU DON\'T DESERVE TO BE A DOCTOR!"" Regardless, the characters were still enjoyable.Overall: 10/10. While if you check my ratings, they all are really high, it is because I cannot rate them a "".5"" or some anything in between, and even if there is a method, the scores are what the series deserves. This anime had been outstanding for such a short time, amazing pacing, and enough comedy as well as drama to the point when they both synergized with each other, and made for an outstanding series.

It’s about a boy who is admitted to a hospital and befriends a girl who is also in the hospital. As they become closer their feeling grow closer and closer, however the girl has a fatal disease and does not have much longer to live. So they make the best out of what remaining time she has left.The story is really good and I really wanted to give this a 10/10 but the show is just too short and while the story does...an amazing job of pulling you in, it’s just too short for it to elaborate on a few topics. I.e. the relation between the doctor and Rika (female main character).Art 9/10The art is very well done for how old the show is. While I do think it could be much better if it was remade with current art style it does a great job at portraying every detail?Sound 7/10The sound is only getting this rating because there wasn’t much of it to set the mood. The mood was set by just the story and character design so sound didn’t really play that much of a role.Character 9/10As much as I wanted to give the characters a 10/10 it suffers from the same issue as the story does and that is it’s just too short of a show to really develop any attachment to anyone but the main characters, and even they don’t show the same attachment as they should in this kind of show. that being said in the 6 episodes that the show ran it did an amazing job in emotionally attaching me to the main characters (just not as much as it should, but still well done).Enjoyment 10/10I did enjoy this show very much and while it does have its flaws it is an amazing show with a lot to offer in terms of enjoyment.Overall 9/10I loved this show and while it does feel to short and could use a little more depth in the characters other than the 2 main characters it was an amazing show and am glad I watched it. an amazing job of pulling you in, it’s just too short for it to elaborate on a few topics.

But when we get further in the story it already makes itself clear why Natsume whas a bastard sometimes, because he did experience it in the past, and the same thing happened to Yuuichi.But luckily it went well with Rika after the operation, and that was a big relief for me, because I don\'t really like ""bad or open endings"". (that\'s just my opinion though)So in short, this is an anime you won\'t regret watching it, and I guarentee you will enjoy this serie from the beginning to the end.-perforM and that he\'s only reading porn in free time.

I hope this review helps you decide if this is something you\'ll want to watch.I watched this anime subbed.The story follows two main characters, Yuuichi and Rika. After both meeting each other at the same hospital they currently are checked into, their relationship begins. The story, for the most part focuses on them, their past, and what their illnesses will mean for their future together. This anime is character driven, so don\'t expect a deep or complex plot. This anime gives us a quick look into their lives,...nothing more or less.  I do think sometimes there is some unnecessary drama which can make the story feel quite childish. Other than that though, I have no other major complaints.The art of Hanbun simply works. It isn\'t terrible, nor is it incredible. It is a bit of an older series so it will look somewhat dated. The animation is function, its fine for what it is. In some scenes, the animation can look a little strange in motion. It may sound all bad, but the art is consistently well drawn. I can\'t think of a single poorly drawn frame that made me look twice.  Overall, its a little rough around the edges but never to the point where it distracted me from the story.The sound in this anime makes me feel conflicted. On one side, the soundtrack is quite varied with music that fits almost every scene needed. On the other, while the voice actors for the most part are good, there are some lines that were delivered awkwardly. The sound effects, while sounding dated, are still functional. Overall, the sound quality is good, with some of the voice actor delivering some lazy lines.The characters of a character driven story had better be good. Thankfully, Hanbun delivers most of the time. First, Yuuichi and Rika are the stars of the show. Their relationship is paced very well, which surprises me as I thought it was going to feel very rushed since it was only 6 episodes long. By the end of the anime, you\'ll probably be feeling multiple different feelings towards them,both individually and combined.There are many side characters as well. For the most part, they are well developed and entertaining characters. However, few of them do feel very throw away to the point where I wondered why they were actually involved. Some characters you\'ll start off hating. But by the end of it, you\'ll be looking at them in a different light. I think that marks well written, and well developed characters.I do have one somewhat major complaint with this series though. This series is listed as a comedy, which it is. There is some humor here sprinkled in, which is fine... until it starts seeping into the more dramatic and depressing moments. I think this anime could\'ve done a better job at separating the comedy from scenes that should be very depressing. It just tonally didn\'t sit well with me. It doesn\'t happen often, but enough to warrant this criticism.STORY: 7ART: 6SOUND: 6CHARACTER: 8ENJOYMENT: 7To end this review, I will state that I was surprised I enjoyed this anime as much as I did. It has somewhat of an average and slow start, but as time continued, my enjoyment went up. I do think this series is worth watching as it is very short, and you could watch it all in one sitting. I also really liked the mixed emotions it gave me. Its both so happy yet so depressing, and it just gels together perfectly into an enjoyable experience. If you are looking for an anime that\'ll make you feel and think about life circumstances, this one is for you.Thank you for reading this review.

If you have any comments, please feel free to message me.', '""Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora"" (or Hanbun no Tsuki for short) is probably the best anime adaption of having an actual 2 hour long painful seizure I\'ve seen all year.There aren\'t many words to describe this show, the only ones that come to mind are: fuck, shit, ass, whatever and bullshit. It was produced by a no-name studio called TAC and features many very talented people who have all done much better stuff in the past.The story follows a 17 year old boy named Yuuichi Ezaki who is put into the worst hospital in the country of Japan. He learns that there is a...girl in the opposite wing of the hospital who is suffering from an unspecified deadly heart disease. After invading into her room, he learns that her name is Rika Akiba and that she really likes reading books(nerd). Together they take part in a lot of booking around, mucking around but no fucking around. They start to converse with eachother and Ezaki learns about the truth of her father and the mystery disease.Oh and they also fall in love for some reason.SOUNDThe sound was god awful. There were many times when after a long monologue there\'d just be about 3 seconds of silence. If you\'re a professional sound designer and you do something like that you should be fired. It will ruin your immersion in the story. Luckily for this sound designer there wasn\'t much dialogue to get immersed in. Another thing he constantly fucked up though was audio mixing. A lot of scenes (prime ex. the racecar scene) suffered from the music levels being way high and the dialogue being so low.And of course the voice acting... yeah, ""acting"". I\'m not blaming the voice actors for any of it though. It was clear they didn\'t have much to work with using the scripts they were given. Amazing voice actor Hiroaki Hirata, voice actor of Goro Natsume, delivered some of the most dullest lines I\'ve ever heard from him. And the soundtrack was just boring and awful and boring and awful and so on. I swear, the audio in this anime is the most abuse I\'ve done to my ears since listening to the new Linkin Park album. And that says a lot.ARTEwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. That\'s the review, thank you.I\'ve seen flash animations with better visuals then this. It looks like wet ass. I really don\'t know what to say more about it other than childish insults. I guess those 4 years of animations school really went to waste huh...STORYThis script was not written by someone who 1) has any dignity or selfesteem 2) was also in a hospital bed while writing it, most likely in the middle of brain surgery 3) is lazy. Honestly, I don\'t know where to start. Maybe I should start with the fact that the writer has no idea how a hospital works and who work there. In his hospital, patients (who are minors, let me remind you) with grave diseases can just walk out whenever they want willy nilly. Ezaki and Rika must have left the hospital on their own at least 6 times and nobody gave a flying fuck. Any patient can just go up to the roof and swing about on the walls. And the staff physically and mentally abuse their patients. This paints a pretty nice picture of how much the author didn\'t give a- I mean how creative the author was to think of such a whacky hospital.For the first couple of episodes nothing important really happens aside from some """"""""""""""""""""funny"""""""""""""""""""" gags. A ballsy move considering they only have 6 episodes to tell a tragic story. Why, the ending must be a surefire masterpiece! (spoiler alert: It wasn\'t...).There isn\'t really much I can talk about without getting into spoiler territory, so you’ll have to take my word that the ending is definitely not worth it.CHARACTERSProbably the root of all evil for this show were the characters. All of them were lackluster and the horrible voice acting and art did not help. I think it would be best for us to examine these characters one by one to see where the biggest problems really lie. Characters will be listed in order of importance to the plot.The MC: Yuuichi EzakiProbably the best character in the series depth wise, but that doesn\'t mean he was any good. He falls in love with Rika even though she only acted like a bitch to him, so I guess hes a masochist? We don\'t really know that. In fact, we know fuck all about Yuu(nickname for Yuuichi) other than he\'s a troublemaking pervert. He might have been the only one with a comprehensive character development. But that doesn\'t really matter since he lacks all charisma and is way too boring for an MC. He\'s also an absolute cuck who let\'s women step over him.Rika AkibaOh god. She is one of the main reasons I hated this show so much. She has no consistent character and none of her actions ever make any sense. She got incredibly upset when she found out that Yuu had massive amounts of porn and just didn\'t speak with him for a week. Nobody really knew why that  upset her, so we just had to make something up like ""she thinks porn is disgusting and can\'t express her feelings"". She constantly pulls shit out of her ass and does the most senseless things which led me to do something else whenever she was speaking.Goro NatsumeThis man does not have a PhD. Unless by PhD you mean ""pretty horrible douche"", that he certainly is. One of the first things he does in the show is beat up a minor for seemingly no reason. We later learn that it was all for a good cause (Spoiler alert: It wassn’t). Because of a tragic event that happened in his past, he decides to abuse the two MCs so that Ezaki wouldn’t end up like him, a psychopath not fit for his profession.  It turns out all right though, as by the end of the show he has grown into a slightly less sociopathic bastard who’s whole life had been a lie.Akiko TanizakiShe was supposed to be a „comic relief“ character in this show since other than introducing the two main characters she had almost no major role in the plot, other than yelling at people sometimes. She also helped her bed ridden patients escape the hospital multiple times. Was it so that they could get some ancient medicine that can cure her disease? Was it to defeat an evil warlord set to destroy the hospital? No, it was just so Yuu could go get his polaroid camera for the next time they snuck out of the hospital.Side charactersThe side characters had no character. They couldn’t bother, they were too busy making jokes about old man’s porn mags. Isn’t it funny that an old man had many porn mags? Hilarious.ENJOYMENTFor the first couple of episodes I wasn’t really sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or a drama. The setting was calling for sadness so I thought it might be a drama but none of the characters were well written enough to care for. There were a lot of failed attempts at humor that had no place in the mood of the story. What I did appreciate however was the tiger mask reference and one scene very scene in the show, the latter for a very wrong reason. Don’t get your hopes up, it was only entertaining because of how stupid it made the writers look. It was of course the scene where Akiko’s friend randomly picks Yuu up on the street and takes him to her place. Jokingly, I thought „here comes a sex scene“. Never in a million years did I think that this would happen between 17 year old MC and 20 something sidecharacter who we know nothing about. I could not imagine anyone, no matter how gullible, to put something like that in your story.And I shit you not, they did.In conclusion, I say that watching Hanbun no Tsuki feels like putting your genitals in the sharps container in a hospital. If you’re lucky, you might just prick yourself on a needle filled with heroin and have yourself a jolly time. However, it is definitely not worth the 30 other needles stabbing you in the shaft.(ps. Dont actually try doing that in a hospital. They will kick you out.)Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora gets a generous 4/10 girl in the opposite wing of the hospital who is suffering from an unspecified deadly heart disease.

We get stuff that seems rushed and undeveloped. Such as the first episode. So much stuff happens.~~Spoilers~~We also have stuff like a Doctor that acts comically evil at times. A nonsensical scene where a chick tries to sleep with the MC.That scene where the MC almost has sex is so out of left field. It doesn't even make sense. We are only shown the girl character once before but now she is trying to sleep with this dude.Also...just how some characters react or act. Example being the Female MC's mother. She is for some reason a really big douche to the MC and not even letting the MC visit the Female MC after she came out of surgery.I do like how the show didn't give the Female MC something as cliched as the character having Cancer. She actually has something that tends to be overlooked.Also the art at times can seem eh. It's what i expect from a show from 2006. It's just you can notice some issues with it. Also not a big fan of the Male MC character design.I did actually have my heart pounding wondering if the Female MC will die. If she did then i think this probably would have a 6 or 7 rating from me.I feel that this show would'v been better if they removed a lot of the unneeded scenes. Use those to develop the story while ending it maybe at episode 5. Then have tell episode 9 or so the two MC's going to school together with the Male MC helping the Female MC around and doing work. Have the 10 episode them graduating and starting to live together then have the rest be the MC proposing and getting married with maybe both of them having a child or so. End on a happy note and not that she will most likely die in 5 years or so. I feel that this would have made the show a lot better and memorable. As it stands now it's a pretty good show that will be forgotten in time for me at least. just how some characters react or act. Example being the Female MC's mother.

Both the male and female main characters have illnesses and are subject to hospital.  They meet.  One has a very severe illness and may die any time.  The anime really encourages me to  cherish the things that I have.  Cherish time.  Use it carefully.  And with that, be happy.  The memories will last an eternity.Even though the anime is only six episodes long, it felt longer.  I felt like I knew the characters rather well by the end, and it...felt like a lot has happened.The storyline itself seems to  [unless I am mistaken] parallel a volume of novels called ""Les Thibault""  In fact, I might actually grab a set from my local library.Is it cliché?  Possibly.

Possibly.  I haven\'t watched many animes to state that fact, but nonetheless, enjoyable.', 'While not a wholly original story, Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora accomplishes something unique in its succinct but powerful execution of tired tear-jerking themes. Although short at 6 episodes, it manages to tell a surprisingly deep and somber story about romance with a caveat, backed up by a very small but entertaining cast of characters that help to give the story more meaning and provide the unique execution that this anime presents.However, I come away from watching this in a strange ""half-satisfied half-disappointed"" state. While the anime does manage to tell its entire story with 6 episodes with good development of character and relatively...decent progression of events, the pacing suffered due to it length, particularly in the last episode when it was wrapping up. While nigh-tearjerking, it felt cut off before it could really finish what it wanted to say, tying up the themes and core impact on the world of the show. What I mean by this is that we didn\'t get to see the aftermath of certain events and how characters reacted to them, we are told this through a very short montage overlaid by the credits. It presented a simple narrative that slowly built up, but the ending didn\'t really offer the payoff to the buildup that was being made. Also, while this may be obvious, certain characters received very little to no development, but that was clearly to be expected of an anime of this length that wanted to tell a story and was set on doing just that and nothing else.That doesn\'t stop this short anime from being very good, however. Character interactions were done in a satisfying and entertaining way and as we learn more about them, we come to understand their prior actions that seemingly weren\'t justified. I think this is a tremendous feat for having a very constrained time limit to present these characters and the situation they\'re in. I don\'t want to spoil the story, but it felt like every event had a purpose when you really thought about it and there was no unnecessary side-elements to pad the already very short runtime if it didn\'t have a reason to be there. This includes the drama, which are present in very satisfying and understandable amounts that aren\'t left going on for way too long and thus souring the rest of the story. Our two leads, Yuuichi and Rika, had excellent chemistry and had understandable emotional reactions to events in the plot despite it not initially seeming so.If you\'re a fan of love stories that are clear on the kind of story they want to tell and don\'t stray away from that, which treat their few important characters with the quality of development they deserve, you should definitely give this one a shot. Any fan of the genre will find something to enjoy here, whether it be the heartwarming moments between the two protagonists or the healthy and deserved amount of drama woven into the narrative. At 6 episodes, it\'s an easy yet heavy watch when you come to a realization about how certain things will inevitably end, or begin. decent progression of events, the pacing suffered due to it length, particularly in the last episode when it was wrapping up.

After watching the first episode, my hopeful expectations were shredded. In short, Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora had a lot of potential, but due to ridiculous characters, tropes, and moments, I found it to be disappointing.Story (8):To begin with, I am actually fond of the story. The premise is pretty original as far as anime series go. It\'s a slice of life, drama, and romance (with awful comedy bits thrown in the mix). It\'s only six episodes long, so if watching with minimal breaks, it...can be viewed in its entirety in under three hours.The story follows Yuuichi, a seventeen-year-old male who is infected with Hepatitis A, and therefore is currently residing in a hospital room. Despite his illness, Yuuichi sneaks out almost every night, and is often caught by his physically abusive nurse. He has hope knowing that it won\'t be too long until he is released and can return to his normal life.One day when looking out the window he sees a girl his age name Rika. Rika has been hospitalized for most of her life and is aware that it won\'t be long before her disease claims her life.Upon receiving encouragement from his nurse, Yuuichi visits Rika\'s room. He is told beforehand about her tastes in literature and lies about having the same interests. Rika is upset with his deceit and refuses to see him, causing Yuuichi to come up with creative ways to get her to forgive him.By spending time together they become friends and eventually fall in love. However, their health proves to be a major obstacle time and again.The basic story line is intriguing. It had a great setup for a marvelous love story. However there are too many unrealistic moments that occur within the six episodes that made me roll my eyes too often. For instance, I find it hard to believe that the hospital personnel would just let an underage patient leave whenever he wants, and if this is a nightly routine, why is there no one on guard to stop him?I do like that this is a romance that does not take place inside a school setting. High school romances are so overdone in anime, and even though the two main characters are technically high school age, the change of setting does win this one some originality points.Characters (3):The characters are one of the major flaws in this anime. On the whole, I think I may only like two characters out of the whole cast, and one of them receives less than a minute of screen time.The main problem with the characters is that there are so many cliches here it\'s ridiculous. You have your tsundere with a tragic past; you have your tough woman in a role of authority, who\'s lack of ethics would get her fired in reality; there\'s the perverted old man; there\'s the best friend who is there for comic relief; and then there is the pointless fan service character. I haven\'t even mentioned my least favorite character yet.To begin with, there is the protagonist: Yuuichi. This character has been seen so many times in anime past and present. Yuuichi has compassion for others. However, he is too passive and lets everyone (literally) beat up on him. He follows the orders of a girl he has an interest in. When she is being abusive to him, he just takes it and apologizes for every single little thing that causes her temper to flare. I kept waiting for him to stand up to her at least once, but never. However, the move he pulls in the last episode does win him some awesome points.Next in line is our female lead: Rika. I did not like her from her introduction. This is another character that has been seen countless times. She is rude, emotional, and lets her temper get the best of her. She gets upset over stupid things and blows them out of proportion--for instance she gets furious with Yuuichi for reading an adult magazine, even though they\'re not a couple at the time. I remember thinking to myself, ""Why is she getting so upset? That\'s not even her boyfriend."" Her tragic backstory of being chronically ill is used as a way to excuse her behavior, which I feel is poor writing. Then later it is mentioned she\'s had this personality since childhood. To her credit, she does undergo some character development by the last two episodes.Next, is the primary nurse Akiko.  In the first episode I was wondering how someone like this managed to be hired as a registered nurse. She\'s physically abusive to her patients and colleagues. I felt that this character\'s personality (even though I know it\'s a common character type in anime) ruined some of the realism, knowing that someone who behaved this way would not keep her job in a hospital. However, I think it\'s clear she does care about her charges, even if she has an unorthodox way of showing it.Now onto my least favorite character in the entire series--the surgeon, Natsume. I just found him to be overall unpleasant. Like Akiko, I don\'t understand how he hadn\'t been fired by the end of the third episode.  As we see with Rika, his tragic backstory is used as a way to explain his inappropriate behavior. Even if he did have reasons, I found them too weak to justify his actions.The only character that I actually liked all the way through was Yuuichi\'s best friend Tsukasa. He is genuinely nice and willing to help out his friends without question. In fact Yuuichi mentions that it was him witnessing Tsukasa\'s kindness that prompted them to be friends. Sadly, he is a minor character and gets minimal screen time. The good news is when he is on screen he is entertaining.Lastly, there is Akiko\'s childhood friend, Misako, who is there for no reason but fan service, and an awkward, unnecessary subplot. (I\'m not kidding, this subplot just happens, has no effect on the overall story, and is never mentioned again.)Pretty much all the other characters in this anime are pointless.I feel that the characters can make or break a story, and the ones in Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora, for the most part, are lacking.Art (5):I was not too impressed with the art in this anime. There is nothing that really stands out about any of these characters that would make them memorable. They look like any ordinary anime character. Sure Rika is designed to look cute, but even she wouldn\'t stand out among a lineup of ten or twenty other random anime females.The settings are not that interesting to look at either. When Yuuichi and friends are taking Rika to school, I believe only a hallway, a locker room, and a classroom are seen, and not much of the location is used. In the hospital you see little of the character\'s rooms, or the rooftop. With the rooftop scenes, there are a few instances of seeing the view of the other buildings or nature, but that\'s one of the few exceptions.The animation is minimal. The art itself is nothing breathtaking.Music/Sound (8):The opening and ending theme songs are calming. It\'s a nice mood setter for the story. Even if it is a drama, there isn\'t a lot of action, and for the most part the pacing is mellow.The few times I noticed background music during the actual show, it was decent. Both songs I can remember are instrumental. One sounded like elevator music, so it wasn\'t too enticing. The second was guitar music during a more crucial moment, so it did add to the excitement, without being overbearing, which I feel matched the moment.I believe that the music, while it doesn\'t necessarily stand out among amazing anime soundtracks, it does work for the scenes in which they are used. I feel that it is better to have less dramatic, but fitting music than excellent music that clashes with the scene at hand.Overall, I have no complaints with the soundtrack.Conclusion (5):In all, I feel that the story itself could have been great, for it is original. Had it focused more on keeping that originality, instead of relying on tired tropes, I would have enjoyed it better. Also, the characters were too unlikable in my opinion.The art is mediocre. While the sound is good, it couldn\'t make up for what all this series lacked.5/10. can be viewed in its entirety in under three hours.The story follows Yuuichi, a seventeen-year-old male who is infected with Hepatitis A, and therefore is currently residing in a hospital room. Despite his illness, Yuuichi sneaks out almost every night, and is often caught by his physically abusive nurse. He has hope knowing that it won\'t be too long until he is released and can return to his normal life.One day when looking out the window he sees a girl his age name Rika. Rika has been hospitalized for most of her life and is aware that it won\'t be long before her disease claims her life.Upon receiving encouragement from his nurse, Yuuichi visits Rika\'s room. He is told beforehand about her tastes in literature and lies about having the same interests. Rika is upset with his deceit and refuses to see him, causing Yuuichi to come up with creative ways to get her to forgive him.By spending time together they become friends and eventually fall in love. However, their health proves to be a major obstacle time and again.The basic story line is intriguing. It had a great setup for a marvelous love story. However there are too many unrealistic moments that occur within the six episodes that made me roll my eyes too often. For instance, I find it hard to believe that the hospital personnel would just let an underage patient leave whenever he wants, and if this is a nightly routine, why is there no one on guard to stop him?I do like that this is a romance that does not take place inside a school setting. High school romances are so overdone in anime, and even though the two main characters are technically high school age, the change of setting does win this one some originality points.Characters (3):The characters are one of the major flaws in this anime. On the whole, I think I may only like two characters out of the whole cast, and one of them receives less than a minute of screen time.The main problem with the characters is that there are so many cliches here it\'s ridiculous. You have your tsundere with a tragic past; you have your tough woman in a role of authority, who\'s lack of ethics would get her fired in reality; there\'s the perverted old man; there\'s the best friend who is there for comic relief; and then there is the pointless fan service character. I haven\'t even mentioned my least favorite character yet.To begin with, there is the protagonist: Yuuichi. This character has been seen so many times in anime past and present. Yuuichi has compassion for others. However, he is too passive and lets everyone (literally) beat up on him. He follows the orders of a girl he has an interest in. When she is being abusive to him, he just takes it and apologizes for every single little thing that causes her temper to flare. I kept waiting for him to stand up to her at least once, but never. However, the move he pulls in the last episode does win him some awesome points.Next in line is our female lead: Rika. I did not like her from her introduction. This is another character that has been seen countless times. She is rude, emotional, and lets her temper get the best of her. She gets upset over stupid things and blows them out of proportion--for instance she gets furious with Yuuichi for reading an adult magazine, even though they\'re not a couple at the time. I remember thinking to myself, ""Why is she getting so upset? That\'s not even her boyfriend."" Her tragic backstory of being chronically ill is used as a way to excuse her behavior, which I feel is poor writing. Then later it is mentioned she\'s had this personality since childhood. To her credit, she does undergo some character development by the last two episodes.Next, is the primary nurse Akiko.  In the first episode I was wondering how someone like this managed to be hired as a registered nurse. She\'s physically abusive to her patients and colleagues. I felt that this character\'s personality (even though I know it\'s a common character type in anime) ruined some of the realism, knowing that someone who behaved this way would not keep her job in a hospital. However, I think it\'s clear she does care about her charges, even if she has an unorthodox way of showing it.Now onto my least favorite character in the entire series--the surgeon, Natsume. I just found him to be overall unpleasant. Like Akiko, I don\'t understand how he hadn\'t been fired by the end of the third episode.  As we see with Rika, his tragic backstory is used as a way to explain his inappropriate behavior. Even if he did have reasons, I found them too weak to justify his actions.The only character that I actually liked all the way through was Yuuichi\'s best friend Tsukasa. He is genuinely nice and willing to help out his friends without question. In fact Yuuichi mentions that it was him witnessing Tsukasa\'s kindness that prompted them to be friends. Sadly, he is a minor character and gets minimal screen time. The good news is when he is on screen he is entertaining.Lastly, there is Akiko\'s childhood friend, Misako, who is there for no reason but fan service, and an awkward, unnecessary subplot. (I\'m not kidding, this subplot just happens, has no effect on the overall story, and is never mentioned again.)Pretty much all the other characters in this anime are pointless.I feel that the characters can make or break a story, and the ones in Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru Sora, for the most part, are lacking.Art (5):I was not too impressed with the art in this anime.

At first, I thought that the doctor needed some beating to come back to his senses, but you will know once you check it out for yourself. All the characters were supportive. I like how the main female lead is stubborn yet strong. The mc did change though, because of her. It was comforting at the same time emotional (not too much) anime. I liked the art style as it wasn't one of those that people want now-a-days. Everything was simple yet beautiful. But I think this anime is not for everyone, but one thing is for sure if...someone who has an eye for art will appreciate and like it. someone who has an eye for art will appreciate and like it.""]"
Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36220/Itsudatte_Bokura_no_Koi_wa_10_cm_Datta,"[""Before starting this review, I would just like to say that you CAN watch the other 2 movies after or before watching this. That is because they occur at the same timeline. The only difference being that each focuses on different couples.Here's the titles of the 2 moviesZutto Mae kara Suki deshita.: Kokuhaku Jikkou IinkaiSuki ni Naru Sono Shunkan wo.: Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai10 cm. Such as short distance. And yet it is too much to close this gap between these 2 people. No matter what you try, distance in love is not something easily explained. Although the person you love may be right next to...you, you somehow feel that he/she is out of reach, almost impossible to ever meet to get closer. And when that person is on the other side of the world, you feel like you could reach him/her no matter what, holding on to your feelings. This is what 'Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta.' explores, the distance between people both literally and metaphorically. It is probably the best part about this anime.The anime is pretty good in my opinion, unless you don't want something a bit cliched. But even if it is, there are some anime series which do better on other things than just uniqueness. This is one of them, I think.First of all, I wouldn't say the story is the best part about this work. I think it was a bit too simplistic. A boy and girl seem to have a good relationship together. A few obstacles appear and this affects their friendship. They try their best to fix things up. That's it. Nothing new about the story, this kind of story has already been explored in many other shows. If I was to pick something unique out of this, it's probably the male lead's hobby, which is film-making. Therefore I gave a 7.In terms of characters, this series focuses on 1 main couple. They're a very cute couple, whom I strongly wished to get more screen-time when I watched the other 2 movies. Other than the main couple there are other 2 pairs and we see some of their development too (and of course you would see them as well in the other 2 movies).Miou is a good character, she is very honest and kind (too kind at times). The scenes when she's shy were the ones that made me really like her, it's a cute part of her personality. However her lack of confidence has been a slight problem. Miou was a bit too sensitive to the news about Haruki's brother, blaming herself for the problem. Going a bit overboard there. It felt as if her weakness in perceiving certain things was deliberately made to be an obstacle in her relationship with Haruki, So I lowered the character score to 7.Haruki is a very likeable character who is presented as someone who enjoys film making a lot, and is friendly to everyone in his club. I really liked the part where he doubted himself, people can always have a time when they're not at their best and start to question their decisions. Maybe he's a bit too good at film-making...The art is really good, way above average I'd say. Very bright colors are used to create a joyful atmosphere throughout. 10/10. However I was a bit disappointed by the movements, sometimes it really looked forced and repetitive. Of course the sound is good thanks to Honeyworks, both the OP and ED are great. 10.The merry atmosphere in the anime is something I must go over on. It's the best aspect of this anime, and I've always seen ever since I watched the other movies. Whenever one or two of the characters are down, there is always someone who cheers them up or helps them out. It's a simple yet essential part of the anime, forming a good development and only strengthening their friendship.Overall, a 9 would be suitable. I'm the type who gives higher scores than most people so... you, you somehow feel that he/she is out of reach, almost impossible to ever meet to get closer.

I began looking forward...to watching the opening each week.Characters were lovable and funny to watch making me wanting to support them and bridge that 10cm gap between them. The series keeps referring to that gap which is a nice touch.The series is sadly only six episodes but is much better than most full series and was a great send off for 2017.  If you want a quick watch masterpiece this is the series for you.Final score:10/10 to watching the opening each week.Characters were lovable and funny to watch making me wanting to support them and bridge that 10cm gap between them.

The pace was also good, but the execution was trash because Aika Miou is so bland and retarded!In order to be able to finish this anime you have to skip ep 4 because she ruins the execution of the story with her masochist nonsense.Isn’t making this into a movie more optimal?Anyways, the ending is beatiful if you take it lightly.It’s just 5 eps if you skip #4 so now go watch it if you are still thinking about it, maybe you can...enjoy it if you take this anime lightly.Don’t spoil yourself below if you can easly watch 5 eps of anime.Spoiler zone ahead;.Too bad Aika ruins some of the ending...

Well, how the fk would we know?Holy Mary the mother of Jesus is not much compared to Miou... Thank god I’m not a 13 years old girl getting influenced by this insect.As far as we know the guy went to America for 7 years to become a movie director, so he could easily clap as much women as Zac Efron.Jk here; In this show this guy could easily clap different women, have babies, then go back to Japan to clap Miou and leave her pregnant to then leaver her and return to America with his other bitches. enjoy it if you take this anime lightly.Don’t spoil yourself below if you can easly watch 5 eps of anime.Spoiler zone ahead;.Too bad Aika ruins some of the ending...

As of now, the story from their original music videos was adapted into two, hour-lenght movies, and this six episode series. The first movie focused on all of our three main couples, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. The second one was worse in comparison, the characters were especially weaker, but it still remained on the positive side of things. And now we have this. A short six episode series resolving around one of the main couples. Did it live up to the potential? For me, certainly yes.First question that comes...to mind is, do you have to watch the movies to understand this series? Not really, it stays pretty independent from each other. But if you like romantic stories, there is no reason not to do so. It\'s a good watch.Anyway, let\'s get to the bussines. The story is centered around one of the couples from the first movie: Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa. I called them a couple, which technically shouldn\'t be the case because they\'re not dating or anything yet, but that doesn\'t really matter. This is a straightforward romance. No love-triangle, just pure one on one. Which is a really good thing. Being a short anime, the decision to focus only on one couple is welcome and we get to see the story around them develop a lot during the time.Miou is a shy and a self-confidence lacking girl, that enjoys painting more than anything. It\'s her own way of forgetting her problems, and she is both more lively and cheerful when she\'s in an artist environment. While being shy when talking to other people, it\'s not done over the top. It is always hard to balance out the personality traits of characters, especially when they are so over-used as the confidence lacking characters are. Miou however, is a case of a well made one. She\'s more quiet, but has her own sweet and happy moments. She can do something you wouldn\'t expect from her. And despite her falling into depression at a certain point, her motives to do so are understandable and her recovery is a well-fought battle.Haruki seems, unlike Miou, as an outgoing and forward type of guy. He holds a passion for movie-making, around which the whole plot of the show evolves. Despite his first given impression, whenever he\'s alone with Miou, he tends to get nervous aswell, not having the guts to even hold her hand. The good thing on Haruki is that he\'s extremely realistic as far as his personality goes. I can see myself in him. And I think it\'s that touch of reality that makes him a good character, because if we were talking about the other things he does or doesn\'t, he\'s as straight-forward as it goes. Ya know, he\'s good-looking, outgoing, friendly and a ""leader of the gang"". Despite all that, I still like him. Because the show did a really good job at showing both good and bad personality traits of both of our characters.The writing of the show in itself is something, I would like to talk about for a bit. You see, incase you don\'t know yet, this is a romance drama. And the word drama can also mean trouble, as the modern animes seem to find it harder and harder to do a proper, not over the top drama that fits the atmosphere well. Which is not the case this time around. It could be actually called the carrying point of this show. Starts of slow and nicely, then suddenly picks up the pace at both ends, and although the peak could be called maybe a little too dramatic, I think I would just be nitpicking at that moment. The setup is decent, the turn-around respectable and the resolution nearly fabulous. I do find the two main characters written well too. They are lacking a bit at certain times, but that just adds to the fact that this show does it\'s best at making them beliavable.If you\'re familiar with this franchise, you also know that there are three main couples overall. That\'s true in the grand scheme of things, but the other two just play the supporting role in this one. Akari + Souta and Natsuki + Yuu. Considering how things went in the first movie, I think and I hope that they will both get their own short animes, like Miou and Haruki did. They deserve it. Atleast Akari with Souta do, I find the two to be destined for each other. Anyways, these four are written in about the same way as the two. Different personalities, but every one of them feels realistic with their behaving, especially in the romantic moments. And despite their romance being cut off this time, they still work well as a supportive cast acting like High School friends do.Ultimately, Itsudatte Boku- whatever 10 cm, is a quality show. And it\'s hell of a fun to watch. Despite not impressing me that much at the start, the show made me appreciate it\'s strong points and I wanted to see more and more every week. It\'s not as rememberable as I would like to, but to be honest, which school romance anime is? For me it\'s important that the show besides it\'s own selling points also had a big entertainment value. While it was seeing Miou and Haruki together or alone, I never started doubting their purpose in the show and I never got bored of them. Which can be said about their story aswell. Just a cherry on top of all things I\'ve said is a very well made ending, that warms your heart to the core.The general looks of this are really good. I always liked the desings of all the characters, which haven\'t changed since the movies. That stays the same and I still find it pleasant to look at. The animation feels on-point most of the time, despite not showing that many hard-effort scenes or moments.I loved the music of the movies. Both the vocal and ambient OST played a big role in them and I still find them very nice to listen to. That being said, no vocal songs aside from opening and ending were used in this one. Which is a shame in my opinion, as exactly these types of animes are the ones that would deserve it. The ambient OST stays almost the same, but felt a little less impactful than was before. Overall, despite the music taking a step back, it still be considered a huge plus when not comparing to the prequel movies.----------Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a great example of a show that focused on the things an anime of this genre should have. It presents a well made dramatic story with a respectable cast around it.

Scenery-wise the art looks fine, but the character design is appalling.Sound: The sound quality is mediocre. The voice actors sound a bit flat. But they seem to be doing a fair job.Character : Dull, bland, uninspired and utterly average... Every tedious cliché you could find in the book was assembled to form those banal 1D characters. Their interactions are quite boring as well. None of the introduced characters seemed interesting.Enjoyment : There wasn\'t any enjoyment. I couldn\'t think of anything redeemable.Overall : This eyesore of an anime is not only below mediocre and arid. It\'s also a typical case of a cornball romcom gone bad. It\'s distasteful and trite.I dare say it\'s worst than those god awful and deplorable ecchi-harems/otome game adaptations. Although the characters look bland and typical.

Totally insecure and dull female leads :PTo be frank, I\'d rate this anime for at least 3.5, given that the art and sound is kinda cool but story and characterization plays a lot on enjoyment, so you can see where exactly this story\'s fall down is.When I\'ve actually watched the movie, Zutto Mae Kara Suki Deshita, I\'ve given it an average score because out of the three couples it presented (which already gave way that there will probably be less development and progress within both characters and story...line), I\'ve actually liked Haruki and Miou the most. LIKED. This series burned that little respect I had away.There are a lot of things I found awfully wrong in the anime like: (1) Why are they all friends (like I understand at least why the guys were but the girls were kinda meh), (2) How the f did those two even fall in love with each other? (the two main leads who are completely incompatible), (3) How can they be so effin unrelatable? and honestly so much more but I\'m not writing a manuscript so I\'ll stick with my major problem with this anime- Miou Aida.Miou Aida is a shy, caring, tender, and loving female lead who has captivated the attention of popular aspiring film director Haruki (our main lead) because apparently, standing under cherry blossoms makes you all the more interesting. Look, I can\'t even begin to explain why I don\'t like this character. I know the intention of Miou\'s character and all, but the way she was executed absolutely made me HATE her. Reading manga and watching anime for a while has made me numerously witness a writer\'s attempt to make a female lead lovable, which is usually done by introducing it as shy and kind and completely unassuming. Let me explain: I mean, no one likes arrogant characters, right? Writers usually attempt to make their main leads humble to make them more lovable but that doesn\'t always end up as the case as some writers overdo it, which results to dull and questionable characters like Miou.Honestly, I don\'t even get why a lot of people like her character. I personally prefer the purple-haired girl, she was, what I would like to say, the perfect female lead (I really wished she was). She was understanding, confident, and has a complete stand. Look, I get that some people have their insecurities and cannot be confident but it wouldn\'t hurt for the girl to grow a backbone and actually own up to the compliments. How do I explain this exactly- imagine telling a model: ""Wow, you\'re so pretty"" and getting ""Oh no, I\'m not pretty, no."" Makes you want to kick the model\'s face, huh? That is just one of my problems with Miou.The friendship was okay, but it wasn\'t really that believable. I mean, if a friend of mine started jerking around with me and acted all cold with me and then even when I confront him/her says I\'m better off not talking to him/her then SCREW HIM/HER. That\'s kind of a jerk move, don\'t you think? And yet Miou is somehow blessed with this great people who babies her even if she\'s acting like a spoiled princess!I also didn\'t like how they butchered Haruki\'s character. The boy was already fine as an ambitious aspiring film director but NO. Because Miou is going through drama after drama, somehow the writers thought that Haruki should too. I mean, the dream stuff at least was valid compared to my problem with the FL so I guess his character is a little developed than Miou? I don\'t know. Either way, they weren\'t really developed. But I\'ll give props to the writers for at least making the ML a little decent. OMG, imagine if both of them were overly dramatic! Grrrr-The art and sounds were really good, especially the music. It is Honeyworks after all.To quip, I actually expected a lot from this series because they were my favorite couple from the first movie but I guess now, I\'m questioning why the heck are they even still together? Like seriously, Haruki could do SO much better. I know I\'m being a little harsh but I\'ll take an arrogant tsundere over an insecure and completely boring FL. Like seriously, at least the former is a little empathetic than the latter.Anyways, the story in my opinion was really dreadful compared to the two movies (which falls on average). Story and characters often falls in line and it would\'ve been great at least to get some character development but instead we get drama, drama, drama. It would\'ve been nice if they were at least relatable but to be honest, the only thing I found at least relatable was the dream conflict with Haruki, but even that was just a downgrade of his character but oh well. Judging from the first two movies, I probably shouldn\'t have expected a decent story out of this. How I even finished this anime is beyond me.[SPOILER ALERT!!]PS. I also dislike how the major conflict (this went for like majority of the episodes) is Miou running away from Haruki because his (deceased) brother saved her? Like dude, she even got advise from that sensei that it was alright and it was not her fault (which was completely correct) and that she should live happily now knowing this and what does she do? Shut Haruki out completely (making him question what he\'s done wrong and completely putting a lot of stress on his already stressed shoulders) and sulk about everything. Like if that isn\'t being self-centered I don\'t know what is.Don\'t get me wrong, I know survivor\'s guilt and all but dude, AKI (HARUKI\'S OLDER BRO) DIED BECAUSE OF AN EFFING DISEASE AND NOT BECAUSE HE SAVED MIOU OR WHATEVER. It really made me want to throw my phone whenever she monologues that it was all her fault and owns up the problem or whatever. I just find it so wrong and so unnecessary and a waste of time. That thinking was actually just toxic, TBH.[END OF SPOILER]PSS.I should know because I actually got to experience being friends with a Miou somewhere in my horrible life and let me tell you, it was a scarring experience. If you ever meet a Miou, run away screaming :P line), I\'ve actually liked Haruki and Miou the most. LIKED.

Please watch this even if its just to see what this amazing ed is."", 'Ok, so here\'s my opinion:Let\'s be honest, we need an opinion of someone who has seen HoneyWorks ever since they started making this saga or, at least, started watching it and comprehended it.First of all, story:I\'m really pleased at all of this, Haruki is a guy who loves making movies as his passion and thanks to the influence of his brother, Chiaki. Miou is a girl who\'s not only shy, but brave when the moment catch her, she loves painting as a passion even though she categorizes it as a ""hobby"". Both of them had already appeard in a lot of HoneyWorks PVs (including Hatsukoi...no Ehon, their story\'s PV) as well as in the past 2 movies: ""Zutto mae Kara suki Deshita"" and ""Suki ni naru sono Shunkan wo"", so people may already had a hint they both liked each other, however, it is not necessary to lean on the movies to know their stories, but otherwise, compliment. Haruki and Miou have a really good relationship but never get to cross their own 10cm distance, that\'s where the title comes in action ""Our love has always been 10cm apart"" (clever, since the lyrics of Hatsukoi no Ehon touch the same words and topics)This series, not only cover and adapts cleverly the songs and manga we\'ve already seen, but also develops the story in its own with some thing we hadn\'t seen in anyways (like when Haruki got his own self-problem), however, a lot of songs were not covered and were a vital part of the story like Inokori Sensei and Hatsukoi no Ehon -another story- (which takes the song\'s same name into the point of view of Haruki) but aside of that, everything went nice and smoothly.STORY: 9/10ArtSincerely enough, Lay-duce made a better job than Aniplex with the art of the characters, making their characters less ""shiny"" and more plain (in a Lovely Complex style or Kimi ni Todoke), however, most of the scenes were made out poorly. comparated to Yamako\'s (Mogelatte and Rokuro as well) great work as an artist for Honeyworks\' PVs and Mangas. But, it went smoothly and felt really soft and shoujo-like, so, I\'m not really mad nor sad about it.ART: 8/10Sound:Perfect enough, I loved how they inteded in making songs with famous utaites like Amatsuki, and some character songs like Kiokemasuka, I\'m amased by the content of the albums the group already released (surprisingly enough, all songs appear in the anime except for Romeo which appeared in the latest Honeyworks movie). Another fact we can add is that they didn\'t use the Chico w/Honeyworks formula for the opening, instead, they used the in-universe idol group ""LIPxLIP"" with the song ""Nonfantasy"" sung by Kouki and Nobunaga. And, you may not know it, but I love when the seiyuus sing in-tone, and the ending felt perfect, it fitted enough for the anime (and the last episode\'s ending was amasing, a reconstruction of Hatsukoi no Ehon, in the point of view of Aida in the present [this is not counted in as a spoiler since it was announced way before and the song released the same day the anime went airing]). Simply, delightful.SOUND: 10/10Character:*EXPECT SPOILERS IN THIS PART, READ WITH CAUTION*Unlike the last 2 movies and the mangas, here we see a develop in character atmosphere, like Haruki after he realized he was only carrying out his brother\'s dream instead of his own, driving him crazy. Or Aida when she discovered about her savior, trying to escape from Haruki\'s wrong reaction. This is not the ""sugar sweet sweet"" couple people were expecting, no, this time, the characters had a deep connection with the background story, giving influence in their decisions. 6 episodes were enough to make my heart race and develop with Aida and Haruki, the best couple HoneyWorks could have (FUN FACT: They were planned to be the only couple in the Kokuhaku no Oto saga, but thanks to their PVs success, they expanded the whole saga universe)After everything that happened, they both changed in their adult ages, both of them grew up and knew how to get afront the ""10 cm"" that were keeping them away.CHARACTER: 10/10Enjoyment:I TOTALLY ENJOYED THIS ANIME, I was waiting for it ever since they announced it, and totally fell in love with various soundtracs (even though some of the tracks are re-used from past movies). HoneyWorks\' fixed the errors they made with the movies, and made them look better, one thing for sure that I liked the most was the abscense of some characters like Hina, Kotaro and Sena. ¿The reason? Obviously enough, because of the focus this couple was getting (I\'m still proud of Gero because of his TV-anime debut as a seiyuu). I can\'t wait for HoneyWorks\' next proyect.ENJOYMENT: 10/10Overall: 10/10 no Ehon, their story\'s PV) as well as in the past 2 movies: ""Zutto mae Kara suki Deshita"" and ""Suki ni naru sono Shunkan wo"", so people may already had a hint they both liked each other, however, it is not necessary to lean on the movies to know their stories, but otherwise, compliment.

Granted, the episodes add up to one long a** movie, but I feel this method of focusing solely on Miou and Haruki did some good. Of course the movie was a good definition of a cheesy teenage romance, yet it wasn\'t distasteful cheese. It was like an ""I\'m in the mood for this cheese"" cheesy. And...even for a tantalizing romance, the ending had its mature parts. Although the conflict was a bit too weak for my liking, I don\'t think there\'s anything bad the viewers can\'t grasp from the trailer or name of the showArt:The art is once again beautiful and perfect for the setting and tone.Sound: The sound weren\'t bad. Nothing extraordinary about it.Character: I feel like the highlight of the show are the two protagonists and the fact that all of the other characters were finally in their rightful roles: barely-relevant supporting characters!!! There are many romance anime (and shows in general) that either only focus on one character or don\'t delve into the love birds\' personal stories at all. Both sides of the romance had backstories, goals, and hobbies, and the actual love story wasn\'t the sole focus. I got to know more about the characters which I felt made the love story more sell-able. I\'ve already said it on multiple accounts that I find some of the other characters rather cliche and/or annoying, but at least they weren\'t main characters and were shoved into a more secondary role. even for a tantalizing romance, the ending had its mature parts.

There are so many strange things that this show does just 3 episodes in that make me want to scream and then episode 4 just seals the score of 5/10.Minor Spoilers AheadThe main male character is actually not that bad. He is just a good guy who has a talent for film making and actually has healthy level\'s of confidence! The main female character is straight up trash, and unless this is a phenomenon only in japan, in the rest of the world this type of behavior is mostly fixed by the time you are graduating high school.Now this show brings...nothing really new to the table. It pretty much summarizes romance anime in 6 episodes and doesn\'t step too far out of what is typical. Yet I still can\'t help but feel that this show was deliberately nerfing the main character.He wins a film competition that allows him to move to the US and study there. It is his dream. He promised his dead brother that he would do it, that he would make their dream a reality. Here comes this insecure, completely imbalanced girl who derails everything.At first I was gonna let it slide. Cool, a strong male lead helps develop a weak female character. But remember, there is only 6 episodes, that isn\'t gonna fit! So instead, it turns out that she straight up can\'t develop. She is just weak, even though she has so many things going for her. She is a talented artist so its not like she doesn\'t have something to build off. She has friends, so she\'s not a loner. She has a future plan for some kind of career, so she is down to earth. How does a person with such stable qualities get so stuck in her own head so quickly! Not only that, when the time comes to make the first romantic move, she is the one who does it. So she is literally proving to have more guts than the male lead.Then she realizes that the man who saved her from drowning when she was a little kid was male leads big bro who is now dead to whom male lead promised he would become a great film maker to. And this derails the whole plot. She goes AWOL. She has to ""forget him"" now? For what reason! Everything is fine why are you over dramatizing everything.This is where the show fails. It doesn\'t actually make any sense! She never knew her savior beforehand. She sees his grave, and it happens to be someone\'s relative that she knows. Big deal! Its not like she caused him to die. She is literally just an innocent side character who happens to like the male lead, THE END. There is NOTHING MORE TO BE DONE. Hell they almost kiss under fireworks and that should be enough to get the point across that you shouldn\'t go and blow this.Then she finds out he is going to the states. And from there on, it all goes crazy. Still confused how on earth that changes anything.How I would write the story? Well she takes the saviors death normally, moves on quickly, proceeds to build up her relationship with male lead, then he says he is moving to the US, and she finds a way to follow him and/or he stays (but really, what sane dude would give up his dream for a girl who can\'t even just tell him out right she wants him to stay, go to the states my guy and get you a nice girl there and go famous). nothing really new to the table. It pretty much summarizes romance anime in 6 episodes and doesn\'t step too far out of what is typical. Yet I still can\'t help but feel that this show was deliberately nerfing the main character.He wins a film competition that allows him to move to the US and study there. It is his dream. He promised his dead brother that he would do it, that he would make their dream a reality. Here comes this insecure, completely imbalanced girl who derails everything.At first I was gonna let it slide. Cool, a strong male lead helps develop a weak female character. But remember, there is only 6 episodes, that isn\'t gonna fit! So instead, it turns out that she straight up can\'t develop. She is just weak, even though she has so many things going for her. She is a talented artist so its not like she doesn\'t have something to build off. She has friends, so she\'s not a loner. She has a future plan for some kind of career, so she is down to earth. How does a person with such stable qualities get so stuck in her own head so quickly! Not only that, when the time comes to make the first romantic move, she is the one who does it. So she is literally proving to have more guts than the male lead.Then she realizes that the man who saved her from drowning when she was a little kid was male leads big bro who is now dead to whom male lead promised he would become a great film maker to. And this derails the whole plot. She goes AWOL. She has to ""forget him"" now? For what reason! Everything is fine why are you over dramatizing everything.This is where the show fails. It doesn\'t actually make any sense! She never knew her savior beforehand. She sees his grave, and it happens to be someone\'s relative that she knows. Big deal! Its not like she caused him to die. She is literally just an innocent side character who happens to like the male lead, THE END. There is NOTHING MORE TO BE DONE. Hell they almost kiss under fireworks and that should be enough to get the point across that you shouldn\'t go and blow this.Then she finds out he is going to the states. And from there on, it all goes crazy. Still confused how on earth that changes anything.How I would write the story?

Having being raised with a Shoujo manga and anime beginning this isn't all that bad to me. Sometimes the most entertaining stories can be those that don't try to stray away from the norm.Itsudatekoi does a pretty good job at realizing what its strengths are and how to best hide its weaknesses. It's a short anime (6 episodes) that explores many of the existential crises that High School seniors go through before graduation. While this show's main...theme is romance, I would say it has a heavier focus on drama because by halfway through we can see the crises that start fostering within the minds of MCs Aida Miou and Haruki Serizawa.I want this to be spoiler free, so I won't talk about that plot point because each of those characters individual crises are showcased in episode 3 (Aida) and episode 4 (Haruki).Unfortunately, due to the small amount of episodes, these dramatic elements lacked a sense of development. It hits the viewers like a truck and we can understand, at least relate, to their ongoing struggles. But, with the short-time frame, it hits hard and, almost, instantly settles itself. It was like the screenwriters only knew how to build tension, but not transfer that tension into various plot-points within the next couple of episodes. I am not blaming the screenwriters on this because I doubt even great directors like Hosoda or Takahata could have figured out how to properly funnel out all the the dramatic elements into 18 minutes without it feeling rushed or improperly finished. 1 or 2 more episodes would have been massively beneficial for this series.When it comes to the characters, all of them are easily relatable and fairly realistic. However, they are boring to watch. While I am normally for the trade-off between realism and enjoyment. I just found all the conversations and interactions between the characters to be mundane and lack any sort of progression. And no, a singular scene doesn't save the fact the characters were dry as licking paper.Do I believe Itsudattekoi is a bad anime? No. I think it's a fine anime with a lot of flaws stemming from its pacing issues, most likely due to its short run-time.Would I recommend this anime to someone? That is also very unlikely. There are better romance anime out there that explore these same concepts whether they are or are not in school. However, if you have the time and this is somewhat interesting to you, then you won't be disappointed because its not a bad anime. Just don't expect a top-tier experience. theme is romance, I would say it has a heavier focus on drama because by halfway through we can see the crises that start fostering within the minds of MCs Aida Miou and Haruki Serizawa.I want this to be spoiler free, so I won't talk about that plot point because each of those characters individual crises are showcased in episode 3 (Aida) and episode 4 (Haruki).Unfortunately, due to the small amount of episodes, these dramatic elements lacked a sense of development.

Not gonna lie, although this series is short ( there\'s only 6 episodes ) it seems too underrated in my opinion. I conjecture that this anime deserves more attention due to its proficient and overwhelming aspects.Story : 7/10The story focuses on two students, Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa. Miou is a shy and reserved member of the school art club that prefers to stay out of the limelight whilst Haruki is the boisterous and confident ace of the movie club, already winning awards for his directing prowess. They both became...friends and grew closer to each other, but not until the last 10 centimeters. As time passes they had to decide their future and try to get past those last 10 centimeters.Well, I\'d say. The story has a great immense and everything connects together. Nonetheless, the romance is inadequately lacking. I\'m pretty much disappointed with the story adaptations especially the re-adaptation for episode 6. Don\'t know why the tarnation they did this, but I\'m very balked with this. It could\'ve been better, but noo..Art : 8/10""If the art of an anime is a catastrophe, everything else sucks as well."" is pretty much my judgement on every anime I reviewed. I only watch series that have acceptable art style, quality and good effects. Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta has a reasonable art, and I\'d say it\'s pretty good for a studio that I never knew existed.Sound : 8/10The opening is appealing and I\'m planning to listen to it again sometimes. But, I totally overlook the ending as regular since it sounds like the average closure tune you get in every ( most ) anime. There\'s actually not a lot to state about the sound, the background sounds are alright, thus does the music. Despite the fact that I have an inclination that there are spaces for improvements.Character : 8/10The development of the two main characters are so constraining. What\'s more, since this anime isn\'t a slice of life, there are likewise other supporting characters and I surmise they\'re having enough attention. But seriously, if this anime was a slice of life I think that it would\'ve been way better for an anime like this.Without a doubt, they may have made up at the end. Yet, it wasn\'t sufficient, all the weight built up inside the story merits a way better closure. This one is a ""meh"" which sort of baffles me because this anime has a lot of potential.Enjoyment : 8/10I enjoyed watching this anime a lot, somewhat it nearly made me cry at the near end but it wasn\'t enough. Still, I had fun watching this short series and I\'d be willing to give it a high score because it seems too underrated.Overall : 9/10This score will probably change ( decrease ) as time passes, but for now. It will remain on the stairs towards a true masterpiece, and it won\'t get any higher because I don\'t think anything will change my mind. friends and grew closer to each other, but not until the last 10 centimeters.

The feelings shown in this anime are 10 on 10. Art style was also satisfactory. This is not a solo series. You have to watch the two movies first , 'I have always liked you' and 'The Moment you fall in love'. But watching it solo is also okay. When I watched the movies I thought this is a average franchise but this season is just outstanding. One of my favourite anime seasons of all time. Better than most romance animes .

The story is deeper than just high school and looks at mental health, love, and one's journey of life. To be quite honest the relationship between the main characters and how they were connected curated an interesting dynamic between them and all the side characters.

It tells the story of a girl named Miou Aida and a boy named Haruki who have been in love since the first year of highschool one...being a painter, the other being a movie director, despite their strong feelings towards each other and spending a lot of time together, their romance doesn't progress because they are both shy when it comes to confessing, plus they always end up with a 10 centimeter space away from each other. They enventually encounter a conflict that changes them, but overcomes it with the help of their friends who are also secretly in love with one another as well. The story was pretty decent and enjoyable, it also had a lot of memorable side characters that I really liked, especially Mr Akechi, that guy is a pretty good adviser for these troubled children. I did find a couple of flaws here that really hindered this animes quality for me. The first a minor one where they use basic troupes like the childhood friend etc for the sidecharacters, and I was expecting actual new unique characters, but oh well we get the troupes and cliches for characters once again. Next up is a big one how the characters are so stupid when it comes to making decisions, imma have to state spoilers from here on out so this is your warning, Aida is fucking stupid so is Haruki, Aida straights up thinks that Haruki will hate her because his dead brother saved her, despite his brother actually being a genuinely good person and seeing it as a massive accomplishment. She blames herself for her brothers death, even tho Haruki's brothers death was because of his frail body and fatal illness, feels like Kaori from your lie in april actually, might be the same disease,  since they both where bed ridden  and ended up dying there. In terms of Haruki, this man ends up in a conflict where he thinks he actually didn't have a dream and was just pretending to follow and reenact his brothers footsteps, despite him clearly being happy doing it, plus him meeting all this wonderful people that ended up changing his life for the better, seriously tho this guy is a freaking moron, like come on, why did this inner conflict even exist in the first place, is it only because we needed a conflict from the other main character, anime you could have done a much more better job than this.  The final flaw that pissed me off the most was the immaturity, while the concept was established to be how hard it is to state your feelings for the person you love while being young, according to my experiences it is the opposite, you both love each other just confess, if it doesn't work out move on its that simple, I'm a person that has gone through a lot of relationships, I have had my heart broken many times over the fast years of my life, never once have I had the difficulty of confessing, the same went for my friends, while at first it was true, but it wasn't to the extend that it was last minute and almost just not possible anymore because of lack of time being in final school years and in fear of separating ways after graduation, seriously I was cringing while they make their decisions and go through the most avoidable problems, like I was screaming on the screen on what to do, and how it was perfectly normal to do it, guess what these characters do the exact opposite things like come on men. Anime could have been much more better if it weren't for these obvious awful flaws imo.Pros:-Great animation, stunning visuals-Good score-Banger OP, decent ED-Characters blend in well together , they have chemistry and it just made me love them, even the side characters actually felt like amazing people, despite the fact that they all act the same in terms of love.-Decent premise-Good PacingCons:-Has some annoying flaws like immaturity to the maximum, seriously I have never seen nor expected people to be this immature, and also characters being stupid making idiotic decisions-Ending was predictable- I Wanted to see more from the other characters but I guess there's a movie and other source material for that, since apparently this is a series, now I don't know if imma continue on this probably not tho.Overall Our love is always ten centimeters apart was a pretty decent romance anime, that had a cool concept but not executed properly leaving out some obvious and annoying writing flaws, it's a shame the anime would have been a lot bettter if the writers just used common sense and actually made better conflicts rather than just copping out to immaturity leads to idiotic decisions, a true shame for that this anime gets a 7/10 for my overall anime rating. being a painter, the other being a movie director, despite their strong feelings towards each other and spending a lot of time together, their romance doesn't progress because they are both shy when it comes to confessing, plus they always end up with a 10 centimeter space away from each other.

It was something slightly different to other things I\'ve seen and the ending was well presented in my opinion.Also worth saying that 6 episodes is around 144 minutes, which is much longer than the films. For that I\'m glad because it didn\'t feel rushed.With a good first episode and good ending, this story was one that I appreciate for sure.Art:9Nice and easy on the eyes. At times colours felt a bit grey, but still looks sharp.Sound:7Some great songs.. but not so great timing. I thought the opening and ending were strong though, especially with how the song complimented the video to reflect the characters.Characters:8A fun group of main and side characters. I think the amount of screen time given to all characters were well balanced, so it is easy to see your favourite character. However, none of the characters were unique or inventive. They were fun for the time of watching, but forgettable afterwards. Also I felt like two characters looked way too similar (sure they were related, but it was unrealistic). This may have been for affect but it became distracting at times.Enjoyment:8Easy to watch and the drama sure built tension that got me excited. All moments had meaning so there was never a reason not to enjoy. That said ""Our love"" doesn\'t have the ""it"" factor that to make it a 10/10 enjoyment.Overall: 8All this said, my review is only from this series.

This series in particular focuses mainly on one of the couples that appear in the two films, and it isn't necessary to watch them before proceeding with this series. With that, I'd like to come out and say that I think this anime has been slept on considerably; it's a cute little romance story that would definitely be appreciated by a lot of people who need their romance fix when they've run out...of things to watch. It's a very straightforward shoujo-like plot that doesn't do much new, but goes through the usual conventions in a very beautiful and enjoyable way.One of the main reasons why I like this show is because it does exactly what people want to see out of a drama-romance anime; with it's short length (only 6 episodes), it forces the story forward without much in the way of pointless filler or storylines that don't correlate with the main narrative. This gives it great pacing in my opinion with the constraints given. However this was also a negative for me; the main story they chose to focus on was one about a character who was connected to both protagonists and impacted them personally in some way. This left it feeling like the anime wasn't about the main couple but rather about this character and how they deal with revelations about them that leave them wrapped up in doubt and frustration. And with the short amount of episodes, the anime couldn't further explore the couple's story beyond that.That being said, the anime does have a conclusive ending that was the one everyone was waiting to see, and it felt very gratifying. It also has superb animation and attractive character designs that are incredibly pleasing to look at, as well as a top-tier soundtrack. For a show that felt more like an OVA than a full series, it was a pleasant surprise. The two main characters, Haruki and Miou, were both likeable and had unique traits about them which made them stand out from usual romance protagonists as well as being very cute with each other. The anime also focuses on two side couples which are also likeable and enjoyable to see develop and eventually receive a conclusion.Itsudatte Bokura no Koi wa 10 cm Datta is a short and sweet little romance series that I think a lot of people have missed, and I think it's exactly what lovers of romance/shoujo anime are looking for.

This is a compact yet sweet story highlighting the emerging love and dreams of two artistic teenagers.The story itself is quite heartwarming, even though it does have its own clichéness or genericness. While it's a short anime, the amount of plot included in each episode felt perfect. You can think of the timeline as a division of thirds. Starting with the connection, then the breakdown, and lastly the resolution. The other characters didn't had that much screentime compared to the main pair but as supportive characters, they were handled well....This did gave more focus to the MCs, and overall, the progression for their development flowed nicely from the start towards the end. A bit of melodramatic hiccups around the middle part is the only thing that I found to be forceful to their personality. As for their passion in films and drawings respectively, this theme was a welcomed addition to create more layers to the story. Passion is definitely a strong emotion, something akin to a double-edged sword. Stemming from their love of their own aspirations, in certain situations, can lead to depression but the latter more positive side to it is a stronger romantic love. This part was the aspect that engaged me to what would otherwise be a bland narrative.Visually, the art style is the definition of eye-catching. It kept that floating feeling in the air, an atmosphere that warmed my heart at a lot of their interactions. The animation was smooth though in a way, it does get a bit repetitive for their dynamic movement. It's a minor letdown anyways because the blushes and reactions from the characters were still adorable to see. An aspect that I found to be the strongest was the auditory section. Firstly, the OP and ED was catchy and very fun to listen to, especially with the ending song. The harmonious singing-in-tune and overall beat of the song conveyed the pleasant side of this anime. All of the background music that were used also sounded sweet to my ears. Piano is one of my favorite instrument so hearing this familiar sound from a few scenes had a complementing effect on me.All in all, it's not a special romantic anime but it had this joyful atmosphere that made me want to see the love development all the way through the end. Certainly was a momentary but enjoyable heartwarmer. This did gave more focus to the MCs, and overall, the progression for their development flowed nicely from the start towards the end.

I can name so many romance anime that had to reach 12 or 24 episodes to do what this anime did.

While the art wasn't commendable, I still give my commendation to the team for making sure that the emotions that surged through Miou and Haruki were given light to make the audience understand the validity of what they were going through and why it was a struggle for the both of them to convey their feelings for one another.You don't always see anime with 6 episodes that can conclude this well and can truly satisfy your desire to see how the story ends.

It knows exactly what its strengths are, and it sticks to them.  In that sense it reminds me of Violet Evergarden, another melancholy drama which came out a year later, though the setting and subject matter are much different.10 Centimeters focuses on two characters in their final year of high school, artist Miou and filmmaker Haruki. It\'s the old...trope about opposites attracting.  Miou is a shy girl who lacks confidence in herself and her talent.  Haruki is cocky and brash.  They walk home together every day, and sit on the most memorable anime staircase since Your Name, talking and enjoying each other\'s company, their hands always--you guessed it--10 Centimeters Apart.Miou and Haruki each have a pair of friends, other members of their art club and filmmaking club respectively, who I gather are important to other parts of this franchise.  (I guess there are two movies; I haven\'t seen them, and won\'t discuss them here.)I think, oddly enough, what I found most notable about this series was what it *didn\'t* have.  There are no annoying love triangles and very little teen angst about their friends.  There\'s no backstabbing of any kind--Miou and Haruki both seem to have chosen really good people to be friends with, and additional drama is unnecessary.There\'s no fanservice.  In fact, this is a rare show where I really can\'t tell what demographic it was primarily aimed at, and that\'s a good thing.  The art style is nebulous and could be shounen, shoujo, or somewhere in between.  Nobody seems particularly idealized, like a fantasy girl/boy to pine after.  Nobody seems particularly blank, like an audience stand-in.  They all just seem like regular kids.There\'s no ridiculous slapstick or juvenile, prurient comedy.  There\'s no abusive behavior, aside from one dramatic moment, which I\'d argue was well-earned and forgiveable.  People hurt each other emotionally, but not out of maliciousness--out of misguided good intentions.  Sometimes the characters act stupid, but they act stupid in the way that teenagers do, with their crashing self-esteem and raging hormones and poor understanding of the world.It\'s all just solid.  There\'s nothing I can really criticize too harshly.  The only thing I can really say is that while I appreciate a show which doesn\'t turn me off to it in one way or another through easily-avoidable mistakes, that lack of risk-taking also veers into predictability.  Which brings me back around to Violet Evergarden.  Again, a very different show, but one which suffers from the same problem: You never really doubt the outcome of anything that happens.  10 Centimeters is the same way.  It has few surprises, and the plot turns are obvious and telegraphed.  It\'s effective and enjoyable, but it will never blow you away.The art and production are in the same vein.  This is a series I rated a solid 8 right down the line.  The characters are distinct and identifiable, but somehow a bit generic at the same time.  The animation is well-executed, and occasionally very good, but never astonishing.  Sound design, music, voices--it\'s all just very good.  Very good--but not great.The only other mild criticism I have is that I think the translation could use some work (I watched it subtitled on CR).  It\'s not the worst, but it comes across as overly-literal.  The way things are phrased is probably the most accurate depiction of the original Japanese, but it sometimes sounds stilted and strange in English; like using the term ""lifesaver"" for a person who saved someone\'s life, or using someone\'s name when talking to them rather than saying ""you"".But that\'s a minor gripe.  Overall, if you enjoy high school slice of life or romance series, give this one a shot.  It\'s only six episodes, so it\'s a small investment, and well, as you can tell by my review--there\'s nothing wrong with it.  It\'s good.  It\'s *fine*. trope about opposites attracting.

The characters behavior is understandable, the art style is pretty and the plot wasn\'t annoying at all.

Bring two creative people with absolutely different personalities and you will see a great match. These two were meant for each other from the beginning.I like the atmosphere of ""we are meant to be but let\'s wait"" because it makes you feel like you are waiting for something big, something special....As long as you are waiting you story isn\'t finished.

The soundtrack used are on point that it gave an added emotion to the scenes. The build up of the story is good especially on the second half of the show. This anime is so refreshing and inspiring. It teaches about love, dreams, patience, hope, and that no matter what happens there are people out there that are sincerely waiting and cheering for you. It can be your friend, family, loveones, or someone who admire you so do not take yourself lightly.

The story is short, concise, and doesn\'t hold it\'s punches.The way this anime contrasts themes of love with serious themes such as death and remorse gives this anime a unique feel.

The emotions of the main characters during the time following this event are...written well.

It isn't amazing, unique or essential, but if you like these sorts of sentimental dramas, you'll still be able to enjoy it.  Minor spoilers below.10 cm is a nice, but predictable love story overall.  As you can likely tell from the title, the story is mostly about various plot contrivances that keep the main leads, Haruki and Miou, from getting together even though it's clear from the moment the series starts that they're already in love with each other.  It takes a few twists, but you'll see them coming from a mile away....It's not necessarily a bad thing, since that just means it's progressing naturally in a way that makes sense to the viewer, but it also means that the series stays firmly within your expectations and never takes any risks.Some of it can be a bit too contrived as well, such as a part where Miou's mother allows her to meet the person that saved her life, but doesn't tell her that the person is already dead and she's being taken to a grave.  This is a completely cruel thing for her to do, and it's only happening to fool the audience watching at home.  There is no reason at all within the show's internal logic for her mother to hold that information back and surprise Miou with it.  Sometimes the drama seems forced or unnatural like this, like it breaks your immersion to realize that things are happening solely because they're Plot Developments for the benefit of the audience, not something naturally occurring within the story.That sort of maximalist approach to melodrama is the norm in this series, but because it's only 6 episodes, it never gets to the point of being over-the-top or grating.  The short season format works against it in some ways, as you don't get to know the side characters as well as you would like, but the gimmick of increasingly improbable events keeping the main couple apart would have gotten annoying if it had been dragged out to a full 12 episode season, so overall it's a positive thing that it was kept short.The characters are a bit flat unfortunately, Miou is shy and withdrawn and Haruki is popular and brash.  They get a little bit of development, but only a little considering how short the series is.  Haruki's crisis of confidence about whether he wants to be a director is the most interesting development, but I also just watched a superior version of a nearly identical storyline with Touko in YagaKimi, so it suffers by comparison.  All that being said, the main couple is still very nice and you want to root for them to be together.  Even if the characters are nothing special, I was invested in their relationship and its eventual resolution.The one place the series really stands out in a positive way is its use of insert songs.  You get one in almost every episode and they always nail the perfect mood and enhance the scene they're playing over.  The sound design, music and voice acting is all very well done, and those are things that I typically don't take note of unless they're especially great.

When I saw it was only 6 episodes I thought to myself, ""There\'s no way that this will be a solid anime, 6 episodes is not nearly enough to develop a solid story and develop the characters."" I was wrong. The way that they were able to develop the characters and story in just 6 episodes was nothing short of an amazing show of their expertise. It\'s not easy to develop characters and story so strongly in such a little amount of time...but the studio managed. Not only was the writing beautiful, but the visuals were so appealing to the eye. The heavy use of warm colors gave the show a soft feel and further helped the story. This is definitely an anime that I wish was longer but it\'s also a nice change of pace from the typical 12 episode, horribly slow developing romance animes. I highly recommend this to anyone.

I will say that I did like the secondary characters more than the leads as they were actually really supportive to the main character's struggles.And as frustrating as the characters were, the story, which started as your typical tale of young love, ended up being even more irritating. The story ended up to be a melodramatic, non...sequitur narrative caused by the unreasonable guilt and thinking of the main heroine. Without going into detail, the main character becomes extremely annoying and thinks so poorly of herself it made me lose all pity for her. Additionally the main guy has this strange mental breakdown that makes him question his future and made me question if this anime was under a different genre completely. I would've been happy if they cut out two episodes of the two characters contemplating and walking in circles around each other.HOWEVER, I still admit that each cliche continuously fed my guilty pleasures and I watched the six episodes not completely offended. It was overall sweet and romantic which is what it promised and although I had a lot of problems with the characters and the story I will say that the emotion had me back on board by the end.Watch this anime if you're bored (and you're really craving some romance), fully expecting the problems that will arise, and just taking it for what it is--a cliched, romantic comedy for teenage girls. sequitur narrative caused by the unreasonable guilt and thinking of the main heroine.

Putting this in front just because I tend to be very sensitive when it comes to any type of spoilers, so some of you might not want to read this just yet until they have seen this for yourself.It might be standard, cliche or whatever you wanna call it, but at the end of the day it was still pretty good in my honest opinion. I\'m not gonna deny the fact that overtime watching the same stuff over and over again...has influenced me in a way so I don\'t ""enjoy"" these cliche romance animes as much as I used to, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that they are bad. (I still enjoy them, just not as much as before) Many people tend to believe that because something has already happened in some other anime it\'s suddenly not as good anymore, which is a rather stupid way of thinking, or atleast that\'s how I see it.This anime so far resembles many romance/shoujo anime and if you have watched a ton, I\'m pretty sure you already know what I mean (and If you haven\'t you shouldn\'t be quick to judge). What this anime/movies (this whole HoneyWorks thing in general) tries to do is capitalize on these so called cliches and present them as well as they can, and I think they are doing a fairly good job on this.Soundtrack was decent, art is my favourite part as usual and characters even though they are completely generic have some sides which I tend to adore a lot. Also I\'ve always wanted this type of a setting where there are a bunch of stories told and they intertwine with each other in a fascinating way, All in all, you shouldn\'t expect much groundbreaking plot twists from this anime but enjoy it just as it is: a completely generic but well done high-school love story.If you love these types of anime I guarantee that you will enjoy this quite a bit and if you haven\'t watched the rest of the story so far go ahead and catch up (there are 2 movies) and if you don\'t, oh well just go ahead and watch something else :) has influenced me in a way so I don\'t ""enjoy"" these cliche romance animes as much as I used to, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean that they are bad.

This show is riding the whole ""misunderstanding/miscommunication\' wave TOO hard. It literally makes something that much harder to watch when the problem or in this case, the miscommunication could be fixed with a simple exchange of words! I\'m stopping almost every 5 min out of anger to rant because of Miou\'s thoughts and decisions. I get the whole not being confident and shy but GEE WILLIKERS ease up on the poor-decision making/ thought process. It\'s not hard to make...the conflict in an anime interesting. Like WOW. It got hard to watch. I am going to continue watching because I\'ve watched almost every romance anime there is and I felt like watching one and had no other choice unless I wanted to re-watch something. But as stated in the first sentence, I\'m only on episode 4 so hopefully, it can redeem itself but honestly if I watch this episode and they are still on the same problem it will be looking grim... the conflict in an anime interesting.

I haven\'t watched those and I am not familiar with the HoneyWorks project. I just found this anime randomly and it seemed quite cute so I decided to give it a try but now I\'ll definitely look into the other movies as well.I finished this in one day and I did enjoy it quite a bit. I must say that all the characters in this short series are very likeable and quite adorable. Now that I know there are 2 other movies, I understand why we don\'t...get too much info about the ""supporting characters"".The story was nothing extraordinary, a typical shy girl - popular guy shoujo but that doesn\'t bother me at all. I can never get bored of these high-school romance anime, no matter how many I see.Maybe what I didn\'t like about the story was this theme that keeps repeating in anime: boy/girl goes to study abroad for x number of years, during which the other person must wait for them. For me that\'s a very sad thing to watch. And I felt even more disappointment when I learned that during 7 years Haruki didn\'t contact Miou... Eh??! Poor Miou! Who does that? And just at the end of the series, just for a few seconds we finally see Haruki coming back and confessing his love for Miou. This ending is so japanese-like. Even though I felt relieved that he came back and still wanted to be with her, I can\'t say it was a satisfying ending. I decided to give it a 9 because of that (>.<).It\'s truly a cute mini series. The artwork is beautiful to look at so don\'t miss it! It should definitely have a higher score. get too much info about the ""supporting characters"".The story was nothing extraordinary, a typical shy girl - popular guy shoujo but that doesn\'t bother me at all.

Here are my thoughts:This is just a 6-episode anime, so I\'ll try to be brief. Although you can watch this show on its own with ease, it is sort of a sequel. There is a sorta-prequel movie with the same cast, but the MCs from this anime are minor supporting characters instead (and vice versa for this anime – the movie MCs are supporting characters). The sorta-prequel movie I\'m referring to is Zutto Mae Kara Suki Deshita; I didn\'t particularly like it (for pretty...much the same reasons as this anime) and rated it 4/10 when I watched it 2 years ago. Anyway, moving along from this preamble...As you might guess, this is a typical highschool romance show. I found it quite mediocre. There are a few decent scenes, but it doesn\'t compensate for all the other lackluster content. My average level of enjoyment while watching was low. There were flickers of emotionally engaging romance (ex. the fireworks scene), but they were infrequent.The story in general is weak, and the second half of the series is filled with forced drama. Sometimes the actions of the characters don\'t make any sense.The characters are, at best, generic. In fact they are borderline unlikable, particularly the male MC. The supporting cast is totally generic and might as well be cardboard-cutout props.The visuals are adequate but unremarkable, as is the audio in general (both music and voice acting). The character designs are totally generic, although Miou\'s brown hair/eyes do look nice. I will say that sometimes the facial expressions are well done, but these moments are infrequent.My overall rating: 4/10This is a totally generic mediocre highschool romance show with no particularly noteworthy qualities. There were a few decent scenes, but they were not nearly plentiful enough to satisfy me. There is a lot of forced drama, and the characters range from generic (at best) to unlikable.There is a music group by the name of Honeyworks that has been strongly associated with this franchise. I attentively listened to a bunch of their albums (about 75 songs) and found ~10 songs I liked enough to set aside for future listening. So, although there was stuff I kinda liked, the signal-to-noise ratio was high.There isn\'t much of value in this franchise. I recommend avoiding it entirely unless you are obsessed with highschool romance. I tried to like this franchise and gave it many chances, but every single thing I tried was mediocre at best.

No idea why. And I hate myself for that. This anime really pictures well so many aspects of life in such little amount of time (6 episodes).. It really impressed me. Thus, the animation, the story and ending (no spoilers I promise) is what's making it shine so much.The animation quality is phenomenal. Sure there is better out there, but the fact that it only lasted 6 episodes compared to the recent years standard 12-13 episodes series make it so that budget was probably put on the quality over quantity....And it shows, vfx and the barebone movement of the characters are fabulous. You don't get any useless panties shot or whatever, which is also very relaxing. We get to focus on what's important and what's beautiful. The animation really suits well the type of anime it is trying (and succeeding at) to be.The story was absolutely touching and I've been on the edge of tears many times trough the episodes. It pictures a lot of heavy emotions with realistic feelings or scenarios, which I'm sure anyone can relate to at least one bit of it. No matter if it's the depression, sadness, love, loneliness or the overwhelm you may feel when you think of the pressure of wanting to succeed, you'd get at least one flashback at your own life. - (yappy yap about my life to explain my point, if you don't care skip to next paragraph) Recently, I have been struggling with my success and studies and what to do in life. Kind of in an existential crisis way. And seeing something similar happen in the anime gave me goosebumps. I can't explain much without spoiling, but you will see troubles and how they managed it. And I really think it can touch anyone in a way.Most anime ends on a never ending bi-monthly chap release without any progress (ahem rent a girlfriend), but the ending was natural. We get answers in the matter of 6 episodes. But, where it would lose points, is that everything happens so fast that we barely see any character development. It's like they've always been like that. Sure it's a way of doing things, but it leaves a lot of questions and emotions untouched. It would probably need an OAV, but that's unlikely.I'm glad I saw that anime. Without hesitation, it's a new pick in my top 10. And it shows, vfx and the barebone movement of the characters are fabulous.
