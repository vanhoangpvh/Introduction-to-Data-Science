Plawres Sanshirou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1873/Plawres_Sanshirou,"[""Plawres has a strong focus on the robot wrestling battles that are titular to the series. These battles are a constant throughout the series and are characterized by wrestling moves and techniques but their repertoires are expanded as the series progresses.There is little I can say about this anime, what you see is what you get. It's a mostly lighthearted show with an villain-of-the-week formula. Each character serves their role but they are not explored in much detail, with the exception of the mysterious Ms Sheila Misty. Sanshirou gets the majority of the screen time, with everyone else regulated to supporting roles.The art style of...the anime is nice but it does not stand out from its peers. There are however flashes of excellent animation that spice up the fights.The design and abilities of each robot are distinctive but lack the expected appeal of made-to-be-marketed soft vinyl figures. But maybe that's just me.Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, who would later make the Pokemon anime. It becomes apparent that Pokemon incorporated elements of plawres, mainly the 1 vs 1 proxy battle structure, with a commander and a commanded.My main complaint is that I never got invested into the battles. You can have the best choreography and animation but it won't matter if I don't care about the characters.Overall, I had a fun if unmemorable time with this show. the anime is nice but it does not stand out from its peers.

Nanatsu no Umi no Tico,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3199/Nanatsu_no_Umi_no_Tico,"[""It's ironic that amongst the World Masterpiece Theatre Project which adapted so called famous children literature, Nanatsu no Umi no Tico or Tico of the Seven Sea seems like the only anime that cares about its targeted audience with an intriguing and breath-taking adventure from the start to the very end.Produced by Nippon Animation in 1994, Tico of the Seven Sea is the only original work of the project. Getting rid of the usual set up, the anime present a lovely story about Nanami, who lives on a boat and travelled around the world with her dad and a mechanic. And wonderfully, she's friend with...a killer whale named Tico. Along the way, they will befriend with more colorful characters and embark on a journey to find the legendary Luminous Whale, a creature that Nanami's father spent his whole life to chase.No more sadness and depression from seeing a rough childhood of some lovely girls, no more poor houses, no more unnecessary drama... We will follow a peculiar and realistic journey into the deep sea, follow the path that the legends passed on to people all over the earth. Along with a likable cast, any kids will feel their adventurous spirit burning hot. Even with more mature viewers, the experiences will be enjoyable and interesting. Every two or three episodes, the anime will visit a different place and meet different people, so I'm sure you'll never get bored.The animation is very standard for the time. And I don't really like the character's design of the WMT since they're too alike, You'll see this type of characters everywhere if you're on a binge of WMT like me.The op and ed is rather forgettable but the ost is good and very fitting with the situations they're in. But nothing too spectacular.Overall, Tico of the Seven Sea is one of the most enjoyable anime of the World Masterpiece Theater, I advised you to watch it last and surely, it will end on a nice note. a killer whale named Tico.

I can't say it's my favorite world masterpiece anime but fans of world masterpiece theater should definitely check it out.Story - 8The story focus's mainly on Scott's dream of finding the luminous whale. There are a few smaller arcs and one off episodes but mainly the story is centered around finding the luminous whale.Art - 7I liked the art, it is a bit simple, but the way the show depicts sea creatures and under water environments is nice.Sound - 7Sound is also fine, the intro and outro songs are catchy...with a joyful tone. The sound in the actual show is just average.Characters - 9I loved the characters in this show. Nanami is a very cheerful young girl with a strong love of animals. Scott is a marine biologist and single father of Nanami. Al is a treasure hungry ship mechanic and chef. Cheryl is the spoiled rich girl who's itching for adventure. Then there's Tico who is an Orca that Scott saved when she was a baby and travels with them everywhere they go.Alot of the show is based around Nanami and Tico's relationship, which is just a joy to watch.Enjoyment - 9When I finished the show and looked back on it I realized I had enjoyed it more than I thought. It was charming wholesome adventure and I admittedly felt a bit empty inside knowing that there was no more of it left. with a joyful tone.

Naruto x UT,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10075/Naruto_x_UT,"[""Umm completely and utterly epic. I don't know what has just happened- maybe spoilers for the end of naruto, or an awesome professional AMV, but it was really good. I re watched it about 10 times. And to be honest, it's only 6 minutes long, so i don't see why you're still reading this, and not watching it.[Also, Aqua timez is an awesome band anyway, so it's all good] "", ""Honestly this isn't a review, but an observation of what this six minute OVA could be.Naruto x UT, is it an awesome ova displaying some of Naruto and Sasuke's best moments from Naruto and Naruto Shippuden in arguably better animation than the anime, movies, or ovas ever had?Or is it a sneak peek into the future of the story?I have two possibilities of what this ova could be.1. On January 1st 2011, people in japan were able to buy T-shirts of the Naruto fame, and including the shirts, they also received a promotional ova that shows a six minute animation featuring a fight between Naruto...and Sasuke, that just seems so unbelievably canon that it seems like it's showing whats to come in the future of the Naruto series.In fact, it just might be. The ova displays such events that seem to be so congruent with the anime and manga, especially to those who have been keeping up with current events in the manga.But the thing is: As of this sentence, these events had yet to happen in the anime, heck even in the manga.Is this ova a strange sneak peek in the future of the series?I would have no problem believing so, I mean why would they go and make something like this with such hi quality animation no less, or it could just be-2. A promotional ova and nothing more, but that's a little hard to believe.OVERALL:+ Some the best animation a Naruto series has ever displayed.+ A possible look in the future of the series.- Could just be a promotional ova, that's just coincidentally showing events that had to do with the series. and Sasuke, that just seems so unbelievably canon that it seems like it's showing whats to come in the future of the Naruto series.In fact, it just might be.

Pretty good fight between naruto and sasuke and highlights their struggles to get where they are. ', ""This isn't even going to be a review, this is going to be a fucking rant.This 6 short few minutes OVA seriously just shows the potential of how awesome and amazing Naruto could have been. Not the crap shit it is right now with all the fillers memories talking etc.... JUST LOOK AT THIS!!!The fight scenes look INTENSE, there's no constant TALKING, no NEEDLESS FILLERS, no MEANINGLESS FLASHBACKS FOR 5 HOURS,Just straight, high end, kick ass fighting. AHHHHHH,It's just so frustrating cus this, THIS, THIS 6 MINUTE OVA, IS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE POTENTIAL NARUTO COULDA BEEN, BUT NOOOO YOU JUST GOTTA RUIN...IT BY FUCKING ADDING 5 BILLION HOURS WORTH OF FILLERS TO CASH DRY THE SHIT OUT OF THAT SHOW,FUCK...Told you this was just gonna be a rant :/ IT BY FUCKING ADDING 5 BILLION HOURS WORTH OF FILLERS TO CASH DRY THE SHIT OUT OF THAT SHOW,FUCK...Told you this was just gonna be a rant :/"", 'After I finished Naruto shippuden I was like. "" Oh yeah I can watch those ovas"" and really that ova was amazing watching naruto till naruto shippuden until the end for seven months and then this made me cry naruto was a part of my life and I appreciate that ova for making me remember what I loved about naruto the characters the fights the villains and the bond between Naruto and Sasuke from kids to teens. You guys really have to watch this it\'s amazing and the nostalgia will hit you so hard it\'s not like the other ovas out there ', ""So, what even is Naruto x UT? Basically, it’s just a compilation of clips set to a song. Supposedly it’s newly animated clips, but honestly I couldn’t tell. Could be because it’s been quite a while since I’ve seen any Naruto episode, but the whole thing felt simply like a commercial. Or at best, an average AMV. And the song isn't interesting either.It has no actual point, it’s literally just random scenes that looked cool. It’s not cool, it’s a bit cringy, though that might be because of my distaste for the Naruto franchise as a whole, and I shouldn’t let that influence my rating...of this special in specific. Then again, if judged outside of context of Naruto, it’s literally just mash-up of unconnected stuff, so through both points of view, Naruto x UT doesn’t come out as rated good.But, if you’re a Naruto fanboy, you’ll probably love this. Is the Naruto fanbase even still alive? Idk. of this special in specific.

Nisekoi OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24227/Nisekoi_OVA,"[""Nisekoi is your typical romcom harem that is produced by the almighty Shaft and I watched the OVA expecting nothing less than an almost-nil developing plot and the huge amount of laughs that goes along with it just like it did on its first 20 episodes.Some anime enthusiasts will complain why Komi Naoshi, Weekly Shounen Jump's Nisekoi mangaka, won't pick the best girl. The stalemate went on in the first season and you can only expect it to continue until the end of the world. Let's be honest with ourselves. We all love our girls. Some parts of us will sail with Chitoge. Maybe...a huge part of us will never let go of Onodera being the best girl. But we just have to take a chill pill and agree to disagree that there won't be any use debating who Raku will end up with.This stalemate is the epitome of the Nisekoi plot. If the day comes that Nisekoi comes to an end without the world dying yet, and Komi Naoshi has to pick the best girl, I will truly be heartbroken and maybe will start considering polygamous relationships. (lol)Nisekoi quality didn't drop. It's still as refreshing as the first season and enjoyment was outstanding. Cheers. a huge part of us will never let go of Onodera being the best girl.

Cheers."", '~EDITED REVIEW~Nisekoi is a romantic comedy/harem that came out Winter 2014 and I sure miss that series. The Nisekoi OVA, I can say for sure, was a blast to watch and  is enjoyable just like the show itself. But even as good as it was, it still has flaws.There are 3 episodes of the OVA, so let me talk about each one individually.Nisekoi OVA #1:The main focus of this OVA is the slight development to Onodera and Raku\'s love. (And since I am a big shipper of the OnoderaxRaku thing I really felt that the OVA was adorable) But don\'t worry...Chitoge fans, because they still manage to keep the comedic relationship between Raku and her. And believe me, it was totally worth it and hilarious.For certainty, this OVA could be for everyone, but is more directed to the Onodera shippers. Due to it lacking some screen time for the other characters it might be disappointing for others. Nevertheless, I still recommend this OVA for people to watch if you already saw the series.Nisekoi OVA #2The first half of the OVA focuses on Marika Tachibana having a part time job at a family restaurant. You may be thinking, ""Why does she need a job if she is already rich?"" It is later explained in the episode, but the reveal is actually quite sweet and endearing. What I got from this first half was that is showed really great development for Marika.The 2nd half managed to give screen time to all the characters of the show. It was New Year\'s Day and everyone comes to visit Raku\'s household. While they are at the house, all the girls got drunk and start being flirtatious with Raku (except Ruri). And by the end, we assume that all the girls did ""something"" with him. But instead are given an idea that is was all a dream. I felt this one was the weirdest out of all the parts of the OVA but still gave us quite a few laughs.Nisekoi OVA #3OVA #3 is a hot spring episode with all the the characters shown. However, all the girls in the series were just there for fanservice. So if you are into that type of stuff, then this episode could be for you. As a person who doesn\'t like fanservice I was quite disappointed.This OVA does have a good thing to it though! We were introduced to new characters that is in Nisekoi season 2, so that\'s a plus.In all, this episode is the one I liked the least. If you like the ecchi type of atmosphere to a harem anime, then you may end up liking this a lot.Anyways, try checking it out! The Nisekoi OVA\'s  are something you should at least watch watch if you were a fan of the series beforehand. Though some episodes may not be good as others, they still are enjoyable at the least. If you haven\'t watched Nisekoi, then I recommend that you should watch it too. Hope you give it a watch and have fun watching it.

The Nisekoi OVA, I can explain who it's good for my opinion per episode :OVA 1:This OVA about relationship Onodera and Raku.THis can fully be liked if you're a Onodera fan happy. But I think it's good who watch the series.. and this ova quite good because RomCom in this anime is there.OVA 2This OVA focuses on Marika Tachibana having a part time job at a family restaurant.  What I got from this first half was that is showed really great development for Marika. and 2nd focuses a new year party who all character...there. And who like harem genre . it's almost paradise.OVA 3 :This OVA can be opening for season 2 who there is new character who will there in season 2In all, this episode is the one I liked the least.

Otona Joshi no Anime Time,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10178/Otona_Joshi_no_Anime_Time,"['""With age comes wisdom, but sometimes age comes alone."" - Oscar WildeWith the passing of every year one can\'t help but feel nostalgic at times. As you get older, you might find yourself asking, ""Where did all the time go?"" or ""When did I get so old?"" In those moments, we often find ourselves looking back towards the past. There were moments that you felt happy and sad, content and depressed, ecstatic and lazy, full of love and full of regret. There were the soaring highs and there were the abysmal lows. There were moments when you wondered what if. Would things have turned out...differently? Did I make the wrong choices? The possibilities are so vast that they can make your mind wander endlessly. However, the past is the past and what\'s done is done. After all, what good is a life that starts with an ""if""? You are right here.Otona Joshi no Anime Time is a set of four short stories that peer into the lives of Japanese women. This isn\'t a series that\'s full of bliss, but rather a crude, unpolished look at what life really is, and can be like. For some, it may be extremely touching and heartfelt. For others, it might seem uninteresting and boring. Having completed all four of the episodes myself, I would say that this series is deliberately intended for a more mature audience. It\'s a series that makes you look over your shoulder, wondering if you made the right choices. It\'s a series that makes you afraid of getting old. It\'s a series that makes you want to go home and tell your mom that you love her.Each episode has their own varying degree of earnestness and subtleties; some of the stories come off as very disheartening, and others empowering. However, within each episode lies a lesson. Using well-crafted symbolism, dialogue, and direction, it\'s as if you\'ve been bestowed with a little bit of life\'s wisdom after each twenty minute segment. It\'s empowering and it\'s beautiful. The art, animation, and sound were good, all being somewhat different, yet fitting. But that\'s not what\'s really important here. It\'s not something you watch to be wowed by visuals. It\'s something you watch to be wowed by realism.At some point or another in your anime-watching lifetime, you should watch these episodes.

There are no gigantic eyes, no moe blushes, just a brief inner monologue concerning hopes and dreams, reality and all of life\'s ""what if\'s.""With only 24 minutes, Kawamo wo Suberu Kaze manages to give us a highly in-depth into Noriko\'s life, from her adolescent days to the near-finish of her lonely marriage. While it would be hard to describe the plot without giving much away, just know that it\'s good.The art and sound are nothing revolutionary, but fitting. The animation mixes photo-realism and a...soft and simplistic style, but manages to be incredibly expressive. There is nothing particular in Kawamo wo Suberu Kaze that makes it \'stand out,\' but the soft colors and gentle narration creates a calming atmosphere that manages to draw the watcher in flawlessly.Kawamo wo Suberu Kaze is by no means a perfect piece of work, but the sometimes heart wrenching portrayal of Noriko\'s life is something so rarely seen in anime today. It cuts straight to the heart of things and manages to stay grounded in reality.

Three additional one-shots aired under the same title and were merged into this entry in 2013.„Though the Asano River is known as the woman river, she always used to feel like an independent girl. Looking at her now, her banks sawn by slabs of concrete, controlling the current, this river is  now more of a crude lady.”Noriko, a 33 year-old woman, who lived abroad for 5 years, returns to her home town with her 4 year-old son. While she walks the small town she used to live in, we...slowly get to know of her past and her current life.This anime takes us not only into the mind and feelings of the main character. It tells us a story of life, decisions we made and reminisces of what could have been if we had followed a different path.The style in which this anime is directed is wonderful. Small gestures, the movements of the eyelids, the many different appearances of the main character in each time skip, they all tell us more of Noriko than the many monologues we’ll hear from her, can describe.  And the monologues are great. They are thoughtful yet never haunting; throughout the episode she narrates her story in a level-headed impartial style, which leaves us only our own opinion to judge her in the end.The music is fitting; it is most of the time subtle but takes action when needed and contributes nicely to the atmosphere of the story. The animation is solid.This anime may not be that enjoyable for those who are still not old enough for having to face important decisions you made. But for those, who have already set foot onto a path they have chosen, this anime is a nice intermission to look back for a moment, getting nostalgic and then turn your head and step towards to the stories life will offer in the future.Given, that this anime manages to tell such an intriguing story in a single episode of 25 minutes, I gave it a score of 9.In this short amount of time, this anime did everything right.I’m looking forward to seeing more from the director of this anime. slowly get to know of her past and her current life.This anime takes us not only into the mind and feelings of the main character.

But for those, who have already set foot onto a path they have chosen, this anime is a nice intermission to look back for a moment, getting nostalgic and then turn your head and step towards to the stories life will offer in the future.Given, that this anime manages to tell such an intriguing story in a single episode of 25 minutes, I gave it a score of 9.In this short amount of time, this anime did everything right.I’m looking forward to seeing more from the director of this anime.', 'This type of anime is probably my favorite , i love the calm story-telling anime with new characters every episode very much but this one was a bit different .I didn\'t like this one probably because of the way it was presented , the anime tries to make it like all the main characters are good characters and what they did was right , for example : the first episode had a very very shitty person as the main character , someone who cheated on their lover and hid the fact that she was pregnant from another man from her husband , the same thing...with the 2nd episode .While it may not have been planned but it feels like the anime is trying to say that cheating is ok as long as you don\'t love your husband/wife and tries to say that they deserve to be happy despite cheating on their loved ones which i personally hated that .The 3rd episode was nice tbh i thought for once in a while that an adult looking older character was cute and it had that funny ending with her so called ""childhood friend""The 4th episode was the best one because it had someone with actual dignity in it that was trying to defend herself and be a good person and it also had actual relatable worries and dealing with them not just using excuses to cheat or run away like in the first 2 episodes .So pretty much i give the episodes these ratings : 1 , 3 , 6 , 8.Overall i give it a 5 but wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone . with the 2nd episode .While it may not have been planned but it feels like the anime is trying to say that cheating is ok as long as you don\'t love your husband/wife and tries to say that they deserve to be happy despite cheating on their loved ones which i personally hated that .The 3rd episode was nice tbh i thought for once in a while that an adult looking older character was cute and it had that funny ending with her so called ""childhood friend""The 4th episode was the best one because it had someone with actual dignity in it that was trying to defend herself and be a good person and it also had actual relatable worries and dealing with them not just using excuses to cheat or run away like in the first 2 episodes .So pretty much i give the episodes these ratings : 1 , 3 , 6 , 8.Overall i give it a 5 but wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone .', 'And the morale of the story is, ""Live for yourself and to the fullest because life waits for no one.""After watching all four of the short stories the experience left me feeling nostalgic, and with an overall sense of warm happiness, [b]however[/b] it also left me with a feeling of fear in regards to the future.The short stories center around the lives of 4 different women between their late 20s to early 40s. The stories primarily focus on the age old theme of love; whether that be love in the form of friendship, motherly love, love of an old lover, or the love within...a new romantic relationship. It also delves into matters of life in general through the eyes of these women; life as a mother, wife, girlfriend, and worker. Sometimes things are lighthearted and fun, while at other times there is a stark portrayal of a dull grey life.It is a slow paced, slice of life romance josei drama so if you don\'t like such genres you may not enjoy it. However, I have to admit that I personally don\'t usually watch enjoy such genres but this I did enjoy immensely. Even though I am pretty young, I could still relate to their problems and emotions which was probably why I enjoyed it so much.In conclusion, I really did like this anime and would recommend it to most girls but possibly only guys who like slice of life, drama and romance anime. a new romantic relationship.

Every episode has a different woman as the main character and we get to see a bit of her daily life as well as get to know her thoughts. I really liked this show because the women depicted are just ordinary people and even though nothing really extraordinary happens to them it is easy to empathize with them. Every episode has a different type of animation and they all look really good.The first episode has a somberness to it. It kinda of reminded me of a Murakami short-story.The second one is cute and...romantic but hides some serious subjects.The third episode was the one I enjoyed the most. Probably because it's the funnier and the main character learns to laugh at herself.The last episode is the one that seemed more common, as in more relatable. I can think of a few women I know that have similar lives to the life the this main character has.None of the episodes has a conclusive ending to it and there's no big changes in these characters lives. Some learn lessons, other don't, but that isn't the point. The objective is to show that everyone has wishes and desires and hopes and regrets. The show does not really pass judgment on any of these women, it just shows who they are. And there's something very relatable on every of them. The honest and intimate way their thoughts and actions are portrayed brings out the viewer's emotions and insecurities. All of the characters seem real and that's one of the bigger compliments I can think of. romantic but hides some serious subjects.The third episode was the one I enjoyed the most.

They are really powerful stories. Each story presents a different perspective. This is a definite watch for adults with open mind.Episode 1 fells like the woman made the wrong choice, but who was to say how the world would have been like of she made the other choice. We just make a choice and hope for the best, but those choices are bound by our desires, like money, status, respect among everybody or a nice man with whom one might not have a rich life...as per society's standards but definitely a rich life as a small good happy family. She couldn't decide, went for a social richness and somehow everything just falls apart. She tries to come back, but sees the other road is no longer open. She makes decisions again, smiles, lies and sitting at the river of her hometown she sees she is now left alone only with her little kid, alone at the place where it all started, a place which held possibilities, but which now only seems like a faded dawn, yet she smiles.Episode 2 might be only one with perfect positive ending. A married woman who has always been told to do thing, parents, husband, in-laws and even her younger sister. A woman who always takes care of her responsibilities, but is never appreciated by anyone. She finds someone, whom she feels is a nice man and wants to be with him. Running away, living with the person she finally loves she comes to the realization of why she loves him, why she needs him. In the end everything works out well for her with an event where she thinks that the husband she ran away from might not be as bad as she thought, or rather she might be worse but everything coming to closure as she looks forward to the new life with her lover, who above all appreciates her.Episode 3 shows the crisis of a 40 year old unmarried woman, who wants to have a happy life. Her excited school reunion with her middle school crush turns out a scam, she just laughs it off. True it might not be anything dramatic, rather something to just laugh and walk on, she again realizes she still has no person to share her life with.Episode 4, might get some people down. A 43 year old housewife who takes care of entire family, even works part time at night when her husband loses job, is unappreciated by everyone. A son who says he hates to have dinner with his family, a daughter who doesn't come home, a mother who just keeps makes her life worse, a guy who tries to hit on her. When her relationship with her daughter turns somewhat sour how she comes back to take things, if not much, slightly in control to realize that she is not just living for others she has or rather will live for herself as well. as per society's standards but definitely a rich life as a small good happy family.

A very light hearted storyline with more inclination towards reality and pragmatism and the way we lead our lives now a days. This is about a girl who looks back into the past and ponders over the decision she took then ""what if"". Our whole life revolves around such ""whats if""s. Its a simple and peaceful story with a lot of hidden meanings inside. Watching it brings calmness to your mind and you feel a lot of warmth inside you.I won\'t recommend this to just anyone. But people who love anime and are mature enough to understand...how life actually revolves around them. It is in short an adorable movie. how life actually revolves around them.

Mixing the usual soft sytle for the characters with some kind of photo extrapolated backgrounds really added to the overal picture.  The sounds were so realistic that when I was not looking, I would have believed it was live action.The main problem I have with this special was the characters, mainly the lead. I don't like her.  I don't hate her, but there is just not a lot to like either.  She regrets the decisions she has made, but anyone with some common sense could have advised her...better than what she did.  Whenever she discribed her marraige, it seemed like it was just something to accomplish without really dealing with any strong emotions.  Then having trouble when they grow apart.  Big surprise there.Overall, I won't remember this a day or two from now.  The only surprising thing was when the boy smiled at the end.

Everything from the stories to art style were very enjoyable for someone who has aged out of a lot of anime. I was looking for a short, simple, more mature show I could enjoy with a drink and whew boy I found it.Each ep revolved around a different matured woman, a POV in anime rarely seen. These women tended to have some degree of a selfish streak, but you know what? Good for them. I found myself rooting for them no mater how flawed their approach to life was....I think many fellow older women will find these 4 stories relatable and enjoyable, especially if you still haven't quite found your way. I think many fellow older women will find these 4 stories relatable and enjoyable, especially if you still haven't quite found your way."", 'So I’m writing this review just to clear up my thoughts on this series. Otona Joshi no Anime Time is a collection of four stories, each bearing a different message and each presenting new characters. The show was mesmerizing for the reason that it was done by studio Bones, a studio you should rely on when it comes to aesthetics. As soon as I saw it, I put it in my plan-to-watch list — it’s been there for quite a while now. So I finally decided to check it out, and here are my thoughts.I will list all four stories and what I thought about...each.Episode one:My first impression with this episode was that studio Bones lived up to my expectations and did a pretty job with the visuals.Now, going into the story, we are greeted by Noriko, the protagonist. She has a child — but that’s not what’s interesting about her. What’s interesting is the fact that the story goes back and forth between the present and the past, putting a contrast between young Noriko, and old Noriko.There may be a lot of shows that do this — going back and forth between the past and present — but I haven’t seen it done in anime frequently (again, I know it has been done before, just not very commonly). Even something like Naruto with its filler episodes doesn’t count as what I’m describing. Because with Otona Joshi, it very frequently goes back and forth — which was the main thing that made this show engaging. “Great. A show that’s done something not commonly done,” I thought.Going to the main story though, this show isn’t really special with its storytelling. It wasn’t really bad though — I actually prefer this episode/story over any other episode of this show (except for episode two). But this was pretty much your everyday, “I slept with a guy, and then many years later, I got married with another one. Then I beget a child, and that child isn’t my husband’s, but the guy I slept with.”Even though I’ve seen this many times before, I still pretty much liked this episode.6/10.Episode two:Unpopular opinion: this is the best episode of this show. Well, aside from the fact that the guy compared the girl to a freaking — I’m not joking — a bird, cat, or whatever. This was the most “WTF” moment of the whole show. Actually, I take that back. Read episode three to discover something more “WTF-y”.In any case, this is an odd story about a woman who falls in love with a waste collector/dustman, because she can. That’s literally the only reason. That’s why this story is more “odd” unlike the last one.Because Mimi’s reason for existence is not that relatable, unless you are a housewife of something. Her reason for existence is to cook for his lover, have intercourse, sleep — that’s it. This is basically a slice-of-life episode. But that’s why I liked it.As for the visuals, I’m highly disappointed. No one has a nose.I have nothing more to say for this episode aside from WHO THE HELL CALLS HIS LOVER A FREAKING ANIMAL?6.5/10Moving on to episode three:The worst episode by far. One thing that I hate, which is commonly used in fiction and self-help books, etc., is this: “I was a child and thought of the future as though I’d get married at 20 and have children at 30 and have white hair at 50 — but that’s not what happened. I ended up having such a depressing life and I became addicted to alcohol and became depressed, and addicted to alcohol, and became depressed, and did I mention the fact that I became addicted to alcohol?”I hate this trope so much. That’s not how life is at all. Life is actually pretty mediocre and not as depressing as they make it out to be. 95% of the time, life IS just graduating from college, getting married, having children, and growing old. What else is it otherwise? Such a misrepresentation, so commonly used... so incorrect.Anyway, I mentioned the fact that episode two had a “WTF” moment, but episode three had worse. What exactly is more ridiculous that calling your girlfriend an animal, you ask? A random guy suddenly appearing and cosplaying as your old crush back in school and having intercourse with you in a hotel, and then you finding out the fact that he wasn’t actually your old crush, but a stranger you haven’t met before. How did he know her name and for what reason he did that and how much of a chance is there for a doppelgänger to appear, I don’t freaking know.Such a meaningless episode. I hated it. Visual-wise, it was meh.2/10Last but not least, episode four:Umm, what...? I’m not trolling right here, what happened? I can’t, and probably can‘t ever comprehend what happened in this episode. Maybe because I’m not a parent? (Also, why is every protagonist from this show a female? Not to be sexist or anything, just wondering)Visual-wise: meh.4/10The end.Don’t look into this review much. It’s as mediocre as any review on MyAnimeList can get. I just wanted to clear my thoughts.I hope you enjoyed the read :) each.Episode one:My first impression with this episode was that studio Bones lived up to my expectations and did a pretty job with the visuals.Now, going into the story, we are greeted by Noriko, the protagonist.

There are some obvious low-effort artworks and animations in the episodes. At times the plot does not seem to move along fast enough. Also there are points when the expected plot development fizzles out somewhat. Yet, I loved it. I love to find that there are anime shows like these for someone at my age.This show consists to 4 episodes, with 4 short-stories as plots for each, with central characters all women.If you are past the age to watch...anime shows targeted towards teenagers or YAs, give this a try.Yeah, I know... there are not many you get to watch and re-watching old favourites can be tiring at times. anime shows targeted towards teenagers or YAs, give this a try.Yeah, I know... there are not many you get to watch and re-watching old favourites can be tiring at times.', ""I only watched the 4th episode after completing the 1st. Found this series through an article about mature romances, but it was just straight depressing. The woman from the first episode is an evil piece of shit. She passed on a dude that had feelings for her even though it was mutual, ignored him for 10 years, fucked him before her wedding with another man, got pregnant with the dude and never told the man she married that he wasn't the father; went back 5 years later to check up on the other dude, and lied to him about the age of her son so...the guy wouldn't know that it was his kid.She's evil because she committed paternity fraud by cheating on her husband and forcing him to pay for another man's kid for 4 years, and then she hides the kid from his actual father. I feel so bad for all the men in this situation, especially the son, but the show doesn't punish the woman or show her in a negative light. It doesn't praise her either, but what was the point of it all? I thought it was supposed to be a mature romance.The fourth episode was rough too. I like how it ended with the character trying to adopt a better outlook on life, but the part where she accused her pushy asshole coworker of rape felt weird because all he done up to that point was drive her to get drinks. Just seems like this show demonizes men, but never holds the female characters accountable. the guy wouldn't know that it was his kid.She's evil because she committed paternity fraud by cheating on her husband and forcing him to pay for another man's kid for 4 years, and then she hides the kid from his actual father.

She has various thoughts as she treated as an object for her family yet no one praise her<lol that's called responsibilities, lol her daughter is obviously mental and at the end, she also becomes one -- probably when her son also leave her<btw her husband doesn't give appreciation to her work, she even thought if she was younger she had the chance for cheating>SO OVERALL STORY--- IT ONLY GLORIFY CHEATING AND ITS COMMON IN ALL STORY THAT THEIR HUSBANDS DON'T GIVE APPRECIATION THEIR WORK, SO IT'S OKAY TO HAVE AFFAIR/CHEATING...IT CAN BE UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE NTR FETISH PEOPLE BUT NOT FOR NORMALPEOPLE""]"
Oda Nobuna no Yabou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11933/Oda_Nobuna_no_Yabou,"['When you look at the cover Oda Nobuna no Yabou, you would immediately think ""oh, its just another cliche harem series"", I wouldn\'t blame you if you did as it does look like one and I myself thought of it as one, but when you actually watch it you realize that there is simply more to it than that, its definitely not a tasteless cliche and although it has many female characters, it doesn\'t present itself as a stereotypical harem where they are all attracted to the male lead.I won\'t bother with the introductions because I know you are smart enough to have read the...synopsis first, so I won\'t repeat anything you already know. Instead I will get straight onto the review.Story: 8.5/10The thing that most other cliche harem/romance animes out there fail at is the story, they continuously throw in unneeded fanservice and ecchi scenes to please the viewers instead of telling the story. However, unlike them ONnY cuts the ecchi short and focuses more on giving the viewers a good story and plot, which is commendable. However although i say this, they put in all the fanservice in the ending credits lolz XD but its much better than putting it in the episode itself where it will ruin the storytelling and the serious aspect of the animeSo far the storytelling has been superb and the plot has been interesting, its based on real historical events that happen in the Sengoku Era where Oda Nobuna (female version), the leader of the Oda Clan has an ambition of conquering the whole of Japan, but in order to do so she must take on rival clans and handle internal affairs, the one who helps her on her conquest is Sagara Yoshiharu who is a huge fan of the original Nobunaga Oda, he uses his knowledge from the game he played ""Nobunaga\'s Ambition"" to assist her by telling her what she needs to do and how she must do it. It gets more interesting as the story goes on where you learn more about Nobuna, alliances are made and as other characters are introduced.The only plot hole that I\'ve encountered so far is how Sagara was able to time travel back in time and how all the major samarai\'s turned into girls. However its an anime, so there\'s no point nitpicking on these small points when its purely fiction and doesn\'t really need to be explained.Art: 8.5/10There isn\'t much to say about this, the characters are nicely drawn  and the vibrant colours and costumes suit the characters really well, its based on clothes of the Sengoku period but its been altered and changed slightly to suit the characters wearing them, which is a good point about this anime because it gives off a unique feeling to them. The action scenes and fighting aren\'t too shabby either and are nicely animated.Sound: 8/10The opening theme is fine and suits the anime, the voice acting is also done pretty well, the characters that have a mature voice aren\'t too husky and the characters that have a sweet and childish voice aren\'t too high pitched and loli-like. The voice acting in serious situations are done well and doesn\'t feel forced and the same can be said for the comical situations where there is a bit of comedy.Characters: 8.5/10Yes the characters are a bit clichéd but they don\'t act as if they are in a cliché harem anime, instead of the girls falling for the male lead like they should, they have no respect for him and call him a monkey (""saru"") which is taken from his name *S*agara Yoshih*aru*.The main Heroine Nobuna is a tsundere character but isn\'t an annoying kind of tsundere, more of a cute and pleasant tsundere unlike all the usual clichéd bitchy tsunderes. She can also handle herself just fine, she isn\'t a weak character who relies heavily on the male lead, although Yoshiharu is from the future and knows exactly what Nobuna should do, she makes it pretty clear to him that she doesn\'t want to be told what to do and can make her own decisions. As time goes by you also start to learn more about her character and more about her ambitions.However what surprised me the most was the main male lead Sagara Yoshiharu, his character is pretty unique, he is a weakling but he isn\'t weak-willed, even though he acts like a bit of an idiot he helps out using his knowledge and takes command in battle. Although he is a pervert, he isn\'t overly horny that it ruins his character. He is a sort of pleasant and funny male lead that you can\'t help but like.There really isn\'t much of a harem aspect in the anime where the female characters fall for Yoshiharu one by one, the only romance that is hinted is between him and Nobuna, unlike the usual overly tsundere female and normal male relationship that occurs frequently in anime, this is one of those rare cases where they are both tsunderes, the best example that i could give you that is similar to this is okabe\'s and kurisu\'s (steins gate) love-hate relationship. They both ridicule each other and argue but they actually care for one another but they refuse to admit it.Enjoyment: 9/10Its very entertaining to watch, the story isn\'t boring and actually teaches you about Japanese history, Yoshiharu is hilarious and its interesting to see him in action, its also quite funny when he and Nobuna argue, the comedy doesn\'t ruin the seriousness of the anime and it does well in changing between the comical moments and serious moments.Overall: 9/10I haven\'t finished the anime but the episodes I have watched have been great and its been getting better and better as the episodes go on. So don\'t be discouraged to watch this anime just because it looks like another stereotypical anime because this is a good example of how ""you shouldn\'t judge a book by its cover"". synopsis first, so I won\'t repeat anything you already know.

So don\'t be discouraged to watch this anime just because it looks like another stereotypical anime because this is a good example of how ""you shouldn\'t judge a book by its cover"".', 'As many have already said, at first glance this show appears to be just mostly your standard harem rom-com, however I was quite surprised when it turned out to be more of a reverse-harem, especially since most of the cast consist of females.Story: (7 / 10)While the story itself isn’t really anything amazing, it well managed to keep me interested enough to finish watching the series. Throughout the show we basically deal with the different tasks Oda Nobuna has to do, or rather what tasks she has for the main character, Yoshiharu. It is an “historical” anime, but since I don’t know much at all...about Japanese history, it’s hard for me to judge how accurate this is, really. However, the fact that Yoshiharu needs to take care not to change too much (as he’s from the future and knows what’s “going to happen”) is quite an interesting element to the show, and adds that little extra as he tries to not reveal important bits of information to certain people, or how he takes from his historical knowledge to get out of situations.There are however a few major plot holes around, like how Yoshiharu traveled back in time in the first place.All in all, it won’t leave you breathtaken, but it’s not like you’ll be bored out of your mind by the story, it’s just that I don’t feel like there’s anything that really makes the story stand out.Another major problem is also the fact that there’s never really any real conclusion or anything, and thus this series is in dire need of a second season.Art: (8 / 10)The art is overall pretty good, to be honest. It has nice visuals, pretty fluid animations throughout most of the series, and nice-looking backgrounds. While I wouldn’t say there’s a “unique” sort of style to it (thinking something like KyoAni) I also quite liked the character designs.However, this brings us to the next point; Fanservice. Now, being a show where a majority of the characters are female, all surrounding this teenage boy then there’s obviously bound to be fanservice. Whether it be Oda’s regular outfit, the occasional fantasy or just overall moe loli characters, fanservice is certainly present throughout the series, however it never really felt like it was overdone or anything (the majority of the fanservice probably appear in the ED, actually). Most of the time they managed to make it somewhat funny, actually, and who doesn’t love the occasional loli? (amirite?)Sound: (8 / 10)I quite liked the music in this show. The OP, “Link” by Aimi, is a bit more fast-paced or upbeat, which fits rather well with the series overall. It’s not really a slow show in any aspect, and all of it is certainly not lollygagging, so this song with a more “action-y” feel to it is rather appropriate, in my opinion.  The ED, “Hikari” by Makino Mizuta, is somewhat slower, and feels like it better captures the “innocent” (or rom-com, if you’d like) side of the series.The background music was good, but again, nothing amazingly outstanding (then again, I’m not one to really pay too much attention to the BGM).The voice acting was rather well done, and further added upon the characters, well, characteristics. The voices are fitting for the characters, and some did a pretty great job at bringing out that little extra in their character (the stuttering of the ninja girl, for example).Characters: (7 / 10)Being the “romantic” (there’s not that much romance, to be honest) comedy, and harem (or well, reverse-harem, rather) that it is, there are some things you won’t really get away from in terms of characters. While the characters are well done, they’re never really fleshed out or developed in any way. There are also quite a few “typical” characters present, such as the Tsundere, the cute loli, the badass mysterious dude, etc. Thankfully, as I wouldn’t say this is really a story-driven series, it’s not really hurt by the lack of character development either. However, it is still important to note that this is a thing in the series, and since once again a lot of the characters are female you might see a bit too many “stereotypical” characters.Enjoyment: (8 / 10)I quite liked the show. The story is decent, it was pretty funny, and most of the characters are rather likeable, but it wasn’t really anything more than that. A big problem is ofcourse also the fact that there’s no conclusion at all to the story, and we’ve yet to hear anything about a second season.Conclusion:If you’re a fan of harems (or reverse-harems in this case) or just want a rom-com with a slightly less “typical” story, then this might be for you, however I’d avoid it if you’re in dire need of having closure.Pros:+ Decent, interesting story.+ Pretty funny overall.+ Music was good.+ Great visuals.+ Likeable characters.-----------------------Cons:- “Stereotypical” characters.- No closure to story (needs a second season)- Plot holes- Doesn’t really excel in any category (in my opinion) about Japanese history, it’s hard for me to judge how accurate this is, really.

No, I\'m sorry. Main Male Lead, Sagara Yoshiharu, has been nicknamed by Oda Nobuna \' Monkey \' or  \' Saru \'. This anime is a historical, romantic and comedy with a large change of physical looks from the normal history (Gender swap). Plot twists are quite unpredictable. Main Female Lead, Oda Nobuna, is a blonde. I repeat. A blonde. I was quite surprised considering Oda Nobunaga had black...hair. The story follows the history that we know with slight changes which was made when Monkey (Sagara Yoshiharu) time-traveled there. The story\'s pacing was good. Nothing was rushed. Ending was okay. Although the romance tag was unanswered that much and the girl in the end, it was fine. At least they finished the main part, the Historical tag. Comedy in this anime was as fine as any other anime. Although it didn\'t make me roll on the floor, it was fine. The story was appealing and drew me in.Art 8/10When Sagara Yoshiharu was named \' Monkey \', it was no joke. The illustrators made him look exactly like a Monkey when it was needed. His hair style kind of looked like a Monkey\'s. Emotions drawn by the illustrators were conveyed well to us viewers. You could clearly see what the characters were feeling. The personalities were matched the best for Monkey. The rest of the characters I would say that it was great.Sound 8/10The VA\'s voice was matched to the character until the point that you could say that the voice itself belonged to the character itself. Sound effects of the action scenes, the monkey\'s monkey voice, everything suited it. The opening of the anime was relatively catchy which makes you want to hear it over and over again. Once you get a hold of it, that is.Character 9/10The chemistry between the characters were great! I loved it. The characters were all well developed. They made an emotional attachment between the viewer and them. The physical looks of the new Oda Nobunaga were great. A few characters lost their show time at the next part of the anime. The number of supporting characters? A variety. Not too flat, the number was perfect. The villain\'s background was not clearly shown. Although it was clear that he had an ulterior motive. I loved all of the characters equally. Except for the villain since I was quite stupid and could not exactly comprehend what he was thinking and can barely remember what he said in the last episode. Look on the bright side, no spoilers! Overall, the characters appealed much to me, the viewer.Enjoyment 9/10Oh, come on. There is nothing to doubt about this. I enjoyed it so much I was standing on my toes. The romance, what would happen next? When I thought that something bad was going to happen, it just decided to change for the viewer. Great, awesome anime. Definitely one which can make you hit that button which leads  you to the next episode. I could barely pause watching it.It was more like -""Kiss  already. Quickly, kiss. Faster plox.""  or just talking to the person in the screen. Obviously I know that I would never get a reply. -cries-Overall, this anime was one that could be remembered by its viewers as one of the best types of anime which included the Historical tag.Overall 9/10As I said in the other sections, amazing.

The anime just sucked you in like a whirlpool.', ""This anime was a big surprise for me, first because i saw this was a harem and i don't mind harem but i have seen a lot of them and i thought this was going to be like the other ones and i was really wrong in a way, second was because i didn't thought they were going to focus on the story and just in the girls but they made a decent job focusing on both.StoryWell, the story was good, it follows a 17-year-old high schooler Sagara Yoshiharu who one day time-travels to the Sengoku period and that is the why i didn't gave...this a better score because you don't really get to know how he time-traveled to the Sengoku period not even through any episode, the reason was unknown but other than that it was great, the fact that he knew how to change the history and helped Nobuna to achieved a way to make her follow the good way and changing what he knew to an unknown result in the future was entertaining and you didn't know what was coming if everything changed and the fact that she wasn't corrupted (like the real Nobunaga was) was because she found someone that she loved and that one was Yoshiharu, the other thing i didn't like was that there wasn't enough romance, i was like ''kiss her'' or ''kiss him already'' don't expect deep romance but overall was very good.Art & AnimationThe animation was great even in the battles they look really well done and the art of the landscape and the cities were just great, and the character design was really good, overall great.SoundSound was great with the voice acting, i can't picture them with other voices that could fit them that great, the music background was very good and the OP was really enjoyable i never skipped it, overall was great.CharacterThis was outstanding, i just loved every single character and not to mention Saru was really amazing, he is a real MC, he is not a wuss even tho he doesn't fight but he was really good in sports so he can avoid things and he was smart too and was never afraid of anything just to make Nobuna happy and the greatest part is that he has a Harem of lolis lol, that was hilarious when every episode a new loli was added to his harem when in reality he wanted girls of his same age was funny but they're really adorable specially Hanbee with that sweet voice, he has like five lolis and two of his age being Nobuna and other one that i won't spoil you, Sagara became one of my favorite characters, and the other ones are outstanding, they were really well developed, there're a lot of characters that were really great in this anime, so this was the outstanding part of the anime.EnjoymentYou won't regret watching this anime, this has almost everything, good humor, amazing characters, great art and sound, very good story, adorable and funny lolis, historical events, this needed more romance or a kiss to be even better but you will like a lot Oda Nobuna no Yabou. this a better score because you don't really get to know how he time-traveled to the Sengoku period not even through any episode, the reason was unknown but other than that it was great, the fact that he knew how to change the history and helped Nobuna to achieved

events, this needed more romance or a kiss to be even better but you will like a lot Oda Nobuna no Yabou."", 'Just  a little note before I start, this is my first review and I was compelled to write this because I truly enjoyed this anime.So, Oda Nobuna no Yabou, first glance, you\'d think ""Oh usual guy meets girl after girl until a harem is made"", well sorry to burst your bubble, but there\'s more to this anime than it looks.Story: 8/10Okay, so maybe some people don\'t enjoy this, but personally I like the concept. Time travelling guys arrives at an alternate past where all the ""Leaders"" are girls, could have been better, but it\'s not overused. Usual progression for the story, girl meets...guy, they fall in ""love"" and it builds up from there, and I mean both their feelings and his harem.In Short: Not going to win any massive awards for the story, but definitely deserves an 8 for it\'s creativity.Art: 9/10Compared to other animes, I\'d say the artwork in Oda Nobuna is pretty GOOD, not as good as something like Hagure Yuusha no Estetica (Personal Preference, replace with some other title) but it\'s definitely nice to look at.In Short: Not the best, but still amazingSound: 10/10The opening of Oda Nobuna is worth listening to, and that\'s coming from a person who skips most intros after hearing it once, it really fits the anime. Now, the sound effects etc. as you\'d expect from an anime with sword fighting and the like is pretty good. I think you\'d be able to immerse yourself in the sounds of the ongoing battle while listening to a few mc\'s chatting pretty well.In Short: Amazing sound effects, great voice actors and a good intro, deserving of a 10Character: 9/10Some of you may argue, but I felt that the way the characters acted and are portrayed fits the time line of the show. They\'re proper ""ladies"", they get embarrassed when they\'re supposed to, trust each other more after some experience, and doubt each other when it\'s proper to do so. I\'d rather not go into detail of the characters themselves, so I\'ll say this: The wide array of characters provides various choices favor.

I loved the concept, the characters and the harem development (compared to other harems), I enjoyed watching the battles and how each character played an integral part in their victory.In Short: WATCH THE SHOW DAMMITOverall: 9/10Worth the watch, worth the time, I won\'t ignore the fact that some people might not like this anime, but if you\'re fine with a few not-so-funny jokes, or getting angry at how disgusting a person looks (it was obviously on purpose) then get your ass off that chair and give Oda Nobuna no Yabou a try! guy, they fall in ""love"" and it builds up from there, and I mean both their feelings and his harem.In Short: Not going to win any massive awards for the story, but definitely deserves an 8 for it\'s creativity.Art: 9/10Compared to other animes, I\'d say the artwork in Oda Nobuna is pretty GOOD, not as good as something like Hagure Yuusha no Estetica (Personal Preference, replace with some other title) but it\'s definitely nice to look at.In Short: Not the best, but still amazingSound: 10/10The opening of Oda Nobuna is worth listening to, and that\'s coming from a person who skips most intros after hearing it once, it really fits the anime. Now, the sound effects etc. as you\'d expect from an anime with sword fighting and the like is pretty good.

Let me just get one thing out of the way:  This is NOT one of them (at least imo.)The historical setting does little to mask the flaws of this anime.STORY 6/10-This isn't a strong point of the series, as many would claim.- Linear and boring plot- Uninteresting developments. Battles are vague and don't make sense. How on Earth is Nobuna a Samurai Lord?!ART 8/10- Character designs are very good....- Scenery and backgrounds are nice to look at.SOUND 7/10- Fairly nice OP and ED that set the tone well for the series.- Voice acting is very good and suits the characters very well.CHARACTER 6/10-I suppose that this series gets praise because all the girls don't lust after the male lead as one might expect looking at this title. Nor is he some generic, pervy loser.-The main female lead is a tsundere, but surprisingly this doesn't result in her being a generic one dimensional character. She is portrayed as (for the most part) a strong female character, much like the other girls in the series.-The development of the characters was lacking and once a couple of episodes go by, they quickly became uninteresting.ENJOYMENT 6/10Character development and plot was unsatisfactory.The humor which is one of the primary reasons people may watch this is this is also boring. Despite what I said earlier, I think it would have been better if Yoshiharu (the male lead) was a complete pervbecause there really was no other source of enjoyment.Fans of the harem genre will enjoy this. Those of you who don't usually watch this genre of anime and come into this expecting a good series will probably be left disappointed past the first few episodes. - Scenery and backgrounds are nice to look at.SOUND 7/10- Fairly nice OP and ED that set the tone well for the series.- Voice acting is very good and suits the characters very well.CHARACTER 6/10-I suppose that this series gets praise because all the girls don't lust after the male lead as one might expect looking at this title.

Standard time shift backwards but the twist is when you meet all the greatest male figures in Japanese history, they are girls. The whole concept seems somewhat cheesy but they actually do this well.They keep the strong character types while somehow making them a little cute. Character designs a i found interesting, when i look at Nobunas standard clothing it just seems so unique for anime. The colors of Gold/Black as always compliment each...other but they gave her such a unique clothing choice that i think was just very imaginative.It may be based off of a standard historical style but it looks unique how they have altered it just a bit.Anyway the art and sound i give a solid 7, art is fairly standard but the sound effects and voice acting is tops. I think they did a fairly great job casting voice actors for this show. Some stronger than others while others being slightly more sweet and childish giving the show a nice balance.The thing i loved most about this show is that they actually use the fact the main character knows whats going to happen in history effectively. I mean they don't leave that big open plot hole in this show. A lot of similar story lines complete neglect facts like they should know or even could know. This show really embraces the whole reality of the situation and uses it effectively as a story mechanic.I really enjoy watching this show, its exciting and it actually teaches you a bit about Japanese historical moments and people. I also like how the beginning they skip the cliched 2 part introduction to the gimmick. They just drop you right into the middle of the action without really feeding you 10 minutes of pre time travel setting/dialogue.I think anyone who gives this a good 2 episode watch is gonna watch more, its funny and the plot is solid.

This is that this show can be a beautiful and interesting/different presentation with exciting fan service (No, not just tits and panty shots) of the Sengoku world to another typical harem/hijinks show. The first will probably be the opinion of people who have studied the Warring States period of Japan, played related video games of them such as Nobunaga's Ambition and Samurai Warriors, and is generally a fan of the numerous Sengoku shows out there. The latter will of course be someone who has no knowledge in this area. While...I try to be objective in a sense, I can't help but come reviewing this show as the former simply because it was created for these type of people and does it extremely well. I am of course in no way putting myself as superior to anyone; I simply want people to understand the show may one viewer squeal in delight while another passes up any enjoyment because of circumstances. It's a show like Carnival Phantasm and Type-Moon in this way.To begin with, the show presents a number of fan service that can only be appreciated by the Sengoku, Three Kingdom fans. From the events of Nobunaga's meeting with Saito Dousan and rifle lighting, to the glorious Okehazama, and to the Zhuge Liang reference of Hanbei, the show throws a number of fan service and interesting references that may go unappreciated by a viewer that has no knowledge of these events and history.The plot progresses from the beginning of Nobuna (Nobunaga) as the fool of Owari and her gradual rise to power with the help of someone from the future who has distinct knowledge of the era. Because it mainly goes through her campaigns, it should be noted once again that enjoyment and interest stems from knowledge of some of these campaigns and to see how they will turn out. Yes, while the story tries to stay true to the main events of history, there are enough little events and subversions that allow the viewer feel anxious on what will happen next. An obvious flaw is the blatant ignoring of how the main character ended up in the Sengoku era. This however helps to alleviate the usually sidetracking of the main story in typical time travel/other dimension travel stories where excess time is spent on trying to get back home. It is somewhat refreshing to see this ignored for a change and see the focus on what is at hand.In terms of art, people who watched Highschool DxD may recognize Miyama-Zero and his distinct drawing style. It probably goes without saying that the art is wonderfully done if you take a few minutes to watch the show or see Zero's artwork. The production values are high up there, not ufotable status of course but you can definitely see the effort the animators have put in this show.As an Aimi (Ben-to OP) fan, I instantly fell in love with the opening song to the show. She is one of the more underrated stars out there and I definitely urge people to try and check some of her songs out. But to not digress, the soundtrack of Oda Nobuna is superb as well. It does a fine job of setting the mood and evoking the feelings from the situation at hand. From the wacky song that plays throughout the comedy scenes, to the touching melodies during the drama, and to the war-like drum fashion when the troops are preparing to go to war, each song plays a suitable role.However, the greatest compliment I have to give to Oda Nobuna no Yabou is it's characters. The typical thought of someone who first sees this show is the thought that the main character is your generic harem man and the characters are but breasts to fill on TV for the ogling otaku. This is not so.The main character, Sagara Yoshiharu is a refreshing character. He is someone that actually uses his knowledge of the era to the benefit, actively participates in every episode instead of sitting around behind his harem of women, even to the point that he is the reason for Nobuna's success, and is overall competent except for a few comedic moments.The rest of the cast is mature and you can see the many qualities they have underneath their exterior. Nobuna herself goes through a series of touching and good character development. She, like many of the characters of this show, are subverted in such creative and unique ways that I must bow in respect to the author. It really really helps if you know the typical media representation of these historical figures and want to see something different and twisted in many different ways. They are not just your typical gender-bent shameless body flaunting character, though there is quite a number of skin-ship.If you are a Sengoku fan, have played KOEI games, and love history in general, then I 100% recommend this show. If otherwise, I still ask for someone to try it out; if not to start learning about the Sengoku period, then for some delicious females, the hilarity, and romance.

Of course the main character would need a lead to be able to be the chosen one and the helpful monkey which is from the future helps nobuna conquer japan.Story-9/10Not exactly original. You gain allies and keep on conquering and make mistakes. The only twists are the fact that there is a ""monkey"" trying to win women ( his harem of friends haha), the fact that all the key historic figures and cute little girls and...the fact that Sagara, our monkey, knows the future and the past but not with all the new twists.Art-9/10It\'s absolutely stellar. Except for the people who are meant to be disgusting but other than them I love nearly every character design and the surroundings. It is what 2012 art should be like.Sound-9/10The opening song really fits with the type of genre this is ( conquer japan) and I love the ending song.Character-9/10There are not many ""steriotypical"" characters. Everyone is quite fun and a bit different and all have their own reasons for fighting. the characters with notable personalities would be Sagara (monkey) who is fun and trying to get the most beautiful women in Japan and help Oda Nobuna conquer Japan. There is also Nobuna who has to prevent herself from being overcome by crazyness, anger or greed like many other rulers.Enjoyment-10I loved every single episode.

I wouldn\'t exactly say this is great for rewatchability but its a fun filled ride as long as you don\'t know the rythm.Overall-9A great story. Fun, exciting and a great story. It\'s basically a codegeass but without a badass main and the make you think aspect. You should watch it or at least give it a try. Some reasons I\'ve heard that made the story awful would be ""it\'s a harem"" or ""it looks like it has no plot"". Yes, it is a harem. However there is one girl that stands out and the rest are basically just friends so there is progress. And I assure you, the plot is quite nice for it\'s genre.

I was wrong.Story: 9/10A story based on Japanese History, which actually entertained me and educated me a bit, mainly because I have Japanese classes. It wasn't boring, it didn't drag out that much and if it did, it would be fan-service/some comedy skit added into that. If I were to give a score on originality about the type of story being used in the anime, I'd give it a 9 but if I based it...on how much it entertained me, I'd give it a solid 4 but the only thing that saved it was they made it different by putting the protagonist to be someone from the future, having the 'ability' (not sure if I could call it an ability) to see the future. The type of male protagonist that come from the future/different worlds and want to save the current world always make the anime better, personally. It had a lot of action, mainly sword fighting and a little bit of magic I suppose. There's harem and romance, but the harem slowly develops throughout the anime, which doesn't bother me but as a guy who has watched a lot of harem/romance anime, it was very predictable on who's going to fall in love with the protagonist. It was somewhat funny, mainly using perverted jokes which are alright, but if overused and repetitive, can get really annoying.Art: 8/10I don't know if it's just me, but the art style gave a history-ish vibe. Other than that, the colors and nice and bright, animations are smooth and is very easy to catch the eye.Sound: 7/10The OST fit scenes nicely and used necessary, not overused and isn't too loud. The OP fit the theme of the anime, giving that 'army' vibe (I'm probably stoned) and the ED fits the romance side of the anime.Character: 9/10Sagara Yoshiharu, the protagonist who comes from the future (circa 400 years). He's very obsessed with history games, mainly with the Shogunate eras and all those. He's very talented, in his own ways because he remembers a whole period of time from the past and uses it to his knowledge to try to save characters from dying. A very kind but perverted person.Oda Nobuna, a very cheerful girl who dresses very minimal. She's a tsundere (not a flat one!!) and cares a lot for the people she loves. She's not that smart, mainly because she is easy to trap. Without Sagara her nation would've died. Kind-hearted and caring (mostly to Sagara ;))Enjoyment: 10/10It was a new experience for me, as not only did it entertain me, but it actually educated me. Yes there's fan-service and a lot of 'loli' characters, but hey the action was quite nice.Overall: 9/10If there's a second season out there, I'd watch it. I really liked the idea of this anime. If you like protagonist who comes from a different world/future and wants to save the current world he is in, then Zero no Tsukaima is for you. If you like history but not very educational, then Hyakka Ryouran might suit you. Would I re-watch this?

From what I've concluded after watching the first episode, him being there causes the death of a key person of in japanese history, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a key retainer of Oda Nobunaga.It's up to Sagara (main character) to take his place and assist Nobunaga or rather Nobuna and take Hideyoshi's place.I love history and this show seems like a good way to learn about the unification of Japan. It gives off sort of a Axis Powers Hetalia feel to...it where the show teaches a bit of history to the viewer.I find it amusing how the producers turn famous deadly warriors into girls. When i saw Goemon's character in this show, i couldn't take this show seriously anymore. Then again i can't say that i don't like the idea of them turning them all into girls. I mean seriously? Who doesn't like watching anime girls with swords and spears, etc beating the crap out of faceless unimportant characters.I laughed a couple of times during this show. For instance, the girls don't even address him by his name. Instead, they call him Saru (Monkey). For the oddest of reasons i felt that this show had the same sort of comedy feel as Highschool Dxd for all of you who have seen it. Not the ecchi comedy part.As for it being a harem show, its not one of those dirty ecchi shows. i'd have to say it's probably a 2 or 3 on a scale of 10 on ecchiness. There are a lot of loli's though...i already counted like 4. The main character's a typical harem character. He's sort of a loser but in his own strange way he's very powerful. Like in almost any anime, you will find anime stereotypes in this show.Personally i hope this show goes where i think it's going. All the girls in the show seem to disrespect him and think he's disgusting but i can see him turning that all around. Sort of like in Love Hina.

What happens if?The anime has done great about Artwork, characters are drawn very well, unlike some other drawings that make you go sick.Also the OST are very well made from...the opening song all the way through the episodes until the end with some minor letdowns.You should watch Oda Nobuna no yabou if you enjoy a good soap opera the opening song all the way through the episodes until the end with some minor letdowns.You should watch Oda Nobuna no yabou if you enjoy a good soap opera"", ""I like the anime when it has good plot, OSTs and Art.Oda Nobuna is just Amazing in all of them .. the OSTs are Amazing and Epic and fits the Anime very well .. The Art is so awesome.. the plot is the best since there's no unnecessary  talking.. Less talking More Action !! that how the anime should be.. I won't say any word other than this // IF YOU LIKE EPICNESS ODA NOBUNA IS THE BEST !! //the only thing i disliked and i HATE about this anime is.. IT'S JUST 12 EPISODES !! THIS MUST LAST FOR EVER !! TToTT "", '""So much loli girls in this anime!"" thats my first impression when watching this, ok, lets forget it.""What will you do if heroes that you know is different from what are you thinking and studying?"" Like Oda Nobunaga is a blonde girl?WHAT? ok, since its anime i think thats fine.First of all, some event that occur in this anime is based the REAL history of oda nobuna (except the gender of course), well, Oda Nobuna replicates many Oda Nobunaga event, or we can said its same as the three kingdoms was replicate by Dynasty warrior. You will enjoy the anime and studying about japanese history,...interesting isn\'t it?STORY 9/10The story involves about Sagaru,  a highschool guy which is unknownly stranded into the era of Oda Nobunaga where ALL the major samurai was a cute girls. and he promises to Oda Nobuna (Not Nobunaga) that he will helps her to achieve her dream to unite japan. as far as go, the story really interest me, since its rare to see some harem anime (well, i always thought this anime is a harem), which have a strong plot and nice development between the two main lead. and love that happen (harem typical) wasn\'t exaggerating , they (the girls) didnt express their feelings in any weird way, and later, the twist in nearly the end of the series was really suprising me. ""i never really thought that"" thats what i said.ART 8/10I cant said too much on this section, for me as the story was good, i dont really mind about the art. well, for this anime , i thought the art was really nice, especially when the battle and war scenes, it looks realistic.  i really enjoyed it. and for the character, i think they are really well-made, and again not exaggrating in ""Boobs"" section like any other harem anime. thats a good point!SOUND 8/10Again, i cant said too much on this, but surely the opening song was nice (really nice, even i searching for this song) and really fits with the story and the anime itself, it represent on what will hapen. and the voice actor really did a good job, especially loli girls voice. the voice was so childish and it really fits with the loli character. Not just the loli voice, but the other character voice wasn\'t really bad too.CHARACTER 7/10i think this was the weakness for this anime, so many questions in my head about this, like how can that highschool boy can do time travels? is he a john titor? and since the story was focussing on the conquest of Oda Nobuna, i think thats acceptable if the each character didnt get any own story. and more, its just 12 episode. its too hard to expand and explaining for each character. and i think there will be a season 2 for this, and hope they will fill ""the holes"" in the season 1.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL 8/10I am really glad i found this anime, i am not just enjoying this anime but in the same time, its feeling like studying japanese history. i am not japanese, but with this anime, i think i am interest in Oda Nobunaga era like i interest in three kingdoms. A totally great anime to watch! interesting isn\'t it?STORY 9/10The story involves about Sagaru,  a highschool guy which is unknownly stranded into the era of Oda Nobunaga where ALL the major samurai was a cute girls. and he promises to Oda Nobuna (Not Nobunaga) that he will helps her to achieve her dream to unite japan. as far as go, the story really interest me, since its rare to see some harem anime (well, i always thought this anime is a harem), which have a strong plot and nice development between the two main lead. and love that happen (harem typical) wasn\'t exaggerating , they (the girls) didnt express their feelings in any weird way, and later, the twist in nearly the end of the series was really suprising me.

Just like always let me know how you like my review and let me know how i can improve :)', 'The anime is about Sagara Yoshiharu, who travels back into the Sengoku era where feudal lords fight among each other to expand their territory and to inch their way into conquering Japan. The anime opens with our main, Sagara, trapped in a battle field. He meets the leader of the Oda clan, Oda Nobunaga. No, wait. He is shocked to discover that the man who unified Japan is actually a young tsundere blonde. She’s not Oda Nobunaga; she is Oda Nobuna. Sagara then decides to serve under Oda Nobuna and using his knowledge of playing video games about his conquest, he has proved to be...a valuable weapon for Oda. He helps her correct wrongs that happened in history and to predict the events to give Oda the advantage. He also vowed to make sure she’s alive after she conquered Japan. It’s not an easy task when the rest of the feudal lords are out to make sure she doesn’t succeed.This anime has been the biggest surprise of the season so far because I didn’t even knew this anime existed until a couple of days ago. I certainly didn’t expect it to be so damn good. I saw the title and I sighed a bit because I expect another anime like Brave Ten that uses the feudal era as a setting and basically doing something subpar with it. The anime has all the elements to fail miserably yet it turns out to be very amazing. I always believe that cliché isn’t a bad thing and it all depends on how you use it. This anime has a harem with all the generic fixings but it was able to properly use the elements to make one remarkable story. Also, it’s a light novel anime. I love anime adapted from light novels because they have more emphasis on story than any other medium. Oda Nobuna no Yabou is one of the best anime of the season.The anime proves to be a bit ridiculous when you see the first episode. I actually find it hard to believe that they made a show where Oda Nobunaga is a tsundere. It boggles the mind and I was sure this premise wouldn’t last. They might replace it with pointless fan service or build a harem or something. All the elements are there for the anime to drop the premise. We have a bunch of girls and one guy, the generic casts of a harem is here: the tsundere, the big breasted one, the silent one and the loud one. They just needed to align themselves and I was preparing for the worst. It didn’t happen though. The anime didn’t disintegrate into a senseless Ecchi or Harem anime. I was relieved to know that. It couldn’t become a pointless Ecchi show mainly because the anime has a pretty impressive story to tell.The biggest hurdle in this anime is accepting the fact that the heroes of Japan are replaced with girls. Oda Nobuna is a freakin tsundere. If you can follow that fact then you can enjoy the anime. It started pretty interesting actually. The first episode started with a battle and the plot was laid out pretty nicely afterwards. The idea of having a guy from the future telling Oda of all the things she did wrong is pretty sweet. It’s like going to the movies with a guy who already seen it. He spoils the story and Oda is able to capitalize from it. The rewriting of history and the characters turning into cute girls is among the charm of the anime. The plot of the anime is very serious despite the ridiculous elements of the anime and it’s the reason why the anime was able to straighten out right away. The first half has some very powerful episodes that will easily grab you.The anime is about a part of history of Japan though but it never got in the way. I recognize most of the characters because I played a lot of Orochi games on the PS2 and that’s as far as I know regarding the Sengoku era. The anime often has time to have a narrator introduce the characters so they can easily slide themselves into the story. After the introduction, the anime proceeds in building the story. There are a lot of dialogues in the anime but it was used to establish certain situations in the anime. The anime is like watching a game of chess and you eagerly wait for the moment where a player shows the trick up his sleeve. There are a lot of moments in the anime that is really impressive. One example is declaring that building a fort in the field would prove impossible because it’s near a feudal lord’s territory and he will do his best to make sure the fort won’t be built. The anime uses certain situations like this and have Sagara or Oda have their moment of brilliance and attempt the impossible. Once you get used to the pattern, it’s not long before you wait for the next big hurdle to come and the moment of brilliance the characters will do to overcome the problem.The characters are certainly the strongest point of the anime. They are a bit generic but they have the perfect personality to make the story interesting. The cute little girls being involved in feudal wars are really interesting because the anime did a great job presenting it. Of course, the idea of a stuttering ninja who looks about 9 years old is a bit of hard pill to swallow but when the story moves along its climactic moment, all the characters  was able to bring their own charm to the scene. There are a lot of characters and none of them look alike. They all have a certain role to the story with their unique personality. There is no shortage of interesting characters here from both the good guys and the bad guys. They certainly make the story a lot more interesting.Oda Nobuna is pretty rounded herself. She is considered as a military genius capable of doing the impossible but most of the time she is just a little brat. I really love how most of the times, she is the problem and her weak hearted nature adds some needed tension in the anime. It does wear off pretty quickly because the anime relies far too much on her weak personality but it deepens the story and makes it more exciting. One moment she is this girl with a nasty personality trying to rule the country then the next moment she is a docile little kitten that needs the other characters to comfort her out.As for Sagara, well, he’s a pretty normal guy. He is the generic type of main character that just flows along with the story. If the scene calls for him to be an idiot then he becomes an idiot. If the scene needs him to be hero then he’ll rise to the occasion. If the story needs him to be “cool guy” the girls will fall in love with then he becomes that guy. I guess it’s a good thing that he’s a flexible main character but he doesn’t have enough personality to stand on his own. It’s not a bad thing though because other supporting characters get some screen time thanks to his lack of a decent personality.There are some hints of fan service in the anime but it was never a main focus. The story did point out that Sagara is a pervert but there aren’t any panty shots and there was only one moment of boob grabbing. It’s pretty alright because some of the characters are a bit under aged and it’d be pretty awful to sit through another Ro Kyu Bu type of anime (which gets another season and some more pedo fan service). There is also a slight hint of romance to tie the entire anime together. Sagara and Oda’s relationship is one of driving plot points of the anime and it’s often of the elements that cause a lot of tension in the anime. One moment they’re buddy buddy then when push comes to shove, they’re fighting.The anime does have some downsides to it. The biggest hurdle is accepting the cute characters as competent warriors battling adult sized soldiers and what not. The story easily covers that up. The anime never explained Sagara going back to the past though and it does bug me at first. He just suddenly showed up and no mention of black holes or time machines to explain his time travel. The anime obviously didn’t want you to question it because the plot was pretty good that it didn’t matter how he got there. The one complaint I have about the anime though is that the anime slowly pushed Sagara into the background. In the first half, he was very pivotal in the fights because of his knowledge about playing video games. As the anime progresses, this knowledge was no longer used and some of the moments of the second half would’ve been more awesome if the anime had Sagara spoil the fights. It’s a minor complain though and the anime didn’t crumble from the lack of Sagara’s knowledge.The pacing in the second half did become a bit fast and certain events had little effect to me because the anime rushed in getting there. There was no climactic build up in the second half and it was a shame that they couldn’t make the final moments of the anime more awesome. It ended pretty anticlimactically and it’s a shame. It did tease a second season and I seriously want another run at this awesome anime.In terms of character, the anime did a heck of a good job at it. There is a huge range of character design here from the cute kin of character up to the grown up old type adult character. One thing I love about this anime is that no character looks alike. They are all extremely detailed using the attire of the era to their advantage and putting a spin on it. There is a stuttering ninja with a pink skull hairclip, a little girl with a spear and a tiger hood and even a girl with a cute dragon emblem on her head. The characters are the best part of the anime and it’s their diverse look that makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.The animation is also one of the anime’s best parts. The fight scenes are a bit too short but they still have an air of awesomeness to them that makes them fun to watch. The use of CG in some scenes is nicely done because it doesn’t look stiff. The way the camera changes angles is also one of the reasons why the fight scenes are some awesome.The fight scenes are pretty straight forward and there isn’t a lot of technicality in them. The anime uses it as a way to move the story along and it’s often not the climax of the anime. It often leads to the climax but the battles where never once the main attention of the anime. The moment of brilliance among the characters is like building a fort overnight. That being said though, the fight scenes are still pretty nice. The capture the feel of a real war and there are enough effects to give us the impression of a massive battle. There is no blood though. I would’ve preferred at least some blood out of slashed necks but the anime often cut away before any blood would gush out or they would be off screen. Let’s focus on the moe characters instead.The anime’s OP is “Link” by Aimi. This really captures the anime’s theme and it nicely reflects the relationship of the two main characters. The anime’s opening sequence is pretty awesome as well. It introduced all the characters without spoiling the story and overwhelming the viewers. I also love the scene of the horses meeting each other for a battle. You can clearly see the awesomeness of the anime and the high production value of the anime.The ED song is “Hikari” by Makino Mizuta. It’s a slow song with a romantic theme to it. It has a meloow vibe to it compared to the rough nature of the anime. The ED sequence is has a bigger fan service than the overall series with all the girls naked and draped with a sheet. It’s pretty nice, I guess.This is a really good anime and it’s too good to miss. The plot, the characters and the action all makes for one awesome anime experience. Try to enjoy the moe girls fighting in the Sengoku era because the anime is really great. I highly recommend it. a valuable weapon for Oda.

I highly recommend it.', ""Oda Nobuna no Yabou appears like a fairly simplistic reverse gender harem/romance and comedy set in the Sengoku Era  at first glance, but there's actually more to the plot than meets the eye...The story revolves around a 17 years old young man named Sagara Yoshiharu, who is sent to an alternate version of the Sengoku Era without currently providing any explanation of how he achieved such a feat.However, not is all as it seems...Sagara quickly realizes that the fearsome Oda Nobunaga has been replaced by a girl named Oda Nobuna in this continuity and that other historical figures such as Shibata Katsuie and...Niwa Nagahide have also undergone an inexplicable shift in gender.On top of these historical inconsistencies, he is mistreated and/or not taken seriously within the Oda clan and has to earn the trust and respect of his own companions and the fiery Nobuna and maybe find love...Note: All following statements explaining my scores are but mere opinion. Also, I have only watched two episodes as of now so my opinion on the series may change along the way.Story: 8/10I think the main appeal of the story is the potential it holds when it comes to changing historical facts as current episodes show Sagara actively trying to alter the course of history as he knows it so that Nobuna doesn't become like Nobunaga and leaves one to wonder what will happen to the roles of Toyotomi Hideyoshi  and Tokugawa Iyeasu if she remains alive unlike her historical counterpart or just how far will Sagara's knowledge of the future will get him before he gets a prediction wrong.Another good aspect of the story is how the comedy aspect of the show does not overlap on the serious aspect of the story like say...Nyarko-san where there was virtually no boundary between the two.Art: 8/10As expected from Madhouse Studios, the art is just fine, the ecchiness is mild and not too overbearing. There isn't anything wrong with the animation in general at first glance though I did not make a thorough investigation (as in frame by frame) like I usually do.The only complaint I would have is against the ending sequence, did they really have to put so much ecchi shots cause it's literally made of them!Sound: 8/10The sound and voices are fine as well, the background music and sound effects reflects the mood of the scenes and aren't squeaky or unbearable and the voices are pretty good as well.Character: 8/10Every character is well fleshed out and don't feel like you're talking to a random background character. Here's a short list:Sagara: A harem hero who has 'balls', that's all you need to know.Nobuna: The Tsundere who is quite reckless and her inability to say what she wants honestly is a flaw can make her as dangerous as Nobunaga himself if no one is there to voice their opposition.Katsuie: The big chested girl who is serious most of the time and gets embarrassed quite easily, follows the 'knight' archetype.Niwa: The 'ojou' type-2 (TvTropes) girl who acts cool and mature and likes to rate people and their actions.Goemon: The loli girl who has difficulty speaking coherently as her speech drags on and is actually pretty skilled as a ninja, which may hint to having been trained so hard she didn't get a proper education.(There are obviously more, I'm just naming the 'main' ones)Overall: 8/10Over all, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is a really unique 'harem'/comedy anime that has a hidden flavor for any Japanese history maniacs if on is willing to look past all the 'anime' aspect of the show and can be very enjoyable. Niwa Nagahide have also undergone an inexplicable shift in gender.On top of these historical inconsistencies, he is mistreated and/or not taken seriously within the Oda clan and has to earn the trust and respect of his own companions and the fiery Nobuna and maybe find love...Note: All following statements explaining my scores are but mere opinion. Also, I have only watched two episodes as of now so my opinion on the series may change along the way.Story: 8/10I think the main appeal of the story is the potential it holds when it comes to changing historical facts as current episodes show Sagara actively trying to alter the course of history as he knows it so that Nobuna doesn't become like Nobunaga and leaves one to wonder what will happen to the roles of Toyotomi Hideyoshi  and Tokugawa Iyeasu if she remains alive unlike her historical counterpart or just how far will Sagara's knowledge of the future will get him before he gets a prediction wrong.Another good aspect of the story is how the comedy aspect of the show does not overlap on the serious aspect of the story like say...Nyarko-san where there was virtually no boundary between the two.Art: 8/10As expected from Madhouse Studios, the art is just fine, the ecchiness is mild and not too overbearing. There isn't anything wrong with the animation in general at first glance though I did not make a thorough investigation (as in frame by frame) like I usually do.The only complaint I would have is against the ending sequence, did they really have to put so much ecchi shots cause it's literally made of them!Sound: 8/10The sound and voices are fine as well, the background music and sound effects reflects the mood of the scenes and aren't squeaky or unbearable and the voices are pretty good as well.Character: 8/10Every character is well fleshed out and don't feel like you're talking to a random background character. Here's a short list:Sagara: A harem hero who has 'balls', that's all you need to know.Nobuna: The Tsundere who is quite reckless and her inability to say what she wants honestly is a flaw can make her as dangerous as Nobunaga himself if no one is there to voice their opposition.Katsuie: The big chested girl who is serious most of the time and gets embarrassed quite easily, follows the 'knight' archetype.Niwa: The 'ojou' type-2 (TvTropes) girl who acts cool and mature and likes to rate people and their actions.Goemon: The loli girl who has difficulty speaking coherently as her speech drags on and is actually pretty skilled as a ninja, which may hint to having been trained so hard she didn't get a proper education.(There are obviously more, I'm just naming the 'main' ones)Overall: 8/10Over all, Oda Nobuna no Yabou is a really unique 'harem'/comedy anime that has a hidden flavor for any Japanese history maniacs if on is willing to look past all the 'anime' aspect of the show and can be very enjoyable."", 'The life story of Oda Nobunaga is definitely one for the history books, and has been used as source material for countless works of literature for centuries, some of which are historically accurate and some of which are not. Oda Nobuna no Yabou would fall into the latter category, but actually not as far into it as first impressions might lead you to believe.The premise of having a high-school kid *somehow* travel back in time to the Sengoku era as a replacement for Toyotomi Hideyoshi (a.k.a. Kinoshita Tōkichirō) and then having all the famous Samurai lords be cute girls instead makes it seem like nothing...more than yet another silly romantic comedy in an original setting. However, if you’re looking for some sort of stereotypical funny ecchi harem you’re not going to find it here, rather this anime sincerely surprised me with how little fan service it had, and bar the initial premise it turned out to be an extremely good series, even from a purely objective standpoint.Now obviously there is a fair amount of comedy and non-serious elements in it as well, but that is essentially only due to the twist made with the main characters identities; other than that it follows the actual story of Oda Nobunaga (in this case Nobuna as it’s a pretty blonde girl instead) and his… uhh her* dream of unifying Japan into a peaceful country, which of course is not something that can be done without military conquest.I should probably also mention that while it is by no means completely necessary, I would highly recommend that you know at least a little bit about the story of the actual historical events of the Sengoku period if you are going to watch this series, as that is in the end what the entire anime is based on, and all the characters, clans, famous battles and events are essentially all ones that existed/happened in reality. You will be able to relate to the characters especially a lot more if you’re at least somewhat familiar with their actual historical counterparts, and there are a LOT of names to keep track of if you’re completely in the dark heading into this. Also even though there are a few short seconds every once in a while showing a map of who and what is where, it would still be very helpful to be familiar with at least the locations of the various major houses, as well as the names of their respective countries and lords.All that being said though, that doesn’t mean you will literally know everything that’s going to happen in the anime in case you are very familiar with the actual story, because our resident protagonist and time traveler also happens to be an expert on the Sengoku era, and due to being able to foresee almost every event since he already knows what is going to happen (because of coming from the future from the others’ perspective), not everything goes exactly as history would tell it since his words and knowledge slowly change events compared to the ‘past’ he knew from his own time. Thus, despite being based on a real story (albeit with some obvious twists in the premise itself), it still manages to be quite unpredictable every so often.Personally I happened to marathon this series literally the same day that I had earlier finished reading Sengoku Rance which probably increased the enjoyment value quite a lot as well, but that is definitely not a stunt I think anyone is obliged to replicate (although if you feel like it and have the time, be my guest).Overall this isn’t an anime you should watch if you want a heavily action-filled samurai story, nor should you watch it if you’re looking solely for laughs and fuzzy feelings, but still to a certain extent, Oda Nobuna no Yabou manages to do both those things at once, which I found kind of impressive given the premise and the fact that it’s only a 1-cour series. Speaking of which though, that is probably the only real complaint I have about the anime as a whole, namely:Where the hell is season 2?? more than yet another silly romantic comedy in an original setting.

It looked like a typical harem anime set in a historical  time frame. Which it is. Most of the characters are typical harem type characters and the anime is laced with comedy and romance.So there you have it.Not quite. Its the historical time frame that separates it from your usual harem comedy. The story is very loosely based on the life of Oda Nobunga, the hero of Japan's Sengoku period, through the eyes of Sagara Yoshiharu a 17 year old boy from the future who replaces Toyatomi Hideyoshi, and includes most of...the key characters of the period except in this version Oda Nobunga is actually called Oda Nobuna who is a teenage girl as are the rest of the main characters in the anime.As a result we have an anime which is a lot of fun likable characters and lots battle and action scenes which are based on real events in Oda Nobunga's life with some very good artwork.I would recommend swatting up on Japan's Sengoku period and Oda Nobunga's life a little to get the most out the anime as it will help to understand the plot. the key characters of the period except in this version Oda Nobunga is actually called Oda Nobuna who is a teenage girl as are the rest of the main characters in the anime.As a result we have an anime which is a lot of fun likable characters and lots battle and action scenes which are based on real events in Oda Nobunga's life with some very good artwork.I would recommend swatting up on Japan's Sengoku period and Oda Nobunga's life a little to get the most out the anime as it will help to understand the plot."", ""I love history.

No, I’m not referring to him, and neither is this TV series.The Ambition of Oda Nobuna (Oda Nobuna no Yabou) is an anime inspired by the manga of the same title by Mikage Kasuga. Dare I say, it’s listed in the historical genre, but truly nothing is historical about it other than all the namesakes of the characters involved are real men who fought in the civil war. Did I say “men?” I’m sorry. I totally forgot this is...Oda Nobuna we’re talking about.The series takes place when a teenage boy from the present day gets stuck in an alternate (and past) universe when Japan was in a civil war during what we know of as the 16th century; only this time, both men AND women were allowed to rule as feudal lords and military personnel. In this mess of literally gender-bending history, the boy known only to his fellow comrades as Saru (literally “monkey”) meets a rather promiscuous Oda Nobuna(ga?), a lower Japanese noble who desires to unite Japan and extend its diplomacy to the coming European nations. Together with her clansmen and retainers, Oda Nobuna and Saru plan to conquer Japan with the least amount of bloodshed while having a typical anime romance sequence.Overall, nothing is terribly wrong with the series, considering it obviously plays to an audience of the typical male otaku who enjoy seeing women playing sexual warrior roles. However, I can’t help but wonder why anyone would decide to write about a gender-bending of a truly historical figure like Oda Nobunaga. That has the same effect as if an American novelist decided to say Abraham Lincoln doubled as a vampire hunter as well as President of the United States (oh wait, that’s already been done). I just hope that fans of this show appreciate that this is totally FICTION and not actually real; and therefore has nothing to do with historical fact.

I finished this just now so still might be post-anime high, but that was so enjoyable it\'s ridiculous!

Oh boi oh boi oh boi! That does not stay that way at all.

And they nailed that part.

Other than then the imbecilic character that makes me want to reach through the screen and STRANGLE him.....This anime was pretty good and i would recommend it to people who can stand guys like the guy your about to see. "", ""Oda Nobuna was set in the Shogun period. This alone doesn't make a series good. What does is how the series used this period. The main characters are generals, leaders, people of importance. They are not citizens who kneel down to a figurehead that is never shown, nor do they need to obey any rules set by another man. The viewers follow the main characters' attempt to conquer and unite Japan. A huge dream shared by many. There are those who want to achieve it together, and those who want to achieve it alone. There are hindrances, eureka moments, betrayals, doubts, trickery and surprises, interesting...allies and enemies. Heroes are born and villains arise. The goal is a grand one but the scheme is a simple one. To conquer quickly and coercively through ruthless decisions, or conquer by sharing, love and unite the people; driven by vengeance or friendship?We see the generals lead the armies in both bird-eye and close-up views. The viewers are given seats in strategy meetings. We see the map, the route armies take and the obstacles they might face. We also see individual deaths and small victories here and there in front row seats.None of the generals are invincible. They fall into traps, they make wrong tactical advances and they let their men die. They regret, they fear for the worst and they sometimes think negatively.This time period wasn't chosen randomly out of a hat. The age sits between old Japan and the beginning of Westernisation. Should Japan learn about the rest of the world? Should Japan shield themselves from the West? Or should the generals set out to sea with a pirate flag and conquer shinsekai?The premise alone sounds plenty interesting. What makes this series more different is majority of these generals are women and lolis. There are good fanservice but few excessive ones. The women fight like men. They lay their honour on the battlefield and they aren't afraid of death. The action is solid. Supernatural elements and magic, check, but they don't overpower the good old fashioned cavalry with swords, bow men or rifle men.Our protagonist is from the future. He doesn't bring the internet with him nor anything fancy that would faze every other character in the show. No one is particularly impressed by his arrival and none feel threatened. He didn't make his impact through technology or his pair of trainers. He made his impact through people management and making good use of history lessons. He doesn't follow what was already written in the history books from his time, he allows discretion and take into consideration of people's feelings, what's the right thing to do at the right time. He doesn't dictate, nor throw solutions around in strategy meetings, and his predictions sometimes go wrong.In terms of personality, he is a determined lad. He is also a pervert. This is a harem show, and this guy gets boners. He has fantasies of his colleagues he works with and he falls in love, unlike school based series where the protagonist has no clue what's going on or doesn't have a penis. Our MC has desires and attempts to fulfil them.This series is nothing short of entertaining. The animation quality is Madhouse stunning. The women are sexual and the seiyuu super. It's one of the rare few anime that makes me guilty for awarding a low score. So guilty that I later changed it. Although, the setting and animation is fantastic, there are lots of typical moments in this series. Any said I would personally consider as spoilers. In addition, there are plot holes. First episode is confusing, one of the worst start to any series. But ignore it. To enjoy Oda Nobuna, you must not try to tick boxes or review it episode by episode. Do not emphasise on this time travelling, world transferring protagonist to overshadow the other characters and what the series is truly good at. The fact he is from a different time isn't the highlight of the series at all and the director made sure he isn't overpowered. It is sometimes best to forget he's from the future altogether.Oda Nobuna isn't a mindless, shut down your brain and watch series. It has emotions and you can get lost in the many names of people, castles, territories that do not come with much references. Although most characters have appeared in many other anime personality-wise, to have them in this age period and not act like scared little brats needing samurai to protect them 24/7 is a breath of fresh air. To really enjoy this series, you should aim to marathon it in 2 days. Any slower with underscore its plot holes. Don't watch it to punish the director or yourself, watch it in a forgiving attitude and you'll have a whale of a time! allies and enemies. Heroes are born and villains arise.

However i was definitely wrong , not only does anime have a good story ,it makes you want for more . Those who want learn little more about  Sengoku period are in for a treat . Though music and art are pretty average . The story and characters  make up for it . Especially for those who live outside japan , you can learn something from watching this . On top that the dub of this anime...is not bad either .  Although this anime may not be for all.  Those that do like historical periods  will get enjoyment out of it . Over all this was pretty entertaining  anime . And I pray that there a season 2 . is not bad either .  Although this anime may not be for all.

The story was introduced well, and I found it to be interesting, with the history added with the fact that every general/soldier was girl. However, the story as a whole, pretty much is like every other harem ""plot"" just that it is in  a different setting with different characters.Art (8/10): Splendid very good, not many flaws I can think of at all. Just spectacular :D!Sound (6/10): Soundtrack was amazing,...OP/EDs were okay. Balances the rating :D!!!Character (9/10): Okay here is where we get down to business.

It's easy to just fly through the episodes forgetting about how much time passed. That in itself makes this excellent. What's fun about it is that it's all made according to actual historical events, so you also learn history while watching it... that is, if you don't care about genders of people or any inconsistencies with the actual history, introduced here by our protagonist from the future. It's interesting how protagonist's original life or the way he came to the past is never addressed, because it's not point of the story. This kind of fast pacing...and moving the story forward doesn't allow for it, and it totally works.I wouldn't think that alternate harem-ish history in which most famous people are gender swapped into anime girls, would actually be good. Only thing I knew going into this was that it was historical romance. And it really delivers in both of those areas. It's not overly-haremish, but few complaints can be made in the area of fanservice. Often it crosses into the area of what I like to call blunt fanservice. Luckily, fast pacing doesn't allow it to eat up too much time. Other than that, sometimes the fast pacing results in introduction of so many characters that it's nearly impossible to keep track of their names. Same applies to the story, though it's mostly clear enough, sometimes I'd get a bit lost in what's going on. It's fun though to wiki a bit after an episode, to see what the differences are between anime and real history. Oh yeah, introduction of magic into an actual history is something you'll just have to accept I guess. But it does make the story more interesting so it's kinda justified. I'd usually be against the idea but again, it works here.It's interesting how much Nobuna resembles Sena from Haganai. They even have the same voice actress, and it's like she's trying to sounds the same. Well I definitely don't mind considering I love Sena. But there are a couple of things about Sena I'd prefer changed (breasts reduction for one), and funnily enough, doing that would result in Nobuna. Well,... hell yeah! What's even better, protagonist is totally cool. So even though setting seems harem-ish with all those girls around, it's plays out nothing like a regular harem anime. So it doesn't really resemble one. Oh, and make sure you're okay with litle girls being ninjas and generals and such... yeah it sounds weird in context of near-actual history, but the anime stylisation of history really ends up making it more fun.Character design, animation and production quality are spectacular and make this worth watching for the action sequences alone. Just look at OP and you'll know what I mean. Speaking of OP, it's really awesome, along with ED, and music is awesome as well. Oh, and don't expect too much closure, as anime only covers the first four volumes out of 10, but the good news is that volumes 5,6, and 7 are already translated by baka-tsuki. and moving the story forward doesn't allow for it, and it totally works.I wouldn't think that alternate harem-ish history in which most famous people are gender swapped into anime girls, would actually be good.

I am a big history buff and lived in Japan for 10 years. Seeing an alternate history was interesting. I have only 2 complaints. The beginning doesn't really explain how he ended up there in the first place. I assume they were looking to fill people in with later seasons. The other is that he did not get his reward from Nobuna at the end of this season. Everything he went through and she couldn't even give him something so simple. Other than those two issues I found the anime to be fantastic and I really want a second season....But as this anime is from 2012, I doubt it will happen.

To it\'s credit they did a great job in showing off the time period since it\'s loosely based on historical events. Despite it being typical, the use of some vibrant colors was executed perfectly and character design was not only true to it\'s time but showed originality as well.The best part about this show has to be the animation, it\'s top notch.

This anime takes place in a very important historical event known as the Onin war with the uniting of all the clans of Japan. The art is wonderful! Each character has a unique art, literally, they each have a different art style to them, so the variety will never end. The character's...are great, given that (SPOILER): a boy from the future has ended in the past. I was truly that the author of this anime didn't make it where he doesn't even talk about the past! I was surprised this anime didn't continue, but don't worry my anime friends, there is a Season 2! In the end it was a cliff hanger (but lets wait until you see it) Overall, I wouldn't want to give this a 10, but a 15!

( GOMENNASAI FOR JAPAN it Doesnt mean i Hate it. eerr,  just little jealous with my own culture *ITS FROM MY DEEPEST HEART! )Aw yes and then the following day i interested to try it so i download the first episode, and WHAT? It must be joking right? its Awesome, plot, story, and art very good. when it in WAR MODE the animation just like in movie but actually its in TV-Series...Right? yes very tempting and fill with romance, maybe it will end with harem but i dont know the ending since nobuna ( the Main Heroine ) very tsundere - type and actually She is KAWAI~. and i think the story like in sengoku era and it focus on Oda Clan. the plot interesting and the story has comedy too so you will not boring to watch it.And for the bad point i think because its too many Lolicon! How awful ( because i dislike it ) . huft, and main character truly very very Hentai! his mind is full with Harem, OPPAI and Girls.yeah that is for the main point I LIKE IT and i hope it has the second season for this anime, ( FULL OF HOPE! )Sankyou~ Right? yes very tempting and fill with romance, maybe it will end with harem but i dont know the ending since nobuna ( the Main Heroine ) very tsundere - type and actually She is KAWAI~. and i think the story like in sengoku era and it focus on Oda Clan. the plot interesting and the story has comedy too so you will not boring to watch it.And for the bad point i think because its too many Lolicon!

This might sound strange but after having this show recommended to me by so many people I wanted to come here today and just rant on how horrible it was just so I could stick it in their faces and state they were wrong. Unfortunately I ended up liking Oda Nobuna no Yabou a lot more than I wanted even with its various faults.Story: 6/10Understand this if you are interested in watching this anime; this is not a serious action/adventure show. I was lead to believe after...the first couple minutes that this was going to be a storytelling of how our average Joe was going to help lead Japan to peace. While that is the underlying focal point of the show, this show tries to do exactly what Campione! and High School DxD tried to get away with; being a smart harem. This show is a harem first, historical action drama second. The show feeds off of those awkward fanservice scenes that have been recycled throughout anime’s recent history of garbage. Just to note however that this show does not go as far as either Campione! or High School DxD in terms of its fanservice level; I’m just pissed that this aspect really ruined what could have been a great story. The story starts out with our main protagonist Yoshiharu somehow being sent into the past during one of Japan’s civil war struggles. It just so happens that our “hero” is a historical game nut that knows this time period very well. He then uses his knowledge to take Hideyoshi Toyotomi’s (apparently someone really important that ends up dying in the first minutes) place in history to help Nobuna Oda (the head of a noble family and ruler of a part of Japan) unify Japan and end the civil war. The events that take place in the anime are actually pretty interesting to watch unfold because the more Yoshiharu helps Nobuna the more the past begins to change.  He must then learn what has really happed compared to what he remembers from his games. There is also some slapstick comedy thrown in here and there making it pretty funny in some cases. Overall the anime is quite interesting to watch it’s just unfortunate that the fanservice scenes really ruined the overall mood of the show.Animation: 7.2/10I was able to watch a blu ray copy of this show (I promise I’ll buy it…eventually) and I have to say that even though it looks great I feel as if Studio Gokumi and MADHOUSE could have done a better job. Compared to other 2012 anime (K, Fate/Zero 2, Nisemonogatari, ext) it falls a little short of what I have come to expect especially from MADHOUSE (not sure how involved they were in making this anime). All the characters, backgrounds, and textures are well defined and have great lighting but there just isn’t anything that makes this show stand out of the crowd. The anime did however do a fantastic job with keeping the heavy action scenes free from any artifacting or loss of quality. Overall a great looking anime but expected more from these two studios.Sound: 6/10With the exception of K, this past year of anime has really not progressed very far in terms of using sound as a way of enhancing the overall experience. Some people do not realize how much a perfect score/soundtrack can make even the worst show redeemable. This show does exactly what every other harem anime has done before it; just throw some generic sounding music in with the dialogue and action scenes and as long as the anime looks good it will work. Well it doesn’t. In fact some of the music really distracted me from enjoying the show. It sounded like accurate music for the time period of the show but overall it wasn’t done very well. The only reason I am giving the sound category anything above a 4 is because the voice actors did do a pretty good job. Each character’s emotions are amplified by their respective voice actor’s performance.Characters: 7/10The characters of Oda Nobuna no Yabou actually do a pretty good job of providing some interesting moments throughout the entire anime. The relationship between Nobuna and Yoshiharu seems to escalate a little too quickly but this in the end helps provide some funny scenes with all the misunderstandings Yoshiharu gets into. The other main characters of the anime are pretty interesting and help make this war drama work even if every serious moment it ruined by Yoshiharu quest to have the most beautiful women in Japan. Now that I think about it even though Yoshiharu is a perv in most cases, he is actually a breath of fresh air compared to other harem leads. He is somewhat intelligent, caring, and bold. The fact that he is a more dominant male lead is a welcome compared to the generic no balls male lead we usually get in harems. Overall the characters help make the show more interesting but like I said earlier on I really think this show could have been one hundred times better if they just took the fanservice out and kept it an action/adventure with some comedy.Overall: 6.6/10Even though I ended up ranting on about the fanservice ruining the overall experience of the show, I did end up enjoying it. Heck I even rated it 4/5 stars on my profile because although the unnecessary stuff does hinder the series, the characters and plot helped make it an enjoyable experience. I do not hate fanservice if it is in say a romantic comedy placed in the present and maybe in a high school setting but when you try to mix it with a war drama it doesn’t always work out the same way. I wanted to hate this show just so I could say “Hey guess what, it sucks!” but I cannot tell a lie; this is an enjoyable show. Far from perfect but by no means unwatchable.Enjoyment: 7/10Thanks for reading my review!

Oh ho, was I wrong seeing that this anime brought out the most famous generals of Japan\'s feudal era to be all sexy ladies.You would think skepticism is what would come in mind because Oda Nobuna is completely off in a history perspective. But not entirely as it still kept some key feature left in it. Actually, enough to keep Oda Nobuna a sensible anime.Character development was something major in this anime. To...summarize it, good guys vs bad guy is what technicality happen thought out the story.So in conclusion, good delivery of some mild fan service with some comical scenes here and there.

A whole lot of nothing happens and I actually really like the Senogoku Period and Nobunaga's story, so this should be up my alley but nope!There is absolutely zero characterization, just very brief goals that come out of nowhere with no meaning. They say they care or want this and that for no reason but we're made to just go with it. Probably the worst part of this anime is there is no sense of where they are. We don't see any traveling and despite them just instantly transporting to one province to another, looking identical, there's no...sense of space or tangibility that grounds these characters. Mino, Oumi and Owari look exactly the same with the tiniest of differences, the only reason I know they're in a different place is cause the anime said so! They live in some CGI green plain land! Time also just barely exists, days, weeks, months and years just go by with no visible changes or development. The characters exist in this void of nothing burger.I thought this anime could at least have some interesting fun characters but they don't even focus on any of the girls! That's the least they could do! Characters are just presented and then instantly forgotten for the next set of characters.The only thing this anime has going for it, the ONLY thing is the art style and animation quality. Not so much actual animation, it's rather basic but the designs and digital processing is pretty good, especially for its time, it looks better than most anime nowadays.

This is the tale of nobunaga the fool as retold if a boy came from the future to the past and all of the generals were kawaii girls. Said boy is an expert on history and uses this expertise to help nobuna (his love interest) to conquer Japan while changing key events so everyone can live happily ever after and no one needs to die (minus countless soldiers who no one cares about). Basically... this is the VN/Anime Kohime Musou without the nudity.Don't get me wrong,...this is done well and the characters are appealing and interesting. You get a retelling of history with some notable changes but with the guise of being a romance plot with cute girls so it appeals to all the weebs of the world. It is done well, the pacing is good and the story is good. There are a few characters that aren't done so well and a few things work out BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP but that doesn't really ruin the story. The ending was complete and I could live with only a single season (though there was setup of another female general who clearly was meant for season 2 which never happened).

Settin any anime during the Sengoku era is an A in my book, cause you dont see many Animes set during the Sengoku era anymore, everything is futuristic, its nice to come back to the classic era. Plus...it reverses the roles, The Oda clan is actually ruled by a girl named Oda Nobuna and a funny hopeless guy from the future is thrown into the chaos of all the fighting during the Sengoku Era, but somehow manages to help Oda Nobuna throughout the time period. And along the way there a whole bunch of humor, but also some parts that have some sense of being serious. All in all i definately think Oda Nobuna No Yabou is a good anime.

As per the fact previously mentioned, I can't say much about the entire series and/or it's quality and enjoyability, but I can say I enjoyed it while I did. The only reason I dropped it is because by the end of episode 3 the momentum had completely STOPPED. The primary premise = VERY appealing, the characters = HILARIOUS, the romance/other relationships = entertaining.

I didn't notice anything special about it probably because the focus was more into art and comedy. 8/10Characters: OMG the characters, they are always pervy and funny.

This OVA is mostly everything you could ask for at this point. It perfectly concludes the first season, and all I can say is that it is even funnier than the other episodes.-Story: As I said before, it continues the story that was left in the last episode from the anime. I gave it just a 9/10, since i think there are some...features missing to introduce the new season, or at least the next part of the manga. However, it keeps on where the last episode left the story, and thats all I could ask for.-Art: Personally, I find Prison School's art awesome. It fits perfectly for this genre, and it lets the characters perfectly show every emotion. You can even watch the series without subtitles or sound, and you could just laugh for many of the reactions, so i gave it a 10/10.-Sound: I'm not really sure of what to write in here. I love the opening theme, and the effects included are good enough. The voices, as the art did, expressed the feelings perfectly, I am a fan of voice acting, and I can say I enjoyed it ^^ 9/10-Character: Same stereotyped characters as in the anime. However, this show makes this stereotypes into something great. In other animes, u can see those repeated and overused personalities, with a shy guy as the main character, and some innocent and tsundere girls. I think this is the fact that makes this show so awesome. They exaggerated everything so hard, that it turns into a funny quality of the characters. 9/10-Enjoyment: Definitelly one of the best comedy manga/animes ever created. At least from my point of view. I enjoyed every chapter, and this OVA is not an exception. 10/10-Overall: I love Prison School, and I hope it gets a second season soon. Hope you agree with my honest and personal review :3 features missing to introduce the new season, or at least the next part of the manga.

The voices, as the art did, expressed the feelings perfectly, I am a fan of voice acting, and I can say I enjoyed it ^^ 9/10-Character: Same stereotyped characters as in the anime. However, this show makes this stereotypes into something great. In other animes, u can see those repeated and overused personalities, with a shy guy as the main character, and some innocent and tsundere girls. I think this is the fact that makes this show so awesome. They exaggerated everything so hard, that it turns into a funny quality of the characters. 9/10-Enjoyment: Definitelly one of the best comedy manga/animes ever created. At least from my point of view. I enjoyed every chapter, and this OVA is not an exception. 10/10-Overall: I love Prison School, and I hope it gets a second season soon. Hope you agree with my honest and personal review :3"", 'The tv show got a 10 from me but this i gave a 7 to.seen via english dub.This continuance of the anime was nice. Yes, i am glad the boys got back to their free lives. But why kill the justice scene? Justice being the girls that were in charge. The episode to me said okay girls we know you were bad to the boys it is now your turn. However, that was a brief moment in time and that was it. They were never to be heard from again. For an ecchi anime that was not cool!in all honesty in terms of audio would...it had made a difference if was in english dub? i would say no. I understand those that enjoy dubbed i love them too. However, to me it is only worth while if the anime is 8-10 ranked. That and it has not been dubbed at all. This of course was dubbed in terms of the actual show. So, even if the were speaking Japanese for me i could mental hear their English voices. it had made a difference if was in english dub? i would say no. I understand those that enjoy dubbed i love them too. However, to me it is only worth while if the anime is 8-10 ranked. That and it has not been dubbed at all.

Joe wants to go back to prison because his life is boring and without any fun, all the boys have got (or almost) girls to talk to and they are happy with freedom, except for Joe. Even Gakuto was able to relate to a girl. Joe wants to go back to prison by any means necessary and does everything for it, he\'s the only one in the group that is no relate to anyone, not even to the boys, Joe does not seem to have a great friendship with any of the boys , his only visible friendship is with his ants, Joe tries in all ways to return to prison, because he believes that it is freedom, for him that world inside the prison is what really puts him on the same level as the boys, he feels alive and sees that his colleagues are in the same situation as him and sees them as equals, out of prison he is the only one who feels lonely and dislocated, for being a very strange guy. The plot approaches Joe very well and characterizes it in a simple way and still manages to make you a little more interested in the character, my impression that he was the most interesting of all the boys was not wrong, Joe is undoubtedly the most mysterious and flashy character of Prison School and this arc works him very well, the plot is simple but straightforward, it serves to develop Joe and does just that. Aside from Joe\'s development, OVA also shows Gakuto and his relationship to a new character, Mitsuko, a cute and clumsy girl, but this is not deepened by the simple fact that Gakuto is not the focus of the arc, it was still fun see the moments of the two. Overall the plot did what it was proposed: Develop Joe, nothing more, nothing less. The comedy remains bizarre and very funny, without doubt one of the strongest points of the series.Characters (2 of 2): They are still incredible and very charismatic, but I will only talk about Joe: His loneliness is understandable and his reasons for going back to prison makes sense, it shows his side and how he sees the whole situation from his point of view and everything makes sense. Not having friends, girlfriend or purpose in life is something painful and this is visible in he\'s characterization. Joe is not made to be cool, pervert and super excited character like the other boys. He is well written and difficult to deal with, a fascinating character who had not received his due focus on the series and when received did not disappoint me and managed to take my interest not only in him, but in the OVA as a whole. Mitsuko is a cool character, too, but not very relevant here, she\'s the arc fanservice and Gakuto\'s romantic interest, that\'s it.Art/Animation (1 of 2): Much worse than the original series, really bad... the character design is beautiful, but the rest is ugly and bland, the direction is still excellent, all scenes are very well directed and this is the positive point of the production.OST (1 of 2): Nothing new, most all tracks are from the original series and the new ones are very weak, OST was not much needed, but still important.Personal Taste (1 of 1) I really laughed watching the OVA. I was intrigued by Joe and I really enjoyed his characterization, it\'s a fun OVA and it fulfills his role well.Final Verdict: 7/10. It\'s worth watching if you want to know a little more about Joe, it\'s really fun too, for me, a good OVA.Portuguese (BR) Version:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Enredo (2 de 3): O OVA adapta o arco do mangá ""Mad Wax"" que foca na caracterização de Joe, o único personagem do grupo dos garotos que não tinha tido um desenvolvimento e tbm mostra a vida dos garotos após saírem da prisão. Joe quer voltar para a prisão pois a sua vida é chata e sem nenhum divertimento, todos os garotos conseguiram (ou quase) garotas com quem conversar e estão felizes com a liberdade, menos Joe. Até Gakuto conseguiu se relacionar com uma garota. Joe com isso quer voltar para a prisão de qualquer maneira e faz de tudo para isso, ele é o único isolado do grupo, não consegue se relacionar com ninguém, nem mesmo com os garotos, Joe não parece ter uma grande amizade com nenhum dos garotos, a única amizade visível dele é com as suas formigas, Joe tenta de todas as formas voltar para a prisão, pois ele acredita que aquilo é liberdade, para ele aquele mundo dentro da prisão é o que realmente coloca-o no mesmo patamar que os garotos, ele se sente vivo e vê que seus colegas tbm estão na mesma situação que ele e os enxerga como iguais, fora da prisão ele é o único que se sente solitário e deslocado, por ser um cara bem sombrio. O enredo aborda muito bem os aspectos do Joe e o caracteriza de maneira simples e ainda sim consegue deixar vc um pouco mais interessado pelo personagem, a minha impressão de que ele era o mais interessante de todos os garotos não estava errada, sem dúvidas Joe é o personagem mais misterioso e chamativo de Prison School e esse arco trabalha muito bem isso, o enredo é simples, mas direto, serve para desenvolver o Joe e faz exatamente isso. Fora o desenvolvimento de Joe, O OVA tbm mostra Gakuto conhecendo e se relacionando com uma nova personagem, Mitsuko, uma garota fofinha e desastrada, mas isso não é aprofundado pelo simples fato de que Gakuto não é o foco do arco em si, ainda sim foi divertido ver os momentos dos dois. No geral o enredo fez o que era proposto: Desenvolver o Joe, nada mais, nada menos. A comédia continua bizarra e muito engraçada, sem dúvidas um dos pontos mais fortes da obra.Personagens (2 de 2): Ainda são incríveis e muito carismáticos, mas apenas irei falar do Joe: Sua solidão é compreensível e suas razões para voltar a prisão tbm, ele mostra o seu lado e como vê toda a situação de seu ponto de vista e tudo faz sentido. Não ter amigos, namorada ou um propósito na vida é algo doloroso e isso é visível na caracterização do personagem. Joe não é foi feito para ser personagem legal, tarado e super extravagante como os outros garotos. Ele é bem escrito e difícil de se lidar, um personagem fascinante que não tinha recebido seu devido foco na obra e quando recebeu não me decepcionou e conseguiu ter o meu interesse não só nele, mas no OVA como um todo. A Mitsuko é uma personagem legal tbm, mas não é muito relevante, ela é o fanservice do arco e o par romântico do Gakuto, só isso.Arte/Animação (1 de 2): Muito inferior à série original, bem ruim mesmo... o character design é bonito, mas o resto é feio e sem graça, a direção continua excelente, todas as cenas são muito bem dirigidas e esse é o ponto positivo da produção.OST (1 de 2): Nada de novo, a maioria das tracks são da série original e as novas são bem fracas, a OST não foi muito necessária, mas ainda sim é importante.Veredito Final: 7/10.

s.CRY.ed,https://myanimelist.net/anime/168/sCRYed,"['Okay kids, time for some real talk. Dub Scryed is the best God damned show ever made, and will ever be made, in the history and future of visual entertainment. It\'s about this badass dude with a nuclear-powered arm and a jet engine on his back who takes shit from no man. Basically he enjoys his life living in an abandoned dentist\'s office in the slums with his loli fangirl until some uniformed douchebags from the city across the way show up to wreck his stuff and kidnap him. From that point on he, Kazuma The Shell Bullet (the main character. last names are for...pussies), devotes his life to kicking their asses, especially this one pompus, justice-obsessed guy named Ryuho. He\'s pretty much your cliche bishounen hero and serves as the other main character of the show.The main theme of the series is their rivalry in particular. No matter what else goes on in this show, it all ultimately boils down to our badass hero and our girly nerd hero wanting to beat the shit out of each other.But seriously now, Scryed is basically what you\'d get if you took Naruto, Bleach, DBZ and Code Geass, cut out the filler, terrible writing, homoerotic overtones and everything else that brings those shows down and put the gold left over into 26 episodes. Speaking of Code Geass, that series is literally just Scryed after Goro Taniguchi got paid tons of money to add Clamp art, school crap, robots and double the series length for no reason.The pacing\'s good. The first half of the series has Kazuma coming to a classic shounen showdown with some of the wildest and most awesome/gimmicky/hateable enemies I\'ve ever seen. In the background of all this, the plot develops as the big bad city and its police force comes into greater conflict with the slum people. Of course this all involves dudes with weird superpowers fighting too.Later on in the show, after Kazuma breaks the universe in half with a flick of his wrist, the series jumps into overdrive and all sorts of awesome shit happens. Scryed shows that it can juggle multiple subplots at once with equal weight(something Code Geass wishes it could do btw), which does nothing but add to how awesome the last batch of eps are. The final episode of Scryed should be duly noted as the best final episode of anything ever. Not even exaggerating here.Characters? Awesome. Many people confuse Kazuma with a cliche shounen hero, when in fact he\'s everything a good shounen hero has never been. Does he fight for his friends? Nah. Does he fight to become a great figure? No way. Does he fight just because he likes fighting? Well, yeah. Obv. But the key difference is that Kazuma does not give a DAMN. Do you have hostages and are threatening Kazuma? He\'ll just knock you the hell out with no regards for anyone else. He\'s impulsive, selfish, destructive, reckless, totally narrow-minded, PROUD and all the other things heroes are too balless or moral to be. These factors play heavily into his character development, as he becomes gradually more mentally unstable and self-destructive.Then there\'s Ryuho. He\'s the polar opposite of Kazuma in every conceivable way in terms of personality, appearance, powers, back story, etc. Such is the point. He\'s almost as major as Kazuma, though I don\'t feel like typing a lot about him. Just note that he ""HATES EVERYTHING EVIL!""There\'s also Straight Cougar as Crispin Freeman. Or perhaps it\'s the other way around. Hard to tell. Anyway he\'s the best character in the show besides Kazuma and a fan favorite. The whole premise of his person is to live fast and be awesome. He\'s actually stronger than both the main characters, but he doesn\'t even care enough to show it. That\'s how slick this guy is.Others include:Kanami: Loli NarratorKimishima: Kazuma\'s best bro, third best character right hereScheris: Boobs(in the manga) with Kari\'s voice from DigimonMimori: The cancer of the series, we don\'t talk about herJigmar: Mullet-clad commander of HOLY. sounds like Jelly JigglerTachibana: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSs_T23qqW4#t=02m00sBiff: HAMMMMMMMERRRRRUrizane: Has mighty watermelon powersEmergy: This guy actually summons a damn Gundam to fight KazumaA humpback whale: The main enemy of the seriesKyoji Mujo: The most wonderfully slick and antagonistic villain ever. He\'s actually just a gay elf but whatever.Other Stuff: Hm... Music. Yes. As with like every Taniguchi show, this series has a plethora of dramatic Mexican trumpets, acoustic guitars, male choruses, etc which liven up action scenes, make dramatic scenes wonderfully Tele-Novela-esque in their cheesiness, etc. A+ OST.Now let\'s shut up for a sec to talk about voices. You don\'t watch Scryed subbed. Let me repeat:###You DO NOT watch Scryed subbed.###Not only does every sub group for this series suck horrendously in ways you can\'t begin to grasp(I hope you\'re reading this, incompetent ""FIST OF MY EGO!"" translators), but the original voices produce a very different series. A boring, desolate series only fools dare to tread where a really aggressive constipated boy does shoddy combat with some losers. A stark contrast to Dub Scryed(the correct title for the series) which follows the antiheroic exploits of a proud man with a prouder fist asserting himself upon dastardly cheesy wrongdoers who are running all up in his house. The scriptwriting in the dub is Pulitzer worthy, as shown by that youtube link above and these gems:""If it exists, I\'ll find it! Even if it doesn\'t!""""Kazuma~! How are you going to get out of this PINCH?""""You should know the answer... with my fist!!""Oh yeah, there\'s art and animation too. Portions of the first few episodes of the series look very 90\'s, but as the series goes on it gets better and better. They actually spent a good portion of the budget on just the final episode, which is considerably smoother than previous ones and even features fully new transformation sequences and no stock footage at all. Not that there\'s much of that in the series in the first place.SUMMARY: It\'s the son of G Gundam and First of the North star and the father of Needless and Gurren Lagann. Dub only, sub sucks.

This is the only shounen fightan\' anime you\'ll ever want or need to watch.', 'StoryThe Lost Ground was created 22 years ago in the Kanazawa Prefecture when an unexplained geological / metaphysical phenomenon occurred which caused the ground to rise up into peaks accompanied by the release of a lot of energy. There were 2 effects of this. Firstly the Lost Ground split off from the Mainland. Secondly about 1% of the inhabitants of the Lost Ground gained special abilities to manipulate matter in various ways, they are called Alter Capabilists, with accompanying ""Alter"" abilities. If an Alter Capabilist\'s ability manifests in the form of a separate entity that separate entity is called an ""Alter"".Politics makes this anime very...interesting. There is the Mainland who treats the Lost Grounds as a sort of beggar nation. The city part of the Lost Ground has trade concessions and AID from the Mainland, and is separated from the rest of the Lost Ground by a high wall. Those outside ""The Wall"" are called Natives, and alter users there are Native Alters.In order to combat the Lost Ground Native Alters, Lost Ground Admin sets up an institution called HOLD and a special division within that called HOLY which is basically Native Alters who have come to the Admin side in order to suppress other Native Alters from the other side of the wall. It\'s sort of like using mutants to fight other mutants. Also note that even within the Admin section of Lost Grounds, Alters are NOT accepted as equal citizens, but they are tolerated if they are members of HOLY.What a WONDERFUL premise. Special people with powers. Politics. Socio-economic ramifications where the rich live in the city and the rest eke out a beggarly but INDEPENDENT existence outside the wall. Organized government vs. anarchy. Dictatorship vs. Freedom. By the time it hit episode 10, I was thinking ""this is GREAT"".If all these wonderful possibilities had been taken to their conclusion I would have given story a 10, but it goes only part of the way there. I will say that the very last FRAME of the series brought the plot from a 8 to a solid 9. You\'ll understand when you see it.CharacterThe main protagonist is Kazuma, the stereotypical rebel bad boy with a heart of gold. His alter is the ability to ""harden"" his right arm with metallic alloy which gives him the ability to smash through anything. At the beginning of the series he is a native alter living with his sweetheart, Kanami, who has masses of long red hair while keeping his identity as an alter ""mercenary for hire"" secret.Before long he encounters Ryuhou, rich spoiled scion of an important industrial conglomerate who has emotional baggage from watching his mother die to a mysterous alter capabilist when he was a child. He is the co-protagonist and is the strong, silent, lawful type. He is the most gifted member of HOLY and is charged with suppressing Native Alters, because as everyone quickly figures out, only alters can fight other alters, normal humans don\'t stand a chance. Ryohou is ridiculously good looking. In typical aloof hero fashion, he is oblivious to the TWO girls who are in love with him.Kazuma and Ryuhou start out as enemies but they don\'t stay that way as things progress. It all happens very naturally too. Sometimes I was not happy with the ""one dimensional"" nature of Kazuma as the competitive, I want to be the best/winner guy. It\'s too Dragonball Z. Ryuhou matured as the series progressed but even then there are some manly man man things that manly men can\'t change.The cast of supporting characters is very well fleshed out, every single one of them. Straight Cougar is the comic relief but he has a ""deep"" side and ended up being my favorite characters. Shiree had the most amazing alter. The mainland princess is idealistic and unrealistic. Melon man has his own principles and the rest of the smaller guys you either liked or hated but they weren\'t easily forgotten. All in all the characters were very well done except for Kazuma\'s character development which could have been done better.Art/AnimationBy 2008 standards, this is fairly dated with TONS of frame reuse. Like every episode there\'s frame reuse. However to give credit to the artists the transformation scenes are very well drawn with excellent artistic licence, flow, color and creativity. You don\'t get bored of seeing the ""alters"" of various people. If not for this I would have rated Art a lot lower.SoundThe first strains of the opening sounds reminded me of Ricky Martin\'s ""She Bangs""!! Serious!!! The alter sound effects were well done and voice acting was good. Not much else to say, nothing else jumped out at me as horrible or wonderful enough to give this more than a 7 rating.EnjoymentI didn\'t expect to enjoy this series as much as I did. Some parts of it were very predictable, characters fit into anime stereotypes but still with all the variety and interaction and plot driven devices this ended up being a very enjoyable watch. There\'s lots of fighting, cool alters, philosophical parts, drama, angst, love, what\'s not to like? Slightly better Art, a little more character development with Kazuma and pushing some other plot points to their conclusion would have made this a 10. interesting. There is the Mainland who treats the Lost Grounds as a sort of beggar nation. The city part of the Lost Ground has trade concessions and AID from the Mainland, and is separated from the rest of the Lost Ground by a high wall. Those outside ""The Wall"" are called Natives, and alter users there are Native Alters.In order to combat the Lost Ground Native Alters, Lost Ground Admin sets up an institution called HOLD and a special division within that called HOLY which is basically Native Alters who have come to the Admin side in order to suppress other Native Alters from the other side of the wall. It\'s sort of like using mutants to fight other mutants. Also note that even within the Admin section of Lost Grounds, Alters are NOT accepted as equal citizens, but they are tolerated if they are members of HOLY.What a WONDERFUL premise. Special people with powers. Politics. Socio-economic ramifications where the rich live in the city and the rest eke out a beggarly but INDEPENDENT existence outside the wall. Organized government vs. anarchy. Dictatorship vs. Freedom. By the time it hit episode 10, I was thinking ""this is GREAT"".If all these wonderful possibilities had been taken to their conclusion I would have given story a 10, but it goes only part of the way there. I will say that the very last FRAME of the series brought the plot from a 8 to a solid 9. You\'ll understand when you see it.CharacterThe main protagonist is Kazuma, the stereotypical rebel bad boy with a heart of gold. His alter is the ability to ""harden"" his right arm with metallic alloy which gives him the ability to smash through anything. At the beginning of the series he is a native alter living with his sweetheart, Kanami, who has masses of long red hair while keeping his identity as an alter ""mercenary for hire"" secret.Before long he encounters Ryuhou, rich spoiled scion of an important industrial conglomerate who has emotional baggage from watching his mother die to a mysterous alter capabilist when he was a child. He is the co-protagonist and is the strong, silent, lawful type. He is the most gifted member of HOLY and is charged with suppressing Native Alters, because as everyone quickly figures out, only alters can fight other alters, normal humans don\'t stand a chance. Ryohou is ridiculously good looking. In typical aloof hero fashion, he is oblivious to the TWO girls who are in love with him.Kazuma and Ryuhou start out as enemies but they don\'t stay that way as things progress. It all happens very naturally too. Sometimes I was not happy with the ""one dimensional"" nature of Kazuma as the competitive, I want to be the best/winner guy. It\'s too Dragonball Z. Ryuhou matured as the series progressed but even then there are some manly man man things that manly men can\'t change.The cast of supporting characters is very well fleshed out, every single one of them. Straight Cougar is the comic relief but he has a ""deep"" side and ended up being my favorite characters. Shiree had the most amazing alter. The mainland princess is idealistic and unrealistic. Melon man has his own principles and the rest of the smaller guys you either liked or hated but they weren\'t easily forgotten. All in all the characters were very well done except for Kazuma\'s character development which could have been done better.Art/AnimationBy 2008 standards, this is fairly dated with TONS of frame reuse. Like every episode there\'s frame reuse. However to give credit to the artists the transformation scenes are very well drawn with excellent artistic licence, flow, color and creativity. You don\'t get bored of seeing the ""alters"" of various people. If not for this I would have rated Art a lot lower.SoundThe first strains of the opening sounds reminded me of Ricky Martin\'s ""She Bangs""!! Serious!!! The alter sound effects were well done and voice acting was good. Not much else to say, nothing else jumped out at me as horrible or wonderful enough to give this more than a 7 rating.EnjoymentI didn\'t expect to enjoy this series as much as I did. Some parts of it were very predictable, characters fit into anime stereotypes but still with all the variety and interaction and plot driven devices this ended up being a very enjoyable watch. There\'s lots of fighting, cool alters, philosophical parts, drama, angst, love, what\'s not to like?

The wide set of characters is amazing, and the interaction between them is even better. In some way, all of them are connected through one another.The story in a nutshell is set a few years after ""The Great Uprising"" and this in return sets up the character plots. Alters vs. HOLY. Alters are people who gained certain abilities from the incident a few years back, and they live outside the inner city just trying to survive, but HOLY wishes to either eliminate them all, or bring them to their side.This show is very enjoyable. A lot of...choice words thrown out here and there, nothing anyone hasn\'t heard before. If your a fan of DBZ, you\'ll most likely enjoy this one too. The story is great, the Animation is fantastic with awesome sound to go with it. As I said, the characters make the show even better, and it\'s just all around enjoyable.Emotion also runs high in this one. A lot of anger from Kazuma, Scheris and Mimori make love a real issue for Ryuhou, and Ryuhou is just one of those lost boys trying to figure out what\'s really going on in the world and what really happened in his past. Kanami makes this story enjoyable too. And those are just a few of the most important characters. Cougar is a pretty funny guy too ;] The two main guys are Kazuma and Ryuhou, which in every other episode they\'re pretty much punching each other\'s faces into the ground, or arguing about something or other.Overall, s-CRY-ed is one anime your not going to want to miss out on. The art is beautiful, the plot gets thicker and thicker as you get into further episodes, and you really have to pay attention in the beginning to understand everything to the fullest. This one isn\'t an anime you have to read the manga for either, so there\'s a plus. The manga goes into more details about the story, but oh well.s-CRY-ed gets a 10/10 overall from me.

Because this show just had sex with you.S-CRY-ED takes place on giant island, called The Lost Ground. Suddenly, the place just...rose out of nowhere 22 years ago. People with special abilities are born sometimes called Alters. Most of the Lost ground is barren wasteland, With one exceptional city on it. We have 2 groups now. The city fuckers, and the natives surviving outside. In the city, a group exists called HOLD, within HOLD their is a group called HOLY. HOLY is made up of Altars organized to control other Altars outside the city, Native Altars. This story has such weak premises and devices, stuff we have all seen before. But the way it works with these is so astounding, its something i have never seen before.Here is were we get to the center of this cream puff of fucking manliness. Wait, eww that sounded gay. Sorry, that aside we have one tough mother fucker named Kazuma. No last name, he doesn\'t need one. He lives with a 8 year old girl named Kaname who wants him to be a slave on a farm all the time. Kazuma say\'s he will do anything for money, so him and his buddy, Kimishima, take on jobs using Kazuma\'s Altar power. He turns his fucking arm into... A tougher arm and uses things on his back to propel forward using attacks like SHOCKING FIRST BULLET!Anywho, tough guy Ryuhou is the second main character and he\'s working for HOLY. CAN YOU SAY JUSTICE?!?!?! Yeah hes the typical no evil good boy and all self righteous like Seto Kiba or maybe you could compare him to Suzaka from Code Geass. His altar is summoning his little doll to fight for him. Him and Kazuma, are EPIC rivals from beginning to end. At first hating each other guts in the first arc, to then teaming up in the second, but still wanting to kick each others ass, but with a respect. Personally, I like Ryuhou alot in the second half, just still not ass much as Kazuma.Arts all like 2004-2006 what do you expect? I don\'t care that much so i just gave it a 9.Sound is solid. Opening Reckless fire is sweet as hell and so is the ending. But one thing here. DUBBED fucking understand me subbed lovers? NO. YOU WATCH DUBBED. No exception.We have a bunch of characters. From the ones in holy to the ones outside it. Development is really awesome but it kind of only comes after the second arc. My personal favorites is Straight Cougar, i guess he was like a mentor to Kazuma, and he uses the moves Kazuma does in the 1st stage of his altar. His motto is go through it fast so you have more time for the next thing. His altar is speedy mc speedy fuck awesome. I like most of the characters from watermelon man, to the ""Humpback whale""(Nyron) to Scheris who is Ryuhou\'s fanbase. One character i can NOT STAND is Mimori. Worst character ever. Give me a second to rant. She fucking love\'s Ryuhou, because she met him ONCE as a kid and has never seen him since and just follows him like fuck. Get a life. I hate this bitch. Whines and complains too. Perhaps she can cook? NO, probably not.Anyway s-CRY-ed is underrated and freaking Incredible. I believe it to be a 10, and it deserves to be in my favorites. Here a gave it a 9, just because i don\'t want to look like as a review, i overlooked its problems because i didn\'t. As a master procrastinator i believe to save the worst for last. ALOT of characters have some build up but NO follow and through and at one point become completely useless. Tachibana or Jigmar for example.

The music was subpar. But overall I enjoyed the show alot. It made me excited to watch each episode and expect the next one to be more better. It pretty much delivered on that end because of one lone reason. The main character Kazuma. He is pretty much an anti-hero mold that doesn't take any bullshit. He is very decisive and does not get caught up in the small things. Basically he does not have any of the annoying characterics other popular shonen characters...would have.Honestly I wanted to give this show a 10, because I thought it was purely awesome with its fight scenes. Even if it was extremely cheesy with the characters finishing each other's line and all that other bread that comes with it. The two characters of Kazuma Straight Cougar pretty much make this show completely watchable even though Straight Cougar is not a lead. I did not think the story sucked since the story kept moving episode to episode but it failed to capture me in its setting.

Both of them go through a character journey, losing things that are important to them and transforming both physically and mentally. Of course, there is a cast of regulars that appear and are interesting in their own right.An early theme as the backdrop between Kazuma and Ryuho’s battles is Order versus Chaos. While it doesn’t stay the focus forever, it’s interesting to see how these viewpoints impact both the two main characters and the world around them, as well as the people that they meet. In...the end, either they change someone’s view or at least take them out of commission.Not every episode lands or is very important.. there are a few episodes that for half the runtime serve as more than recaps than actual story progression.

The reason I say ""mostly"" amazing is because of its male characters having tons of powerful scenes, but the non-amazing parts of the story are terrible as they deal with the female characters. This anime comes off as very sexist. None of the girls really pose a good fight to anyone and they are all put into serving roles 95% of the time while having minimal personality. I mostly remember them moaning, crying or calling out the male character names. They are basically objects and servants or non-existent. It never...makes sense to have physically weak female characters in a world where super powers exist and while there are many, MANY shows that have managed to do it anyway. Even so, S-cry-ed is a tough act to follow when it comes to hatred of women. The female characters mostly do healing or nothing, even if they can fight. They are mostly defined by patience or faith, despite having abilities which should allow them to be more meaningful to the fate of anything.Art: The art designs in this show are really good, in my opinion. Kazuma has a legendary character design, but other characters in the series have equally great designs. The fight scenes just look incredible most of the time.Sound: Very solid. I like the ending theme more than the opening, but the soundtrack in the show itself really works, if I recall correctly.Character: Like I said, female characters are terrible. Kazuma is a great character with deep manliness whereas his ""sidekick"" (I want to call her that) is boring and usually so one-dimensional that she can be characterized by calling out ""Kasu-kun"". She shows glimpses of a great character, but was never pushed far enough to make her seem like anything but a child archetype. Mimori is a character who seems like she could mean something, but is downright empty. Scheris\' ""Eternal Devote"" is a phrase that has remained in my memory forever. I wish she was a good character, but she is also mostly empty and fails at everything despite being the most involved female character. None of Kazuma\'s real opponents are female.Enjoyment: My enjoyment was low. Although the show was great, it was hard for me to really feel involved with it because the female characters were the ones I was invested in, but they never went anywhere meaningful for me.Overall: 6 Fair.

In the lost ground there are ""Native Alters"" and Alters of Holy"" which is a government organization tasked with keeping the peace in the lost ground so that native alters do not effect the humans that live on the main land.The story of Scryed is...simple but interesting at the same time the only thing I have an issue with is the charcters. Almost all the characters expect for Kazuma, Ryuhou, and Kanami get any push time. All around though it is a very enjoyable series.I recommended it to anybody who Likes, Zetman, Bleach, Trigun, Outlaw Star, or DBZ simple but interesting at the same time the only thing I have an issue with is the charcters.

Despite being marketed as a classically cheesy, over-the-top MANLY action series, this show not only succeeds on that front, but does so while including surprisingly nuanced characterization, brisk pacing, and a few daring creative choices that probably went on to inspire other series in big ways.The setting is twenty or so years after the apocalypse, where a cataclysmic event breaks off a piece of Japan, the newly formed island becoming known as the ""Lost Ground"". The island becomes a lawless slum in...the style of something like the Satelite from Yugioh 5D\'s or District 12 from The Hunger Games, both of which came after this by the way. Meanwhile, the mainland lives in prosperity with futuristic tech aplenty, the special forces unit HOLY on a mission to subjugate the lost ground and assimilate the people there into their society. Furthermore, the cataclysm triggered superpower mutations in a select percentage of the population known as ""Alter"" powers. This part sounds derivative, but in fact these Alter powers are uniquely and creative in implementation and execution. Rather than using generic elemental powers or ki blasts, the Alter powers include stuff like rewriting reality into a screenplay of the user\'s own creation (which can be broken by someone of sufficient will), throwing giant watermelons at the enemy, or being able to turn regular cars into hot pink turbo chargers. Sadly, the fights are not overly complex in terms of choreography, but the ideas are certainly memorable.Fundamentally, the story is about the rivalry between the two main characters, Kazuma and Ryuho, as well as the stories of the people close to them. Interestingly, the conflict between the two is not precisely good vs evil as much as it lawful vs chaotic. Kazuma is the protagonist and undeniably heroic, but he can also be quite dickish at times and is overly impetuous, unfocused, and downright dumb at times. I wouldn\'t have it any other way - he is an enjoyable character and feels human. Likewise, Ryuho is quite dickish at times but is not ever really that evil. Even at his worst he never goes outside the bounds of his duty as a member of HOLY, and is often honorable, principled, and noble. The audience dislikes him because he opposes Kazuma, but I always liked both of them. Also notable is that Kazuma and Ryuho never succeed at winning the other over to their belief system, but learn to respect each other anyways, which is something I found refreshing.Although Kazuma and Ryuho are fairly nuanced, most of the other side characters are fairly one-note in comparison. The most memorable by far is memelord Straight Cougar, with Crispin Freeman hamming it up (of course you are watching this dubbed). Otherwise, I liked Scheris and Kimishima. Mimori was pretty brutal at times, cannot lie.The story goes to some surprisingly odd and weird places at times, but keeps a very fast pace and tells a complete story in 26 episodes. Unfortunately, the series was never too popular outside of a cult following in the west, but that\'s not so bad because the story actually has a beginning, middle, and end. Unthinkable these days. Two things to note - Kazuma\'s shell bullet is very similar to Issei Hyoudou\'s Sacred Gear from dxd, and the ending of this series echoes the ending of Naruto eerily. You can bet that many high-profile mangaka have S-Cry-Ed on the radar. They know a good story when they see one.The animation was done by studio Sunrise, who also did Infinite Ryvius and Gundam Seed. Personally I am not a huge fan of their style but outside of my aesthetic preference I thought they did well on the production side of things. There are not that many re-used frames which is notable for a show centered around fighting. I would have personally loved to see how the show would have looked with Studio Gallop at the helm, but that\'s just me.Overall, this series is a breath of fresh air in many ways and is one of my favorites. I heartily endorse it as one of those ""chill summer weeknight"" kinda shows. the style of something like the Satelite from Yugioh 5D\'s or District 12 from The Hunger Games, both of which came after this by the way. Meanwhile, the mainland lives in prosperity with futuristic tech aplenty, the special forces unit HOLY on a mission to subjugate the lost ground and assimilate the people there into their society. Furthermore, the cataclysm triggered superpower mutations in a select percentage of the population known as ""Alter"" powers. This part sounds derivative, but in fact these Alter powers are uniquely and creative in implementation and execution. Rather than using generic elemental powers or ki blasts, the Alter powers include stuff like rewriting reality into a screenplay of the user\'s own creation (which can be broken by someone of sufficient will), throwing giant watermelons at the enemy, or being able to turn regular cars into hot pink turbo chargers. Sadly, the fights are not overly complex in terms of choreography, but the ideas are certainly memorable.Fundamentally, the story is about the rivalry between the two main characters, Kazuma and Ryuho, as well as the stories of the people close to them. Interestingly, the conflict between the two is not precisely good vs evil as much as it lawful vs chaotic. Kazuma is the protagonist and undeniably heroic, but he can also be quite dickish at times and is overly impetuous, unfocused, and downright dumb at times.

A goal in overtime, my daughter learning to crawl, an amazing encore at an Alkaline Trio concert.  Now, after watching s-CRY-ed, I have a new reason to cheer.The intro credits blast a mixture between a Mexican mariarchi band and jazzy rock number.  You find yourself head bobbing while being caught up in character profiles and fight scenes.  You\'re hooked before the first word is ever spoken.  And then the series begins.Right off the bat, you are introduced to our main lead character, Kazuma.  He\'s not your typical hero....This guy is a fighter, not a lover.  He doesn\'t care about anyone.  He doesn\'t care about anything.  Hell, he doesn\'t even care about himself.  He just lives for the next chance to knock someone out.  Does that sound like the greatest lead character ever??  Trick question.  If you answered no, you\'re an idiot.  Kazuma makes this series a spectacular journey.Sure there is a plot involved.  Two opposing factions battle for what they believe in to be right.  Is either one right or wrong.  NO!!!  But who are you going to be pulling for.  The bad ass kid from the wrong side of the tracks (Kazuma), or the spoiled rich kid who\'s perminantly ""on the rag"" (Ryuho).It\'s the characters that truely make this a series worth not only watching, but owning as well.  And I am not just referring to our protaginist.  Sure he\'s cool, but the supporting cast is just as awesome.  Each one has a ""power"" not seen in other ""power"" shows.  You know the ""powers"" I\'m talking about.  Invisible, strong, mind control, speed, transformation etc.  Boring and overused.  These kids have unique physical attributes that make them stand out from the others.  One can control a situation by writing it into a play.  One summons a 20 foot pistol.  One turns everything into water.  Different and one of a kind powers.  Another bonus.The art style is your typical 90\'s art...AWESOME!!!  Simple character designs and spectacular backdrops leave the eye wanting for nothing.  The color schemes chosen for outfits and uniforms not only fit each character, but bring the character to life.  They gives each one purpose and matches their personality perfectly.As for the animation, another genius work of art.  This show is plastered with some of the coolest and most addictive fights in anime history.  You get to see how all your favorite characters stack up against our main dueling dude and watch them get pulvoristed.  I don\'t mean to spoil anything, but he never losses.All this being said, the show is not perfect.  The plot is a little weak, some of the characters look and feel a little generic and one diminsional, and they could have finished the series (I strongly repeat COULD have) on a better note by ending the series an episode early.  But these are very minor flaws.All in all, if you love watching a good fight and love pulling for the underdog, this series is for you. This guy is a fighter, not a lover.  He doesn\'t care about anyone.  He doesn\'t care about anything.  Hell, he doesn\'t even care about himself.  He just lives for the next chance to knock someone out.

Ryman's Club,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50185/Rymans_Club,"['""To Succeed In Life You Must Learn From Failure""why is this quote used in my review? Well it relates to the theme of this anime which I\'m going to make an opinion on so that answers your question hopefully.This review is going to be divided into 4 sections that correlates to the Story, Art, Sound, Character and Conclusion:PLOTWhen it comes to the conventional idea of sports anime there is always that one main idea of reaching for your goal or to become the best in the world. Well the plot in this case is somewhat in that line but let\'s just say it\'s a bit...more... unique per say. This is a badminton anime which of course is rare to the sports genre as it has been a very very long time since we ever got one. The plot is overall really compelling because the main character, otherwise known as Mikoto Shiratori want to learn from his past incidents and turn it into a great success for him both mentally and physically.ARTNo question that when it always comes to sports anime they always have this raw essence of great 2D/3D transitional movement in their characters and overall animation. This anime here, Ryman\'s Club is another one of them. It clicks every time I see a shuttle being hit by the backside of a racket which oozes my hearing aids oh so well. Trust me this anime is something else...SOUNDThe music in this show is pretty good, otherwise great. I have nothing else to say other than that really because this anime is already too good in terms of the plot perspective.CHARACTERSOOOO RELATABLEMikoto Shiratori was fired from his previous acadmy called Mitsuhoshi Bank. Despite being mentally broken down another academy called Sunlight Beverage wanted to recruit him.MENTAL HEALTH is a big factor when it comes to main protagonists and how they challenge or learn from dire situations. This MC is no different because he has to go through a transition. Not only does he do that but also he has to work in the sales department of the company by day. This is really a stressful thing to do in terms of focusing on two things in your life but... Mikoto is built different. Wanna know why Sherlock Holmes?Reason 1:MIKOTO OVERALL LOOKS BACK TO HIS PASTReason 2:HE LEARNS FROM HIS MISTAKES WITHIN THAT PAST AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM NEXT TIMEReason 3:HE LEARNS FROM FAILURE FROM THAT PAST TO TURN IT INTO A SUCCESS FOR THE PRESENTReason 4:HE LEARNS TO VIEW LIFE IN A DIFFERENT WAY REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE CHALLENGES MAY BEReason 5: HE\'S BADASSAnd that my fellow anime fans is what I love about Ryman\'s Club""Mental Health is not a destination, it\'s a process. it\'s not about how you drive but most importantly where you are going overall""CONCLUSIONI love this anime. It hits different than any other sports anime that I have ever seen thus far.

Combine that with a sport like badminton and the determination and conviction Mikito, Tatsuru, and the other characters have, it makes the show all the more enjoyable.Is this the most accurate rep of badminton? No, not by a longshot. (the same can be said with other sports anime) Is it enjoyable? Yeah, I would say so if you throw your suspense of disbelief out the window and enjoy it for what it is.When I first heard about it, what intrigued me the most was that it's a sports anime with...a cast of adults. And not just adults, but salarymen. And both Mikito and Tatsuru gave me good impressions at first glance so I stuck around and I'm glad I did.What makes Salaryman's Club stand out to me was the combination of corporate work and badminton. I like when sports anime has lots of slice-of-life aspects mixed in with the competitive scene of sports because it gives the characters more time to be themselves and live out their lives. It's a nice break in pace as well as letting us see more of the character's personal lives outside of sports. I was invested in how Mikito, Tatsuru, and the rest of the gang worked to make beverages and the shenanigans that ensued. And when they were playing badminton, I was hooked on how competitive it was.Speaking of, I never thought I would get so into a sport like badminton but I did. Each match, whether it was a practice match or a competition, I loved how each time, our boys were so determined to not only win but try their best and improve on their weaknesses. Seeing them rise and fall felt so believable and how they reacted to certain events or insecurities felt all the more real. This is what makes Salaryman's club so great.Mikito and Tatsuru were by far the best part of the anime. They're complete opposites in every way but its their differences that makes them a pretty great team, both on and off the field. Tatsuru is more relaxed and carefree and Mikito is more reserved and somewhat aloof but what they have in common is getting the job done and doing their best. Mikoto does have the tropes of being a skilled player held back by trauma, but as the series goes on, he does grow in trusting himself and Tatsuru. As for Tatsuru, he really was my favorite. He may seem carefree but underneath that exterior is a man who cares for the team.As for the art and animation, it was done exceptionally well during the matches. The fast movement of the players, their swings, and the shuttlecock, all of it was sublime. Aside from the animation, I did like the art style of how the characters looked, making them distinct and pleasant to look at. (Looking at you, Tatsuru)I only had one qualm with the anime.The other characters of the Sunlight Beverage team are good characters and they have good enough screentime. The issue is that when they have their time in the spotlight, they become somewhat one-note after. Even some of their rival teams can be categorized as having one distinct personality and nothing else. I think the worst would have to be Usuyama. He reminds me of those characters in an RPG that joins the party last and doesn't get that much development before they fight the final boss or an optional party member. Weird analogy, I know, but that's what he felt like to me. I didn't find him all that interesting and even though we do get a brief backstory with him, it was short and almost forgettable. There were some stand-out rivals but for the most part, some don't have much going for them.Overall, Salaryman's Club is simple yet effective. It does what it sets out to be, a sports anime with corporate life. It's easy to watch and very much enjoyable. Definitely recommend it. a cast of adults. And not just adults, but salarymen.

Definitely recommend it."", 'What do you think of when you put badminton and animation together? Do you get bad-ass badminton with fast-paced action and pristine quality at its best? If this is what you\'re thinking, then welcome onboard, because studio Liden Films is back at the badminton animation game once again with Ryman\'s Club a.k.a Salaryman\'s Club, a portmanteau of the corporate work life and the actual sports club that actually exists in Japanese culture. Combined with the impressive work of Liden Films that badminton is the ONLY sport that this studio does produce right.But in order to understand Ryman\'s Club, you have to first understand how it...works. The Island of the Rising Sun is no short of unique things like these, and this is integrated in Japanese culture as the so-called ""Club Badminton"" that is in the same way, most of the club players are also employees (or salarymen in Japan\'s context) at the company they represent, so they\'ll be guaranteed lifetime employment after they retire from badminton. They would still be able to work for the club\'s sponsor company which is usually major companies (NTT East, Tonami, Nihon Unisys to name a few), they receive monthly salary just like all other employees in the company, which makes it different from pros in other parts of the world who mostly earn from prize money, sponsorship deals, endorsement, commercials, national caps salary etc. while Japanese players have stable income (salary from club company) on top of sponsorship deals, endorsements, national caps salary, commercials and prize money (while players from other countries could get most of their prize winning, Japanese players will receive theirs after a cut from the national badminton association). Some interesting tidbits worth sharing since the idea behind Ryman\'s Club is from one that has been existing for quite a long time in Japan.In Ryman\'s Club, we get 4 teams which are fictional portmanteaus of the real-life companies:- Sunlight Beverage (Suntory Beverage & Food);- Tomari Transport (Yamato Transport, only replace the two cats logo with a lion);- Unisics (Universal Music with their logo being inspired from Asics); and- Mitsuhoshi Bank (Mizuho Bank with their logo being inspired from both Mizuho and Mitsubishi).But the story itself is bog-standard that\'s conceptualized out of someone\'s performance boot and dark history that got him out of his former company, and right into a fresh new company whom recruited this same person to play on their team. This person is Mikoto Shiratori, a badminton prodigy with the ability of foresight, and someone whom went through his own dark episode from young times of playing doubles and causing his teammate to get injured, to playing for one of the top-ranked companies (Mitsuhoshi Bank) and only to get the boot because ""failure is not an option"". His next venture into Sunlight Beverage is a means for a re-start at getting his life together, but not before he\'d meet his future partner: Tatsuru ""the Badaryman"" Miyazumi, his boss and doubles partner, whom had been drunk the day before his first official day at work, only to resurface his PTSD of his young badminton days when he was about to let go of his past behind. Being a relentless request from Tatsuru himself, Mikoto is introduced to the SunBev team of Coach Yasuomi Ono, Koki Takeda, the Saeki brothers Toya and Sota, and their formerly team ace Toru Usuyama of the East, and therein sets the journey to overcome past traumas and be a better team through teamwork. Believe me, it sounds simple, but it does the entry-level job application enough.Of course, how can you have protagonists without antagonists, and there are a fair few bit of players within the same reign of issues that they face. The only few people whom have a backstory to them are the doubles team of Mikoto and Tatsuru, along with Usuyama, and they exist from the strongest adversary team ever: Mitsuhoshi Bank. Mikoto\'s history with the team with the Bakugo-like character of Takuma Kirishima; Tatsuru\'s history of playing with Izumo Naohiro as a doubles team (before Mikoto made his entrance); and Usuyama of the East and Ibuki Sentaro of the West, the team singles aces which have an extensive history behind them to face off for years before the former would quit and sacrifice his badminton to focus on his work and family. Mikoto also has Tomari Transport\'s Azuma Tachibana as a former player of his young badminton team, whom is there to check up on Mikoto when he got back in the groove of playing badminton for another company\'s team. Other than that, the requirement of 6 players per company team creates the same derivative that you would expect of any sport that needs a minimum amount of players just to play ball. Again, simple story, backed by simple characters and intended motives, nothing to really complain if the execution is done decently.You know the drill: when it comes to sports shows, studios like Production I.G. and MAPPA have made a name for themselves adapting high-profile shows like Haikyuu! and Yuri!!! On Ice respectively. And Liden Films have also made a name for themselves when the studio produced Hanebado! back in Summer 2018, proving that they ARE the go-to studio for badminton anime adaptations turned into beautiful and striking sakuga animation. And 3.5 years later, we\'re seeing the same with Tokyo Revengers episode director Ami Yamauchi and Sarazanmai series composer Teruko Utsumi\'s work, which thankfully other than the missteps of Hanebado! in the story department, this works great and hand-in-hand with the overall package. If there\'s a strong department in this show, Liden Films has done it once again to deliver good performance.And what\'s a good series if it doesn\'t have good music, and this bumps the extra atmosphere with the show to good effect. Given Mafumafu\'s musical calibre, I don\'t really need to mention if you\'ve heard a good 2 or 3 songs that this Vocaloid producer has produced, but it\'s Novelbright\'s OP that really slaps. A double thumbs up.Ryman\'s Club is what I like to call: simplicity at its finest. In every predictable twist and turn, there\'s the direction from Ami Yamauchi with the skills learnt from Tokyo Revengers to twist things on its own shuttlecock and racket, so going into this series being her debut directorial show, I\'d say she accomplished a work well done to keep it simple, working and executed properly.This is a well-rounded show, all things considered. works. The Island of the Rising Sun is no short of unique things like these, and this is integrated in Japanese culture as the so-called ""Club Badminton"" that is in the same way, most of the club players are also employees (or salarymen in Japan\'s context) at the company they represent, so they\'ll be guaranteed lifetime employment after they retire from badminton. They would still be able to work for the club\'s sponsor company which is usually major companies (NTT East, Tonami, Nihon Unisys to name a few), they receive monthly salary just like all other employees in the company, which makes it different from pros in other parts of the world who mostly earn from prize money, sponsorship deals, endorsement, commercials, national caps salary etc. while Japanese players have stable income (salary from club company) on top of sponsorship deals, endorsements, national caps salary, commercials and prize money (while players from other countries could get most of their prize winning, Japanese players will receive theirs after a cut from the national badminton association). Some interesting tidbits worth sharing since the idea behind Ryman\'s Club is from one that has been existing for quite a long time in Japan.In Ryman\'s Club, we get 4 teams which are fictional portmanteaus of the real-life companies:- Sunlight Beverage (Suntory Beverage & Food);- Tomari Transport (Yamato Transport, only replace the two cats logo with a lion);- Unisics (Universal Music with their logo being inspired from Asics); and- Mitsuhoshi Bank (Mizuho Bank with their logo being inspired from both Mizuho and Mitsubishi).But the story itself is bog-standard that\'s conceptualized out of someone\'s performance boot and dark history that got him out of his former company, and right into a fresh new company whom recruited this same person to play on their team. This person is Mikoto Shiratori, a badminton prodigy with the ability of foresight, and someone whom went through his own dark episode from young times of playing doubles and causing his teammate to get injured, to playing for one of the top-ranked companies (Mitsuhoshi Bank) and only to get the boot because ""failure is not an option"". His next venture into Sunlight Beverage is a means for a re-start at getting his life together, but not before he\'d meet his future partner: Tatsuru ""the Badaryman"" Miyazumi, his boss and doubles partner, whom had been drunk the day before his first official day at work, only to resurface his PTSD of his young badminton days when he was about to let go of his past behind. Being a relentless request from Tatsuru himself, Mikoto is introduced to the SunBev team of Coach Yasuomi Ono, Koki Takeda, the Saeki brothers Toya and Sota, and their formerly team ace Toru Usuyama of the East, and therein sets the journey to overcome past traumas and be a better team through teamwork. Believe me, it sounds simple, but it does the entry-level job application enough.Of course, how can you have protagonists without antagonists, and there are a fair few bit of players within the same reign of issues that they face. The only few people whom have a backstory to them are the doubles team of Mikoto and Tatsuru, along with Usuyama, and they exist from the strongest adversary team ever: Mitsuhoshi Bank. Mikoto\'s history with the team with the Bakugo-like character of Takuma Kirishima; Tatsuru\'s history of playing with Izumo Naohiro as a doubles team (before Mikoto made his entrance); and Usuyama of the East and Ibuki Sentaro of the West, the team singles aces which have an extensive history behind them to face off for years before the former would quit and sacrifice his badminton to focus on his work and family. Mikoto also has Tomari Transport\'s Azuma Tachibana as a former player of his young badminton team, whom is there to check up on Mikoto when he got back in the groove of playing badminton for another company\'s team. Other than that, the requirement of 6 players per company team creates the same derivative that you would expect of any sport that needs a minimum amount of players just to play ball. Again, simple story, backed by simple characters and intended motives, nothing to really complain if the execution is done decently.You know the drill: when it comes to sports shows, studios like Production I.G. and MAPPA have made a name for themselves adapting high-profile shows like Haikyuu! and Yuri!!! On Ice respectively. And Liden Films have also made a name for themselves when the studio produced Hanebado! back in Summer 2018, proving that they ARE the go-to studio for badminton anime adaptations turned into beautiful and striking sakuga animation. And 3.5 years later, we\'re seeing the same with Tokyo Revengers episode director Ami Yamauchi and Sarazanmai series composer Teruko Utsumi\'s work, which thankfully other than the missteps of Hanebado! in the story department, this works great and hand-in-hand with the overall package. If there\'s a strong department in this show, Liden Films has done it once again to deliver good performance.And what\'s a good series if it doesn\'t have good music, and this bumps the extra atmosphere with the show to good effect. Given Mafumafu\'s musical calibre, I don\'t really need to mention if you\'ve heard a good 2 or 3 songs that this Vocaloid producer has produced, but it\'s Novelbright\'s OP that really slaps. A double thumbs up.Ryman\'s Club is what I like to call: simplicity at its finest. In every predictable twist and turn, there\'s the direction from Ami Yamauchi with the skills learnt from Tokyo Revengers to twist things on its own shuttlecock and racket, so going into this series being her debut directorial show, I\'d say she accomplished a work well done to keep it simple, working and executed properly.This is a well-rounded show, all things considered.', 'I love badminton. I played it at a highly competitive level for almost 7 years of my life, commuting an hour to my club 5 times a week where I dedicated buckets of sweat and even more hours to a sport I loved. Unfortunately, many people frown upon badminton. It’s a tricky sport to play, which makes it trickier to understand and appreciate. So it doesn’t come as a surprise that of all the sports out there that anime could cover, badminton is one of the most underrepresented. That’s why I’m grateful for shows that push badminton into the spotlight, because it’s truly one of...the best sports out there.But that’s also why I’m very disappointed with Ryman. Just like Hanebado, there was a lot of potential it could live up to. But unlike Hanebado, it fell flat on its face much more quickly and much more heavily in a way that makes the show extremely tough to watch, not only as a badminton fan, but also as an anime fan.I think a basic requirement for sports anime is serviceable (get it) animation. Haikyuu is a perfect example. Its first few seasons? Great animation which elevated everything else. The last 2 seasons? Piss-poor animation which drags everything down. Even Hanebado, which had such boring attempts at melodrama, horribly faked conflicts, and lacklustre characters, was still an enjoyable watch thanks to its amazingly accurate (within sports anime ofc) portrayal of the sport and the stellar animation.Is Ryman’s animation any good? No. It’s horrible. You rarely see any rallies aside from the final few episodes. Instead, they’re cleverly cut to make you think shits going on but really its just lack of animation/budget/effort. And even when they do animate “epic” jump smashes, diving saves, or clever net play, the animation is so fucking stiff, I don’t even know if it’s handanimated or done with CGI. Ruins the immersion in the sport when you see janky limbs making janky shots.And without good animation to prop it up, Ryman just becomes a hard-to-believe, angsty story. I’m not even gonna touch on the attempts at a “story” because it’s just quite sad.Don’t get me started on the inconsistencies either. There’s supposed to be “powers” like foresight, but only MC has it. We’re also supposed to believe the power structure they have set up: an Olympic/top BWF calibre player can be bested by 2 bums? Very nice. Instead of tapping entirely into super fantasy like Kuroko or plausible realism like Hanebado, Ryman tries to have its cake and eat it too. Ultimately, it ends up falling short here as well, just like everywhere else in the series.But I think Ryman’s biggest fault is its refusal to properly elaborate on the complex strategies that are actually behind the sport. Shot selection, location, angle, speed, footwork, pace of play, and coordination with your partner. Just applying these to singles alone is complex enough, but it gets even crazier in doubles. Because Ryman chooses to dumb the narration/discussion down, what you’re watching is just a watered-down, unexciting version of badminton. Sure shots are going here and there, but why? How, why, and when do players change their tactics and strategies? Instead the explanation you get is “How about I attack you instead!” or “He’s using that devil drop, killer!” I get that you’re trying to make it cool and all, but really it just sounds lame because people who don’t play badminton won’t have a clue what’s going on and people who actually know enough about badminton will be even more confused as to what the fuck is going on.3/10 for being a bad anime overall. +5 for showcasing badminton, my favourite sport. -5 for ruining badminton, my favourite sport. the best sports out there.But that’s also why I’m very disappointed with Ryman.

(I think) Also, sorry for the bad English, It's not my native language!My first ever review, oh boy here we go. After the mess that was Hanebado, it looks like LIDENFILMS is going for a more relaxed approach to this Original anime which is also based on badminton.There are only 3 episodes so far so I can't say much but so far, this anime is FAR, FAR better from Hanebado. Now, bear in mind this is my own opinion, you might like it, you might not, personally for me, I love it so far! I'll edit it once more once the anime...ends.Now let's start!(Story - 7)Nothing special, a former prodigy with a traumatic past that hinders his skills in baseball is laid off from one of the top badminton work teams (did I use the correct term?). He comes back to his hometown and was hired by Sunrise Beverage Co. as a salaryman and badminton player, there's nothing much separating it from other sports animes that I know, but generic isn't always bad especially when done right, as a matter of fact, I'm really happy that it's a sort-of cliched anime. I don't know much about badminton so I can't comment much on that part of the story but the slice of life part is wonderfully paced for an Original anime, the quirky everyday lives of the characters are so contrasting to the serious setting in the matches but is still very much enjoyable and I'm all in for it. Can't wait for the story to progress more and more!(Art - 8)It's LIDENFILMS, usually a hit or miss for me, but this one's a hit. The animation looks clean and fluid (but that's probably because they also did Hanebado) and I love it, the art style looks so good as well, not much to say about it except that it's simple, but it's good!(Sound - 9)Congratulations to Novelbright for getting their first anime op performance ever, and they delivered! The opening perfectly encapsulates the feeling of the anime, and Novelbright just never misses, I just love Yudai Takenaka's vocals. As for the ed, how can I NOT love this, it's made by mafumafu, who I am a HUGE fanboy of, and hearing him sing the ed just made me fall off my chair in happiness haha. As for the OST and SFX, they're all good! They fit the scenes they're part of and elevate that scene as well, whether it's a drunk roasting session, or a serious badminton match, the ost just sets the mood! It's not the best by all means, but for this type of anime, it's really good. (how many times have I already said this?)Oh and don't forget the VA's, they really bring their characters alive here!(Character - 8)Each of these characters is very different, A traumatized prodigy, a strong drunkard, A high-school friend, A gamer, and a very reliable co-worker, the main characters are all loveable and the support characters are cool too! Hope to see these characters flesh out more.(Enjoyment - 10)I love this, do I need to say more?(Overall & final remarks - 8)Now, I'm usually wary of Original animes because they can be a bit... iffy. But honestly, I'm loving it so far, like I said earlier, the pacing is good and everything else just fits like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, that's all! I honestly never expected to write a review since I'm always anxious about what other people may think of me but honestly, I enjoyed this anime enough to give it my first review.

I get Run with the Wind vibes from this.

Each character already has their unique ""thing"" and I hope they get fleshed out beyond those roles as we go along.The voice acting is great. (There are some notable Haikyuu!

The action animations are poor as well because they are rushed and lack the build up to make you really excited for the matches. Usually, sports anime will also teach you about the sport and that was lacking as well. If it were just a sports anime I would have dropped it midway.From a work life anime perspective, I feel...like they really just did a shallow copy of corporate work that just feels hollow for the most part.

That\'s what I like to say.. Not 100% true, but isn\'t wrong either.First of all, this is the first badminton anime I have ever watched. Being a huge fan of badminton sport (I used to play it when I was in elementary and middle school, but growing up I kinda stopped playing since I had to focused on something else) that I follow any badminton tournaments on TV. So, when I found out they finally made a badminton anime (I know this isn\'t the first, but this is the first I\'m interested in), I have to watch it.To...my delight, this anime also set up in workplace instead of school, unlike most sport animes. I mean, I like sport animes so much but most of them are setting up in school (which I could relate to 10 years ago), but now I\'m a working adult so I feel kinda disconnected whenever I watch sport anime (guess I envy the character\'s youth, ha!). Hence, I was super excited when I knew about this anime!Anyway.. On to the review~I was expecting the anime would focus on technical aspects of badminton sport, but it is not. As a fan of badminton, I\'m not a stanger to the game and its terms.. But I can say that those who aren\'t fans of badminton will follow the game and its terms easily. Since this anime is setting up in workplace, there will be conflicts and issues related to the workplace that the characters have to solve. This is something I\'m looking forward actually.The characters are adults in early 20s to early 30s, so they have responsibilities outside their ""hobbies"". Yep! Some people think just because they\'re working adults now, their interests in sport is just meaningless hobbies which is wasting their time. Must I remind you this badminton team is part of corporate team so they\'re workers on the corporate they are represented. That is why I said what I said at the top--this is a grown up sport anime.So far, the anime is only focused on 4 corporates teams.. And for some reasons, all characters from those different workplaces are linked one way or another. This is also the caused of some conflicts.With only 12 episodes, I feel the anime is lacking on the depth of relationships between each characters (I mean it\'s there, but I feel like they\'re just grazing the surface). I think they can be explored more if the anime got at least 16 episodes. I would love to watch it if they had 25 episodes! Isn\'t it saying enough how I like this anime?In my opinion..The story is very good (can be explored more),The art is good (can be improved here and there, but I like the variety of art style on this anime!),The sound is very good (both Seiyuu and sound effect are very good--especially the sound of shuttle being hit! -- it\'s therapeutic),The character is good (should be developed and explored more for the emotional depth),The enjoyment is GREAT! I will totally re-watch this!So, it\'s totally very good overall~~ I highly recommend it!Based on the last episode, the possibility of season 2 is high. But who knows? If so, hopefully it will be soon. my delight, this anime also set up in workplace instead of school, unlike most sport animes. I mean, I like sport animes so much but most of them are setting up in school (which I could relate to 10 years ago), but now I\'m a working adult so I feel kinda disconnected whenever I watch sport anime (guess I envy the character\'s youth, ha!). Hence, I was super excited when I knew about this anime!Anyway.. On to the review~I was expecting the anime would focus on technical aspects of badminton sport, but it is not. As a fan of badminton, I\'m not a stanger to the game and its terms.. But I can say that those who aren\'t fans of badminton will follow the game and its terms easily. Since this anime is setting up in workplace, there will be conflicts and issues related to the workplace that the characters have to solve. This is something I\'m looking forward actually.The characters are adults in early 20s to early 30s, so they have responsibilities outside their ""hobbies"". Yep! Some people think just because they\'re working adults now, their interests in sport is just meaningless hobbies which is wasting their time. Must I remind you this badminton team is part of corporate team so they\'re workers on the corporate they are represented. That is why I said what I said at the top--this is a grown up sport anime.So far, the anime is only focused on 4 corporates teams.. And for some reasons, all characters from those different workplaces are linked one way or another. This is also the caused of some conflicts.With only 12 episodes, I feel the anime is lacking on the depth of relationships between each characters (I mean it\'s there, but I feel like they\'re just grazing the surface).

It was something really easy to throw on in the background while I did other things. The animation wasn\'t particularly stunning and I could not pick the characters out of a line up if you put a gun to my head, but the storyline was gently compelling enough that I continued to hit \'next episode\' whenever the last one came to an end, and effectively got through the whole thing in one sitting. I also appreciated that they didn\'t try to...be more than they were; they weren\'t hoping for the Olympics or anything, so everything mostly got solved by the end. It was also refreshing to have an anime\'s cast largely be adults or close to, rather than high school/middle school kids.Would I rewatch? Probably not. I might recommend it to someone who enjoys sports anime with latent ""subtext"" though lol. be more than they were; they weren\'t hoping for the Olympics or anything, so everything mostly got solved by the end.

I thought it mixed the actual playing of the sport with regular life of a salaryman/badaryman really well. The character design is not my favorite, I'm still trying to figure out why and what I actually like lol. Oddly, the studio that made this, Liden Films, also animated Tokyo Revengers, a style I also didn't like but which looked different from Salaryman Club. Go figure. The depiction of movement, however was very good. There were, obviously, times when they took some liberties in...less crucial moments, but overall the animation of action I thought looked really smooth. I wasn't even bothered by the super digital looking slow-motion close-ups of the birdie striking the racquet.The protagonist, Shiratori, was a mix of Takeru from Run with the Wind and Haru from Free! Stubborn and obstinate, out for revenge on those who presumably wronged him, then swooped under the wing of an outgoing, gregarious senpai who shows him the real meaning of badminton and friendship!I did reeeeeeallly like that this was a show about adults, however young, with jobs. I feel like so many sports animes focus on school-aged and college kids (not unlike the two other shows I mentioned above). So it was refreshing to be shown a relatively new slice of life. I LOVED the main storyline of salaryman part of the show. Shiratori, a complete novice in the world of business, much less the beverage business, wins a pitch to create a new soda. Hilarity ensues. I frickin' lost it when the badminton team used SWOT analysis on Shiratori's idea. XD Also really laughed whenever the team went out drinking and Shiratori made a fool of himself. Also also really loved that everyone thinks Shiratori's favorite soda is the worst the company makes.The badminton itself I think is pretty good. I am familiar with the sport, having played it in gym class, but I didn't think the show was either too esoteric or too simple. As a said before the action was illustrated very well. They matches were generally pretty predictably but I have long since stopped expecting the unexpected when it comes to sports anime. That being said, there's an all-time, code geass-level twist in the last match. idc if you don't think it is, but it left my jaw on the floor lol.Overall not the best but def worth a watch for an fan of sports or salarymen. less crucial moments, but overall the animation of action I thought looked really smooth.

At least it suits my personal taste and I can't point out what's unpleasing.Characters: 8...Likable ones. Good.Enjoyment: 9Pretty nice, I enjoyed it, the animation was good, especially the matches, they’re entertaining. It’s like a typical sports show, but not boring. Well, and like many sports shows, somehow the last boss opponents would conveniently have a mental issue and not perform their best. Personally I don’t really a fan of that type, it decreases the fulfilment a lil bit. It reminds me of how Hanesaki in Hanebado beat Mashiko, who also coincidentally has some flashback over surpassing their brother. Or how Joe in Megalobox beat a Yuri who just underwent a torturous operation. Just to say, because I also think it’s inevitable  setting for the underdogs to win. Overall 7 out of 10, but I add 1 point cuz, yeah, my soft spot for SoL of growing teens/adults coming out if their shells in life and, of course, Badminton matches (damn I love seeing my fav sports in the spot light). If you expect something groundbreaking, or profound, deep stuff, maybe set your expectations lower. Expect it to be more of a Slice of Life, there’re heartwarming moments between the characters, and not a complex plot. If you can dig this kind light-hearted and “friendship” type of anime, then you can reserve it for a chill weekend. Likable ones.

I\'ll admit, it\'s your typical sport anime, with life lessons and character development and tense moments. You\'ll find the same character tropes and the same kind of drama.But, it still does it well. In just 12 episodes you\'ll find that you actually like pretty much every single character. They speed run some things and at times it\'ll feel rushed, but the attachment was still there. There were some moments I wouldn\'t have been able to predict even if I tried, so it kept me guessing until...the end.Watch enough sports anime and you\'ll pretty much have watched all of them. But that doesn\'t take away from the enjoyment of good, well-developed ones. Ryman\'s Club feels like it\'s targeted at an older audience. Just slightly. The work-play balance is a pretty clear theme. Although understandably, the anime does teeter towards play a lot more. But you might find that you\'re watching this at just the right time, when you think you\'ve moved past things you had a passion for and ""grown up"". You\'ll find characters at totally different life stages and totally different situations, that it does make it slightly different to other sports anime.It\'s a solid 8, maybe just shy of a 9. Highly recommend, and hopefully there\'s a season 2. The ending definitely hinted at one. the end.Watch enough sports anime and you\'ll pretty much have watched all of them.

Although, I absolutely adore the sport, when another badminton anime gets announced aside from hanebado, I was excited. But to my point of view, ryman's club is just like your typical sports anime, but they added the workplace system to makes it more unique. Aside that, they really have nothing much going beside, but somehow it is more enjoying to watch than hanebado because most of the characters here are more mature. However the animation is mediocre, they animated the movement very strange in some parts and to my eyes, some even look...identical moves and they somehow bluffed the whole dynamic movements thing a little overboard I'd say. At the end of the day, the skills and movements are not the huge things portraying most sports anime, because they are just a fiction, but it would be nice to make them more accurate. 7/10, an enjoyable anime to relaxing and watch during the weekend, I'd recommend but don't look out for this anime as a serious one, it wouldn't serve you enough. identical moves and they somehow bluffed the whole dynamic movements thing a little overboard I'd say.

The team is a point of corporate pride and there are some contract bonuses for the employees who do it. I guess badminton is the right mix of skill but relative low impact on the body for players who are at least 22 and not getting pro-league contracts. Seeing that balance play out for Tatsuru...and Mikoto is fun to see, as while the sport has more focus that the work-related episodes, their job does define the context for everything else, as well as where they talk with each other.There aren't long rallies and writing doesn't do anything surprising for the characters. I don't know how to describe it well, but it felt like Haikyuu did better for its team. Those are the main issues, but it's still fun to get into and Tatsuru and Mikoto have the kind of relationship that makes it all work. It's got a fun OP, and for the kind of ending that wraps up everything nicely with a bow, it has a nice, light second season hook, nothing crazy, but leaves something interesting in the future if a second season comes around.

The author in general made a really poor effort to flash out the Badminton in this anime. What is the difference between official sport teams and workplace teams? Why are the two brothers apparently #1 and #2 in the world when...they a) get defeated by randoms and b) havent traveled internationally? Does only Japan exist in this world? They also do a poor job of explaining stuff like the S/J league. The workplace stuff was done a bit better, the MC producing a drink was a fun idea and executed well.Pacing:Also pretty bad. There never are any stakes in the show after MC gets over his trauma in like episode 5 or 6, which led to them having to introduce a new plot line of the other MC being framed of punching his boss 3 or 4 episodes before this anime ends just to make them accept a nonsensical bet that they have to WIN the tournament because otherwise there literally would have been no tention at all.Also they skip over some really interesting matches completely and only show the scoreboards which was a shame, im specifically referring to the match between pink haired guy and dad character who just came back from a hiatus, both were setup quite nicely before and the theme of old veteran vs rising star always makes for a good scenario.Characters:Kinda basic but still likable. MCs were fine, nothing special. The older one of the antagonist brothers and the white haired dude who left Sunshine Bav were probably the most interesting characters but there wasn't really anything interesting being done with them.

But being an adult, the toll life has already taken on your body can also show. You can get injuries you don\'t recover from as swiftly anymore, if you\'re gone from your sports for a while you may be gone for good. There also isn\'t any money in it if you\'re just doing it because... you can. No matter how good you are, it\'ll pretty much always be for fun only. Nevertheless, there is a lot of value to be found!Ryman\'s Club is clearly made by someone...who loves sports stories, but may not have loved that most of them end with a high school graduation. In those stories, the characters spend years together, growing as a team, chasing their dream of competing in a big torunament, if not the national one, but eventually, they\'ll have to graduate from school and ultimately enter the workplace. And much like Class S stories - in Japanese societies, dreams and ambition can often end with school. People are expected to be serious. And because of that, characters in these stories tend to treat the sport as everything that matters to them. Their entire life revolves around training, tournaments, or at best hanging out with their teammates. The matter of school usually takes the back line, maybe as a ""funny"" filler episode about how everyone\'s failing school and has to get back on track, or else they won\'t be allowed to continue playing. Characters can also get downright reckless when it comes to their health - neglecting sleep, training from dawn till dusk. They are pouring everything they have into their sport. Though once you\'ve graduated... where do you go from here? Like sure, once in a while a narrative about a single character and their career in their chosen sport comes to mind, but especially in more team-based stories, that\'s usually it. Maybe you get a cheeky future-episode about the characters meeting up, now having careers and familie and such, and that\'s about it.And to that effect, Mikoto, the first of the main two characters we\'re introduced too, might have as well come from one of those stories. He picked up badminton when he was a child, and even developed amazing observation skills because they help him perform better. He and even seeked a company known explicitly for its strong team - and was then prompty fired for underperforming at work.The show delights in having the coworkers in his new company point out to him that he IS supposed to be working and wasn\'t hired only so he could play in the corporate badminton team - forcing him out of his fixation on the sport and actually engage with his coworkers and team members, and, as a consequence, life as an adult overall. And from there, the show becomes a fun Sports-SoL-Hybrid and pretty much equally divides its episodes between the characters training, playing in tournaments and such, and having them work as salarymen for a beverage company. Selling products, developing new ones, marketing, getting drunk together and brainstorming... it\'s all here.  And with that groundwork, the show manages to present very human, if not terribly complex characters. Everyone gets their own arc about adult problems - like struggling to get back into an old hobby after your life changed with marriage and kids, comparing yourself to your siblings and how they were faring since graduation, struggling to fulfill your own potential. It\'s all a bit basic, but it helps greatly to acquaint the viewer to characters who may just mirror your own coworkers in many ways.And likewise, these characters have to mangage adult problems as well. They have injuries and insecurities to overcome, as well as responsibilities like a family, but approach them with the understanding and reasoning of an adult. They know they can\'t just run on a broken limb, they have to learn to adjust and allow themselves to heal, or to move on. They help each other out and talk - and not in a dramatic, overly emotional fashion. It grounds the show in realism - save for maybe two, three little things that seem just a tad too anime in parts.For example, the two main characters, Mikoto and Tatsuru, met when Mikoto was a child - they have a 10-year-gap - and that encounter inspired each other to keep on pursuing badminton. Tatsuru then found out about him, and convinced his manager to hire him which is just a tad bit odd. At that point, them meeting each other again throgh sheer coincidence, or because they\'ve been following the same path - like how Mikoto met his former middle school partner in a tournament again - would have perfectly sufficed. It\'s not a huge distraction by any means, but doesn\'t quite fit in with the more subdued nature of the other relationships in this one. And of course you have a climax with the future of the team at stake.But I found myself willing to look past all that because the rest of this show was just so pleasant. It\'s nice to see adults hanging out for a change. It\'s nice to see that you can enjoy and continue to be ambitious in your chosen sport even if your body may not be able to keep up as easily as when you were young.

I know nothing about badminton and care even less. But I am mesmerized by the depiction of corporate life and adult slice of life. I mean, it is the first time in which I ever saw anime characters do a SWOT analysis on green onion ginger ale, discuss what QA actually does, struggle with proposals and company politics.  It is not even exaggerated or amped up. It is almost dull. And, for some reasons, it feels more surreal than giant robots and magical girls transformation. I am loving the dissonance.The story is pretty simple for now, and...the main character is a bit of a downer, but I am looking forward some good character development on his part. He is also very young (he turns 20 soon into the series). On that note, I really like how the cast includes character of different ages, spanning from teenage years to mid 30s, and explore the diversity of adult friendship and camaraderie.At the moment I am not sure the series is my thing, exactly, but for sure it is an experience. An experience which I am enjoying, I have to say. I would like to see more? Is corporate anime a genre now?

SO this review POV is from an amateur without much technical knowledge on the sport. If you are the same, then please read ahead...In a nutshell, if you want to learn about the sport and it's technicalities, this is not the right anime for you. However, if you want to pass some leisure time, like sports in general and are a office worker, then I would suggest to try it out for the sake of it.Overall, it's a one-time...watch anime, so I would probably not think about this anime again in future. Which also means that the impact of this anime is not that huge.Art- The art style was average for me. The strangest part for me was that they failed to make the lead team members distinct in their physical characteristics. Quite a few characters have the same hairstyle, same facial features with a slight difference in hair tones. Honestly, in initial episodes, you might feel confused about which character is which if you are not paying enough attention. But you can tell, that the production team tried (in vain) to make as many characters pretty and flashy as possible.Story & characters- Overall, they did attempt to bring the story and plot together. However, when you mix two major professions, sports and office worker in an anime, it's important to keep the right balance of each aspect. One would think, how a salesperson who has one of the most tedious job that impacts your physical stamina would keep up in a continued basketball practice, especially when you are ageing. Well the anime does show the age aspect in certain characters. However, except a few of the main characters with just a slight glimpse in their past, the character development is extremely subtle, if any at all. The past is what makes a person into a sport that they could care about. For that, you will need to show the viewers enough to understand each character's personality and why they play the sport. It's crazy how one of the ML almost does not even get their past featured enough. This flaw in itself makes you fail to connect to the characters as you should be able to. The story itself is pretty rushed. Has quite a few obvious loopholes (that no one bothered to do anything about). Personally, it felt that enough thought or efforts was not put into the sport itself as it should deserve. We know barely anything about the rivals in the matches except for their relationship with the MLs and yet they failed to justify that relationship enough. [Personally, this fact itself made it a little frustrating and didn't grab my attention in any of the matches except the final game]. The series DOES NOT do justice to Badminton, DOES NOT show the intricacies of the sport and neither does it show enough of the matches that lead to the ultimate game. It's almost before you know it that the team reaches their last game.Music- Decent overall, but not particularly catchy.The whole anime overall just felt extremely rushed and half-assed efforts at presenting the sport and story. There might have been a budget issue, I don't know. But I can tell this much, the anime had potential if done right.Hence, I was simply glad the show ended without making me feel sorry that it did end. It failed to grab my attention and made me click next episode just to make it end. Nonetheless, the anime has it's comedic moments throughout, makes you like only 1-2 characters (for me Miyazumi), but it's not enough to make you last.So I will suggest that you watch this if you have enough time to spare. Or else, please do go for all the other amazing sports animes out there if you wanna watch something worth your while. watch anime, so I would probably not think about this anime again in future.

I say somehwat because although on paper it looks simple, there is more than what you see on TV or spectacting a live match in the gymnasium. Ryman's Club job was to illustrate elements & rules of the game in layman's terms but it didn't, the show didn't even need to spend an entire episode explaining the basics of badminton but instead throws you right in. Someone who has no idea what Badminton is would have no clue what was...going on screen, the lack of any actual badminton rallies further enforces that. If this was a purely Badminton sports Anime, this show would have gotten a much lower rating than a 6/10 and this is me being nice & lenient towards it.What compelled me to give it this score is because its simply just refreshing, seeing that almost all Sports Anime are set in High School, barring a few exceptions like Run with the Wind, Ryman's Club's setting in a corporate environment gives the viewer a different perspective of what older or mature people are like in Sports & just getting a sneak peak at the corporate world, even though the story overall very simplistic, to a fault actually.There was very little depth to the story, it is very predictable and stereotypical like for example Mikoto's backstory, while it is not inherently bad, I wish the show took time to explore it a little more in detail, not just throwing in flashbacks for the sake of it. The simplistic nature of the show also meant that the characters also weren't properly fleshed out. I feel as though good characters in Sports Anime particularly are important because it allows the viewer to be able to put themselves into the character's shoes & sympathize with them while also having a connection with said character. At the end of Ryman's Club, I didn't feel any sort of attachment to any of these characters, while I do understand & sympathize with their struggles and past trauma, I couldn't relate to them as much as other characters from other Sports Anime, like Haikyuu or Chihayafuru.Touching on visuals & animation here, I do like the artstyle of the show, its simple yet does the job as it appropriately portrays a slightly more mature yet laid-back setting (idk if I made sense there). The Animation could be better, there were some scenes in the Badminton rallies that were abit wonky when it came to joint movements especially, there were definitely some inconsistencies. But overally, the artstyle & animation get a pass, nothing groundbreaking but it gets the job done.Overall, Ryman's Club had a lot of potential as a Sports Anime with a different perspective/twist on it but it definitely failed in doing some of the basics of a Sports Anime & had defiencies in other areas. However, being someone who rates Anime based on pure enjoyment, I definitely did enjoy watching the show, for better or for worse or maybe my taste is too simple to the point where a simplistic show like this can dig enjoyment out of me. going on screen, the lack of any actual badminton rallies further enforces that.

For those who want a Shōnen sports anime with training arcs, an underdog mc and epik plays that require an in depth understanding of sports theory, I am terribly sorry but you arrived at the wrong place.Story (5)In the first 3 episodes Ryman's club has managed to introduce the characters not in any interesting way, create only one hook (being the main character's reluctant nature to play doubles) and showcase badminton for only 15 minutes or so (out of 3 episodes). Ryman's club is more of a...slice of life anime than a sports anime displaying the life of a salary man. The comedy is lacklustre and the characters do very little to make the life of a salary person at least somewhat interesting. I found myself crawling by the third episode only encouraged by the fact I could make this review if I finished the third episode. When there is badminton play on the screen, I was left utterly disappointed at the lack of depth Ryman's club showcased (not diving into any badminton theory and instead relying on a gimmick only the main character has). The action is heavily reliant on art and fluid animation, there is no story and the show has not got me invested in badminton itself. Pretty boys doing badminton living a life as a salary man, that's all you'll get watching the show.Art (8)The art is the only saving grace for this show. All their movements are coherent, fluid especially when they were playing badminton. I was impressed by how they animated the shuttlecock and integrated that with 2D animation.Sound (6)I'm not sure how to rate sound, there was nothing noteworthy. (Imo) the main character's voice was off putting at times (I'm not sure why xd)Character (5)All the character's were mediocre, they didn't carry any specific traits or stereotypes (which I think would've made them more appealing imo) but was just there to fill space. The main character was not your typical Shōnen protagonist but an emo boy who was traumatised because of something he did in the past. What makes Shōnen protagonist so fun is how they're an underdog and they beat everyone and everyone's shocked. What makes this protagonist so boring and a pain to watch is his ego and his reluctance to change his attitude and beliefs when someone points scrutinises them.Enjoyment (5)This slice of life was not what I wanted and in fact there are other slice of life + sports anime that execute this way better.

Thirty years later, the original story gets an alternate re-telling in the form of New Getter Robo. The question is, does it live up to the hefty getter name? For the most part, yes.The story of New Getter Robo is definitely not its forte. Rather than focusing on actual storytelling, the plot mostly just seems like an excuse to pit the three violent and near-psychotic men against legions unfortunate foes. While this may put off some viewers, it does make for plenty of screen time...featuring the getter team turning its enemies into bloody smears on the ground, with or without their trusty super robot. Think of New Getter Robo as a Power Rangers series that kids were never meant to watch -- if you like the monster-of-the-week feel that is light on the plotting, you should be able to enjoy what New Getter Robo offers.The characters, on the other hand, are definitely the strength of the series.

Sketch lines are used for shading, much like older anime series', but the use of thick lines in the rendering of each scene creates a bold sensation that makes it feel larger than life. However, though that animation is crisp and clean, the amount of detail is rather low. Background art never goes beyond being functional, the frame rate never enters the realm of smooth, and the transformation sequences are either reused or omitted. Though the style and limitations of New Getter Robo's animation certainly does add to the air of nostalgia, it does put the production value of the series into question.The amount of enjoyment derived from New Getter Robo depends strongly on  personal taste. If you enjoy shows of the super robot genre such as mazingkaiser and other Go Nagai classics, or if you just want some action that is light on thinking, New Getter Robo is definitely worth a look. But if the idea of watching three grizzled men in colorful tights fighting in a giant robot only evoke thoughts of ridicule in your mind, chances are, this is not for you. featuring the getter team turning its enemies into bloody smears on the ground, with or without their trusty super robot.

Shigurui,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2216/Shigurui,"[""Popular to contrary belief, Japan's Tokugawa (or Edo) period, wasn't all about fancy clothes and fairy tales at all. It was a time when honor and loyalty ruled in a man's world. Where women were treated as mere objects and held rather little to no power. And being formal with your enemies was as common as wielding a blade. This story basically follows the trials and tribulations of two warring clans rife with sex, lies, and deceit.Don't get me wrong, Shigurui isn't a complete historically accurate show, but it's damn close. Starting off with the music, its very reminiscent of something you would hear...straight out of a Japanese stage opera and sets the mood and pace perfectly for this show. If you turned off your monitor you swear you were watching a Japanese play unfold before your very ears its all a beautiful experience. Even the cold silence can emit a feeling unlike any other.The actual sound effects of the show are also very play-oriented. It's usually silent with the exception of the actors playing their role, but when there are sound effects they are  usually very subtle, environmental, sound effects like wind rustling, or flames snapping, or even the sound of gravel being undisturbed beneath a warriors feet. Less sound in this instance is good as it gives immerses the viewer in to such an intriguing drama.The voice acting are all top notch as well. I'm not a big fan of a mostly male seiyu cast, but all the voice actors play their part with such passion and seriousness that I am not very accustomed to. Albeit its not very hard to act as a badass or a madman with very little lines in every episode. Compared to all the cute loli anime being released in droves recently, this is a very welcome change of pace.From the beginning of the opening credits, one can already see that they are in for a visual treat. Its not often that you get to experience something like this. EVERY scene in this show is so beautiful that each cel can be a masterpiece in its own right. The background art is so pretty you swear you've seen the art off a history text or a museum its that immaculate. Even every camera angle has its own beauty and flair. To add to its historic feel colors are pretty limited to a neutral tone (brownish green tinge) more reminiscent of tapestry paintings of the time. Apart from the background art, the character art has its own beauty and uniqueness not found anywhere else. Each character (including stand-in's) are all drawn with the utmost care. Wrinkles, shadows, beards all drawn in with large detail. Each person looks completely unique from their eyes hair and face, all the way down to their clothing (with unique patterns and colors) and sandles. Little forewarning there are a lot of adult situations including violence and sexuality, but they are all there for reason. Even if its only there to show how brutal and harsh (yet elegant) the Edo period really was.The story itself is a rather hit and miss mostly because  of the &quot;Tarantino&quot; effect they did with the main story. After a few episodes you almost forget about the main story. But how they skillfully use art and sound and voice acting in every episode the viewer is more drawn to the situation at hand rather than what happened 4 episodes ago. It can be intriguing for some and a turn off for others. But I really appreciate the detail and accuracy they try to pull off with this show. Now I'm no expert in the Tokugawa period or Japanese history in general,  but I am a decent history buff and know more than enough to truly appreciate an epic such as this.For you kiddies expecting to watch something like bleach or samurai champloo or even Inyuasha, i highly recommend reading up on some good Japanese literature.  Namely, Amaterasu, List of Divinities, or Kojiki (they were required reading for my uni). Or wiki up some Tokugawa period history (specifically Kan'ei)  if you don't feel like reading up on such historic pieces. As for everyone else, I highly recommend watching this as this should be one of the best examples on how to do an artistic anime. Don't expect much in terms of pace, treat it like you were watching a stage play on your pc. One word of caution, be prepared to experience cold, brutal, reality straight out of a Japanese stage opera and sets the mood and pace perfectly for this show.

I'm not a big fan of a mostly male seiyu cast, but all the voice actors play their part with such passion and seriousness that I am not very accustomed to. Albeit its not very hard to act as a badass or a madman with very little lines in every episode. Compared to all the cute loli anime being released in droves recently, this is a very welcome change of pace.From the beginning of the opening credits, one can already see that they are in for a visual treat. Its not often that you get to experience something like this. EVERY scene in this show is so beautiful that each cel can be a masterpiece in its own right. The background art is so pretty you swear you've seen the art off a history text or a museum its that immaculate. Even every camera angle has its own beauty and flair. To add to its historic feel colors are pretty limited to a neutral tone (brownish green tinge) more reminiscent of tapestry paintings of the time. Apart from the background art, the character art has its own beauty and uniqueness not found anywhere else. Each character (including stand-in's) are all drawn with the utmost care. Wrinkles, shadows, beards all drawn in with large detail. Each person looks completely unique from their eyes hair and face, all the way down to their clothing (with unique patterns and colors) and sandles. Little forewarning there are a lot of adult situations including violence and sexuality, but they are all there for reason. Even if its only there to show how brutal and harsh (yet elegant) the Edo period really was.The story itself is a rather hit and miss mostly because  of the &quot;Tarantino&quot; effect they did with the main story. After a few episodes you almost forget about the main story. But how they skillfully use art and sound and voice acting in every episode the viewer is more drawn to the situation at hand rather than what happened 4 episodes ago. It can be intriguing for some and a turn off for others. But I really appreciate the detail and accuracy they try to pull off with this show. Now I'm no expert in the Tokugawa period or Japanese history in general,  but I am a decent history buff and know more than enough to truly appreciate an epic such as this.For you kiddies expecting to watch something like bleach or samurai champloo or even Inyuasha, i highly recommend reading up on some good Japanese literature.  Namely, Amaterasu, List of Divinities, or Kojiki (they were required reading for my uni). Or wiki up some Tokugawa period history (specifically Kan'ei)  if you don't feel like reading up on such historic pieces. As for everyone else, I highly recommend watching this as this should be one of the best examples on how to do an artistic anime. Don't expect much in terms of pace, treat it like you were watching a stage play on your pc. One word of caution, be prepared to experience cold, brutal, reality"", ""Do not drop this anime, endure a few episodes! (Assuming that you are aware that this one has maybe too much gore/blood/violence!).This anime has one of the greatest plots  I have ever seen (and not just anime), every scene is there for a reason and a part of the complete picture. So, from my! point of view Shigurui is underrated.Why?Let me tell you how I started to watch this one; I wanted to watch something with samurais in it and started to watch Shigurui as a coincidence.  The first episode was just awful, I did not liked it at all; too much blood,...too much violence(I even covered my eyes with my hands instinctively at some scenes). So at first it was just an anime that was tried to be made interesting using lots of unneccessary disturbing scenes, so I nearly dropped it but still there were some interesting things (or lets say unexpected character reactions) so I could not drop the series as a result... Next day I had nothing to do and so I took a deep breath and resumed watching it but after a while the general atmosphere of the anime got me very very interested. The story was very solid not to say disturbingly unique (due to the realistic reactions of the characters maybe;  not the usual either black or white characters but ones with shades). The art was top notch as the sounds (no music at every scene, sometimes just sound of cicadas -though I found them rather annoying-  but perfect both for reflecting the mood and complementing the plot).So before I realized, the series was over and I was awestructed, cause I did not get the ending at first. But after 5mins or so I started to remember scenes, scenes from first episode, scenes from 5 th or 9th episode and I just got it. It was like oh my gosh ( stupid sentence but describes my feelings precisely). So watch it till the end because the masterpiecycity (copyright at Guuguk) of the series is increasing exponentially.This is a very sophisticated anime which might be enjoyed by careful and patient viewers only, so take notes :), take a deep breath and complete the 12 episode in e few days (to avoid the 'baccano effect')So finally :) the process of watching was hard for me due to the high gore level but it was worth it! This is one of the stories that I will possibly remember for a long long time, not for the story itself but for how it was told...PS: I admit that I am not familiar with the 'actua'l Edo period (I learned a little bit in Kenshin though :) ) but still the value of the plot is unbelievable and it is just fiction right.I did not give examples from scenes and stuff, just to avoid giving any spoilers, which might really spoil the ' it was like oh my gosh' effect... too much violence(I even covered my eyes with my hands instinctively at some scenes). So at first it was just an anime that was tried to be made interesting using lots of unneccessary disturbing scenes, so I nearly dropped it but still there were some interesting things (or lets say unexpected character reactions) so I could not drop the series as a result...

To that end, I'll try to steer some poor souls away from trouble immediately by saying that Shigurui contains a massive amount of exceedingly gruesome gore as well as all manner of violent sexual predations, and in many cases  those two things appear onscreen simultaneously. If you have a strong aversion to the stomach-turning, you can probably just...continue on your merry way, because this show is two cuts above grotesque. That being said, I don't believe that art is under any obligation to be shiny and happy, and content of a violent and brutal nature doesn't necessarily make something “bad” (although, in this instance, the point is a little moot). But for anyone who remains undeterred, there is an actual review up ahead.To say that Shigurui has high production values would be an understatement. Even by the standards of the frequent overachievers at studio Madhouse, Shigurui is looking at “high production values” in the rearview mirror half a mile back. It's a shame that much of the show takes place in dimly lit dojos and huts, because the outdoor backgrounds are nothing short of gorgeous. I'll be blunt in saying that the character designs are repulsive—everything about them is exaggerated, and from their overblown facial features to their overly pale, shiny skin, they look more like wax caricatures of humanity than anything else. Given the show's general love of putting the disgusting on display, I'd wager that this is intentional, and while the designs aren't aesthetically pleasing, they're fitting, and their remarkable level of detail and consistency can't be denied. The one artistic aspect where Shigurui falls a tad short is the animation; on the rare occasions where fluid animation is actually present, it looks great, but unfortunately the series defaults more to blink-and-you-miss-it shortcuts and fades for its fight scenes, which are less than enthralling (more on that later).Shigurui is musically minimal. Most of the score consists of slower, more traditional Japanese music. Ominous drumbeats and strings are par for the course, sometimes punctuated by a deep, wailing chant. Atmospheric sound is common and used to good effect, with the old standbys of keening cicadas and chirping birds being the most noticeable. Some of the show's better music actually comes in the form of rhythmic folk songs sung by field laborers or village children as the samurai pass them by. To some degree, this befits both the setting and the “slow but violent under the surface” nature of the series.And now we come to the writing, which, for the most part, is where I lose the ability to say anything positive about Shigurui. For all of its artistry and its attention-garnering violence and sexuality, the plot is built on fairly typical samurai fare: In the present time, a swordsmanship tournament is being held. Facing each other are two decrepit samurai, one of them blind and one of them missing an arm. They are both students of the same school of swordsmanship, they have a historic rivalry with each other, and the rest of the series is a flashback that delves into that rivalry. Revenge, rivalry, and betrayal can be made powerful with a quality story and good characterization (see Berserk, Gungrave) but it just isn't so here. Shigurui's writers seem to be going for the “slow but deliberate” buildup, and as a result the story dawdles,  takes frequent forays into the backgrounds of characters and objects which have a minimal connection with the plot, and all the while fails to generate tension or momentum in any significant amount. A lack of complexity isn't always a bad thing, and good execution can take a simple plot, run with it, and make it compelling. But here is simplicity done wrong: Meandering, directionless, trying its hardest to pull something out of nothing and be more than it really is. Entire episodes could be skipped with minimal loss. You can practically see the seams where the plot is stitched together—in the first half of the show, someone is wronged, and in the second half, that someone seeks revenge in a methodical, predictable fashion while everyone else runs around like chickens with their heads cut off. The show's ending is somewhat fitting, but it's also anticlimactic in the first degree, and leaves many questions unanswered. It's insult to injury, and as a result, Shigurui's story is an absolute drag, a bloody, swerving run-on sentence with no period.Memorable characters could probably dig the show out of the hole, but to call Shigurui's efforts in that area “paper-thin” would be to short-change paper. The leads, Fujiki and Irako, are both tools of the plot, and they bend to its will in completely unreal turnarounds. Irako goes from “sinister, merciless, master swordsman” to “blubbering, defenseless idiot” seemingly at the drop of a hat, and Fujiki, originally the least offensive protagonist, develops into a brutal, sadistic shell of a man for what appears to be no reason whatsoever. Both characters have motivations that are either completely unknown (Fujiki) or laughably simple-minded and one-note (Irako). As previously mentioned, the show would rather spend time delving into shoddily introduced plot elements than fostering any sort of actual interaction between these two characters; it glosses over their development as fellow swordsmen completely, and in the end the root of their much-touted, show-spanning rivalry seems to be limited to “Irako beat Fujiki in a practice match this one time and then Fujiki punched Irako in the face.” They hardly ever speak to each other; the show seems to be going for effective minimalism in this aspect, but it falls short. We know almost nothing about the ideals of either man, and while they might have good reasons to kill each other, the truth is that they're both cold and simple characters to a nearly inhuman degree, and it's nearly impossible to care about them or relate to them in any sense. Add to that some terribly flat supporting roles who seem to exist for the dual purposes of dying gruesomely and killing time while the show struggles to reach the 12-episode mark and you get a lackluster cast that's utterly incapable of picking up the slack left by the similarly flawed story.In fact, Shigurui as a whole feels like the result of one big case of writer's block. That there's talent and effort poured into the series is beyond question—the near-flawless artistry, the attention to detail, and the willingness to show things that the audience might not want to see are all hallmarks of a strong creative team. It's even directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki, who managed to score a home-run with similar directorial style in the slow-but-powerful Texhnolyze. I've little doubt that if Shigurui's writing had been handled differently, the show could float above average, maybe even to greatness. I'm all for rooting for the underdog, and I'd love to be able to write a cute blurb along the lines of “despite its outward mask of grotesquely twisted sex and violence, Shigurui has numerous redeeming qualities...”...but, truthfully, short of the art and the general atmosphere, I just don't see anything worth praising. Shigurui has nothing to say. It has all of the means in the world, but no conceivable ends. It's completely without vision, and as a poor replacement for vision, it reaches onto the shelf and pulls out the book of sheer brutality and shock value. It's the angry pre-teen, screaming (admittedly creative) obscenities, hoping that others will mistake them for maturity. In a sort of sad irony, its positive aspects actually look retrospectively silly when coupled with its writing, like lipstick on a pig. The fight scenes, which amount to staring contests punctuated by swift blows delivered via animation shortcuts, could have been effective if there was any emotion brewed between the characters involved, but lacking that element, they ring hollow. The slow, traditional music and voice-over narration sound absurdly ham-fisted and out of place next to the needless sexual violence. Countless artistic shots of butterflies and cicadas, symbols of change and rebirth, are not a substitute for writing characters who actually undergo convincing development.  The show has zero self-awareness; at its best moments it's a halfway entertaining gut-spiller, and at its worst moments it's borderline BDSM smut, yet from start to finish it operates under the misleading pretense that it's an engaging work of art. In all walks of life it's best not to kid yourself, and I can't help but recommend that if you're going to make something as pointless and mind-numbingly gratuitous as this show, you could at least maintain some honesty about it. continue on your merry way, because this show is two cuts above grotesque.

It's a very serious anime.  No jokes, all business.2. There is brief full-frontal female nudity in almost every episode.  Sex scenes are brief, and are presented much like a slideshow of dim, still images.STRENGTHS:1. Production value is obviously very high.2. Story is solid as long as you watch the entire series within a relatively short span of time.  If you leave too much time between episodes, the story will be harder to follow.3. If you're in the mood for an intense, violent, and gory samurai anime, this is definitely the one for you.WHAT KEPT...IT FROM GETTING A HIGHER SCORE:I would have given it an 8 if it had a little bit of lightheartedness.  A hint of humor would have made the characters more likeable.  It would have made the story more interesting too.  I mean, c'mon, even the most serious of movies had a bit of comedy in them.I would have given it an 9 if the pacing had been a little faster.  The anime drags at times; especially since the director tried to make EVERY scene intense.  The minimalism of the soundtrack exacerbates the sluggishness sometimes.I would have given it a 10 if the story was exceptional, which it was not.  It ended up being a story of pride and revenge, which most people have seen before.  Still a pretty solid plot though.Recommended if you're in the mood for something really really serious.

obviously going to watch it but till i ended the other ones that i have listed but i was told that this was accurate on the dark side of the samurais and how despicable they were and how mature the art and story was, and i was convinced to watch this anime before the other ones.StoryStory is really mature, it's confusing at the beginning because there are a lot of flashbacks and you don't realise those are flashbacks at the moment but later when you are tying the...pieces together you get whtat's happening, may be boring for some people to see that the story advances slowly, but it has something addictive and keeps you watching the next episode, don't expect a happy story, is dark, in the first minutes after the OP of ep. 3, i was ''Oh no, everything but that kind of things'' but i knew what i was into so i kept watching it, the english name of the anime is Death Frenzy, so expect that in cruel ways, the bad thing is that they didn't conclude the story in the anime at least and that can be annoying for a lot of people and i saw it was Madhouse the king of ''Watch this unfinished ending by reading the manga,'cause 2nd season ain't happening son'', yeah they made this anime, and it was like with their 80% of animes they release, they don't make 2nd season, only for the other 20%, so i googled the parts that were not explained and how it ended, overall was great.Art & SoundThis two go hand to hand, the dense and dark atmosphere, with a mature art style and the fit music for the samurai theme with sometimes silent parts were great, i'm not fan of the gore, but i didn't mind at all the gore in this anime, because of the samurai theme, it makes sense, it was almost like this back in the era where not everyone were respectable samurais but there was the despicable ones, both Art and Sound were great.CharacterI can say that 99% of characters were really despicable, but that's why this is great, it makes you dislike them but at the same time like them a little (well maybe just Fujiki and Ushimata) and you get to see how different they were, i mean different ways of being despicable, Iwamoto and Irako being the most despicable characters, you have to see for yourself, they were great for a samurai setting, as i stated the thing is that they didn't clarify how was it that Fujiki lost the arm (NOT a spoiler the arm lost, you see him for the first time like that on Ep. 1, but they don't explain it) unless you google it or read the manga, and that's what i did to find out, overall was great.EnjoymentI really was able to enjoy this, being careful

This anime has a LOT of gore, a LOT of nudity and sexual violence, and doesn\'t exactly tackle its gloomy subject matter with artistic subtlety. Basically, imagine combining the 1990s OVA Ninja Scroll with elements of Rurouni Kenshin, Berserk, and some exploitation movie that the Cinema Snob would review! THAT is exactly what Shigurui feels like to watch! Despite all of this...I actually enjoyed this series. This is definitely not a series for everyone, but it has some positive elements that are truly worthy of praise.Story:The story starts in the year 1629 with a large kendo tournament using...real swords and matches to the death. This tournament is being held by the brutal tyrant Tadanaga Tokugawa, who is the younger brother of the shogun ruling Japan. Tadanaga was executed for his ""criminal insanity"" and is sort of like Japan\'s Caligula, so this tournament is not out of place with the kind of deeds commonly attributed to him by Japanese historians. However, that isn\'t to say that Shigurui tries to be 100% historically accurate. Shigurui will instantly remind viewers of the much more famous Rurouni Kenshin with legendary swordsmen standing around and waiting for their opponents to unleash the ""Super Secret Bullshit Technique"" of the ""Does not exist"" school of sword fighting. Shigurui is infamous for having so many rape scenes, but nothing gets raped worse than the laws of physics in this series! The 2 main fighters in the tournament are long time rivals and mortal enemies. The entire series is a flashback explaining their histories and all the bad blood between them. The main 2 characters are the samurais Fujiki and Irako. Both were once students of universally feared Kogan School of Kendo, which was run by a brutal and completely insane old man named Kogan Iwamoto. Irako was blinded and exiled from the school for cheating with Kogan\'s mistress and now wishes to annihilate the entire school for revenge. Fujiki is loyal to the school and wishes to get revenge on Irako for killing everyone it it besides him. That\'s the entire plot! Also this is a condensed adaptation that didn\'t want to create its own ""filler ending"" so instead it just abruptly ends in the middle of the story! What makes the series interesting is its action, music, portrayal of history, artwork, and believe it or not the questions that it asks!Characters:The 2 main characters have commonly been compared to Guts and Griffith from Berserk and although this was actually based off a novel far older than Berserk, I can REALLY see why people would say that. Fujiki is a one armed swordsman who is loyal to a fault and against his conscience will carry out brutal deeds if ordered. Fujiki lives on for the sole purpose of getting revenge on Irako for killing all of his friends. Irako is a highly effeminate, Machiavellian bastard that wears lipstick. Irako was born to the lower class, but he is extremely ambitious and charismatic, willing to kill anyone and everyone to rise to the top. However, here is where the similarities end! Fujiki may feel sort of bad for following terrible orders, but he would never quit his master like Guts did after Griffith ordered him to assassinate the Duke. Guts would never follow an order to hurt someone he cares about, while Fujiki willingly held down a girl he liked so another man could rape her. Guts shows a lot of strong emotions and is a Byronic Hero, while Fujiki is NOT portrayed as a hero at all. Fujiki is frequently called a ""puppet"" with no will and ambition of his own, and this is honestly accurate. Irako may share similarities to Griffith, but the show never at any point attempts to make the viewer admire Irako. Griffith has his many ""magnificent bastard"" moments when the viewer is awed by his cunning, intelligence, and skill. Griffith also was shown in Caska\'s flashbacks to have at one time been a fairly decent person that sort of cared about the lives of his men. Irako is a straight up evil motherfucker. This guy laughably murders a kitten for absolutely no reason! He randomly murders prostitutes and only joined the Kogan School to ""drain everything it had and move on"". To top it all off, he\'s not even very cunning and is only the 4th best fighter in the series! His revenge only succeeded as well as it did due to random outside help combined with dumb luck. He hires someone to poison the # 3 best fighter, beats the #1 fighter by backstabbing when he was distracted, and gets his ass kicked by the #2. There are some other characters with potential, but the 2 scorned and revenge obsessed female characters don\'t have enough development. Kogan is a sick old fuck who happens to be freakishly strong, much like Wyald from the Berserk manga. There is a reason Wyald keeps getting cut out of the adaptations! He is a plot device, not a well developed character. Now on to the things this anime really does well!Art:Shigurui was animated by Studio Madhouse and it looks absolutely fantastic! Japanese characters actually fucking look Japanese!!! People actually have intestines and well drawn organs instead of red paint and indiscernible chunks. When a character gets his head split in 2 we actually get to see a Sagittal Plane view showing everything inside with decent anatomical accuracy! The characters wear clothes that are period accurate and look like some actual thought and effort went into them. The backgrounds are well detailed and aren\'t marred by horrible use of CG. This was made in 2009 when bad CG, lazy backgrounds, and ""Moe"" absolutely dominated the anime industry. This series took a gamble and it really paid off!Music:The music is entirely traditional Japanese music that stays consistent with the Tokugawa Shogunate time period. It doesn\'t switch back and forth between period appropriate music and a really crappy comic relief track played on synthesizer whenever some dumbass appears on screen! This may not sound like much, but seriously I have seen over 300 anime and this basically NEVER happens!Portrayal of history:The days of the samurai in Japanese pop culture, much like Europe\'s Medieval Period in much of Western literature, is frequently romanticized as ""the good old days"". This was when people knew their place in the world, served with honor, and nobly sacrificed themselves to avoid shame befalling their family. Much like Game of Thrones, Shigurui rejects this nostalgia and shows the poverty, disease, filth, and low quality of life that the ordinary people of this period had to suffer through. The author of the original novel was named Norio Nanjo and he was a Japanese soldier in China during WW2. He felt it was unjust that Japanese history at that point solely focused on Emperors, Generals, and the people at the very top. The life of an ordinary Japanese soldier or the civilians they massacred weren\'t written about and historians simply didn\'t care about that part history. Nanjo not only wished to show history from the perspective of the common man, but also to reveal the whole truth and not conceal any embarrassing details. For example, Shigurui actually has the balls to mention that samurai very commonly had 5-10 year old boys as assistants called ""wakashu"". A samurai was fully expected to have anal sex with their wakashu in order to teach them submission and loyalty to their master. In addition to this, most respected samurai did NOT remain faithful to their wives and visited prostitutes FREQUENTLY. I\'m not talking about Geisha for music and conversation, I mean actual prostitutes! How about the fact that women in Japan until the Meiji Period would purposely blacken their teeth because blacker teeth were considered more beautiful? In a country like Japan with such reverence for ancestors and history, to show the naked truth and not polish up the unpleasant details is a rather bold and commendable feat!Philosophy:There is no good and evil in Shigurui. Instead we are left to decide which is worse: a man who will follow any evil deed like a robot, or a man who commits evil of his own volition and cares only for himself. Neither is portrayed in a flattering light and no answers are definitively given here. Normally the concept of absolute loyalty is revered in Japan, but after personally witnessing the actions of the Japanese Army in China and the willingness of soldiers to follow the ""Kill all, Burn all, Loot all"" policy, Nanjo began to question this supposed truth. In many ways, the simply evil and selfish character Irako is actually the anti-hero and chief protagonist of this story for rebelling against the Japanese cultural principles that led to the deaths of over 10 million civilians in just a few years. This is a rather interesting question and not one that is frequently brought up either in Japanese media or elsewhere. The supposed hero of the story Fujiki is someone the viewer grows to both pity and despise for embodying what is almost always portrayed as a great trait in anime.Overall:Who would have thought that an anime that features a martial arts master karate chopping a prostitute\'s nipple off and then eating it would cause the viewer to reflect and think?! I really would have preferred that the anime had more episodes and completed the manga instead of remaining faithful for the parts that it covered... but just abruptly ending. However, the fact that this wasn\'t a big hit in Japan and didn\'t get a sequel isn\'t the fault of Shigurui. It is the fault of consumers that demand Ikki Tousen have 5 seasons and frequently neglect more worthy anime. This is certainly a series with some big flaws, but as I explained I also really loved some aspects. It is certainly a series I would recommend checking out, as long as you have a fairly strong stomach that is! real swords and matches to the death. This tournament is being held by the brutal tyrant Tadanaga Tokugawa, who is the younger brother of the shogun ruling Japan. Tadanaga was executed for his ""criminal insanity"" and is sort of like Japan\'s Caligula, so this tournament is not out of place with the kind of deeds commonly attributed to him by Japanese historians. However, that isn\'t to say that Shigurui tries to be 100% historically accurate. Shigurui will instantly remind viewers of the much more famous Rurouni Kenshin with legendary swordsmen standing around and waiting for their opponents to unleash the ""Super Secret Bullshit Technique"" of the ""Does not exist"" school of sword fighting. Shigurui is infamous for having so many rape scenes, but nothing gets raped worse than the laws of physics in this series! The 2 main fighters in the tournament are long time rivals and mortal enemies. The entire series is a flashback explaining their histories and all the bad blood between them. The main 2 characters are the samurais Fujiki and Irako. Both were once students of universally feared Kogan School of Kendo, which was run by a brutal and completely insane old man named Kogan Iwamoto. Irako was blinded and exiled from the school for cheating with Kogan\'s mistress and now wishes to annihilate the entire school for revenge. Fujiki is loyal to the school and wishes to get revenge on Irako for killing everyone it it besides him. That\'s the entire plot! Also this is a condensed adaptation that didn\'t want to create its own ""filler ending"" so instead it just abruptly ends in the middle of the story! What makes the series interesting is its action, music, portrayal of history, artwork, and believe it or not the questions that it asks!Characters:The 2 main characters have commonly been compared to Guts and Griffith from Berserk and although this was actually based off a novel far older than Berserk, I can REALLY see why people would say that. Fujiki is a one armed swordsman who is loyal to a fault and against his conscience will carry out brutal deeds if ordered. Fujiki lives on for the sole purpose of getting revenge on Irako for killing all of his friends. Irako is a highly effeminate, Machiavellian bastard that wears lipstick. Irako was born to the lower class, but he is extremely ambitious and charismatic, willing to kill anyone and everyone to rise to the top. However, here is where the similarities end!

It starts off with final battle (didnt show result) for the rest of the episodes to uncover the past. The art is top notch.Best selling point(s):I dare to say : AllReason of liking the anime:I like it because 1st of all i am sick of those wannabe-samurai anime. I heard this is somewhat special and decided to have a go for it. The story telling is so good and pace is well controlled even for a short series anime. The gores comes with some torturings of women( yes , it's somewhat sick anime) and even showed...detailed parts of humans organs when duelers received damage upon duels.  Ah, i forgot to mention the tension created, it works so well with the music copping with the story pace.  I dare to say there're no other better samurai anime than this one.What i Dislike:Some scenes can be too dark or too bright to be seen.Advice(s):1) Not for women( well if you wanna have a go,be my guest) . For 18+age , Not for wannabe-samurai anime fans or any shounen anime  fans.2) It's like reading a good novel/story book, so have patience to watch it.3) The story is good that it makes you wanna watch on, watch slowly or you will finish watching it too soon :P. detailed parts of humans organs when duelers received damage upon duels.

It lacks the humor and the character development of majority of animes - they protagonist with the sense of justice or past that pushes him into a direction or the antagonist that considers destruction of all for his own purposes. If one considers true human nature with all its complexity it is hard to establish an antagonist. Before going further, I will state - and justify later - that Shigurui is underrated.An anime should be considered for what it intended to show or depict. Shigurui is not meant to be a fast paced action with Samurai\'s...jumping around and showing off flashy moves. Neither is it a display of a person\'s will to fight on and move forward by overcoming challenges. To first give an impression I will say that the anime refers to a believable edo period with skills fearsome and breath taking. Don\'t expect cut scenes similar to fights typical to One Piece, Bleach, Basilisk or Ninja Scroll (the last two titles for a better comparison). It contains sufficient violence and nudity but for the purpose of a more vivid and convincing plot not for fan service. The pace at which the story proceeds might be considered slow for some but in my opinion it is balanced and is targeted towards people who are more intuitive and let a tale seep in rather than skip scenes to reach the end. Patience is required for a reward as the anime proceeds. It is not for those who prefer first episodes like Deadman Wonderland, Mirai Nikki. I won\'t go into the details of the story itself. What I will say is that the story is an exceptionally well execution of an everyday attribute of humans: ambition. It combines that with the complex and varying personalities of humans to give a theme that is more or less a commonly occurring phenomenon in places/departments where people compete to rise to the top but is executed with such intricacy that a person continuously wants to know what will happen ahead. That is, if you let the anime display its potential in an episode or two. Having said that, the anime is sadly in complete - the ending which one is looking forward is not reached BUT, DESPITE THAT, the anime does finish off at a point of certain progression. It left me disappointed but did not make me question if I should have watched the anime or not (like it does with deadman wonderland, Attack on Titan for me).The art is impressive - the character appearance and architecture is realistic - it tilts towards designs similar to that of Paprika (for comparison) in which proportions are closer to real life and eyes/nose differ from those usually found. The color/hue throughout the anime is dull. It is meant to be that way since the anime takes place in a dark era with most scenes in dojo\'s and open gardens. The dreariness of dull colors is a perfect match for the atmosphere. Yet the backgrounds are detailed, the art is crisp and impressive. That includes the gore that does not only include splattering showers of blood or non-existent organs/muscles/limbs flying around. Also - with an anime that is meant to depict realistic Samurai scene sequences, ""excessive bloodshed"" is a must. If one wants a serious historical anime with sword fight but lack of bloodshed then I wonder what they are searching for.The sound in the anime is meant to compliment scenes. The background chirping of the insects in the morning and occasional slow tune in the background that is barely noticeable again suits and compliments the type of anime this is and is not existent in every scene, every time the protagonist turns around there would be a dramatic bass playing in the background. This is not a suspense thriller of the sort.The characters, as has been discussed earlier - are realistic. In what sense? They are not one dimensional. Meaning that they are not unmovable representations of a single goal or vision from which they will not waver. They are not simply distinguished as good or bad. A sense of justice, a code for Samurai has been set in the beginning and it is maintained - death for their master is an honor for a Samurai. The character of Fujiki Genouske is not just of a loyal man. It is of a loyal Samurai with all the restrictions applied. The restrictions do impose certain emotional responses in him (That are subtle to comprehend at the very least) but he overcomes them. Irako Seigen is a Samurai that considers personal gains and goals more important and is impulsive - he does not want to live in the constraints that tie down a Samurai. But is that necessarily bad? Don\'t we at many times act in such a way that duty is not neglected yet personal gain is also met. In the same way is Fujiki really that good? Is following rules that at times may impart distress on some, really that good? Is it wrong for the Mistress Iku to want to find love, or feel negatively for a murderer of his loved one? The way ambition, emotions and circumstances drive the characters and in turn the story is beautiful.Now to conclude, where is the enjoyment in this anime? Its the realism of the situation. It is the competition, the fact that righteousness does not always prevail. The fact that this is an anime that does not deal with the super natural yet exhibits skills that one wants to witness again and again. The excitement of waiting for a slash for it determines the fate of the fight. YES, for those that prefer long fight sequences with up\'s and downs in stamina and dialogues during the fight won\'t enjoy this. After all this is not devil may cry.So I will finally say that this anime is a beautiful execution of a dark period and a sinister story. For viewers of happy, fast paced or supernatural animes, this is not your thing. For patient viewers looking for a more mature yet interesting and deep storyline that challenges the brain into thinking, this is a wonderful anime. Partial, yes, but wonderfully executed till then.Feedback is appreciated! jumping around and showing off flashy moves.

I say unfortunately because while it is refreshing to see a samurai series take the-path-less traveled (no quiet, morally driven heroes here), its still an unpleasant ride that insists on showing the uglier side of things.The first episode of the story is set in the early 1600's during the Tokugawa years. One of Tokugawas crazy brothers decides hes going to hold a tournament, but the competitors will be using real swords instead of wooden ones. This is misleading. There is no tournament and you don't even get...to see the climax between the two main (in name only) characters. Instead, we're brought back in time to tell the story between the two main characters.Fujiki Gennosuke is the number one pupil of his dojo. Irako Seigen appears and challenges Fujiki for that spot. Their sensei has a daughter, Mie, and the succesor to the dojo not only gets her, but the land, prestige, and power that comes with her.Pretty simple plot thats not too difficult to follow. However, reading this you might believe that Fujiki is the hero of the story. That is not so. Fujiki is portrayed throughout the series as a serious, silent puppet...ironic, considering at one point in the series he is deemed the only non-puppet in the dojo. He does, on occasion, show anger, but beyond those few short snippets he has no personality and no background. We are never told why he his training to be a great swordsman or what he wants out of life or whats driving him. He perhaps was to be enigmatic, but instead he came across flat and 2-dimensional.Interesting to note, Fujiki began showing signs of some typical samurai honor early on,  but any inkling of that was dashed away the moment he felt content defeating a weakened rivalOn the other side of the coin, the main villain, Irako Seigen, has a wealth of history and personality. We are told who he was, who who wants to become, where he came from and where he wants to go. In the course of the series, Irako is betrayed by his dojo and destroyed by them. He later overcomes his injuries and handicaps to take his revenge. As a result, Irako comes off as the true hero of this series which I do not believe was the intention.The other characters fill their roles well and a simple story is told in detail. That means theres a lot of slow spots in this one folks. Yet, with everything moving so slow, the story often crescendos violently into epic scenes with massive blood loss and gore. The contrasts are well done and make the bloodletting far more effective.Overall, this is an animu for samurai fans. It is very rare that you see what samurai were actually like and not the fantasized ones we're used to seeing. However, you have to take the good with the bad, and thats experiencing and acknowledging the widespread practice of homosexuality as well as acknowledging that honor wasn't practiced to the extent we've been led to believe.For everyone else, I'd recommend to avoid this one. It is well animated, the music is great, everything about it works well...its just a question of taste. It is slow and blurs the line between good and bad to the point where the &quot;bad guy&quot; is far more heroic and interesting. There is a slight incestuous element but no real romance. There is a ton, A TON, of gore and blood and grotesque, wincing scenes that could just make you sick. to see the climax between the two main (in name only) characters.

The premise of the show is centered around a duel between two master swordsmen, Gennosuke Fujiki a one-armed swordsman, and Seigen Irako a blind swordsman with an almost crippled foot. Through foreshadowing story telling the series gives birth to a magnificent plot. The plot then, guides the path for the young master...swordsmen, Gennosuke Fujiki and Seigen Irako with a display of sensational visuals and an in-depth mastery of outstanding artistic showmanship, as they showcase their ability, courage and loyalty in hopes of grasping an unrivaled set of skills.Characters:Gennosuke Fujiki: Voiced by: Daisuke Namikawa (Japanese), John Burgmeier (English)The protégé of the kogan dojo and the ideal candidate that’s most likely to inherit the dojo. Through out the series, Fujiki is portrayed as a calm and rational figure that never allows his emotions to dedicate the pace of his judgment. His ability to wield the sword is uncanny, and his compassion towards his fellow comrades is heartfelt and sincere. Amongst these admirable traits, the one that shuns his other noble traits, Is Fujiki’s loyalty for his master Kogan.Seigen Irako: Voiced by: Nozomu Sasaki (Japanese), J. Michael Tatum (English)An aspiring master swordsman, whose methods of reaching a profound goal lack proportion. In the series, Irako’s ideals are encompassed in the sense of deceit, betrayal, and utter disloyalty for his master. Not only does he lack a sense of cultural value, his actions often, are very impulsive, as if they required a sense of instant gratification. The desire to reach a higher plateau is very demanding, and treacherousness is often a counter productive method that is likely to hinder progression. The noble path Irako walks requires a sense of self-acceptance, prudence, and mutual respect between pupil and master, traits that Irako profoundly lacks.Kogan Iwamoto: Voiced by: Seizō Katō (Japanese), Jerry Russell (English)Kogan Iwamoto is the headmaster of the Kogan-Ryuu school. He is a fearsome person whose mastery of the sword is regarded as unrivaled. In the series he’s depicted as an unbalanced figure who’s suffering from dementia: and once a year he breaks free from his uncertain slumber to oversee his dojo. He constantly wishes for a strong breed which in turn will oversee the dojo in his demise. To ensure the success of this, Kogan treats daughter as an instrument that is bring forth this vital breed.Mie Iwamoto: Voiced by: Hōko Kuwashima (Japanese), Laura Bailey (voice actress) (English)Mie Iwamoto is loving daughter with an infinite sense of pride. She tends to her father when he’s in his dementia state, along with the aid of Fujiki. Mie is portrayed as a maiden of staggering beauty that is lovely as the autumn rain. The Kogan-Ryuu school’s survival rested solely on her shoulders, as the presupposed offspring she is to produce would be the future of the Kogan dojo.Summation:To amass an unprecedented amount of artistry of violence through remarkable story telling is an astounding achievement that requires profound dedication and a level of sophistication that is almost impossible to reach, but Shigurui with ease, was able to capture all of these requirements. The bloody path of a samurai’s a life was captured instantly from the get-go of the series, until it reached its wondrous climax. The aspect of a samurai’s life was ensnared wonderfully with phenomenal storytelling that captured the core of its ideology.Theme:The society we live in today follows many ideologies that are coherent to our present time, but Shigurui strongly introduces its audience to a style of ideology that will surely appear to be morally twisted, and completely unnecessary. The series offers several valid themes that can relate to how our society behaves in the current times, but the main theme it wonderfully depicts, is the resolute and harmonious loyalty that a samurai wholeheartedly adheres by. This distinctive quality was terrifically exposed through out the series, with events that tested a samurai’s physical and mental tolerance for his master. Shigurui magnificently delivers this profound and rich artistic representation of the early 1600 hundreds with immense success, and it paints how marginally the ideologies of the past were regarded with great ambition and respect, a rare trait that our self-imposing society lacks.Media Related:With a stellar star mesmerizing image, Shigurui showcases a marvelous prospective through beautifully realized violence. Visually astonishing, artistically inspiring, these are the stupendous rich traits that the series embodies.

Immediately, the colourful and stylistic scenes and art was inviting. Unfortunately, it was followed by rather bland, mid-toned artwork. Although there were redeeming factors in the actual visuals, like detailed environments and facial expressions, the overall feel lacked any invitation. Nothing immediately caught the eye other than the constant snowfall!The second thing that impressed me immediately was the sound. The background music was very refreshing, and more importantly true to the era depicted in the setting. But again, it failed to hold its own became it became extremely monotonous by the end...of the first episode. It was almost like a very good loop was played throughout the series. This caused many awkward moments where the music did not match the scene appropriately.The character development was almost non-existent. There was very little evolution of any type. Other than perhaps two of the characters, there was also a dire need for more emotional voice-acting in order to instill some life into the inhabitants of the dojo, the focal setting of the series. Due to a problem with the chronology of the story, the viewer becomes even less involved.As far as the animation was concerned, the majority of the effort was put into the action sequences. Yet again, this factor of the anime failed to deliver. Although a unique and interesting method of representing the tension before each fight was used, the fights usually lasted about a second or two with very little actual animation, which doesn't say much about the rest of the anime.There is a decent amount of gore, and the faint of heart are warned to stay away if that is not your cup of tea. One particular molestation scene stands out as one of the most blatantly gratuitous scenes in any anime I've watched recently, and I can handle a lot of disturbing violence. I can't help but think that it was used for shock value rather than being an integral part of the story.Overall, I had to force myself to get through the coma-inducing pace of the entire series. All that was left was a bitter taste of needless gore, and confusing story-telling with a few artistic qualities worth mentioning. I strongly recommend looking elsewhere if you're looking for a historic anime revolving around the patriarchal society in a dojo, with a peppering of inadequate samurai action sequences thrown in for giggles. of the first episode.

This review represents the opinion of someone with very little knowledge of Japanese history and who didn't read up about it before watching the series. It's not like I actively try not to have a sense of the context, it's just that I believe that I shouldn't have to know all about the historical background of something before I watch an anime about it, as it's essentially fiction and should really be good enough to keep me entertained without that. So this review represents my opinion of this anime as a piece...of entertainment in its own right. If you did read up on Japanese history before watching this, fair enough, I'm not having a go at you, it's just not something I do.2. People keep going on about how realistic this series is. It isn't. You get impossibly strong punches, razor-sharp hand swipes, special moves that are somehow unblockable, and more. It does, however, feel fairly real in that people don't go jumping 30m into the air or shrugging off fatal wounds.Now, onto the review: I watched this series because I wanted to watch a samurai anime that wasn't too stylised, i.e. without superhuman jumping about and ridiculous attacks. Shigurui sounded like it fitted the bill (and close enough did, I suppose), so I watched it. It's told in the form of starting at the chronological end of the series, and showing the events leading up to it in the remainder of the series. More on why I scored its story so badly later.Shigurui's art was good, albeit fairly bleak. It had some nice scenery, and characters were drawn well. As others have mentioned, very often a scene would be so dark that you literally couldn't see what was going on, which was really rather irritating, necessitating turning down the contrast, leaving fuzzy outlines of figures. The series' animation was also good, with little repetition and smooth movement.Shigurui had fairly standard voice acting, which stood out in netiher a good nor a bad way: neither was it surprisingly good, nor did it ever detract from the series. The score was very atmospheric and fitted the series well, so as a score it was excellent. As music, it wasn't all that pleasant to listen to, but it fulfilled its function well.The series as a whole is very well put together in terms of cinematography, art, etc.Where it all goes wrong is with the story. It's nothing original, which isn't usually a major problem (almost everything follows some sort of template), but here, I think originality is one of the few things that might have saved this series. By the end of the second episode, you can deduce roughly what will happen throughout the rest of the series, meaning that it feels more like atmosphere and build-up than a plot. But this build-up comes to nothing: you might expect there to be some closure for the series, but it just tails off, so you end up wishing that they'd at least covered some new ground. Imagine a version of Reservoir Dogs where you neither find out just how they got to the safehouse, nor are you shown much of what actually happens when they're there. You'd think that they'd show you what happened to Fujiki's arm and Irako's leg, but they don't. You might have some sort of insane idea that they'd show you what the outcome of the battle, to which it all feels like it's moving, was, but you don't see this either. It doesn't end at the place the series began. It doesn't even end anywhere near there.  When I watched the end, I was sure I'd missed an ep, but I hadn't. It left me with a horrible mixture of disappointment and emptiness, and the bollocksed up ending made the bits of the series I had enjoyed feel shallow and pointless. I have a bad taste in my mouth when I mention this series.My overall score of 6/10 reflects the juxtaposition of some really rather good atmosphere and art with a deficient storyline. Almost everything I've watched comes from recommendations from close friends, meaning that I've seen almost exclusively what I would call good stuff, but this is the one series I would not recommend to my friends. Maybe it's someone else's cup of tea, but it's certainly not mine. of entertainment in its own right.

"", 'Simply, the first thing to consider is that this anime is composed largely of some of the most graphic scenes of violence in the industry. It also is fairly free in its portrayal of sex and thus I would instantly dismiss it if you do not care for these things. In watching Shigurui, they cannot be avoided.If this does not concern you then you will certainly appreciate the art, the degree of artistry and realism in the violence alone justifies a high rating, entrails feature heavily. Otherwise the anime is generally graphically pleasing, the general Edo period scenery is well presented the characters are very...well drawn and this makes it all the more disturbing when they near-inevitably breathe their last. Fans of period drama will appreciate this one without a doubt.The story is not so engrossing, partly because it is confrontation that drives the storys events rather than actual intrigue, but as a device to tie one bloody murder to another the plot is more than sufficient and fairly well written. Ultimately, there are samurai, sword-lineages, secret techniques and endless betrayal as one would expect from a good example of an Edo period anime. The truly exceptional part is that they have managed to make it more violent than ever, showing us that there is truly no upper limit.The sound blends  beautifully with the horror of the visual situation and highlights just how disgusting what you are watching is, in case you had forgotten. Traditional japanese sound effects and music underscore the whole thing. well drawn and this makes it all the more disturbing when they near-inevitably breathe their last.

But as soon as the first episode you are thrown into a chaotic world where you literally have no clue what&rsquo;s happening and why it happened. That perhaps being the strongest point of this anime, the story is amazingly well done, that it always keep you interested. Like some invisible grip over you, it keep you coming back for more and more. However I will say this, this anime is not for weak hearted people and definitely not for anyone under 18 years old. It...contains a very mature theme. Bloods, severed limbs, wild emotions, sex and everything else you can think of, you will see it in this short 12 episodes series. The story line is also somewhat hard to understand at first, but I promise you that if you watch this anime carefully, by the end you will understand everything.There is one drawback however, it&rsquo;s only a 12 episode series. In the end when it&rsquo;s all over and enough blood has been spilled, this anime leaves you with the feeling that something is missing, and you will definitely wish there was more.

I am someone who has a strong stomach, but this show made me wretch nearly every episode. Despite the disturbing imagery, the series does nothing with it, instead relying on shock factor alone to keep people interested. If the violence somehow supplemented a meaningful story, I might have given it a better rating, but nothing in this show is coherent and often feels like gore is just a cop-out...for lack of narrative.Admittedly, the show started off from a relatively interesting place. A Lord is holding a tournament that involves his samurai , but where these were originally fought with wooden swords, he has altered the rules for them to fight with real swords instead. To augment this story, Shigurui attempts to show the politics of the period, as well as add to the development of the characters that will be fighting against each other, through flashbacks. Seems pretty cool, right? Unfortunately for you, there is nothing interesting in these flashbacks at all. To sum up most episodes, it's a camera pan between two rival warriors until the screen goes white, a sword slash occurs, and someone's head rolls onto the ground.As for the soundtrack and art, they are both just as dull as everything else. The soundtrack is usually just a bunch of cicadas and a couple smacks on a drum; not much else to say there. The art is just as lackluster, being almost completely washed out, save for the few moments where blood is splattering all over the screen. They made sure to make that nice and bright for you, just in case you missed that eye explosion scene. It was clear they were trying to emphasize it through their color choices, but it doesn't save Shigurui from having distasteful art all together.To sum it all up, I cannot recognize any redeeming qualities in this anime. Many tout this as a mature series, but it just seems like they used an uninspired narrative to justify making unreasonable amounts of graphic violence and sex. If you feel like you can stomach the show, then run through the first episode and see what you think. The first episode is about the same pace and tone of the rest of the episodes, so if you like that, then you'll like the rest. Other than that, I would stay away from this one at all costs. for lack of narrative.Admittedly, the show started off from a relatively interesting place.

I've never seen an anime that is this violent, explicit, and drenched in darkness and stark realism. This is probably the most realistic samurai anime that one will ever see. Fights end quickly and characters die in gruesome fashion.The animation and framing of the scenes make it so that it invites the viewer to pay close attention to bask in gruesome ends to characters and so that they don't miss clear cases of foreshadowing and symbolism methodically placed in...the anime.This anime is clearly for mature audiences. Not only are scenes gruesome, but there is explicit sexual content. Clear shots of female nudity, sex acts, sexual assaults, etc. However, the anime doesn't show these things to simply be edgy. Overall, these scenes are meant to portray the setting has a very awful time in Japanese history. Women are treated like objects, characters die in horrific circumstance, and samurai are portrayed either as glorified attack dogs are complicit pawns.Characters are a bit of a mixed bag. The character that you initially might hate eventually will gain your sympathy and some characters you can't describe. Some characters are the vilest scum ever portrayed and yet you wonder why other characters ignore this fact or don't address it the same way the viewer might think they should. The story revolves around a rivalry between two main characters: one with a clear motivation and backstory and one with none of that. He just seems like a blank slate with no clear motivation or personality really. However, I appreciate that this anime takes its time to tell a story at the pace it needs to be told. It is unfinished which lowers the quality to an extent with some key details left unanswered at the end.To a degree though, I found the show to be wrapped up satisfyingly enough for me. I did hate how weak the musical score was for me. It failed to make me feel tense during the scenes I was supposed to feel tense. The opening was forgettable and the soundtrack made it feel like the viewer is hearing silence instead of being in a show.I would recommend this show if one wants to see an anime that portrays samurai in a different light than usual and tells an interesting, albeit slow at time and unfinished story. I will say that this is a show that will make you think about characters and appreciate a show differently than you normally would.It will be a mixed bag though: some will be able to appreciate the show for what it is and some will be turned out by its grotesqueness and slow pacing. It is worth giving a try and drop it if nothing seems interesting. the anime.This anime is clearly for mature audiences. Not only are scenes gruesome, but there is explicit sexual content.

Most people would find this show slow and boring or grossly disgusting. However, what they fail to realize is that those are very human things, humans are dirty and seemingly boring.Shigurui is undoubtedly the most realistic vision of ancient Japan that I've ever come across, where honor is everything and real old delirious old men drool and soil themselves...without shame.What really got me was the way sword fighting was portrayed, as mentioned earlier, the sword fights were subtle, albeit highly stylized. That is as real as you can get to true samurai. The art of swordsmanship was just that--an art. It was supposed to be a poetic act of a one on one duel between warriors. It thrilled me to no end how they pulled it off in Shigurui. without shame.What really got me was the way sword fighting was portrayed, as mentioned earlier, the sword fights were subtle, albeit highly stylized.

The story is extremely confusing (told in flash backs and flash forwards), most of the characters look very similar, tons of plot points are dropped or not nearly as relevant as the amount of screen time they were given, almost all of the characters were awful people and had little development, and the story STOPS IN THE MIDDLE. IF you're not interested in intense violence and gore with flashy animations or...samurai and the Edo time period, I suggest just skipping right on by this one. In fact, do yourself a favor and watch Basilisk if you're looking for that kind of thing, since it is basically this story but 10x better in basically every way.Story: 4/10The story is bad. It is extremely confusing, told in an odd way, and doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I didn't really know who a lot of characters were, what their motivations were, or where they were going. It certainly doesn't help the story starts with an epic scene and then flashes back and concludes before the flashback (so you have no idea how the intro fight scene turns out).Art: 9/10Flashy and done extremely well, this is an artsy piece. The violence is gory and realistic, if this isn't your thing you won't like the overall art style.Sound: 6/10It is period appropriate and gets the job done. The voice actors do a good job but generally the sound is minimalist.Character: 5/10Maybe it was because I couldn't tell anyone apart except for a few of the main characters, but I didn't understand most of the characters development, motivations, or really much else. This may be better than I am giving it credit for, but you have to have a very good sense of what is going on and pay very close attention.Enjoyment: 3/10I did not enjoy this. It took me nearly 2 weeks to get through it (and it is only 1 season). I just didn't empathize with the characters or have much of an idea what was going on. The style of story telling was fairly bad and if I hadn't invested into it for the first half of the season I would have dropped it.Overall: 5/10If you have a good attention span and really like samurai and period pieces with gore and sex and violence you might enjoy the. Then again, if you like coherent stories, a diverse cast with character development and a story that wraps up at the end of the anime, you'll hate it.Sidebar, if you are planning to hold on to see who wins from the fight in the 1st episode, just drop it. You never find out in the anime. I was thinking about using google to figure out how the manga ended, but I think I'll just forget about it and move on since honestly at this point I really don't care. samurai and the Edo time period, I suggest just skipping right on by this one.

There were times where i got just a little bored, but as a whole the anime is excellent. This anime is probably as realistic as it gets, it is most honorable for a samurai show. The grotesqueness is absolutely 100% enjoyable. Okay i lied, 95% for sure though. Anyhow if your dad is getting tired of the old cowboy movies put this on for him. ', ""I've heard a lot of bad things about this anime, admittedly, the violence might be seen as a little shocking but it's nothing to get over-sensitive about. Besides, although the hyper-violent side of the series is what seems to get the most feedback, the story itself outweighs the brutal aspects of the series to a point where the violence really didn't interest me. I thoroughly enjoyed this short little series and didn't expect to after the first episode. But, from then on, the story slowly weaved it's way in and had me hooked. I'm a fan of a proper, serious samurai movie and this was...done as a samurai series should be. It reminded me of a Kurosawa samurai movie. Very slow-paced and I think it worked well that way. Very strange at times but also thought provoking if you're into the psyche of a samurai. Much like Texhnolyze, the characters are cold, at times, probably quite dull to your average anime fan. You never really know who to sympathise with, if any. If Lone wolf and cub had ever had an anime series made, it would have been great if it was made in this style. My main gripe with the series is the hugely disappointing ending but I guess that's what you get when the manga is still going. It's a shame, one more episode probably would have done it but I'm hopeful that a second series will get made someday. done as a samurai series should be. It reminded me of a Kurosawa samurai movie.

The story line is simple, easy to follow and classic: pitting two swordsmen against one another and telling their story by jumping in and out of a chronological order.The art is well done and some of the sword-fighting scenes are superb not because they are flashy but because they pack a whole lot of tension. It's like being coiled up like a spring and unleashing at the sound of a drum-beat. Lethally cool.Each character had a specific style or look,...which was excellent.

To quote a character in the last episode, “This isn’t a dojo, this is hell.” Beyond displaying the bleakness and brutality of the Edo period, this show has nothing to say. Even those looking for beautiful kills and gore will not be satisfied. Heralded as one of the most violent things out there, I see why, but not in the way I had wished. The reason it has this reputation is that it focuses on the...blood and innards of its victims. Intestines spilt out in the beginning scene is a forewarning. This is their go to for showing brutality...intestines! I appreciate this the first time, I don’t often see this level of the grotesque, and I appreciate that, I’m not squeamish, but you see intestines spilt 4-5 times. It loses its shock by the second time, and by the fifth time, in the last episode, I was laughing. “O God, they're going for the intestines again?!” All jokes aside, lets show some creativity here, there are many ways to dismember samurai. Grotesqueness does little for the viewer unless there’s some meaning behind it. That goes for the nudity as well, they just take off the clothes of their two female protagonists like no body’s business, it is done in a very pornish kind of way, “wow look at her tits,” beyond the shock value there’s no meaning behind the nudity. If you're going to have nudity, do it a little more skillfully.The show looks phenomenal, but too often I feel like they wasted money and detail on dreary settings and guts, hence why the show doesn’t even make it through a season. Yes, that’s right, some reviewers here have glossed over the fact that this show is simply not completed. It just dies after 12 episodes. After a promising first episode they flashback to 2 years previous, intentionally of course, to develop the characters, yet in the end, you never even make it back to the first episode. The rivalry between the two main protagonists and their eventual battle, which i thought was the entire motivation of the show and intention for the flashback, never comes to fruition. So, I get it, the show is not finished, I won’t judge it on just that, plenty of good shows get the plug pulled on them, if those 12 episodes are brilliant then that’s great, there will be the blue ballz effect as some story arcs will never be fulfilled, but I can still appreciate it an extent. This is pure pornography though. The story is at times intriguing, but the way scenes jump around doesn’t make sense. I could follow the show but I had to assume a lot. I’m sure it was created with the manga reader in mind, but that doesn’t mean they should leave huge holes. There’s no real narrative, random things just kind of occur.On top of that, there are no real likable characters. You’re naturally drawn to Fujiki, I guess the main protagonist, but that’s only because he’s slightly nicer than everyone else. Every character in this show is a piece of shit. But even with shows like Death Note or Game of Thrones, inhabited by antiheroes, there are things that attract you to the characters. There’s no one worth rooting for in the show. Everyone acts for the sake of power and for themselves. Maybe this is realistic, which some reviewers say Shigerui recreates a realistic Edo Japan, but I have a hard time seeing that none of those samurai, especially, the dojo leader, have an ounce of wisdom in them. There is no love of life in these characters, just in furthering their own power and exacting revenge. They are all quite shallow, sure we can enjoy characters like this in many shows, but when all the characters have this viewpoint the show becomes a bit of a boor. You could plug any character (besides Fujiki) into any situation and they’d probably do the same thing.The intentional flashback 11 episode arc, doesn’t even do a good job of building up characters. Characters rarely last longer than an episode. A character is often introduced, there is a brief flashback to show what a character is generally like, and then they kill him off frighteningly quick. There’s no point of showing background info for a new character if you’re just going to kill him off in 7 minutes, its a waste of time for the viewer. And that’s also the problem, I understand its realistic for samurai to take their enemy down in as few swords swings as possible, but because of the quick nature of these fights, there’s no real satisfaction in the fighting. They build up a fight for ten minutes and then someones dead instantly. Every fight has potential and then in end it was obvious how much stronger one of the samurai was. What’s the beauty in that, samurai didn’t just kill to kill? There really aren’t many fights per se, there are some murders, and sometimes they don’t even show the fight, just the result of a decapitated head. For example, one samurai is said to have incredible strength, they build up his potential, then he is merely killed in a hot tub, he is unnamed and doesn’t put up a fight, what’s focused on is the blood splattered in the bath house. Later, another might warrior is killed when his back is turned to his enemy. Not trying to go on here, but what I’m saying here is there is no beauty in the kill, the gore is just exemplified, and let me make this clear, I love gore!On top of that the show tries to be deep at points, showing closeups of flies on guts, cicadas screeching, but it just falls short, being artsy without real meaning is cringe worthy, it made me laugh in the end. Its all too bad because it really seems like there is tons of talent on the show. They really just needed the writing to pull it all together, but as is its just a bunch scenes mashed together. Beyond showing the brutality of the era it doesn’t give me much. If you’re a fan of intestines and want to see something brutal, go for it, it’s only 12 episodes, but by the end, like me, you’ll probably feel a little cheated.

You’re entering a large white room filled with a few abstract objects. You definitely recognize the objects, but you are unsure of what their purposes are. In the background an old cd-player let's off a reverberating noise, this noise could be anything from a car engine to a water droplet, graciously touching the water. The sound and the visual objects are supposed to converge into a symbiosis of something deep, something...meaningful and passionate. This combination of perceptual information is supposed to reflect the artist's feelings and expression, and convey some sort of message.  At least that is usually the intention.Shigurui tries desperately to be like this sort of art piece, and some people would probably regard it as a successful one. The subjectivity of the matter is therefore prevalent.Objectively the art and animation is of a high quality. The animators of Madhouse successfully create a dark and washed out canvas, which really adds to the usual perception of the romanticized vision we hold of Edo Era Japan. The outdoor scenes during daytime are particularly beautiful, albeit most of the scenes are contained within Dojos, which feels like it does the animators a great disservice, hamstringing the visual variety to a great degree. Understandably this is a limitation created by the story and the source material, which is a bit unfortunate in my opinion.The way the story is told felt disjointed and messy.  Focusing around a “final lesson in the artistry of violence where nothing is more beautiful than the kill.” (episode description), the story emphasizes strange parts of what’s important when conveying a good story. The characters throughout the series are never really introduced in a way that differentiates them, except for their respective fighting styles. The whole cast of characters neither feel protagonistic, nor antagonistic, they simply feel bland. Like soldiers (in this case samurai) following their generals orders. Instead of conveying thought, judgment or even consideration for their actions, the cast is more reminiscent of participants in the Milgram Experiment than actual human beings. Historically this might be somehow accurate, but it when conveying a story, this really hurts the ability to generate emotion and recognition for the viewers.The story in itself is really basic and boils down to “People must kill each other because (insert reason)”. Devoid of characters of interest, the plot doesn’t generate any purpose. Simply put, when characters you don’t care about simply die, you simply won’t care. Thus the kill serves no purpose except for the visual presentation of a murder. When this is expressively described in the episode summary, you certainly must realize that the focus of the storytelling is simply wrongly weighted.In addition to the unbalanced storytelling, Shigurui is also its self-perception. The fact that the anime takes itself so seriously makes the action feel forced and unnecessary. Perhaps this is historically accurate, but that is still no excuse for such a dull presentation of an interesting subject as Samurai. Instead an idiosyncratic presentation of each of the samurai, and a battle after such an introduction, would’ve felt much more satisfying.The focus on the “Beauty of the kill” and not on the characters isn’t the only fault of Shigurui. The way the audio and visuals converge feels horrid. The simple noises, always playing in the background distract you from what happens on the screen, instead of simply adding to the story. A good musical score would have fit this story a lot more.  Even though I prefer a good score, the creators should be commended for trying something different, but when taking such a risk, you should be prepared to fail. Shigurui fails strongly in this regard.TL;DR: In short Shigurui tries to be a post-modern art piece about Edo Era Japan, but fails in every regard in doing so.

It truly reflects the stoic and jarring world of honor bound killing and entire communities premised on power and violence.In addition to its starkly accurate historical perspective, the directing aides the story so well, suspending every moment to discomfort and stress.

And don't forget, this is the most violent and gory anime ever made."", ""Shigurui is dark, gritty, relentless, and communicates its story to the viewer fairly well. Midway through this series it was headed for my top ten. Upon completion it will not be. There are a ton of things this show gets right, most of them actually. But it has a fatal flaw and I hope to bring that flaw to light with this review.---Story---This story is not for the weak of heart. If you prefer dainty, lighthearted, adventure seeking, and unrealistic fights then this is not the anime for you. The story of shigurui tracks the downfall of the Kogan style of swordsmanship and intertwines a...story of competition between two protagonists. It does this quite masterfully and by episode 4 I was hooked to see what would happen next. The drama in this series is extremely believable: jealousy, sex scandals, betrayal, and the ensuing fights that occur. This anime is a little bit of a slow burner but this works to the advantage of the story perfectly. The juxtaposition between the pacing of the actual story and the frequent yet lasting mere seconds of fighting create a very tense and realistic atmosphere. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that ALL the fights in the show are realistic: they merely have a realistic grace about them. The downfall of this story is that it begins from a point that is never properly revisited or explained. The whole show is a flashback from the events of episode one. While I actually do like this kind of show (akin to Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju), Shigurui butchers it. I'm talking it beats the meat more than an otaku who just found his new waifu. I felt that this series did not have a proper ending; I was drug along down this fabulous path only to have an unresolved conflict I was looking forward to the most. ALSO the fact Fujiki's injury isn't explained is rather sad and pulls this story down even further from its initial lofty heights. Despite my problems with the show's story resolution I quite enjoyed this tale. It doesn't give you room to breathe, and I liked that.Story score: 8 (Very Good)Art:The art is this series is a toss up. Most of our time is spent in dark rooms lit by candle or outside in the evening/night. This makes some scenes extremely hard to analyze fully. Facial expressions and body movements are fairly realistic yet animation is sub par. Sometimes the characters have extremely realistic reactions to events yet other times they look like wax sculptures or figurines. This is most likely due to the attention and care that the faces received for this series. This resulted in some rather powerful moments with a few that fell flat or missed the mark. Overall it was a positive experience.Art Score: 8 (Very Good)---Sound---The sound is another strong suit of Shigurui. It tosses the idea of normal OST's for something more edgy and yearning in a sense; it is one of the biggest reason the conversation between pacing and action in the series works. The drums, strings, chants, sung songs, cicadas, and moments of utter silence all exemplify the notion that these characters are on edge all of the time and are as sharp as the swords they carry. It is both breathtaking and simplistic. Bravo. This being said, the lack of a true OST isn't something I welcome with no setbacks. I find that music can take an average anime and turn it to an amazing one. The lack thereof is a *slight* detriment since I won't have a single track to remember this series by.Sound score: 9 (Great)---Characters---Few anime have made me hate a character with every fiber in my being. Irako is a little bitch. A talented swordsman none the less, but an utterly disgusting human. He reminds me of a snake: strong, powerful, and extremely deceptive. The narrative of his continued struggle with Fujiki and Kogan is powerful and is one of the highs of this series. The story fleshes out each character with stunning acuity, all except for Fujiki himself. That is a major disappointment given that he is by far my favorite character. I think the characters most well done in this series are Irako, Kogan, and Lady Iku. Gosh... especially Kogan. What an odd and demented man. The characters in this series are sure to impress Each person fulfills their role and truly feels alive in the harsh world of samurai.Character score: 9 (Great)---Enjoyment---I have to say, given the flaws of this series it really brought down the enjoyment score. As I said earlier I did not feel satisfied with the ending of this show whatsoever. I practically enjoyed every other aspect of this show. It's a bummer.Enjoyment Score: 9 (Great)---Last impressions and final score---This series is special amidst all of the anime that frankly isn't. The scene and tone are practically the grittiest I've seen in the medium . The action is to the point and battles are decided through cunning swordsmanship. Art and sound complement each other and characters seem to leap out of the screen at points. I full recommend this title to anyone who 1. Likes samurai, 2. Likes blood, 3. Enjoys diversity in the anime they watch.Overall: 9 (Great) story of competition between two protagonists. It does this quite masterfully and by episode 4 I was hooked to see what would happen next. The drama in this series is extremely believable: jealousy, sex scandals, betrayal, and the ensuing fights that occur. This anime is a little bit of a slow burner but this works to the advantage of the story perfectly. The juxtaposition between the pacing of the actual story and the frequent yet lasting mere seconds of fighting create a very tense and realistic atmosphere. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that ALL the fights in the show are realistic: they merely have a realistic grace about them. The downfall of this story is that it begins from a point that is never properly revisited or explained. The whole show is a flashback from the events of episode one. While I actually do like this kind of show (akin to Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinju), Shigurui butchers it. I'm talking it beats the meat more than an otaku who just found his new waifu. I felt that this series did not have a proper ending; I was drug along down this fabulous path only to have an unresolved conflict I was looking forward to the most. ALSO the fact Fujiki's injury isn't explained is rather sad and pulls this story down even further from its initial lofty heights. Despite my problems with the show's story resolution I quite enjoyed this tale. It doesn't give you room to breathe, and I liked that.Story score: 8 (Very Good)Art:The art is this series is a toss up. Most of our time is spent in dark rooms lit by candle or outside in the evening/night. This makes some scenes extremely hard to analyze fully. Facial expressions and body movements are fairly realistic yet animation is sub par. Sometimes the characters have extremely realistic reactions to events yet other times they look like wax sculptures or figurines. This is most likely due to the attention and care that the faces received for this series. This resulted in some rather powerful moments with a few that fell flat or missed the mark. Overall it was a positive experience.Art Score: 8 (Very Good)---Sound---The sound is another strong suit of Shigurui. It tosses the idea of normal OST's for something more edgy and yearning in a sense; it is one of the biggest reason the conversation between pacing and action in the series works.

""Right... an imitation sword, you said when his head was put out in public an imitation sword was put in his mouth"". the narrator was bad, it was useful to explain the setting but the voice actor was really bad. this may be more to do with the anime itself as it has a confusing structure, causing the narrator to mention the date many times over the show. he sometimes explains things when we already know whats going on which breaks the immersion a bit. i still thought it was worth it for the main characters, especially Ushimata, but dammit it coulda been amazing and they missed it and that really makes me angry. i really hope i don\'t come across more dubs in the same situation as this..i\'m giving it a 10 because i either love something or throw it away all together, i don\'t think the dub should have an effect on the score(unless its great). this is only coming after i had watched the show and know where it was all leading to, while i was watching it i was questioning whether i liked it or not as i didn\'t have any idea where it was going, so you will have to finish it before you can appreciate it, if you don\'t like rough starts then you won\'t like this.one thing i almost forgot, this is only half the story, they never got to make a second season. i hate it when people say that anime is just an advertisement for manga, even though i will read the shigurui manga one way, there is no way the fights will be brought to life like it was in the anime. event, flashing back before it for a while then flashing back after. it could have been re-structured.the art is great. its dreary and grayed out, fitting well with the grim atmosphere. the gore  is my favourite part of the art, not the blood but the deformation of the bodies. people getting struck across the face to have their jaw shatter and turn to elastic with their eyes bulging, the injuries plastered across peoples bodies, you meet a character who looks like they are always smiling until he opens his mouth and you see the strings of meat hanging between his cheeks and the best part is CGI intestines.the music is good. the opening could have been better if they didn\'t have the violins and stuck with the traditional instruments, a male chorus would have been better. the ending was better but not much better. the music used during episodes was great, it wasn\'t something made to be listened to alone, but is used to enhance the scenes to great effect.my favourite thing out of the whole show was the fights, i\'m not a big fan of sword or katana fights in anime they are often weightless and boring to me. in shigurui the fights don\'t have alot of action, instead it shows us what is going on inside the bodies of the samurai, the tension in their muscles, the cracking of their bones, the amount of power they put into each strike. it adds incredible weight to each fight. it also explain the techniques that the samurai use which is cool to understand. this is the height of the art and the sound, as during the fight, the background will turn white and the samurai\'s will become naked, the sound lets us hear what is going on inside their bodies too. when the samurai look at each other, they see the internal organs of each other, almost as if they see opponents as bags of meat rather than people. while it is less animated and more drawn out, i much prefer this style of fighting compared to that of samurai champloo.the characters are great, especially Fujiki, Irako, Kogan and Ushimata. the rivalry between Fujiki and Irako is very well done, my second favourite thing about this anime is that despite it leading you to believe that one is more evil than the other, if you pay close attention to their actions and their thoughts, you see that this is not the case.i watched the Dub, the main characters were voiced well, but the side characters and the narrator were bad. it got better towards the end though. the main problem i have with the dub is that it seems to have been translated more literally than others. it is probably a difficult task to translate something like shigurui, which was made to be historically accurate, especially in the way they talk, but they could still make changes to make it sound more natural without changing the meaning. like mentioning peoples honorifics all of the time causes them to talk very fast, a way around this would by to only mention this when in their presence or when it is important. the worst line is this.

One of them will eventually become the heir of the academy, which creates a bit of a tension between them, even tho the potential heritage isn\'t the only thing that makes them dislike each other.~I find the story really interesting, and the gore element makes it even more appealing to me (hehe) but despite all that, during the series, I felt like something was missing.~I soon realised that I didn\'t really care about the death/torture/rape (yes it includes all that) scenes...towards most of the characters. I found that I was having a hard time bonding with the characters, mostly because I felt like I was just a spectator to whom the feelings and the emotional states of the characters weren\'t fully displayed. Most of the characters are closed to themselves, rarely expressing any feelings. Some people might like that, but after a while it made me lose interest in the story and be amused only from the interesting gore scenes.~After all, it is a great story, with interesting animation (everyone looks alike yet so different), character development but lacks expression towards the viewer. If only I could sympathise with a character or really feel what it\'s like for them to change, this series would be so, so much better.Aaaand that was my review teehee ~~~ towards most of the characters.

The animation and the way they display and build the characters is interesting. The gore is nice too.  However the anime is very confusing to understand. The ending is greatly disappointing too. The more i watched this the further i became confused and less interested. As for the action i felt it was too slow paced. I'm a fan of action anime and usually prefer fast paced action or thrilling action. But as the series went on i felt that this was lacking so for that reason I wouldn't recommend this anime "", ""I enjoy blood with a purpose but this was just graphic and violent. Not my taste at all. The story was hard to get into - maybe I didn't give it justice as I know many anime start slow and get better but I just couldn't get past the violence. I also gravitate more toward heroine stories so this may have been part of my disappointment. "", 'I have no way of actually confirming, but this nigh-misantrophic anime feels a lot more accurate to what the samurai were probably actually like, compared to any more heroic depictions.a hypermasculine cabal, high off authority, practicing nothing but worship of rigid power structures and the art of killing? yea, no way that wasn\'t a hotbed for corruption and depravity.enjoy the not-so-subtle symbolism behind the school of samurai in this show being singularly devoted to a cruel elderly man, entirely succumbed to dementia, who only snaps into lucidity to commit acts of violence.perhaps this is even the one actually great ""horror"" anime.very slow paced and minimally...animated, but incredibly dense on unnerving atmosphere, with occasional bursts of the grisliest, realistic violence ever put to animation.Hiroshi Hamasaki\'s off-kilter direction and the amazing minimalistic soundtrack, full of ominous chanting and percussion, take center stage and achieve an outright hypnotic effect.the show is the platonic ideal of a great, albeit incomplete, anime adaption - accurate to the source material, but with enough of a unique identity to warrant it\'s own existence. animated, but incredibly dense on unnerving atmosphere, with occasional bursts of the grisliest, realistic violence ever put to animation.Hiroshi Hamasaki\'s off-kilter direction and the amazing minimalistic soundtrack, full of ominous chanting and percussion, take center stage and achieve an outright hypnotic effect.the show is the platonic ideal of a great, albeit incomplete, anime adaption - accurate to the source material, but with enough of a unique identity to warrant it\'s own existence.', ""Be prepared, Shigurui: Death Frenzy is not for everyone. It's gruesomely violent, has very few redeemable or likeable characters, it's rapey, shockingly gory and has pretty much zero moments of humour.I also kind of loved it.The story takes place in the 1600's and follows a sensei who is training samurai in order to choose his eventual successor and the backstabbing, murder and betrayals going on in the background. That's the basic gist of it, i don't want to spoil anything.Pretty much every character is a psychopath especially the sensei, the fight scenes are so stylish and brutal and the tone and atmosphere so thick with...dread and tension that i do not blink when i watch this show.The violence really is extreme with dismemberment, eyeballs being slashed with swords (and eaten), jaws being detached from faces and characters having teeth stuck in their fists after delivering particularly hard blows to their opponents.It really isn't for sensitive viewers but if that sounds cool to you then....well it is pretty cool.I enjoyed the soundtrack too which is mostly traditional Japanese instruments and dark ambient drones which make it feel really intense.

So be wary of that if you pick it to watch.Shiguriu takes place in the Edo period and feels like a classic novel, it\'s not an adventure nor action packed, and after watching it I went straight to the manga (you will know why if you watch). The manga is a masterpiece on its own, and I thought how hard it would be build up the tension and suspense as Hamasaki does in the anime without the aid of timing and music, but then I realized the real challenge might have been how to transfer all the emotions to the animation without the use of a narrator. Even if the manga was completed by the time the anime came out (it wasn\'t), Hamasaki\'s directors cut couldn\'t be more precise, and it was truly a superb adaptation, extremely faithful but at the same time bringing this historical romance to new heights thanks to his skillful direction.I still loathe the slow pace and crypticness, and think for this series too the whole thing could be fit into a single movie and that movie would be awesome. Hamasaki became someone I love to hate, but now I\'m left to wonder if this part is not a necessary contrast to reach a greater climax. pieces of it were presented if could just endure this beginning.

This anime is not for weak stomach. If you are a sensitive soul dont even try to watch it.I dont think the 18+ is enough for this anime. Not just because of its goreness, but because of the series as a whole. This is definitely one of those which is made for mature audience. What did I say?

The characters were nothing special. The story was simple. The music was minimalistic, yet I really liked it because as a whole it had really uniquely dark atmoshpere which was captivating to me. It was really facinating to me how it depicted the chaotic and animalistic nature of the humanity without the strong rules what keep us in bay nowadays. The anime settings was just after the sengoku jidai which was really chaotic and brutal period in japan\'s history (Unlike in the movies, where the samurai is a hero and the embodiment of honor, which could not be further from the truth, except maybe a few cases). The show doesn’t try to moralize, it just shows things the way they are, in their unjust form.The story is really really slow, which is actually positive in this case. It lets you accommodate the experience. If you like long trashtalks between the villain and the protagonist, than this show is not for you. The flexing here is much more meta.

I was scouring the interwebs for shows comparable to Texhnolyze and Ergo Proxy and came upon Shigurui: Death Frenzy which boasted a gritty atmosphere, blood and gore, and all-around awesomeness, and while Shigurui is not as complex in and of itself, it does present the plot in very interesting ways, which has catapulted it to the heights of one of my favorite shows.[Story: 7/10] The plot of Shigurui is not a tremendously complicated plot in and of itself; it's...a story of revenge, a story of a deadly rivalry and a story of brutality. What does fascinate me about the story is the way in which it is presented. The first episode alone could be subject to an analysis on the usage and effectiveness of anachronisms (in the literary sense). The show constantly breaks away chronological order, scenes that are given emphasis are not necessarily the ones that advance the plot, even minor characters are established through frequent flashbacks and the ending… well, the ending. Without wishing to spoil too much, while the show does work with that ending, I cannot recommend reading the manga, for the continuation of what seems like a very abrupt and inconclusive ending. The plot has multiple layers of importance and should not be seen as the definitive starting and ending point of the entire story, but rather as the buildup, the sum of events that culminated in the important event: the meeting of our two rivals at the Tournament at Sunpu Castle (which in turn is but a minor parenthesis in the larger story of a Japanese feudal Lord). The story is not what kept me watching, though, and were it not presented so effectively it would probably have made for a boring anime.[Characters: 8/10] Let’s meet the gang! Our party consists of three (maybe four) main characters, two of which we meet at the in medias res beginning of the show: Irako Seigen and Gennosuke, the two rivals whose conflicts and struggles have led them to meet at the Tournament at Sunpu Castle to fight on last battle to the death. A third main character is their Sensei Iwamoto Kogan. Irako is the handsome, arrogant and ambitious man on the surface, with goals that show his hubris, but also reveal a genuine desire to right the wrongs he feels have been committed against him by a brutal feudalistic society. Gennosuke is the stoic and fierce warrior who is above all else loyal to his Master Kogan and his daughter Iwamoto Mie (the arguable fourth main character). He is closest to what this show has to offer in terms of a good guy, but there are not good or bad guys in this show. There are evil guys, sure, but no one that could be unequivocally be labelled the villain. There are only conflicting motivations and as simplistic as those motivations might be, they are believable. The cast of secondary characters is solid.What I love most about the primary and secondary cast of Shigurui: Death Frenzy is the fact that there is something very apparently wrong with each and every one of them. It starts with the very prominent physical deformities and disfigurements: the main characters, Fujiki with is missing left arm, Irako with his lame foot and blindness, Kogan with his six fingers on his right hand. Many of the secondary characters are also disfigured, thick scars, missing jaws, cheeks slashed open and so on. The flesh truly does reflect the madness. Every character has something wrong with them. If it’s not physical, then it’s with the very unsettling way they speak, stare at you, or behave. I have seen a review complaining about how the characters feel more like wax figures than actual people and I’d almost agree, except I don’t take the comparison as an insult, but rather think it works towards the overall tense and unsettling tone of the show.[Art: 7/10] What I always like about an anime is when the various characters are distinguishable by more than just their ridiculous hairdos and Shigurui accomplishes this quite well. You can tell each character apart at a glance and the visuals complement each character’s individuality.The show is also brimming with visual symbolism, some of which might be lost on the average viewer. I for one wasn’t able to pick up on what all the imagery of insects and spiders means in the context of the plot, but I have read some essays, that explain how each of the visual metaphors play an important role to the story, so I feel like I can’t complain. The viewer will probably ask themselves, why they are being shown pictures of various bugs all throughout the show, but apparently it is not empty imagery.One disappointment I have with this show is how most of the fight scenes are handled in terms of their animation. For many viewers the cliché of drawn out tension building, followed by a few quick cuts with little animation or even still images, will leave the impression of being incredibly lazy. If you’re looking for gloriously animated fight scenes, you will be disappointed. Now, I get it, the build up obviously contributes to the atmosphere. Also, while not explicit, the supernatural abilities of the characters plays an important role, in that it is quite heavily suggested that the characters move with supernatural, impossible to follow speed, which in some of the quick-cut fight scenes is actually portrayed quite well. However, some of the scenes, with still images and slight animation in lieu of an intriguing fight “choreography” left me a bit wanting, especially when contrasted with the high-octane musical backing.The major flaw with this anime, however, are with the blood effects. For an anime with such a heavy emphasis on blood and gore, the fact that in many scenes the blood looks like some absurd thick syrupy sludge is really distracting and gets in the way of my enjoyment of the show. Seriously, there are some scenes, which almost made me laugh out loud, because the blood looked so dumb and unreal that any weight and impact they were supposed to have were lost. Now, not every bloody scene is bad, some of the blood and gore is actually very impactful, which leads me to believe, that the blood effects were a deliberate artistic choice rather than sheer incompetence and that baffles me. One scene in episode three has one dude getting his forehead slashed open, and the way the shiny glistening blood pumps out in regular beats, as if he had a second heart in his skull subtracted from the tension of the scene. The scenes with heavy gore and visible organs (oh, lovely) are done quite a bit better, but unfortunately, I am left feeling a bit disappointed.[Sound: 10/10] This to me is the undisputed highlight of Shigurui: Death Frenzy. For an anime with tension, atmosphere and a slow pace, knowing when to accentuate certain moments with certain music is crucial and this show pulls it off masterfully. Slow drumbeats, throat singing and discordant lute chords; Shigurui knows exactly when to add to the disquieting atmosphere and knows when to play up the occasional action-packed moments with fast paced scores as well. But what the show arguably does even better is knowing when to have no music, silence is sometimes louder than anything else after all, and some tense scenes play out without any musical, which only serves to make them more tense. The transitions from no music, to slight musical elements as the tension increases is so subtle at times, that the viewer may be forgiven for not even noticing. If I had to point out some faults, it would be the OP track, which I always skip, and the fact, that complementary as they are to the anime’s atmosphere, most of the songs might not lend themselves well to independent listening. I still listen to them, because I like this kind of stuff, but if you are looking for some catchy anime OST tunes, then you might be left disappointed.[Personal enjoyment: 10/10] This is always the most subjective part of a review, which far from being irrelevant I believe is where one can justify a rating higher than what the rating of the more (though still not completely) objective criteria might suggest. I absolutely fucking love Shigurui, despite its flaws, which I do absolutely acknowledge. I had been looking for another show in the general vein of Ergo Proxy and Texhnolyze and while Shigurui: Death Frenzy is a very different show in most ways, the tense atmosphere and disturbing imagery are the two main factors that make this show so enjoyable for me. A definitive recommendation for anyone looking for a show that isn’t afraid to drag the viewer by the hair into the dark corners of anime, then Shigurui: Death Frenzy is definitely worth watching.[9/10] a story of revenge, a story of a deadly rivalry and a story of brutality. What does fascinate me about the story is the way in which it is presented. The first episode alone could be subject to an analysis on the usage and effectiveness of anachronisms (in the literary sense). The show constantly breaks away chronological order, scenes that are given emphasis are not necessarily the ones that advance the plot, even minor characters are established through frequent flashbacks and the ending… well, the ending. Without wishing to spoil too much, while the show does work with that ending, I cannot recommend reading the manga, for the continuation of what seems like a very abrupt and inconclusive ending. The plot has multiple layers of importance and should not be seen as the definitive starting and ending point of the entire story, but rather as the buildup, the sum of events that culminated in the important event: the meeting of our two rivals at the Tournament at Sunpu Castle (which in turn is but a minor parenthesis in the larger story of a Japanese feudal Lord). The story is not what kept me watching, though, and were it not presented so effectively it would probably have made for a boring anime.[Characters: 8/10] Let’s meet the gang! Our party consists of three (maybe four) main characters, two of which we meet at the in medias res beginning of the show: Irako Seigen and Gennosuke, the two rivals whose conflicts and struggles have led them to meet at the Tournament at Sunpu Castle to fight on last battle to the death. A third main character is their Sensei Iwamoto Kogan. Irako is the handsome, arrogant and ambitious man on the surface, with goals that show his hubris, but also reveal a genuine desire to right the wrongs he feels have been committed against him by a brutal feudalistic society.

While there is so much gore, it hardly happens in swordfights but all kind of violent situations along the way. The show focuses mostly on establishing on this calm, unsettling atmosphere like in Seriel Experiments Lain or Kurozuka, wich is quite to my liking. Most of the sword fights consist of the characters meditating / starring at each other and are suddenly over in one blow.Unfortunately this super slow story telling really eats on the enjoyment in the long run. The more episodes you watch, the more it becomes a drag. The story...from these 12 episodes could have been told in 4 to 5 episodes and we are also faced with some major plotholes. So if you enjoy the atmosphere in the shows of Yasuyuki Ueda and Hiroshi Hamasaki, this one might be for you. from these 12 episodes could have been told in 4 to 5 episodes and we are also faced with some major plotholes.

The show just jumps into the past in a disconnected way that scrambles what little story it actually had. In the past we're shown what, presumably led to the duel, but we never get answers, and the ending doesn't say anything about the outcome.At times I found myself wondering what would happen next, but usually I was disappointed.The story was quite poorly written and unnecessarily gory, which the art style supplemented. I don't mind gore, but...this was just gore for the sake of making it disturbing and edgy. The art itself was passable, but I wouldn't write home about it.Most of the characters had little to no personality or backstory, and those that had some had bad stories that did not give an explanation to their actions, for the most part.I just couldn't really like this steaming pile of fresh guts that someone thought was a good idea to make, and I don't understand why so many like it, but I would say this is a divisive show. It's probably one of those where either you like it or you hate it. this was just gore for the sake of making it disturbing and edgy.

It's probably one of those where either you like it or you hate it."", ""Oh boy, where to start with this one. I signed up to review it, so here we go. I'm currently reading the manga for this one, and while I initially enjoyed this adaptation (the first two episodes were super promising!) I found it to be quite detestable in the way it handled the plot and characters of this series overall.Art and Sound Design - 9/10These were, in my opinion, the main strong points of the show. You have high quality Studio Madhouse animations and art, which lovingly render a blend of 2D art with select moments of 3D (usually for gore) that lend an edge...of uncanny valley to the gory scenes often portrayed in this show. Of which there were a lot. It paints a brutal takedown of the idea of the 'noble samurai in service of his lord', and almost everything shown here is in service of that goal. The palette is washed out, casting everything into a brilliant, uncanny white, or the dull browns of half-light. Interiors are often gloomy, decrepit greyscale. It lends the work a certain dreamlike quality, but... more on that in a minute.The sound design evokes the period the show is depicting in a way the manga honestly couldn't replicate, due to the limits of the medium. It's minimalist, using traditional instruments from the period to build tension in a way that's reminiscent of wild west films, or samurai flicks, an irony that does not escape me given the story's themes. It's unobtrusive for the most part, but still evokes emotion in a more subconscious way than some more bombastic anime.So... why would I rate this a 5/10? Because of everything else. Because the story is needlessly obtuse in a way that the work it adapts just... isn't. Because it did a terrible job of making me care about any of the generally unlikeable fanatics this world is populated with. Because for all its amazing animation, portrayal of male-presenting nipples, anime people who look like actual Japanese people, and sheer unflinching brutality, it spends more time lingering on scenes of graphic sexual assault than it does on the core conflict it's meant to be setting up.The Story 5/10The story meanders all over the place for an extended period towards the middle of this series. As I have since read the source material, I can tell you this is solely a problem with this adaptation, for context. It's a pacing issue that lead me dangerously close to uttering the six deadly words, 'I don't care about these people'. Yes, people are maimed and tortured at the whims of uncaring madmen, while the idea of 'loyalty' is messily deconstructed, but at some point it began to feel more like the animators wanted to stretch out the sexual assault scenes for as long as they could. The plot felt aimless or plain nonexistent, ending with a whimper, telling you to go read the manga. This was because a large amount of background information for the world seems to have been cut to make way for more totes radical animation and vaguely surrealist moments. This has a horrible knock-on effect on:The Characters 4/10The characters in this show are, by and large, presented as mute psychopaths with nary a human bone in their body (apart from the ones that occasionally surface violently through their skin). I get it, it's a dark show. But even dark stuff needs some form of attachment to its characters. For context, the source material has a lot of internal monologue, personal philosophy, etc. Almost none of this is present, or at best, feelings are vaguely alluded to in mild facial tics and body language. As someone viewing this with no context initially, the show gave me almost nothing to work with. There were a couple of characters who were sympathetic due to their wretched circumstances, but Madhouse seemed more intent on forcing the viewer to wallow in their suffering than they did in developing anyone in particular. The main conflict feels barely touched upon, because this adapts a short stretch of the manga, and it leaves the characters involved in that conflict poorly fleshed out as a result. That leaves the conflict between loyalty and free will, of people striving against a slavish cultural devotion to duty - the thing meant to be driving the story- seem tepid and aimless. The characters really are puppets in this one.Enjoyment 5/10Shigurui came off as something like a weird, brutal indie arthouse project. It's enjoyable for those reasons, but it also felt pretentious to me. It's needlessly obtuse with its visuals, seemingly for the sole purpose of being 'artistic'. I didn't mind that the fights often end in a single stroke. That's what happens when people use swords on unarmored bodies. I did mind how often people seemed to get molested, and how the camera felt the need to linger over that in a way it never did with scenes of murder. It's kinda like Ninja Scroll in that way. Rape on display for mostly its own sake.Overall 5/10I'm sorry for mentioning the manga so much in this, but when the show ended abruptly, leaving me feeling mildly robbed, I needed to know what the hell just happened and why. It's just that I'm only now realizing what could have been done with this show, and why the end result felt lackluster. It was okay while I watched it (most of the time) but only after I got to the 'read the manga' ending did I realize how many important character moments and how much dialogue was cut out of this adaptation. It's okay if you want to watch samurai you don't care about get murderized in very flashy ways, or see lovingly animated girls get molested, go for it, but I wouldn't recommend this anime as a faithful adaptation of its source material. It's not awful by itself. It's... average, by way of being both great and terrible at the same time. It got myself and my partner to check out what it was adapting, and that's... better than nothing I guess? We're not likely to get a second season, so I'd say, save yourself the effort in divining the entrails on what scene X 'really means' and just read the manga instead.

However, was '𝘚𝘩𝘪𝘨𝘶𝘳𝘶𝘪' able to effectively immerse the viewer and tell a compelling tale? In some ways yes, otherwise, mostly not.The strongest aspects of the show as previously stated, are the artistic elements, but they are certainly not without their drawbacks. The soundtrack is solid and is reminiscent of what the Edo era would sound like, it is also applied...appropriately to what is happening in a scene. However, there was one or two tracks which whilst sounded good, featured immersion breaking electric/synthesizer, mixed into the song. The soundtrack by the end of the series also felt repetitive as there was little distinction between tracks, and sometimes the sound mixing felt poor.The art of the show matched the tone nearly perfectly, muted colours in contrast with the emphasis of blood (deep red), excess of shadows and blinding lights, and unique X-ray shots, these were all suitable, however the 'generic anime character designs' were fairly unambitious, when a more 'grittier' character style would have been more suitable (something like '𝘔𝘦𝘨𝘢𝘭𝘰𝘣𝘰𝘹' in character design).The area where '𝘚𝘩𝘪𝘨𝘶𝘳𝘶𝘪' egregiously fails, is in creating an interesting narrative with interesting characters. Characters were mostly boring and felt as if they had no character, either due to lack of development or poor writing (there were also multiple times where I was unable to recognize a character even though I watched the entire show in two days).

It is full of nonsense flashbacks that make you get lost in the story so you cannot focus on the plot.The animation is very shiny at the day and very dark at night (maybe because the 1600's years and shogunate period ambience that reflect the fact of having no electric power and roads made with rocks that reflect too much the light of the sun).I don't like specially samurai anime but...i have curiosity, if you are truly in love with the history of the shogunate and samurai era watch it without hesitation and read the manga, if is not the case you better watch some shoujo or shonen i have curiosity, if you are truly in love with the history of the shogunate and samurai era watch it without hesitation and read the manga, if is not the case you better watch some shoujo or shonen"", 'If you want a concise review that isn\'t riddled with vague pseudo-intellectual nonsense, read this one.It\'s basically a tragedy where apprentices compete for being the heir of a renowned sword dojo, with a twist on the story.The atmosphere is extremely cruel.

It's dark, violent, gore-y, rape-y and showcases the cruelty and callousness of humanity. You'll feel bad for some characters, possibly even root for them, and for others, hope for their downfall.The plot is one of revenge, pride, and power. There's a lot of fodder characters who get slayed, but the core main characters are pretty interesting. We come to know their emotions and motives. Rather than a linear progression, the anime begins with an introduction of two handicapped samurai who are about to engage in battle, then the story follows their rivalry while meandering into backstories.The traditional Japanese...OST is excellent and totally sets the mood: amplifying the intensity of what is happening on the screen.I enjoyed the suspense and uneasy intense atmosphere of Shigurui.

Its trying really hard to depict a brutal time in Japans history and trying way to hard. This anime has a lot of horrible scenes.  So if you are a little sensitive to extreme violence or sexual assault, some of which is at the same time then for a start this isn't for you.  Equally, if you like shows with great animation and great story telling coupled with great character development, this show also isn't for you.Ill start with the only positive and to be fair, its still not great....The music is minimal here and attempts to provide tension and a sense of foreboding.  Instead you just get bored of hearing it.  It may be hindered by the fact that what is accompanying the music is mindnumbingly uninteresting, but still, its gets really boring.  Don't get me wrong, i appreciate what it is trying to do, and in some circumstances do a good job with the atmosphere.  Sadly, its more of a miss than than a hit. 5/10Animation is a shocker from Madhouse, which i never thought i would say.  Every scene is always really close to the characters.  This provides little context to the visual element of story telling in anime.  Further, most of this is inside dark rooms with absolutely zero character.  Sadly, even if there is the possibility of some textural character, you can barely see it due to how close the characters appear to the 'camera'.  A lot of the time scenes go by without even seeing the characters full face.  I am assuming this too is to create tension in the dialogue or the story but its just really irritating for me.  Moving on to the violence etc, its just unnecessary.  I have no issue with depicting such things providing they serve a purpose either for the narrative of the tone of the show, here it really doesn't and comes across as trying way to hard at the cost of a controlling the tone and atmosphere of the show. 3/10Moving on the the story...its just really boring.  I didn't care about the characters, all of which are unlikable.  No attempt was made to get you invested in any character and i get it, its trying so so hard to depict the times of the shows setting, its just really boring.  I haven't been as bored watching an anime in a while.Overall, I thought this was rubbish.  Definitely not the worst i have seen, but not too far off.  Its baffling to me how the aggregated score is so high.  Clearly my feelings towards this are closer to the minority.

Tales of Zestiria: Doushi no Yoake,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24459/Tales_of_Zestiria__Doushi_no_Yoake,"[""First time ever writing a review, figure it's a new year, time to try writing reviews. Ok, that aside, on with the review:This will be spoiler-free, rest assured.Story: 6/10There isn't much to say about the story - it builds up a world, but it's only within the framework of roughly 40 minutes or so. Much doesn't really happen; there is a small direct conflict physically portrayed in the episode, and then the conflict mentioned but not shown as part of the world-setting/backdrop.Given that this episode was released under the pretense of promoting a JRPG that's to be released in late-January, it does a...good job in that regard. However, as a stand-alone, the episode leaves much to be desired, despite concluding the small-scale story presented within the context of the episode.Art: 9/10This is my second time watching a Ufotable work, the first being the new Fate UBW. The art is rather familiar in regards to UBW - the characters are well-drawn, complemented by very appealing backdrops, from the Castle-in-the-Sky-reminiscent ruins to the cloud-covered landscapes. The last scene of the world following the credits deserves much praise - it really sets up the feeling of the adventure about to begin.Sound: 8/10Epic. Generic? Maybe. The tracks used to compliment the scenes worked well, and that's all that matters in my book. VERY reminiscent of video game music, and with good reason.Characters: 6/10My issues with the characters are the same with the story - there's only 40 minutes of material to observe. While archetypes are present, they aren't expanded upon, given the nature of the length of the episode. Nothing remarkable with the characters, truth be told.Enjoyment: 8/10As a prequel episode so-to-speak promoting the game, I had a good time. The whole episode felt like a fleshed-out opening cutscene for a video game. The action sequences weren't particularly amazing but still kept me watching. The build-up of the setting was fun - as someone who is a sucker for epic-type storytelling, watching this episode was definitely a good time.Overall: 8/10The episode fulfills its role well, given its limitations. I'll definitely be on the lookout for a sequel, should an anime be made from the JRPG. good job in that regard.

This obviously serves as...an introduction to them, the world of Zestiria and where they stand in it currently. Not going to give synopsis I don't do that, just know as far as an introduction as an anime I say it gets the job down making me interested in the three main characters that I will probably be playing with first when I start to play the game.Art and Animation (9/10) GreatC'mon people.. it's Ufotable we are talking about here. I should just leave it there and move on to the next category but what the hey let's give credit where credit is due. Ufotable once get hits us with a really well animated and anime adaptation of a video game. Apparently they've been doing anime adaptations for the Tales of series for a while now and I can see why Bandai Namco allows them to they do a great job. It's probably why Badai Namco allowed them to animated God Eater also.. but we aren't going to talk about that lol. Anyway the artstyle is easy on the eye and the little fighting they we got to see in this 40 someodd minutes OVA was great, yeah there could have been more but I understand why it was so little. Plus as far as I heard Zestiria is getting a full anime adaptation next year so expect everything you want from that adaptation version. But as far as we got the the sword play choreography and animation behind it we get to see from the MC Sorey was great and the CG animated spell attacks from Mikleo were great also, they really get you hyped if you are going to play the game in the future.Sound (9/10) GreatThe music chosen for certain scene I thought were spot on. Nothing that blew my mind but not everything needs to. It had a lot of laid back moments in this OVA so laid back music from the OST was played and during the conflict of the OVA it definitely sounded like a song I'll be hearing when I play this game, playing a Tales game before I know what those type of songs sound like and it was quite authentic.Characters (8/10) Very GoodThe characters Sorey, Mikleo and Alisha all kind of remind me of combination of characters from Tales of Hearts R whether it's in appearance or initial personality.Sorey I felt a combination of Kor and Kunzite(Kor resemblance - a brown hair main character who finds an unconscious girl)(Kunzite resemblance - i little bit ignorant in regular behavior but knowledge on the lore of his universe)Mikleo I felt a combination of Chalcedony and Hisui(Chalcedony resemblance - A little bit in appearance but with white hair and he also gives off the same vibe as Chalcedony)(Hisui resemblance - He's the second male main character we are introduced to that fights along side the MC in a friendly rival type of way. And it looks like Sorey and Mikleo brothers Sorey being adopted? I mean you have to assume that Kor eventually got with Kohaku thus being brother in laws with Hisui in the future no? Assumptions that's all they are i know but not far-fetched predictions on what proabbly happened lol)Alisha I felt a combination of Kohaku and Chalcedony(Kohaku resemblance - The first female character met by the MC unconscious, kind of shy at first, slowly opens up ehh Kohaku kinda opened up quickly tho but anyway, they both don't showcase any of their combat abilities at the beginning of each story)(Chalcedony resemblance - Obviously the obvious on that both Alisha and Chalcedony belong some sort of Kingdom but that's probably where it ends anything else is debatable)Funny how these characters remind me of a combination of previous Tales of Characters when the new gimmick for Tales of Zestiria is to fuse/combine characters together LOL. Anyway NONETHELESS even though they remind me of previous Tales characters that's not looked at as a flaw to me they were still unique in their own way and will most likely have unique character development like the Hearts R roster.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodI feel I got good enjoyment out of this OVA, I would assume it's definitely more enjoyable if you are about to dive into this universe of Zestiria like I am in a few hours but for someone who isn't it is debatable if they would get any enjoyment pass a 7 but all it is is an introduction so hopefully they take this with consideration.Overall (8/10) Very GoodSo like I said before the purpose of this OVA was most likely to introduce you to the first few hours of Tales of Zestiria I'll be surprised if the video game doesn't start off the exact same way this OVA did because then I'll have some questions, I felt this was a very good starting point to the story. an introduction to them, the world of Zestiria and where they stand in it currently.

It is one of the most emotionally soothing anime I’ve seen in a very long time. Utter and complete bliss throughout, and my life will be worse off without it on Wednesdays.There’s several things that really stand out about Saint Cecilia and Pastor Lawrence. For starters, it’s one of the few anime I’ve seen that actually depicts Christianity(not explicitly stated, but clearly is) in a decent light. The role of the saints and pastors is to help townspeople with their spiritual issues and be a general pillar of support for the...community. Other than the magical elements of the story, I actually think they nailed what churches meant to small 19th century towns.The other thing that stands out for me is just how warm and fuzzy this show makes you feel. Cecilia and Lawrence’s relationship is so delicate and pure you just can’t help but root for him to stop being an idiot and accept her feelings. But even with him being oblivious, just seeing their daily activities and home life is more than enough. It’s “slice of life” in the truest sense of the word. It really feels like we are just watching two people who’ve suffered loss, find a new family with each other.Simple, seemingly mundane daily tasks like cleaning and cooking feel so nice in this because of the relationship between the two leads. There’s a few side-quest-esque episodes where the cast leave the main town and meet new characters, but for the most part the story is really self contained to the village. Coincidentally, those those few episodes where we did leave the village and learn about how unique Cecilia’s life as a saint was, were really the most emotional. There’s a couple episodes that almost had me in tears.While the cast is small, the two main side characters, Hazelita and Abel were great. They both basically act as stand-ins for the audience who just want to see Cecilia and Lawrence finally end up together. Had so much fun watching Hazelita play matchmaker behind the scenes, and the budding feelings between she and Abel were also great. There’s a really cool dynamic that exists between Hazelita and Cecilia and Abel and Lawrence as well.It’s Doga Kobo so you know the art is top notch. It’s bright, cheerful and has so much positive energy. The seiyuu castings were spot on as well, adding a lot of life to every conversation between the characters. The studio really created a pleasant experience with this one and big emphasis on “experience” I think watching this show is a spiritually healing experience that made my Wednesdays so much better. I’ll miss it. A must watch for any SOL or romance fan.Shiroseijyo gets 9 out of 10 community.

Our FMC is a saint and MC takes care of her as a priest. The rest of the anime is a relaxing romcom with a little bit of drama/lore.ReviewThe anime mixes 3 different genres and it does it so in a way, that feels very natural.1. Iyashikei( calming Slice of Life): All the characters...are positive and appreciate everything around them. The way they all care about each other is heart warming and provide us with plenty of warm and fuzzy moments. This part of the show feels like those relaxing village anime (Non Non Biyori, Barakamon etc..) which just show our cast doing something fun or going around the town/village meeting various characters.2. RomCom: You can definitely see the tropes of a High school romcom in this show. Our MC is dense and everyone except him know about the saint\'s feelings. Our Saint also keeps up the appearance in front of everyone, but starts lazing around when alone with MC. The best friend of MC (blonde priest) is smart, but also clumsy. These three are the main running gags of the show and always keep the atmosphere bright and energetic. It is not LMAO comedy, but its good enough to maintain a smile on your face while watching and leaving you in a better mood after you finish an episode.3. Mystery: It seems there are nobles who will try to exploit the saints and their blessings. The show also establishes multiple times that our MC is special somehow. Both of these supernatural elements add some drama and a serious mysterious vibe to this show. This was a pleasant surprise to me, because despite this dark undertone, the show still maintains its happy and pleasant atmosphere. The world is also a little bit weird. Despite being a fantasy, there are modern amenities electricity, lights, stoves, cameras etc.. At the same time, the people travel in horse carts, send letters to each other like its middle ages. IDK if this is a writing inconsistency or an active choice.This show has great characters, good setting and decent writing. The Opening and Ending are also really good (might want to listen to them once even if you don\'t watch the show). The art/animation looks slightly generic, but still colorful and scenic. It atleast has more care put into it, compared to an average isekai or highschool romcom.If you are a person who loves ""slow life fantasy romcom"", then this is a must watch this season. I was very hesitant to start this show because it felt too generic on the surface, but fortunately, it has a solid start which hooked me in and the consistent quality throughout (atleast until episode 5 as of this moment) keeps me coming back.

Just the first episode should be enough to judge if its to your taste or not.', ""I know what you're thinking: our Dear Lord Jesus Christ loves all people regardless of sins, so how can Christianity be marketed to one of the least probable countries of the world: the Land of the Rising Sun? Given how much the religion was once persecuted in Japan as one of the most secular nations in the world, then opening up in blazes with the acceptance of other communities and denominations like Catholicism and Protestantism, it's no secret that the Japanese, primarily of either the Shinto or Buddhism faith, are particularly cautious of its approach, even in AniManga where the most prominent relation is mangaka...Hikaru Nakamura's acclaimed manga of Saint☆Oniisan a.k.a Saint☆Young Men.In this Summer season, there is a new challenger to share the good faith of Christian contemporaries, and that lies with author Hazano Kazutake's Shiro Seijo to Kuro Bokushi a.k.a Saint Cecilia and Pastor Lawrence, of which he/she would go on to be one of the illustrators to the work/source material that is one of this Winter's most notable shows: Otonari no Tenshi-sama a.k.a The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten. And I've gotta say that this show is one pure, decadent Iyashikei a.k.a slow-life, slice-of-life series that is unapologetic to its nature and themes of being akin to watching and listening to Christian sermons, but if conducted in anime form.Don't let the simple nature of this show fool you into thinking that this has nothing to offer other than the simple rom-com aesthetics that's plastered everywhere, thanks to the show's titular yet peculiar MCs: Lady Saint Cecilia and Pastor Lawrence. As expected of being figures in their small town of a close-knit community, both the Lady Saint and Pastor are the centre of attention whenever they are run into on the streets. But as soon as they're back at the church (or its more appropriate form, chapel) and communion rooms, they are not what you expect them to be: Cecilia is the Lady Saint who just wants to laze and daydream, whereas Lawrence is every bit as dense as he comes, for a fact that Cecilia adores and loves him from even close distances, but for the whack that Lawrence doesn't get things like love and romance. Yeah right, talk about keeping up the facade and converting back into their faith whenever people are involved within sight.Of course, that's not to say that both Cecilia and Lawrence have their limelight alone. Meet Lawrence's friend Abel, who's just as much as both a smart aleck and a joker, being in the same profession as fellow pastors dealing with their own issues. As to Abel's issues, he's the one doing the teaching as a home tutor, most particularly to a house of nobles: the Aldridge family with younger sister Hazelita, whose older brother Gieselbert is a rather uncomfortable sis-con obsession of a sibling. That said, Hazelita is another girl worth protecting, as her kind yet unforgiving nature sometimes creates worries for the people around her, though she is always the straight girl who sits in the middle of Cecilia and Lawrence's romantic problems. I really adore Hazelita's character quite a lot.The simple nature of the show also gives rise to one of its appeals: the mystery-fantasy factor. You see, lady saints exist to protect the people, especially those who have been given divine powers, and the people have to do the same and vice versa. But just like the world itself, which doesn't think straight, lady saints can also get persecuted if their roles are wrongly committed, and/or even worse, they can get exploited by the nobles in higher power in regard to their blessings, which is the direct discourse of a lady saint's role. This is the sole reason why Lawrence was raised to this tradition by his late grandfather since he was young, and the way that he treats Cecilia is the same for the most part, while not being completely absent from her growing feelings towards him; she treats him as her saviour for trusting in her intuition.When it comes to adapting 4-koma a.k.a 4-panel manga, Doga Kobo always finds a way to make this one of the studio's core traits, simply because they have been masters at it for years now. Simply put, the anime is pretty, gorgeously beautiful, but I can't help but feel that the art style has looked the same since Winter 2019's Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita! a.k.a WataTen! An Angel Flew Down to Me (that's exclusive to 4-koma adaptations), which while isn't a bad thing to keep improving upon it, it's a formula that I have a hunch that this show will not be the last time that Doga Kobo will re-use WataTen!'s reference designs.On the music front, I've heard better songs from ClariS, not to say that their OP song here is bad. Even sasanomaly's ED song, while exhibiting the soothing Iyashikei feels, it's a simple, mellow song that does its job. Poppy, cheerful music that fans of either music artists will love, but sorry, I'm not one of them.If you hate generic rom-coms, this is definitely a show to keep away from. But above all, a rom-com with Christianity themes on display, it's a unique take on a 4-koma manga that's now 6.5 years old (as of this review). Simple shows like this get their job done right and can be downright enjoyable without any pretences or any kind of overblown drama.Heretics, be gone!

Saint Cecilia and Pastor Lawrance or Shiro Seijo to Kuro Bokushi is a unique romance anime in a mix between a fantasy world and reality featuring a small European village’s pastor and a “lady saint” in a strange marketable Christian show adapted from a 4-koma.Plot 6/10The show is extremely simple. It’s a romance show, there isn’t much story. Cecilia is missionary of God who helps the people. After a long struggle to save a community causes her to become exhausted, she ends up in a small village where...the local community’s backbone, a church’s pastor – Lawrance – takes her in and looks after her throughout the rest of the show. I can’t say I really cared for all the religious references, but the utter overprotective and adorable nature of their relationship really saves what little story was; so, you can pretty much forgive it not existing. The simple nature of the story does allow it to develop slightly and give way to an element of mystery as it explains some concepts such as “divine protection” and a few characters backstories, but unfortunately by the time it does that all you want to see is Lawrance and Cecilia interacting.Characters 7/10The show is mainly centred around this lovely close-knit community featuring a few notable characters. Cecilia is absolutely adorable, and all her interactions are the only reason you’d be watching this show. She has a fair bit of depth behind all of the extremely red faces, a “lady saint” – a messenger of God sent to protect the people who can bestow her protection on people and someone who can’t stop lazing around when not having to put on the extreme sparkle-inducing front that is the Lady Saint. Lawrence is the village’s pastor and the backbone of the village, he gives more to the table than the average black haired self-insert but is still dense as ever when it comes to any form of romance. The other main pair – Haiselita & Abel don’t really scream romantic interactions at all but provide a nice straight reality into the romcom problems experienced by the 2 main characters. I quite enjoyed these two as Abel is designed to be a “tutor” but is the stupidest character in the show and Hasielita is some fancy rich noble with an obsessive sister-complex brother; she is pretty much the embodiment of the audience getting irritated at how dense Lawrence is. As a result of such contrast, the chemistry they provide is great. Finally, the cast of side characters doesn’t leave much room for desires. A dress maker and her son, a fortune teller and several other reappearing characters heighten the show and solidifies that close-knit community that gives the show a great feeling to watch.Art & Animation 7/10It looks good - It’s not bad, It’s not amazing. Just good. The art style aims to be quite vibrant and cutesy which it does well - quite nice to look at.Music & Sound 7/10Still Pretty okay, the intro and outro aren’t Spotify playlist material by any means but they get the job done. I’m not even going to lie to you I did not pick up on the background music as well – I suppose it succeeded on the “background” quite well.Closing ThoughtsWell I never expected Christianity to be marketed in an anime, but I think they’ve done it well. If you hate romcoms - don’t even try it. If you like romcoms – give it a shot, this could be one of the better shows where you want to punch the main character for being so dense. I personally had quite a bit of fun watching this, the interactions cured my daily depression and the anime resulted in 0 progress between Cecilia and Lawrence.Score: 7/10 - Good the local community’s backbone, a church’s pastor – Lawrance – takes her in and looks after her throughout the rest of the show.

As a studio, Doga Kobo is a personal favorite of mine, so I was more than willing to check out Shiro Seijo to Kuro Bokushi. They are the creme de la creme of CGDCT and/or wholesome slow life anime at the moment, the synopsis reaffirming my feelings once again, anticipating another relaxing and funny Doga Kobo...adaptation. They ""heal"" you, so to speak, washing away the stress and exhaustion of another day of slaving away at work, unfortunately, there was no such healing this time around.The sole reason is Lawrence, one of the two main characters in this show and our Male protagonist. He\'s also voiced by Kaito Ishikawa, somebody that I am so sick of hearing these days, it feels like he\'s in every 3rd show I watch, it was a double whammy personally, punched in the gut twice.The reason I didn\'t like Lawrence, was simply because of how dense he was. Whether it be towards Cecilia\'s obvious feelings for him, friends throwing hints or questioning him, etc, it just did not matter, this dude took thick-headedness to the next level. Think of any other dense MC you know of and times that by ten, that\'s Lawrence. As a direct result to all this, Lawrence acts like a worried and overprotective parent all damn season, no matter what Cecilia did or didn\'t do, it was overbearing and frustrating to watch, which made it difficult to care or enjoy the small sparks of romance that would sporadically happen every now and then. ""Seijo Sama, careful where you walk, Seijo Sama, leave some space for dinner, Seijo Sama, time to get up now, Seijo Sama Seijo Sama Seijo Sama"", literally a parent taking care of a child.This sort of density wouldn\'t usually bother me so much, in such a laid back anime, an anime that lacks a serious plot, and I felt that way in the first couple episodes, but it really just got to be too much. It\'s more of a threshold thing IMO, some won\'t care at all, others won\'t be able to stand it. It seemed so counterproductive to me, you want to relax or laugh, but then Lawrence does something moronic for the 127th time, ruining any chance of relaxation lol...He does show tiny amounts of progress, and you do get something out of it in the final episode, but by then I was already long gone.It is a very aesthetically pleasing anime, I will give it that. Adorable character designs, simplistic but vibrant artwork, cozy enough soundtrack, it ticks all the boxes there. I don\'t think I\'ve ever been let down by Doga Kobo in this regard.Overall, it was a pretty disappointing experience, Hazano Kazutake\'s first adaptation excluding artwork that they\'ve done for other projects like ""The Angel Next Door"".

I loved the relation between Lawren and the Saint, it is absolutely adorable.The background of the characters is unique, since it’s being told from the perspective of the church. Usually represented as being a negative body of influence and corruption or in a gothic aspect. A really refreshing perspective.If I had to change something; I would just keep the entire anime between the Saint and Lawren and shorten the episodes, but that’s just me. Otherwise, it’s a great show nothing too...crazy and nothing too boring. crazy and nothing too boring.', ""The Hot Vicar of Dibley.If you’re looking for a slice-of-life rom-com that is cute but predictable, safe and at times a bit boring then here is Saint Cecilia and Pastor Lawrence.The story revolves around Pastor Lawrence who lives with and looks after Cecilia, a mythical Saint said to be sent by god to solve the people's problems. However, Cecilia harbours an enormous crush on Lawrence who is so dense you could mistake him for rock. This is the beginning and the end of the joke spread over twelve episodes.Okay, that's a bit harsh. The show can be very funny in that cute way...most competent moé shows are. Studio Doga Kobo may not be pushing the boat out in terms of art and animation compared to the monster anime they made last season “Oshi no Ko”, but the painted backgrounds are pretty and the character expressions are very lively, charming and fun. Especially Cecilia, who is adorable.This anime nails the first episode introducing her as a kind, saintly, almost divine figure to the people of the village contrasting her adorably lazy and gluttonous self she only shows Lawrence when they’re alone. Abel and Aldridge don’t add much to the dynamic when they’re introduced apart from giving Cecilia and Lawerence some other people to talk to, but theirs and the villager's efforts to drop obvious hints about Cecilia’s obvious affection for Lawerence to the Paster can be very charming.There’s some light world-building. Saints can communicate with angels/fairies in the form of little light blobs and also the dead later on(?). Still, it is mostly that sort of diet Christian-inspired religious inspiration anime uses but doesn’t fully commit to probably for Japanese historical cultural reasons.Saint Cecilia and Pastor Lawrence is fine. The first episode is really good but after that, it settles into genre tropes you see in most slice-of-life rom-com’s and fluctuates between good and dull.The lord may be Cecilia’s shepherd but it's Lawrence she shall want but he's not laying her down in green pastures any time soon if you know what I’m saying.6/10 It’s Okay. most competent moé shows are.

The show is mostly focused around the two main pairings interactions with a small amount of nice story and world info here and there. One of the best ways to describe this show would be wholesome and ""overly sweet"".The character\'s are the main focus of the show, and although there certainly is some amount of larger story it\'s more so a side thing. Starting with Cecillia, she\'s a very adorable character who as the saint in...the town helps them with various things. She\'s completely in love with Lawrence and is constantly blushing around him. Lawrence meanwhile is totally oblivious to that fact. Being the pastor of the small church in his town he ""looks after"" the saint I suppose. In a way he\'s the example of the perfect guy. He\'s always protective of Cecillia, treats her with the upmost respect, even going as far as to always call her ""lady saint"" instead of her name. Cecilia meanwhile who has totally fallen in love with him wants him to fall in love with her. However being the perfect guy he is, Lawrence never even considered the possibility of falling in love with her, partly due to her status as a saint. This duo\'s interactions makes for a overall enjoyable very wholesome watch.Finally on to the biggest problem, this show doesn\'t have much going for it other than the character\'s interactions and relationship.

So much time is spent encouraging, almost pleading with Lawrence to take even the most infinitesimal of...steps, and just when you think true development may occur, Lawrence resigns Cecelia to being family, as if his innocence has become a conscious effort to avoid having feelings for her, or seeing her as anything but the lady saint.A missing proper conclusion to whatever romance there was supposed to be could've potentially been circumvented had we been given 24+ episodes, or as stated previously, had there never been romance elements at all.It is unfortunate, because the wholesome slice of life elements are done so well, and there is something to be enjoyed here in that regard, but too much of the runtime gets allocated to what essentially amounts to nothing. steps, and just when you think true development may occur, Lawrence resigns Cecelia to being family, as if his innocence has become a conscious effort to avoid having feelings for her, or seeing her as anything but the lady saint.A missing proper conclusion to whatever romance there was supposed to be could've potentially been circumvented had we been given 24+ episodes, or as stated previously, had there never been romance elements at all.It is unfortunate, because the wholesome slice of life elements are done so well, and there is something to be enjoyed here in that regard, but too much of the runtime gets allocated to what essentially amounts to nothing."", ""Out of all the seasonal anime of Summer 2023, Saint Cecilia and Paster Lawrence was a pleasant surprise.

Here we have Echizen and his Seigaku headed for a tennis resort where they meet up with some unfriendly college tennis players. As a huge Prince of Tennis fan I was pretty disappointed with this episode. The only tennis match of the episode lasted maybe 3 or 5 minutes and that wasnt really spectacular other than a new shot that really wasnt that new.ART: Art was well done again the characters looked vibrant and the animation quality is still improving. But still...it wasn't really as great without the high quality EXTENDED tennis scenes. So in my opinion quality was passable for an extra episode.SOUND: The music is of the same quality of the original series. So if you havnt seen it then dont expect too much. Not bad but not great either.CHARACTER: Only one character evolved here if u can call his one new shot, development. Inui juice is here XD but then again when isnt it. You wont get to see enough tennis action from the other players to keep you satisfied.ENJOIMENT: Like i said earlier the lack of tennis action was a little disappointing. This is just one episode so why not add it to your Prince of Tennis collection ^_^OVERALL:Not really sure why the creators added this episode but since its just an episode its not that bad. If you dont watch this episode, dont worry it has nothing to do with the main plot of the series.Recommendation: If you liked the original series watch this for sure. And if you liked this watch the National Tournament ^_^ for more some real tennis pwnage.If you dissagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discss it. Always fun. @_@WoofWoof it wasn't really as great without the high quality EXTENDED tennis scenes.

Always fun. @_@WoofWoof"", ""Prince of Tennis: A Day on Survival Mountain is one of the few OVAs that contains side stories of the series yet fairly entertaining.Story: Nothing special; it's just your typical non main plot-related episode with tennis-related activities and some humor thrown in. Though, aside from that, you find it quite entertaining and could keep you watching until the end. The only problem is that there isn't much tennis action, and the longest match could have been 7 minutes or less, but I don't mind that.Art: One of the strongest points in The Prince of Tennis series. There is a small improvement in the animation,...as expected of a special, and there is minimum amount of frames repeated, which is good.Sound: You might notice that there is a new set of BGM numbers during the OVA. They are similar to the ones played in the original anime series and were nothing exceptional, but it was cool to listen to something new and refreshing.Character: There isn't much development in this OVA, both in traits and tennis style, though we get to see one new move Echizen did. We got to introduce to a few new characters, but most of them (two are excluded) aren't really special.Enjoyment: Despite the lack of tennis action, there was humor that could make us giggle and some new tennis tips and training activities that kept me sitting in the chair.Overall - Prince of Tennis: A Day on Survival Mountain is one of the few OVAs that contains side stories of the series yet reasonably entertaining at the same time. The OVA could be finished in one sitting (of course).

Tiger & Bunny Movie 1: The Beginning,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12015/Tiger___Bunny_Movie_1__The_Beginning,"['Dear Scamp,I heard a new Tiger and Bunny movie is coming out and that you got the chance to see it. I like Tiger and Bunny, but not enough to watch a rushed retelling of the TV series. Is there any reason for me to watch this new movie?Yours sincerely,Imaginary correspondent created to provide a opening segment to a review.xxxxx-----------------Hi there! Thanks for writing in. You’re right, I did get a chance to see the new Tiger and Bunny movie and I too sorta liked the Tiger and Bunny TV series but not enough to eagerly devour the exact same material all over again. This...movie is indeed a re-skinning of the first few episodes of the TV series. That all said, yes it is most definitely worth your time.Something that’s worth remembering about Tiger and Bunny is Sunrise were flying by the seat of their pants when it came to writing that story. For example, early episodes had a big focus on Blue Rose, but once it became clear that a huge part of their audience were yaoi fangirls, they swapped the focus away from her and had more swimwear photo shoots with Bunny. They created this villain in Lunatic who acted on his own morals, but then sort of forgot about him in the second half. Looking back, the writing really seemed all over the place. What’s clear about this movie is there’s a much steadier hand on the reigns this time. With their fiction fully established, they can now pace things properly and set clearer objectives within the timeframe. The story is entirely about Tiger and Bunny getting to know each other and eventually work together, and this time it’s paced much better. Bunny comes off as less of a total asshole and the culpability of the relationship not working stretches to both parties. The entire story just flows better.In general, the main thing I came out of this movie thinking was how much the production staff learned from their mistakes on the TV series. Some of the heroes that were boring originally are massively improved in the movie. For example, did you guys ever know what Rock Bison’s superhero ability even was? I didn’t, and that’s absurd when you consider he was one of the main 8 heroes in the series. In the movie, they reveal it in this rather great sequence where he shows off his shirtless rock body to Dragon Kid. They still riff on the idea that he’s not the coolest of heroes. His new weapon is this giant catapult you might see Gundams launched from, except they literally launch Rock Bison from it. Except every time he uses it, he misses his target by a couple of feet and flies straight into a skyscraper instead. Dumb as hell, but really funny.Speaking of Dragon Kid, she’s another character who gets way more chance to shine. She actually feels like a human being with personality this time, rather than some girl in the background that they never really knew what to do with. She’s like the rookie in the group who is more personable and interested in events. Origami Cyclone also gets a big improvement in his character. They take his ninja stuff to ridiculous levels, as it kinda always was with his character, and really milk it for humour. Even better is his brooding, sulky side, in which he sits behind everyone and makes emo comments about how popular Bunny is with the girls. The heroes talking to each other have always been my favourite part of Tiger and Bunny, and this movie only improves on that.However, because they really try to play up and exaggerate the elements of each of the heroes personalities, it does result in some of the heroes from the TV series who were well-handled originally being diminished. Sky High is still great, there’s no worry there, but Blue Rose really isn’t. Because Blue Rose got so much screentime in the TV series, her character had a lot of depth. Not so much here, where she mainly comes off as kind of a bitch. Fire Emblem is probably the worse though. He was always a flaming gay stereotype, but he had cool parts to his character. He was a tough dude who, because of his seniority, felt like a father mother figure to the others. In the movie, those elements seem to disappear and he comes off as even more prancy gay stereotype, except with even less likeable qualities.What’s disappointing is they had the opportunity to show off Fire Emblem’s cool side too. One of the most interesting parts of his character is something you never learn in the TV series, instead only learning through drama CDs. They tell the story of how, when he was starting off as a hero, nobody would sponsor him because he was gay. So he said “fuck you guys, I’ll set up my own company and sponsor myself”, founded Helios Energy and became a hugely successful businessman on top of being a superhero. In a way, that almost justifies his total campness because it’s a point of pride for him. That he stuck by his flaming gay ways even in the face of adversity and succeeded. It’s a cool story, which the movie does try to cover but makes a total balls of it by not telling it properly. It says that he owns Helios Energy, but don’t say that he’s sponsored by it. The only way you’d make that connection was that if you remembered it was on his suit, and good luck remembering that one piece of info with all the corporate logos flying around.Those minor gripes aside, this is Tiger and Bunny with a tighter focus and comes off much the better for it. I’d say roughly 30% of the movie is the same material from the TV series (+ or – 20% depending on my total inability to remember stuff correctly), but it’s cut in a way that makes it feel fresh and more vibrant than it was before. Absolutely well worth your time if you even remotely liked Tiger and Bunny. I’d even say this is a better starting point for people who have never watched the TV series. To make that judgement, I would have to see what their other movies pan out like first. That said, all they need to do is cut Jake from the story entirely, and it will automatically win. movie is indeed a re-skinning of the first few episodes of the TV series. That all said, yes it is most definitely worth your time.Something that’s worth remembering about Tiger and Bunny is Sunrise were flying by the seat of their pants when it came to writing that story. For example, early episodes had a big focus on Blue Rose, but once it became clear that a huge part of their audience were yaoi fangirls, they swapped the focus away from her and had more swimwear photo shoots with Bunny. They created this villain in Lunatic who acted on his own morals, but then sort of forgot about him in the second half. Looking back, the writing really seemed all over the place. What’s clear about this movie is there’s a much steadier hand on the reigns this time. With their fiction fully established, they can now pace things properly and set clearer objectives within the timeframe. The story is entirely about Tiger and Bunny getting to know each other and eventually work together, and this time it’s paced much better. Bunny comes off as less of a total asshole and the culpability of the relationship not working stretches to both parties. The entire story just flows better.In general, the main thing I came out of this movie thinking was how much the production staff learned from their mistakes on the TV series. Some of the heroes that were boring originally are massively improved in the movie. For example, did you guys ever know what Rock Bison’s superhero ability even was? I didn’t, and that’s absurd when you consider he was one of the main 8 heroes in the series. In the movie, they reveal it in this rather great sequence where he shows off his shirtless rock body to Dragon Kid. They still riff on the idea that he’s not the coolest of heroes. His new weapon is this giant catapult you might see Gundams launched from, except they literally launch Rock Bison from it. Except every time he uses it, he misses his target by a couple of feet and flies straight into a skyscraper instead. Dumb as hell, but really funny.Speaking of Dragon Kid, she’s another character who gets way more chance to shine. She actually feels like a human being with personality this time, rather than some girl in the background that they never really knew what to do with. She’s like the rookie in the group who is more personable and interested in events. Origami Cyclone also gets a big improvement in his character. They take his ninja stuff to ridiculous levels, as it kinda always was with his character, and really milk it for humour. Even better is his brooding, sulky side, in which he sits behind everyone and makes emo comments about how popular Bunny is with the girls. The heroes talking to each other have always been my favourite part of Tiger and Bunny, and this movie only improves on that.However, because they really try to play up and exaggerate the elements of each of the heroes personalities, it does result in some of the heroes from the TV series who were well-handled originally being diminished. Sky High is still great, there’s no worry there, but Blue Rose really isn’t. Because Blue Rose got so much screentime in the TV series, her character had a lot of depth. Not so much here, where she mainly comes off as kind of a bitch. Fire Emblem is probably the worse though. He was always a flaming gay stereotype, but he had cool parts to his character. He was a tough dude who, because of his seniority, felt like a father mother figure to the others. In the movie, those elements seem to disappear and he comes off as even more prancy gay stereotype, except with even less likeable qualities.What’s disappointing is they had the opportunity to show off Fire Emblem’s cool side too. One of the most interesting parts of his character is something you never learn in the TV series, instead only learning through drama CDs. They tell the story of how, when he was starting off as a hero, nobody would sponsor him because he was gay. So he said “fuck you guys, I’ll set up my own company and sponsor myself”, founded Helios Energy and became a hugely successful businessman on top of being a superhero. In a way, that almost justifies his total campness because it’s a point of pride for him. That he stuck by his flaming gay ways even in the face of adversity and succeeded. It’s a cool story, which the movie does try to cover but makes a total balls of it by not telling it properly. It says that he owns Helios Energy, but don’t say that he’s sponsored by it. The only way you’d make that connection was that if you remembered it was on his suit, and good luck remembering that one piece of info with all the corporate logos flying around.Those minor gripes aside, this is Tiger and Bunny with a tighter focus and comes off much the better for it. I’d say roughly 30% of the movie is the same material from the TV series (+ or – 20% depending on my total inability to remember stuff correctly), but it’s cut in a way that makes it feel fresh and more vibrant than it was before.

Yes I am a fervent fanboy of this particular series, but at least this one manages to give it\'s fans so much more than most of the same breed has done in the past.*coughberserkcoughrurounikenshincough*Tiger & Bunny The Beginning is, to sum it up simply, a directors cut of episodes 1 and 2 with a lost episode included. Not an actual lost episode, but...something that would\'ve appeared to be a planned to be an ova rather than a part of a longer running feature. And by directors cut I mean this movie offers more content to these episodes, to the point of showing brand new material with mixed in with the old.Fans are sure appreciate this, though the issue here is, this is still just a recap of the first two episode, in fact it\'s really just a re-airing of the those episodes in order. Meaning that the first 40-50 minutes of the movie is stuff that isn\'t terribly different from the tv series.So, with that out of the way, what new\'s to experience in this movie? A little bit of detail into Kotetsu\'s internal anguish with the lost of his wife, an event that happened before the series starting point. It doesn\'t struggle him with grief (As that would make him into a rather unenjoyable character), but it sheds some light on him and makes him an even more relate-able and sympathetic character (And thankfully gives me some material to fight back the crazier fujoshi fans with). Unfortunately for Barnaby, we\'re stuck with the beginning\'s less likable pre-good character development. Which isn\'t all that bad, that just means we get more of the great banter between them.But with even more good news, the side characters get a lot more screen time in this than they normally would in the series. Even Rock Bison, who until this movie, gets some more details revealed like what is his powers exactly.Production wise, this is barely an update of the tv series, even the new material looks as good as the better parts of the series. Which isn\'t in any way to talk it down, the tv series was competently well made and so is this.So at this point you\'re probably wondering what the rest of the movie unfolds out to be. The new material doesn\'t come in until pass the halfway point of the movie (Though the villain has a small cameo earlier in the film). Basically it\'s like this: A Next with teleporting powers has come to Stern City to steal a valuable object and the whole gang has to stop him in an amusement park. Plays out like a Saturday morning superhero episode plot, which we expect it to. The villain is pretty crafty with his powers and is pretty enjoyable to watch him outwit everyone with admittedly useful powers (Useful in a way that Origami Cyclone wishes his was). And the conclusion is while predicable, is written well enough to rank up with the best of the solo episodes of Tiger&Bunny.It\'s just unfortunate that I have to say that it still doesn\'t quite deserve to have a movie made just for it. It would\'ve worked out better as an ova or material for one or two episodes of a second season. But despite knowing what that was going to be, this was still a much better end product I expected it to be and I have high hopes for the second movie where apparently some big shit is going down. something that would\'ve appeared to be a planned to be an ova rather than a part of a longer running feature.

The film reuses scenes from the first few episodes and adds new content to expand the story and characters.Story: 8 - the main event explored in the film is the starting point of the show: the beginning of Bunny's career and Tiger being forced to become his partner. When I first watched the show this did feel a bit rushed, so Sunrise choosing to address this feels like a good move. The scenes that are reused are mainly the action and comedy ones, and almost all the new scenes focus...on the characters, giving them some much needed development (in the series most of the heroes received one episode to establish character and that was pretty much it). The new story content is a whole new NEXT villain the heroes have to deal with the same day Tiger & Bunny make their debut. More of a gag villain than a heavy hitter, the situation is mainly created to force early cooperation between the heroes early on.Art: 9 - the expected 'Sunrise Smooth' standard, CGI looks better than in the TV series.Sound: 10 - one of the areas where the film excels, the voice work is very well suited to each character, and both the music and sound effects keep to the pace of the action very well.Character: 9 - the main new addition of the film is the expansion of the characters, with some characters having as much screen time as civilians in the film as they did during the entire series. Each of the heroes received an extra layer of depth, making me much more invested in them than I was during the series.Enjoyment: 10 - a great mix of action, comedy and character development.

By cramming all the backstory elements into the beginning—where they should have been all along—it managed to set the series up better in 1 hour than the series itself managed to in 10.It also paused to answer questions that should have been answered in the show itself. ""Why doesn\'t Sky High fly to solve all their problems? If flying is his power, why does he have a jetpack?"" (His power is just floating.) ""When did Barnaby train to become a hero if nobody had ever...heard of him?"" (He actually went to the Hero Academy that we saw in the show and was Steel Samurai\'s classmate.) ""Why did the villain with the crazy eyes suddenly decide to attack during the show when he\'d been stewing for decades?"" (He saw Barnaby on TV going purely for points and not helping people.) ""What the fuck even is Rock Bison\'s power?"" (He can harden his skin and have super strength. This is completely obscured by his costume in the show and here, so they put a little moment in where he used it on Kotetsu.)It also showed the heroes being less than co-workers for once. In the show, they\'re basically always shown as friends and we are informed that they are not actually friends. Here, they are much more explicit about being rivals only.And the resolution of the original story in this is a much more direct reason for Barnaby to start softening towards Kotetsu than anything the show offered.This all should have been in the show.

Although they gave each hero at least one moment where they showed a personality. Fire Emblem\'s moments (plural) were gay panic sexual harassment. I remember that early on he appeared to be a bit of a gay (perhaps trans-spectrum) stereotype, but I watched the show dubbed and he gets SO MANY great moments where he\'s just a character who happens to be gay, including one or two that accentuate him being particularly BLACK and gay and perhaps trans. I don\'t know if those were changed for the dub, but there is none of that energy in this movie. It\'s a character assassination.The last thing I\'ll say is that the Hundred Power is literally the worst power in the show and it\'s just absurd that they even let Kotetsu be a hero, let alone Barnaby.

The first two episodes of the series are used, with new sequences added in. Some additions are purely cosmetic (scenes with Kotetsu struggling to put on his CrapSuit in his car) and others serve to flesh out characters (we finally learn what Rock Bison's NEXT power is!).The new scenario was on-par with an average episode. The villain had an interesting power, and the heroes dealt with him in classic T&B style: everyone...works together to try and catch him, but T&B end up figuring it out. I must say, I did not expect the capture the way it played out on screen; I was expecting something completely different based on what characters were saying throughout the epsisode. I felt that the crime was lackluster, however. It seemed a little cheesy, but that's part of T&B's charm.Art: The retelling section was mostly reused from the show, so nothing new there. The new sequences were added in seamlessly. I loved the villain's swanky outfit!Sound: Like the art, most of it was reused. I didn't notice any new themes, but I could be wrong.Character: Most characters benefitted from additional screen time. Rock Bison, Sky High, Blue Rose, Wild Tiger and Barnaby all had some interesting tidbit or sequence that shed more light on their personalities or Hero alter-ego.Fire Emblem, Dragon Kid and Origami Cyclone got the shorter end of the stick, with nothing new revealed about them. Poor Ivan came across as a mumbling loner that no one paid attention to. I guess you could say that's true to Origami Cyclone, but out-of-costume Ivan is such an interesting character. In the movie, he was mostly seen muttering to his shurikens.Overall: I was impressed with the first movie. Sunrise handled the retelling well, and interspersed the new sequences well so that you were not bored. I think this is an excellent way to start the series if you've never seen it before, and even if you have, you'll look at characters differently.

Another recap from Sunrise. They sure want their money well... NO, wait. This is all new and.. and different? And better? What the shit!?Tiger & Bunny The Beginning is like Tiger & Bunny tv series in the beginning, except this movie isn\'t lost. The problem with the start of the tv series was that Sunrise had not decided what to do with the series when they started with it. It was a mess, ugly and basically one rough diamond. What Tiget & Bunny The Beginning movie does, is polish that diamond, and it polishes it good.The story starts off the same, the idea is...the same as in the fist 2 episodes. We have some scenes from those and the same plot, but, in this time, made into a solid packet with neat pacing and rythm, and all in all, better execution. While this is recapturing in a way, I would say these are around 10% similar to each others. The movie is well worth the watch, offering more new material than fans of the series would expect, and actually matching the MAL\'s describtion of an ""alternative version"" of the tv series.

Interwoven stories of loss, hope, and rebellion set the stage for the Captain Harlock crew. There are battles waged in the name of masculine honor, love, and above all freedom from opression in their search for Arcadia, a planet without war, and also the namesake for their space battleship.I think this is a good ease into the Harlock franchise due to its much lighter tone and less grounded science-fiction themes. Alternatively, the very same elements hit fast and heavy in the darker...OG Space Pirate Captain Harlock which is what you would watch after this series if you're following event timeline watch order.SSX ENDLESS ORBIT revels in character backstories and the fight for a better tomorrow with their rag tag crew shaped by fate to battle against the evil Illumidas and Mr. Zone. The villains in SSX imo are a stepdown; as the main antagonist, Mr. Zone doesn't command the same ominous presence of Queen Rafflesia from the 1978 show but that doesn't make the show any less entertaining.If you enjoy Gurren Lagann's super manly honor themes, humor, and its crew fight against its oppressors to reach for the sky; the Captain Harlock franchise will be in your wheelhouse.

SSX is no exception, being an alternative story to the original series, so I wouldn’t recommend to start your Harlock journey here. At minimum watch the original series and the prequel Arcadia movie first.Overall, SSX is pretty much a typical space opera anime. This isn’t meant in a negative way though, as an average space opera anime tend to be quite enjoyable. You get the usual mostly episodic adventure with...some overarching plot and story driven by character dramas and manly ideals such as friendship, freedom, honor and fight against oppression. The drama can be touching even when concerning only characters introduced in given episodes and never seen again further. Admittedly the ideas are nothing never seen before, but the execution of 80’s aesthetics still make it work.There is some action here too, both closer combat and space battles. Unfortunately it’s more about being cool rather than in-depth portrayal of warfare, but well, this series is more about the adventurous side of things rather than the logistics, so it’s not really a fault.I’m sure fans of the currently somewhat niche genre of space operas will enjoy this series, and everyone else will likely find this to be at least an okay series. some overarching plot and story driven by character dramas and manly ideals such as friendship, freedom, honor and fight against oppression.

Unlike the Arcadia of my Youth film, Endless Orbit SSX has a much lighter and more whimsical tone compared to the very dark and gritty movie. That is not to say a whimsical show is an inferior one but when compared to what it is a continuation of then it is hard to take seriously the occupation of Earth by the Illumidas and Harlock's struggles.The science fiction is also a lot more toned down and less believable...compared to the original show. One example being the rogue computer satellite that lures ships to their doom through a siren's song. It's very fantastical and even though the original series was as well at times it felt a lot more grounded than how SSX would present such story elements.There are times though when SSX really shines. One example being episode 20 when Kei goes to an enemy occupied space station to retrieve medicine for Tochirou. It was easy as a viewer to take seriously as the stakes were very high and the action and suspense were on point. However, overall throughout the show there is too much silliness which ruins moments such as these.I believe this may be because Endless Orbit SSX was targeted for a younger demographic. Though I am only assuming that based on the inclusion of the child characters aboard the ship, Tadashi and Revi. In the original show there were no children aboard the Arcadia and I feel like they are included here for who may be the intended audience. Though the original Captain Harlock did have a Tadashi character, he was in his late teens and was no stranger to combat by the end of the show. Compared to SSX's Tadashi who cooks and cleans and adds a much more light hearted tone.If I could compare this show to another, the tone shift to me in SSX compared to the original Harlock is very much like Sailor Moon Super S compared to the original series and S that preceded it. Another show which was regeared for a younger audience but unfortunately lost a lot of its charm in the process.For a hardcore Leiji/Harlock fan, SSX is probably worth checking out. For someone new to Leiji Matsumoto's works however I'd direct them to the original Captain Harlock instead. I write this review with no bias as my introduction to the Leijiverse was from the Arcadia of my Youth film and I went straight to the SSX series after before watching the original Captain Harlock.SSX simply can't compare to what came before. Both due to its much lighter tone and less grounded science-fiction. The villains in SSX are also a stepback as the main antagonist, Mr. Zone, simply does not have the same ominous presence of Queen Rafflesia from the first show.As SSX was cancelled at 22 episodes from the original 44 episodes it was meant to be, due to low viewership as it was originally aired, I believe this shows that it is indeed a lower point in the Leijiverse/Harlock franchise. However, there is still a decent enough show here and I would not say it is outright bad, just not Harlock at his best. compared to the original show.

Whistle!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/183/Whistle,"['I\'ll start off first by throwing this out there, I don\'t really like soccer all that much. Watching it is pretty damn boring, and playing it isn\'t much better in my opinion. Now, with that out of the way, let me just say that I really loved this anime. I know, you\'re like, ""But he just said he pretty much hates soccer. Is he weird?"" Yes, this anime indeed be about soccer, but it is much more than just that. This anime follows a middle school boy, Shou Kazamatsuri, who enjoys soccer and works extremely hard to get better and rise to the top. We...his transition from a 3rd string substitute for one school, to an amazing player for another. I\'m now re-watching this series for a second time and still enjoying it, probably even more so than the first time. I think what really makes this anime so inspiring to watch is Shou\'s character. I believe that he is meant to have a little piece of everyone inside of him, me, you, and anyone who watches this show. I believe that he has aspects and traits that can be found in every single one of us, I think this is partially the reason for me watching this anime and enjoying it so much, it\'s almost as if sometimes I\'m seeing a bit of myself in the anime in front of me. When I watch this, I don\'t think, oh I\'m watching a soccer anime, I think of it as a story of a boy who is striving to obtain his goal, a boy who is willing to work harder to get to the top because he can! This definitely is an anime which is worth watching at least once, even if you\'re like me who doesn\'t like soccer, I definitely encourage you to watch this series. The story and the characters are definitely the driving points of the anime and what make it what it is. The art and music definitely are enjoyable too and bring out an even more desire to continue watching as well. his transition from a 3rd string substitute for one school, to an amazing player for another.

It was actually a realistic soccer story and it didn't have to deal with any other side stories. it maintained me entertained for the whole anime and the ending was very exciting, and it left you asking for more. I recommend this anime to the true soccer fans, who know the reality of soccer and that know how hard it is and how much you have to work to make it in the sport. "", ""When I first began watching Whistle!, there were many things that could classify it as a bad anime. Granted, it is old, but the animation was very choppy and uncoordinated. The main character's voice actor was not the best either, and a lot of the lines were delivered without clear articulation and emotion. However, despite these, there was something about it that drew me in. Next thing I knew, I had finished the last episode and was craving more.The story for Whistle! revolves around Kazamatsuri Shou, a 2nd-year junior high school student who has an unquenchable passion for soccer. Throughout the anime, most of these...developments include him in some way, and it showcases his overall improvement in each part. Each soccer match and emotional bump all somehow work to bring him closer to maturity.Unfortunately, the art was pretty bad. Yeah, it's a pretty old anime, and the animation should not be held to today's standards. But putting that aside, a lot of the animation was not smooth at all, and it seemed like it lacked in-betweens. Furthermore, some body proportions were off and physics seemed weird. Also, because it's old, the quality wasn't all that good, and backgrounds lacked detail. It didn't detract too much from my total enjoyment of the anime though, once I got used to it.I have mixed feelings toward the sound. On the one hand, the voice acting was sub-par, and some sound effects were a little strange. Especially for the main character, a lot of words were slurred and emotion was definitely lacking. However, the actual music (opening, background music, and ending) was pretty good. The timing for background music was also solid, in that it enhanced each scene depending on the mood.Character development is definitely one of Whistle!'s fortes. Other than the growth of the protagonist, all of those around him also mature in some way, shape, or form. Rather than solely focusing on Shou, every character, even the minor ones, receive a little treatment as well. That being said, these weren't executed to their full potentials, but the overall feeling was there.I wholly enjoyed this anime. I don't know what made me enjoy it so much, given the average ratings I've given each aspect of the show, but I did. And I would be hard-pressed to put it in to words. Just watching Shou grow, and observing each step of the way, kind of made me feel like I was there with him, and relating to each of his struggles. The fact that he is such an altruistic, dedicated, and self-sufficient kid is just so heartwarming somehow. It really is difficult to describe.Overall, the anime receives a 9. While poorly executed, the story and character development set a tone that evoked feelings of satisfaction and fulfillment. I hope that you will give this anime a chance, and perhaps, you can experience some of the mysterious enjoyment I felt. developments include him in some way, and it showcases his overall improvement in each part.

The story feels as if it makes a progress....The soundtrack to this anime got one of the most classical Fotball music there ever is even the beginning of the anime has this classical look to it.I have yet  to find more then one or two characters in this anime i dont like. Reason is though some might be hated in the beginning you will  either understand more about them or you will beginning to like their personalities as they are and realise their not all that bad. The main character is go happy lucky in a good way. He isnt naive in a bad way he just gets better and doesnt sit down crying for 3 episodes until some guy gives him a kick in the ass.This is one of the best football anime there is out there. Its not as mature as some of the newer one but i feel its classical and funny and worth watching and when your bored you can watch  it again.Its all what i have said above its great in every way and its just to enjoy. Even if you dont like football this might be something for you because they make something out of it and doesnt drag thing out. Its classical and great in every ways which is why it deserves a 10 out of 10 any day.

Amazing anime! I loved the characters, the music really fitted in nicely, the plot was to a point good but short but overall the anime was excellent! Dissapointed they didn't make another season or carry on the anime as theres more to have seen. It could well have turned out to be an anime such as captain tsubasa in the sense of going on a journey with the tokyo team and there adventures. "", ""First and foremost, I really have to say that the plot is really interesting, such that it is different from most sports anime I know.1. The main character Shou may not seem to have the attribute that a striker (forward) ought to have, but yet he does not give up and makes use of whatever he has to put up a play to his advantage.2. His growth along with the interaction with the other characters were equally as important and good.However, the thing is that this anime seems to be under budget, I really don't like how the voice casting for Shou is done,...and the drawings aren't really good in a way.The story isn't drawn to a good conclusion, it would be good if there is season 2 to see his growth to see how Shou will aspire to be like his dad and how he uses his instinct for soccer to continue growing further. and the drawings aren't really good in a way.The story isn't drawn to a good conclusion, it would be good if there is season 2 to see his growth to see how Shou will aspire to be like his dad and how he uses his instinct for soccer to continue growing further."", ""Since childhood, I learned how to play football, turned out I found the anime actually soccer is Whistle.

Yowamushi Pedal: Re:Ride,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25755/Yowamushi_Pedal__Re_Ride,"['[This review applies to both YowaPeda recap movies]Since the third season of Yowamushi Pedal is airing right now, I had decided to refresh my memory about the two last seasons and hence I watched both recap movies, Re:RIDE and Re:ROAD.Unfortunately, many recap movies fail at summing up the story without excluding key scenes, making them feel incomplete. But unlike these movies Re:RIDE/Re:ROAD managed to keep the original feeling of the Inter Highs in only three hours, even if the source material is much, much longer. From the iconic Onoda and Tadokoro singing scene to Izumida\'s glorious ""Andy! Frank!"", it literally has everything. Even some bits...of the (many) background stories are shown.Besides, the writers also included movie exclusive scenes involving Makishima, Onoda and Toudou in Re:RIDE and the Senpai Line of Hakone in Re:ROAD. These extra scenes reveal a little more about their relationships too. If you\'re a fan you will love them!Overall, both, Re:RIDE and Re:ROAD, are decent recap movies involving the highlights of the story, as well as something new to spice it up. I think it\'s worth watching these recaps if you (like me) watched the anime two years ago. If your memory is still good I\'d suggest to skip the recap part and just watch the movie original scenes. of the (many) background stories are shown.Besides, the writers also included movie exclusive scenes involving Makishima, Onoda and Toudou in Re:RIDE and the Senpai Line of Hakone in Re:ROAD.

Zoids,https://myanimelist.net/anime/763/Zoids,"[""Zoids is a mecha anime about people who control beast-like units.  Unlike Gundams, they aren\\'t really used in space (at least in this particular anime) but are used for purposes such as transportation and of course, battles.  This anime was the starting point of the Zoids franchise, and after watching the anime a few times (both in English dubs and Japanese subs), one can point out that it was a great way to start of the Zoids phenomena.The story, although your simple &quot;country raised kid rises up to the challenge of saving the world from evil,&quot; is very good and has...enough plot twists in between to leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting for more.  What made this Zoids saga different from the others were the miniature Zoids organoids that were able to fuse with their larger counterparts and in essence, bring the Zoid to life with more power than before.  What really makes the story great is the epic battles they have between many Zoids.These epic battles for the most part, are animated very well.

Because it\\'s been awhile since I saw this anime, I don\\'t remember a lot of the scores used, but I do remember for scores used for the battles and they fit just right.All of the main characters have very distinct personalities and you\\'ll come to have your favorites most definitely.  Van and Fiona have believable strengths and weaknesses given their environment and always seem to have an enemy, or rival, to go against up with.  There really isn\\'t a boring moment where you\\'ll find that the protagonists are superior to everyone else.All in all, the anime was a great start to the Zoids saga.  Though a lot of the following stories after were not as great, this is still a classic.  The stirring romance between Van and Fiona again is something you\\'ll fall in love with as the story progresses and is one more reason to give this show a try.

Chaotic Century and The Guardian Force, essentially it's all one series.The series takes place on the Planet Zi, where living machines called Zoids live.  There are wild ones, and ones controlled by humans.  There are two major powers on the planet Zi, the Republic and Guylos Empire.  Though the war they fought is over, the peace is tenuous and could give way to war at any moment.  The story follows Van who lives in a village.  He goes out one day and gets chased by bandits into some ancient ruins.  The he finds...a organoid, and names it Zeke.  Zeke reviews a Shield Liger and defeat the bandits.  They go back into the ruins and discover Fiona a ancient Zoidian who has lost her memory.

A series everyone should watch."", ""*NOTE: This review contains some minor spoilers, but I will do my best to keep it brief, concise, and to the point*STORY: In the first half of the series, Van Flyheight is a zoid pilot who comes across a mysterious type of zoid known as an Organoid who he names Zeke, as well as a young girl named Fiona in pods found in mysterious ruins. Upon finding the two, Van finds himself the center of attention of bandits and soldiers alike who are after the Organoid's strange powers. Van and Fiona come across other characters and find themselves in the middle of a war, and...have to do what they can to help bring peace to land and end this war. Zoids does a relatively decent job of keeping tone shifts frequent without overexaggerating it, often having serious moments albeit with light-hearted comedy when the mood needs to be brought up. The flow of the story feels natural, and feels neither rushed or slow. It has a nice, even pace that the viewer can easily enjoy. 9/10ART: The art direction that Zoids took was aesthetically pleasing all around. Characters were detailed enough that they didn't stick out too much, but also were not too detailed to the extent that they distracted from the environment. It felt as though environments and characters had about the same effort put into them, so that neither were too distracting. Obviously, the Zoids were what the majority of the focus was put on, most likely being what most of the budget was used for. The zoids were rendered with high quality, and it shows. If anything in particular needed the most focus in terms of art, it was definitely the Zoids, and it shows. That being said, the only real flaw I can see with them is that some animations were clearly recycled throughout the series, but it's not incredibly noticeable so it isn't really that big of an issue. 9/10SOUND: As much as I personally enjoy the soundtrack, I do have some issues with it; the main problem I have is that the soundtrack can often times sound a little repetitive while other times is a little too scarce. There's nothing wrong with having certain audio tracks be more common than others, but eventually it gets to the point where some tracks sound as though they're heard in almost every episode. I felt that there could have been a little more variety in certain places, and that occasionally, certain tracks did not fully fit the mood. Yet in other situations, the soundtrack did its job very well, helping in creating the particular mood of a scene. I felt that the type of music used did fit the overall environment of the show, using both fast paced action-themed music for fighting, and softer, more melodic music for scenes involving development of characters. 7.5/10CHARACTER: In Zoids, the characters can really be hit or miss. Some aren't as fleshed out as others, but the main cast is fleshed out enough that the viewer cares about them and wants to see them succeed. Van Flyheight is the most developed character by far, as the second half of the series, Guardian Forces, focuses on how much Van has matured since the first half of the series (there is a small time skip in between), and they really emphasize just how much he's changed, going from often being a jokester kind of character to a more serious character who cares about protecting those dear to him. The show also does a nice job in creating sympathy for certain characters who start off as villains but have a change of heart as the series progresses. Unfortunately, while Zoids does a great job in developing the main protagonists, the show falls a bit short in terms of the main antagonists, who sadly fall into the usual trope of being evil for the sake of being evil. That being said, they are not part of the main focus of development to begin with, and while it would be nice to see them developed more, at the very least the main and supporting cast have enough development to keep the viewer caring for them. 8.5/10ENJOYMENT: The biggest part of enjoyment typically comes from watching the Zoid battles throughout the series. They have a mix of fast paced action and often strategic ways of fighting, appealing to more than just one audience with the way the battles are handled. There is drama involved, but it is not shoved in the viewer's face. There is a nice, even pacing between the fighting and story elements, so neither feels overdone. Light hearted moments in the show are welcome when they are as the action and serious tone will bring characters back to reality. The show  has a nice, enjoyable pace from start to finish, introducing slight changes in the second half so as not to be repetitive. 9.5/10OVERALL: Zoids: Chaotic Century/Guardian Force gives off the feeling of being along for an adventure. It develops its characters enough to make the viewer care for them, and want to see them get to the end of their journey. You follow them along, and through thick and thin, they keep fighting, and the journey goes through various types of drama and has an adventurous feel. A lot of the series is about the maturity of Van as a character too, and you see him grow from a young boy to a man who fights for what he believes in. You also see the evolution of how the likes of Fiona and several other characters develop throughout the series, and by the end, their relationships feel genuine. The characters feel like those who can be related to by the viewer. It has all the feelings of an adventure, from humble beginnings to the maturity one gains from it.Final Score: 10/10 : Would recommend to any anime fan. have to do what they can to help bring peace to land and end this war.

That being said, the only real flaw I can see with them is that some animations were clearly recycled throughout the series, but it's not incredibly noticeable so it isn't really that big of an issue. 9/10SOUND: As much as I personally enjoy the soundtrack, I do have some issues with it; the main problem I have is that the soundtrack can often times sound a little repetitive while other times is a little too scarce. There's nothing wrong with having certain audio tracks be more common than others, but eventually it gets to the point where some tracks sound as though they're heard in almost every episode. I felt that there could have been a little more variety in certain places, and that occasionally, certain tracks did not fully fit the mood. Yet in other situations, the soundtrack did its job very well, helping in creating the particular mood of a scene. I felt that the type of music used did fit the overall environment of the show, using both fast paced action-themed music for fighting, and softer, more melodic music for scenes involving development of characters. 7.5/10CHARACTER: In Zoids, the characters can really be hit or miss. Some aren't as fleshed out as others, but the main cast is fleshed out enough that the viewer cares about them and wants to see them succeed. Van Flyheight is the most developed character by far, as the second half of the series, Guardian Forces, focuses on how much Van has matured since the first half of the series (there is a small time skip in between), and they really emphasize just how much he's changed, going from often being a jokester kind of character to a more serious character who cares about protecting those dear to him. The show also does a nice job in creating sympathy for certain characters who start off as villains but have a change of heart as the series progresses. Unfortunately, while Zoids does a great job in developing the main protagonists, the show falls a bit short in terms of the main antagonists, who sadly fall into the usual trope of being evil for the sake of being evil. That being said, they are not part of the main focus of development to begin with, and while it would be nice to see them developed more, at the very least the main and supporting cast have enough development to keep the viewer caring for them. 8.5/10ENJOYMENT: The biggest part of enjoyment typically comes from watching the Zoid battles throughout the series. They have a mix of fast paced action and often strategic ways of fighting, appealing to more than just one audience with the way the battles are handled. There is drama involved, but it is not shoved in the viewer's face. There is a nice, even pacing between the fighting and story elements, so neither feels overdone. Light hearted moments in the show are welcome when they are as the action and serious tone will bring characters back to reality. The show  has a nice, enjoyable pace from start to finish, introducing slight changes in the second half so as not to be repetitive. 9.5/10OVERALL: Zoids: Chaotic Century/Guardian Force gives off the feeling of being along for an adventure. It develops its characters enough to make the viewer care for them, and want to see them get to the end of their journey. You follow them along, and through thick and thin, they keep fighting, and the journey goes through various types of drama and has an adventurous feel. A lot of the series is about the maturity of Van as a character too, and you see him grow from a young boy to a man who fights for what he believes in. You also see the evolution of how the likes of Fiona and several other characters develop throughout the series, and by the end, their relationships feel genuine. The characters feel like those who can be related to by the viewer. It has all the feelings of an adventure, from humble beginnings to the maturity one gains from it.Final Score: 10/10 : Would recommend to any anime fan."", ""Note - This review may be a little biased.I will start off by saying that Zoids was a big part of my childhood. I grew with this as my favorite TV show, played Zoids Battle Legends for the GameCube, and even had a toy Redhorn (my brother had a toy Liger, he somehow convinced me to get a stupid Redhorn). All of this being said, my review may be somewhat biased.Story 9/10Zoids (Chaotic Century/Gaurdian Force are the two halves that make up this series of zoids) takes place on planet Zi, where large robot animals called zoids, which are generally used for combat by humans...live.

He discovers the organoid who he names Zeke, and the girl Fiona, and he sets out with Fiona to help her uncover her past and find the mysterious Zoid Eve. Zoid meets Irvine and Moonbay who accompany him on most of his journey as they overcome various pitfalls on the way to learning about Fiona's past.Art 8/10I thought the art/character designs were well done. I think the biggest issue that many people will have with zoids is the mediocre CG used in the fight sequences with the zoids.

With plenty of plot, this is one of the most well-developed plots of any Zoids series, with perhaps Genesis being second. The voice acting is sometimes a bit sub-par, but the rest of the series is very enjoyable. It's fairly cartoon-ey in nature, but that adds to the quality of the series.Mecha sizes can vary massively, the scale of Zoids is very inconsistent, but this is one of the few limitations of the series. Overall the animation is very good, especially considering this series is the first Zoids series to be produced. "", 'Do note that my thoughts in this review focus more on the first half to Chaotic Century that I had rewatched recently and do not include anything coming from the second half of the series, Guardian Force. With that said, onto the review:Nostalgia can be quite the strange little thing at times. Sometimes, it can make you think of times that you believe were better than they are now. Other times, you may have rose-coloured glasses on how you believed certain things were when you were younger. The latter was the case for me when I seen Zoids: Chaotic Century ten years ago on Toonami....Just starting out my fandom in anime, I thought of it to be a decent mecha adventure series focused on the exploits of Van, Fiona and their pals on Planet Zi as they become entangled in war between two rival kingdoms and deal with the threat of a powerful legendary Zoid towards later in the series. It is still recognized to this day by older anime fans as the most memorable part of the Zoids franchise as it actually had an ongoing storyline and was seen as not so bland and merchandise-driven as other parts of the franchise like New Century Zero and Fuzors.Coming back to it ten years later with more experience, exposure and some jadedness in viewing anime, I can\'t necessarily say Chaotic Century\'s aged too well with what I\'ve been exposed to in the past decade. The series carries a blend of the typical cliches you could find within mecha and shounen action anime. Many characters within the series carry some sort of archetype typical of both approaches such as Van your typical young, energetic, adventurous, dense and naive male lead; Irvine the aloof and troublemaking partner with a heart of gold; Raven the psychotic and merciless renegade with his eyes set on the lead; and a nice number of antagonists who are cruel, merciless and desiring power for no particular reason other than the fact they are evil. There are some interesting characters that stuck out for me not being so bland like the mercenary pair of Rosso and Viola plus Major Schubaltz, but they\'re mostly supporting characters to the otherwise mostly bland lead characters. I don\'t even want to think of the number of times I felt the urge to whack Van atop the head for his ""fight first, ask questions later"" mentality he exhibited at many points throughout Zoids that you would expect of enough plucky leads from shounen action anime titles.The major elements of the plot to Chaotic Century involve discovering the origins of Fiona\'s character and the ongoing tensions between the Guylos Empire and Helic Republic. The former does get a reasonable amount of build up as hints are dropped throughout much of the series regarding Fiona\'s origins and her possible connection to the mentioned powerful Zoid. The mentioned war, on the other hand, is a bit hollow with its plot thanks to the limited amount of fleshing out there was on both kingdoms and the reasons surrounding the war as it felt mostly like a backdrop for any reason for Van and his group to face their adventures and put up with Prozen\'s later manipulations. I\'m all for seeing an anime focused on a fictional war. But if the series isn\'t even gonna bother properly exploring both sides and their reasons for engagement like the Gundam franchise and Legend of the Galactic Heroes, then I\'m not gonna be as invested into it.Visually, Chaotic Century\'s animation is on the standard side for a late 90s to early 2000s TV anime with its scenery and character designs, with the CG animated Zoids sticking out like a sore thumb compared to the hand-drawn character designs. There are a number of occasions where the series resorts to animation shortcuts with its battles such as reused frames and speed stripes. Still, some of the concepts for the Zoids when used in battle were quite unique such as how the Geno Saurer can make itself into a charged particle gun and the use of the E-Shields from Shield Ligers as a sort of battering ram.Still though, I can\'t say Zoids: Chaotic Century was the show that I remembered it to be from a decade earlier thanks to my exposure to the common cliches it makes use of and having a nice number of hollow elements to its storyline. It does beat out the mentioned New Century Zero and Fuzors in that it doesn\'t feel as merchandise-driven with its series run and having an actual plot that it follows. But nostalgia for anime I seen years ago can only carry a series so far for me if it doesn\'t have anything that sticks out with it too strongly.

They\'ve produced so much over the years, and some of it is actually decent, but not this one. Zoids (Chaotic Century if you\'re American) had a huge amount of potential, but was completely watered down with flat visuals, a bloated cast of shallow characters, and way too many episodes of what amount to filler.This show had all the ingredients to be one of my favorites. It follows all of my stupid rules to make a great mecha show:-It keeps the same theme song throughout-There\'s a robot battle in every episode-The robots are in...CG, which is dank as hell!-They play the theme song at the climax of each episode to reinforce the hypeBut none of this could keep me from being bored out of my mind within the first 30 episodes.I started this show on January 1st, and finished on May 6th. That\'s 126 days, so 67 episodes/127 days gives just over 1/2 an episode as a daily average. Even giving myself the advantage of watching every episode at double speed, I could not bring myself to watch more than that. Let me not understate how bad that is--I have watched far worse shows at a religious one-a-day pace just to end the pain, but I was so disinterested in this show that I couldn\'t be arsed to spare 12 minutes a day for it.Let\'s examine why this might be:The direction is beyond uninspired. Every shot is framed well enough so the kids at home can keep up with what\'s happening, but forget about going above and beyond to add any visual intrigue to the show. The standout eyesores for me were the establishing shots which far outstay their welcome, and are almost unbearably slow even at double speed. The art style, which leans towards realistic proportions, does not lend itself to having expressive characters. Sure the characters are on model very consistently, but half the time they look like cardboard cutouts with a terribly drab and muted color palette. This style may have been a choice to fit with the more rigid lines of the Zoid designs, but they really shot themselves in the foot by taking away the one means by which their boring characters might have had a small amount of visual flair.These boring characters are all pretty one dimensional. At most a character will have one defining trait, and receive little to no character development throughout the entire run of the series. I can recall maybe one or two episodes focused on developing a backstory or exploring character motivations for each of our main cast. That\'s one or two episodes out of almost 70. A great majority of episodes do nothing to challenge our characters on a personal level, and just involved the aforementioned regularly scheduled robot battle. The antagonists show similar levels of depth, and are really only relevant to the story if they have a powerful Zoid.What really confounds me is that they had a lot of great ideas to work with and could have told a gripping story. In episode ONE we establish our heroes are looking for an ancient artifact/location called ""Zoid Eve"" that seems like it could drive a long running mystery plot, only to be cast aside and never mentioned for a vast majority of the episodes. There is a planet-wide military conflict that our characters become wrapped up in, but almost no focus on what motivated the war or its repercussions on the people of each nation. Near half way through there is a time skip, and it does nothing significant to grow or change our characters. Don\'t forget that they\'re on a planet crawling with giant robot animals that they go out of their way to show are sentient, but never pause to make our characters wonder about the morality of people\'s relationships with Zoids by taking the Pokemon route.So who should watch Zoids? If you\'re looking to commit long term to an easygoing shounen series with abundant robot battles, Zoids is a good candidate for you. Those looking for anything of substance should steer clear.

I think the main reason for watching this is seeing a bit more of Karma and Nagisa and the events they thought were important to them.', 'I kind of expected this from the title being ""365-nichi no jikan"", but it really was simply a review of what happened over the course of the single year they spent with Koro-sensei.This OVA has little to no extra scenes of what happens afterward. If anything, it only has a minimum interaction between Nagisa and Karma reminiscing about the ""old days"".I think I would have enjoyed this if I didn\'t finish the entire series in 2 days, but it\'s good nonetheless. It was kinda dumb for me, personally, because while they are thinking and talking about what happened with Koro-sensei, as if it was wayyyy...in the past, I just watched it yesterday man lol in the past, I just watched it yesterday man lol', ""Basically a recap and not needed at all since the show ended it good enough already.Not much more to add, but if you wish to see a recap it was decent enough.Do watch the whole animation series beforehand tho.Karma and Nagisa narrate the whole anime and the events that happened, they add some comments, but that's it. There isn't anything new and it doesn't add to the experience (nor the story) of the whole anime.I watched this hoping there would be some new stuff, but it was basically just two old students reminiscing about the past which resulted in a whole recap movie. I still...finished it because I was hoping for something extra, which didn't come at all.Wouldn't recommend the movie unless you're into recaps. finished it because I was hoping for something extra, which didn't come at all.Wouldn't recommend the movie unless you're into recaps."", ""Part 1 EnglishPart 2 Bahasa Indonesia--------------------------------------Well, well, well, what do we have here?

Kwak is a dutch anime aimed at kids.But unlike most cartoons aimed at kids, Alfred J. Kwak features lots of mature and mostly sad the,es. Amongst others it deals with various social and political issues, like abuse, or power. Even with all these negative themes, the shows about important values too, like friendship, family and solidarity.The anime is notable for the political themes on which it points a highlight. In the anime ...our main protagonist fights a evil fascist dictator, takes in refugees, saves whales against hunter and even oversees the changeover of his country from...an sbolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy.Such themes are far from typical in a children'sanime, and form a big part of Alfred J. Kwak's appeal. Other episodes have satirised the Japanese love of golf, and criticised countries which have sharp north/south economic divides.The story settles around a duck, some time after birth Alfred loses his parents and sisters, and is raised by a mole, which was a good friend of his parent. Together they wind up in lots of different adventures, fun adventures, but even so, very dangerous one's.What's nice is that Alfred actually grows up, from a small kid, at the end of the show, he's an adult duck. In most kid's shows the characters don't age/or at least mature.The art is simple, but astonishing beautiful, it has this old style which really appeals to kids, and yet, me too. I've seen the series as I was a kid, here on television, but I can still enjoy it when I put (the tapes) on.

Then we get a &quot;black&quot; duck, who's a refugee and Alfred's girlfriend, a polar bear who's a scientist, we even got a stork and a magpie as cool characters.We've got lots of animals, who resemble or potrait cool, funny, evil and most of all, fun people (or just) fictional beings.

Well… IT ISN’T! It’s a grim story, dressed in bright colors and light humor.Here is the premise. The protagonist is a naive duckling. While playing happily, it goes away and escapes its mother’s attention. This saved its life, as a rich animal inside a luxurious car RUNS OVER ITS ENTIRE FAMILY! The rich bastard simply says, “I’m too rich to care” and keeps driving WITHOUT EVEN SLOWING DOWN!Later, the duckling is looking for its family, but it doesn’t find them (thank God)....It is found and taken cared by other animals and things start to get better. But the entire universe is simply out to get our tragic hero. A kleptomaniac friend of its, steals a jewel and “accidentally” drops it on the duckling’s head.“Look! The duckling that dumped its family is the thief! What a bad animal you are. Shame on you!”“But I…”“Shut up! The universe says you are never to be proven right!”And something similar like this keeps happening to the duckling over and over throughout the rest of the story…If Bambi’s dead mother is the limit in cruelty, this series goes off the charts. It’s so mentally scaring for children (I was only 10 when I watched it and it gave me nightmares about the poor duckling looking for its dismembered family). And the whole “everyone is out to make your life miserable” attitude is miseryporn from a point on, like watching ReZero or Rainbow. It is supposed to be ironic and humorous but it only feels petty and cruel. You could see it as a variant of Oliver Touist but it will still feel overbearing.Yet, this is the same reason why the series stands out among most anime for kids. If you keep watching, you will actually see a story where there are dozens of references to Fascism, Apartheid and European monarchy. Really, it isn’t a typical children’s story with simple good guys and bad guys in some magical fairyland. It is in fact portraying the modern times of our world in a very sad way. I don’t say I like the way it presents all that (deaths and malicious acts on part of the bad guys) but it is trying a lot more than your typical fairytale (it’s eons more sinister that the average stupid villains who never kill in typical cartoons).The duckling’s tragic story makes it interesting for a while, but all its naivety and Diavolo Ex Machina blaming gets to your nerves pretty soon. Still, that duckling matures a lot as a character. We watch him grow older, get a girlfriend and take part in an uprising against Fascism, Apartheid and other forms of malicious acts. Quite a lot for kiddies to grasp, right?Then there’s the villain of the story, who is pretty much half a dozen infamous historical figures in one body. From Hitler, to Napoleon, to Godfather, to greedy faceless oil company suits, he causes more harm and death than Cobra Commander and General Havoc ever did during their endless terrorist armies in old cartoons. And in far more sinister ways too! He looks like a silly crow and yet he is evil incarnate. Plus, he has a backdrop story that excuses his behavior. He was not “born evil”.Still, it is true that after a while they act in silly ways and the end-result is a happy ending to a sad story. It’s not trying to be miserable all the way to the end, the same way Ranking of Kings flipped over anything it was building in its first half. The rest of the cast is not as great as these two so it’s an issue if you have to watch the whole series without strong support characters.

Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25519/Yuuki_Yuuna_wa_Yuusha_de_Aru,"['**NOTE: This anime is a sequel to the LN \'Washio Sumi wa Yuusha de Aru\', it\'s highly recommended that you do NOT read it before this, don\'t even look at its synopsis as it contains spoilers, it\'s recommended however that you read it after finishing this anime as it gives good backstory for some of the characters and works well as a tissue burner.**Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (Yuyuyu henceforth to avoid confusion with the character) was one of the least anticipated tiles for Fall 2014, but as a fan of both the SoL and mahou shoujo genres I figured it\'d be a decent...watch but didn\'t have high expectations for it, the PV hinted at a mundane show about nothing in particular with some magic to mix things up.Upon looking at the staff list however and seeing names such as Seiji ""Nice Show Would Be a Shame if Something Happened to It"" Kishi (Angel Beats!) and Mr. ""Woah, This Character Is Still Alive? Better Fix That"" a.k.a. Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), I couldn\'t help but wonder ""what are these monsters doing in a show about cute little girls?""Yuyuyu\'s was shaping up to be a massive massacre as Studio Gokumi took the lead in the animation front, and that\'s exactly what happened, Yuyuyu was indeed a massacre – of my expectations.The story starts off with a simple play of a hero trying to stop the demon king, a child\'s play, aimed at such, but helps set the tone for the rest of the show, in multiples ways, this is a simple story, we\'re not dealing with an over the top sci-fi setting that requires several episodes before you grasp what is going on and these characters are no geniuses or unique souls who appear once in a thousand years to change the world... Or are they?.. Probably not.It takes less than 3 minutes for the characters and setting to be introduced, even as the staff credits appear over several still images it\'s easy to understand that the world our heroines live in is a simple one, there\'s some city landscape shown but it\'s mostly countryside, it all screams peaceful, very peacefully.Yuuna, Tougou, Fuu, Itsuki, together they form the Hero Club, a club that focus on helping people, mainly through the form of community work. Shortly after their introductions, we get to see a bit of their daily lives, make no mistake here however, being part of the SLICE OF LIFE™ genre, this anime makes these cute little girls face real adversities as they try to find owners for kittens, update their website or think of what to do when faced with japanese middle schoolers\' greatest fear after common cold – the cultural festival.Everything stops, however, when they receive a strange message on their phones.""We\'re it"".The members of the Hero Club have been selected to because heroes and fight Vertex – enemies of mankind that wish to destroy the world – in order protect Shinju-sama (Divine Tree), the foundation of the world.Who, why, when or how? Questions which are sure to have an answer somewhere but are they really important? These girls have a world to save, those come later!At this point one can\'t help but wonder if this will be the classical ""enemy of the week"", but fear not, or do.The mahou shoujo genre is a genre that has it\'s tropes very well defined and it\'s very easy to identify them even without much experience with it, however, Yuyuyu uses these tropes for ease of storytelling but doesn\'t get lost in them, creating a story and characters that stand on their own.Yuyuyu is more on the ""modern"" side of the genre (look at the bottom of the review for a more detailed analysis), it\'s not just about mindless murder of hopeless, little Vertex.Eventhough this is a SLICE OF LIFE™ anime these girls are more than just kawaii, each with their own traits and personalities – simple ones, guessable just by looking at their hair color – they have more to them than it initially appears, as their pasts are revealed and explored, we get to know more about them, sympathize with them, maybe even relate to them. It ever ends up going overboard about how sad and unfortunate these girls are though, it\'s life, we have all experienced sudden changes at one point or another, for one reason or another, but that hasn\'t stopped us from living.However simple Yuyuyu might look like on the surface, it does have depth, while most of the cast might look care free enough for little girls tasked with saving the world, underneath all the fun and entertainment this show provides, there\'s always that lingering feeling of uncertainty, ""who exactly are the Vertex? Why are they after us?"" But the series never spells it out or feels the need to ask it every episode, which can be both a good and bad thing, it\'s easy to forget these girls are tasked with saving the world, even the characters themselves are aware of this though, which does serve as a reminder without being intrusive.""""Things are gonna be fun"", huh? We\'re supposed to be heroes saving the world. How silly.""Just as much as this show is self-aware it also has an incredible attention to detail and amazing foreshadowing skills, little things like when the group is facing the first Vertex and Yuuna tries to calm Tougou down, while she\'s the one shaking; it\'s so subtle however, that it can go by unnoticed as all that we see is her fist, an easy way to make the audience aware of the fact Yuuna is also scared would be to simply expose Yuuna\'s thoughts and how nervous she is but the show doesn\'t feel the need to hold your hand.This makes rewatching this series an amazing experience, picking up on little things the characters say or do which spell out the outcome of future episodes and events.At it\'s core Yuyuyu is a very well-realized show, it focus on the big picture – saving the world – but doesn\'t ignore the implications, exploring them and quietly builds up to the finale without you even noticing it\'s happening.The whole atmosphere the show builds has a much greater purpose, tense moments that lack tension are not because the show itself can\'t create it well, it doesn\'t need them all the time, it knows how to set a mood but doesn\'t need the mood to be heavy 24/7, it doesn\'t take every opportunity it gets to try to create something, it knows exactly when to strike. Perhaps Takahiro realized it wasn\'t the best of ideas to kill off a character every episode, it numbs the audience, after a while you just expect it and you start to care less and less.Hints are left behind with every corner the show turns but it doesn\'t come back to pick them up again, as said above, incredible self-awareness and attention to detail, enjoyment when rewatching the show is easily doubled, a feat accomplished by very few series.""Though there is no other thing that can fascinate humans more than the truthThere is nothing that is more cruel to humans than the truth.""(...)""No matter what... No matter how tough it gets... Live on.""If there\'s one thing Yuyuyu nails however, it\'s certainly its message, what implies being a hero, the regrets of becoming one, the hopelessness of not being able to change the past or the future but still trying desperately to do so when faced with picking between loneliness and suffering or no future at all.""Being a Hero isn\'t about making sense or bending to the cruelty of the world. It isn\'t about being a sacrifice for others or defeating villains. Being a Hero isn\'t even about saving people.Being a Hero is about facing everything that is terrible and wrong and refusing to accept it. So when that Hero strides forth against impossible odds other can look towards them as a shining beacon of hope, stand up, and follow in their footsteps.""Which would you pick?Would you still manage to become a hero even if it meant sacrificing yourself?Even if it meant having a future filled with nothingess?Or would you rather have no future at all? Would you leave your friends behind to suffer? Would you take them with you in a selfless act of desperation? Or would you fight alone and take all the burden yourself?The sacrifice of few to save the rest is explored a lot in anime but what if there\'s nothing to save? What if you can\'t save anyone no matter how much you sacrifice? Would you just give up? Or grab onto the little hope and strength you have left? Could you keep going knowing, no matter what you did, the future wouldn\'t change?Yuyuyu doesn\'t directly ask many questions and it answers even less but it doesn\'t need to do so, everything is made obvious through the characters, their actions and their situation, ""show"" is prioritized over ""tell"" but it doesn\'t forget to keep the plot coherent, this can also be seen as a flaw as viewers who don\'t pay much attention might get lost and feel like things happen for no reason, in the end it\'s also up to how each one of us interprets it.-insert ""truly the evangelion of the madoka of our generation"" joke here-Even regarding character backstories Yuyuyu is a rather unique series, they are introduced later than sooner, which usually isn\'t the case, at least in this sort of series, the first few episodes are usually used to build the characters and then move with the plot, Yuyuyu leaves characterization for when it\'s necessary and... it works.Instead of focusing on everyone at the start and overloading the audience with exposition Yuyuyu lets the viewer relax and progresses the plot in a well paced manner as it introduces plot twists and character backstories to maximize the various emotions it invokes.The calm before the storm vibe is very much present most of the time, even after the fighting ends, which is when Yuyuyu holds your hand and tells you it\'ll be daijoubu like the well dressed man in front of a black van giving out candies, you are wary of him at first but then you take the candy and realize he\'s not a bad guy at all.""Our fight is over. We won\'t lose anymore.""It\'s certainly an anime that takes it\'s time and perhaps could take even longer was more time allocated – and being a show that scales really well with how much times passes, it\'d only get better – but it\'s certainly not a waste of time, it does end up being a hard series to evaluate if you go over it on a episode by episode basis as the start is rather slow and uneventful, but it\'s all by design.Perhaps the main problem with Yuyuyu is that it sets the bar too high towards the end, so high the show itself can\'t see it and when it tries to jump over it obviously fails.But it\'s really up to the viewer to decide wether it fails or not, Yuyuyu leaves enough hints behind that you can use them to justify just about anything, it\'s more a question of wether you want to believe or not, like said above, it can be considered a flaw as people who don\'t catch every little detail might be left behind, and it\'s asking a lot to catch \'em all.After their lastest work, Escha & Logy no Atelier, learning that Studio Gokumi would be animating this series certainly did not inspire much confidence, so it\'s with great suprise and joy to see how well Yuyuyu turned out in the visuals department.The character designs fit well enough, they are the sort of normal designs that you\'d expect from a slice of life series, plain, cute, smile-inducing, with the kawaii and moe meters in the red zone.The magical costumes the girls use are simple yet stylish, they feel fresh, modern, it avoids the classical fluffy cocktail dresses for most of the girls and replaces them with clothes that resemble actual armor, even if on the light side – these girls actually look like heroes.When in most other cases less clothes equals more protection, Yuyuyu certainly makes these girls look good as they attempt to save the world with their fists and giant swords and sniper rifles and more swords.Yuyuyu does feature a very good color pallete, especially in the barrier world (Forest) where most of the fighting takes place, the whole place resembles the roots of a tree, with each main root having it\'s own color and as it branches off it expands on that color, and while the watercolor style works really well it can be a mixed bag when examined up close, sometimes making the characters feel out of place.While the animation in the slice of life moments isn\'t anything out of this world it certainly does the job well enough, mistakes aren\'t that obvious and the quality is consistent throughout. When it comes to battles, animation quality does peak but perhaps not really enough to really set it apart, nevertheless, a solid direction goes a long ways and can make or break the scene no matter the animation quality, in Yuyuyu\'s case it definitely benefits from really good direction, you won\'t feel it lacks animation or that it has a below average choreography, can\'t complain much about the latter though, these are little girls, not martial artists, but overall it\'ll still feel fast paced and intense which is really what is important.There\'s also a good amount of character CGI used yet it doesn\'t feel awkward or out of place, mostly because it\'s used during jumps when characters have their backs turned, it\'ll be harder to spot than to avoid. The Vertex are mostly CGI too, they do benefit from the fact that they are mostly immobile or just very slow which doesn\'t make them stick out as much either.The OP and ED are rather weak. The OP song isn\'t that catchy or exciting and takes some getting used to and the animation is nothing worth looking over more than once, the ED shares the same fate, unless you\'re some creeper who enjoys watching little girls from the bushes as they walk with the sunset in the background you\'ll probably find yourself skipping over this one too... Is what I\'d say had I not watched the show to the end, you\'ll slowly learn to appreciate them and in retrospect they uphold to the standard set by the series, simply glorious in retrospect.The OST and overall sound effects in Yuyuyu, unlike the OP and ED, are amazing from the start, it\'s the cherry on top of the cake for the series.Being a mahou shoujo anime the obligatory transformations scenes before battles are very much present, these are coupled with an amazing track choice that just screams hype, one can\'t help but feel excited for what\'s to come next, even if it\'s not always good, and it keeps going when the battle themes kick in, one stronger than the other it makes the fights feel exciting, a couple tracks even feature chants from worlds unknown to us, making the battles feel alive – it all culminates together for what is pure audio porn, not even complimenting the battle sequences as much as taking them to a whole nother level.Slice of life scenes have fairly standard tracks, they don\'t get in the way and fill in empty space when the little monsters settle down and overall just help move the scenes along not making them feel boring.Some of the themes that appear during the battles are also present outside of those and it\'s amazing how it just works.Yuyuyu does feature insert songs, which are easily the high point of the whole category – for reasons you\'ll have to find out yourself.Shall something not be perfect with the sound it\'d certainly be the seiyuus, not as much as they are bad but as they could be better, criticism being more focused on Yuuna\'s than anyone else – eventhough some of them don\'t speak at all but that\'s another matter entirely – Yuuna, while not the leader of the Hero Club, is certainly the main character of the series, if the title wasn\'t hint enough surely the fact that she has pink hair is a dead giveaway, Yuuna is the character that will push the show forward when it comes to an halt, someone feeling down or angry? There\'s Yuuna to cheer them up, someone having an identity crisis? There\'s Yuuna to tell them who they are, someone about to kill themselves? There\'s Yuuna to tell them to do it.What\'s that? Haremettes\' problems in my mahou shoujos? It\'s more likely than you think.Being a rather new seyuu Terui Haruka\'s perfomance is excusable and actually fairly decent, her voice fits Yuuna well and she has her moments, however, unlike most of the other cast members those moments come once per episode and, being the MC, Yuuna requires more than that, while those moments are properly timed to fit with the climax of the episodes ""side scenes"" could certainly be greatly improve was Yuuna not as unphasable, but perhaps that comes a bit with the character, emphasis on the perhaps.Being a SLICE OF LIFE™, SCHOOL™, HEALING™, CGDCT™ anime enjoying these will help, however, as one would expect at this point, these aren\'t the main plot points of the show, they probably aren\'t the reason you are getting into the series either.Watching these little creatures in their natural habitat is the best way for bonds to be made, to further empathize with these girls and try to get attached to them, enjoying these will only help but being indifferent to them doesn\'t hurt the enjoyment the show provides.Obviously, if SoL/CGDCT/moe/""GUYS, I\'M NOT DELUSIONAL, THEY ARE HOLDING HANDS AND BLUSHING, YURI!!""/overall kawaiiness overload murdered your parents then you might want to steer clear. The cute facade the shows puts up has more to it than what it looks, but it\'s still a facade that you can take at face value and enjoy for what it is.Big part of the enjoyment factor in Yuyuyu certainly comes from noticing the subtle hints the shows leaves and realizing how they affect and dictate future events, something that was made easier when the show was airing as it left a lot of time to discuss and analyze them (I left some in this review for those who watched the series). Might be harder for people who will watch it now but it\'s not something required to enjoy this series.Overall, a solid 8.5/10 show – 9/10 on rewatch – and definitely the surprise of the year, even with a somewhat ambiguous ending, highly recommended.Christmas was saved.Puella Yuusha no Evangelion; Bokurano Beats!? Nandattebayo?A story about love, hate, and charisma... and fate, life, death, hope, heartbreaks, lies, deception, delusion, madness, tricks and... a cow that eats other cows... behind a beautiful hero who disappeared in the Seto Inland Sea.Yuyuyu might not be the yuusha we need, it certainly isn\'t the yuusha we deserve given how underwatched it is in the West but I think it\'s the yuusha we want, and the yuusha we see off with a smile as it walks into the horizon of uncertainty as this franchise can probably muster the force for more anime entries given how successful it has been thus far.Now let us hope for a movie adaptation of the prequel light novel.**Anime, very much like every other medium, is easily influenced by what\'s trending, every once in a while it\'s to no surprise that there\'ll be an anime that will end up setting new standards in it\'s genre or even in the whole industry, because of how popular and successful it was, even if said anime doesn\'t invent those ideas it\'s what made them popular and obviously it\'ll become a point of reference even if it wasn\'t the first one. Puella Magi Madoka Magica (PMMM) is one of such titles, it wasn\'t an unique-never-seen-before-anime, the themes in PMMM had been explored before, multiple times, but it became so popular that it set standards, more for the viewer than for the creators and as such, titles released after it will have to face the fact that they\'ll be compared to it, wether they wanted to or not.As such, mahou shoujo anime that wishes to use the common tropes – present in the genre for over 30 years – be it to lure and trick the audience or just use them for ease of storytelling while trying to spicy things up a bit by not feeling like an anime aimed at little girls will perhaps forever suffer of the ""Madoka rip-off"" syndrome.While drawing parallels between the two works is easy enough thanks to the common tropes they use, both explore different themes and take different paths, and both are masterful in how they do it, at their cores they are completely different. watch but didn\'t have high expectations for it, the PV hinted at a mundane show about nothing in particular with some magic to mix things up.Upon looking at the staff list however and seeing names such as Seiji ""Nice Show Would Be a Shame if Something Happened to It"" Kishi (Angel Beats!) and Mr. ""Woah, This Character Is Still Alive? Better Fix That"" a.k.a. Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), I couldn\'t help but wonder ""what are these monsters doing in a show about cute little girls?""Yuyuyu\'s was shaping up to be a massive massacre as Studio Gokumi took the lead in the animation front, and that\'s exactly what happened, Yuyuyu was indeed a massacre – of my expectations.The story starts off with a simple play of a hero trying to stop the demon king, a child\'s play, aimed at such, but helps set the tone for the rest of the show, in multiples ways, this is a simple story, we\'re not dealing with an over the top sci-fi setting that requires several episodes before you grasp what is going on and these characters are no geniuses or unique souls who appear once in a thousand years to change the world... Or are they?.. Probably not.It takes less than 3 minutes for the characters and setting to be introduced, even as the staff credits appear over several still images it\'s easy to understand that the world our heroines live in is a simple one, there\'s some city landscape shown but it\'s mostly countryside, it all screams peaceful, very peacefully.Yuuna, Tougou, Fuu, Itsuki, together they form the Hero Club, a club that focus on helping people, mainly through the form of community work. Shortly after their introductions, we get to see a bit of their daily lives, make no mistake here however, being part of the SLICE OF LIFE™ genre, this anime makes these cute little girls face real adversities as they try to find owners for kittens, update their website or think of what to do when faced with japanese middle schoolers\' greatest fear after common cold – the cultural festival.Everything stops, however, when they receive a strange message on their phones.""We\'re it"".The members of the Hero Club have been selected to because heroes and fight Vertex – enemies of mankind that wish to destroy the world – in order protect Shinju-sama (Divine Tree), the foundation of the world.Who, why, when or how? Questions which are sure to have an answer somewhere but are they really important? These girls have a world to save, those come later!At this point one can\'t help but wonder if this will be the classical ""enemy of the week"", but fear not, or do.The mahou shoujo genre is a genre that has it\'s tropes very well defined and it\'s very easy to identify them even without much experience with it, however, Yuyuyu uses these tropes for ease of storytelling but doesn\'t get lost in them, creating a story and characters that stand on their own.Yuyuyu is more on the ""modern"" side of the genre (look at the bottom of the review for a more detailed analysis), it\'s not just about mindless murder of hopeless, little Vertex.Eventhough this is a SLICE OF LIFE™ anime these girls are more than just kawaii, each with their own traits and personalities – simple ones, guessable just by looking at their hair color – they have more to them than it initially appears, as their pasts are revealed and explored, we get to know more about them, sympathize with them, maybe even relate to them. It ever ends up going overboard about how sad and unfortunate these girls are though, it\'s life, we have all experienced sudden changes at one point or another, for one reason or another, but that hasn\'t stopped us from living.However simple Yuyuyu might look like on the surface, it does have depth, while most of the cast might look care free enough for little girls tasked with saving the world, underneath all the fun and entertainment this show provides, there\'s always that lingering feeling of uncertainty, ""who exactly are the Vertex? Why are they after us?"" But the series never spells it out or feels the need to ask it every episode, which can be both a good and bad thing, it\'s easy to forget these girls are tasked with saving the world, even the characters themselves are aware of this though, which does serve as a reminder without being intrusive.""""Things are gonna be fun"", huh? We\'re supposed to be heroes saving the world. How silly.""Just as much as this show is self-aware it also has an incredible attention to detail and amazing foreshadowing skills, little things like when the group is facing the first Vertex and Yuuna tries to calm Tougou down, while she\'s the one shaking; it\'s so subtle however, that it can go by unnoticed as all that we see is her fist, an easy way to make the audience aware of the fact Yuuna is also scared would be to simply expose Yuuna\'s thoughts and how nervous she is but the show doesn\'t feel the need to hold your hand.This makes rewatching this series an amazing experience, picking up on little things the characters say or do which spell out the outcome of future episodes and events.At it\'s core Yuyuyu is a very well-realized show, it focus on the big picture – saving the world – but doesn\'t ignore the implications, exploring them and quietly builds up to the finale without you even noticing it\'s happening.The whole atmosphere the show builds has a much greater purpose, tense moments that lack tension are not because the show itself can\'t create it well, it doesn\'t need them all the time, it knows how to set a mood but doesn\'t need the mood to be heavy 24/7, it doesn\'t take every opportunity it gets to try to create something, it knows exactly when to strike. Perhaps Takahiro realized it wasn\'t the best of ideas to kill off a character every episode, it numbs the audience, after a while you just expect it and you start to care less and less.Hints are left behind with every corner the show turns but it doesn\'t come back to pick them up again, as said above, incredible self-awareness and attention to detail, enjoyment when rewatching the show is easily doubled, a feat accomplished by very few series.""Though there is no other thing that can fascinate humans more than the truthThere is nothing that is more cruel to humans than the truth.""(...)""No matter what... No matter how tough it gets... Live on.""If there\'s one thing Yuyuyu nails however, it\'s certainly its message, what implies being a hero, the regrets of becoming one, the hopelessness of not being able to change the past or the future but still trying desperately to do so when faced with picking between loneliness and suffering or no future at all.""Being a Hero isn\'t about making sense or bending to the cruelty of the world. It isn\'t about being a sacrifice for others or defeating villains. Being a Hero isn\'t even about saving people.Being a Hero is about facing everything that is terrible and wrong and refusing to accept it. So when that Hero strides forth against impossible odds other can look towards them as a shining beacon of hope, stand up, and follow in their footsteps.""Which would you pick?Would you still manage to become a hero even if it meant sacrificing yourself?Even if it meant having a future filled with nothingess?Or would you rather have no future at all?

The previews teased that it was going to be another slice-of-life series, but looks were deceptive. While it has some SOL elements, at its core it\'s a magical girl show, and a pretty serious one, too. Here’s my final review of the entire series, as of 12/26/2014. If you just want an overall recommendation without any other details, feel free to skip to the tl;dr section at the very bottom.The Plot In a Nutshell:Middle school girls in a ""Hero Club"" perform small everyday acts of heroism in the normal...world, but also become heroic magical girls protecting the planet from strange creatures called vertexes.Background/Influences:Yuuki Yuuna  is an original series created by Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), and it blends elements from three different anime genres. First are its magical girl ancestors, and this one comes from the lineage of adult magical girl shows like Lyrical Nanoha and Madoka Magica. Fans of those series will recognize the influences of both, although Yuuki Yuuna still tells its own story in its own way. Second is slice-of-life, and except for the dark clouds that are almost always lingering under the surface, some of the mellowest scenes wouldn’t feel out of place in a Kyoto Animation series. Third is character drama, and here the series actually shows some surprising Key Visual Arts influence (Kanon/Clannad), along with other influences from Angel Beats and the Persona series (Yuuki Yuuna’s director, Seiji Kishi, also directed both Angel Beats and Persona 4 The Animation, so this shouldn\'t be a surprise). All three genres are done well enough individually that it could have focused on any one of them and been a decent show, but the blend of all three really elevates it above the sum of its parts.Moe’s Scale of Female Cuteness:While this isn’t a true moe series, all the girls in the Hero Club can be awfully cute. Most of their club activities are ordinary community service work, like fostering kittens and performing puppet shows for kids. They also hang out together sometimes outside of school, eating udon, singing karaoke, and doing other fun things together. The catch is that none of this SOL stuff is there just to be cute and funny – while some of it may seem frivolous at first glance, the writers are deliberately giving you time get to know the girls and their personalities and motivations by showing you how they behave and act around each other. All the girls have their own personal demons they’re wrestling with, and most of them did not have happy childhoods. Tensions occasionally flare between them, and even in the most seemingly cheerful moments there are lingering undercurrents of anxiety and doubt about the job they have to do and the risk to their lives and well-being, which all makes these scenes even more effective. One of Yuuki Yuuna\'s greatest strengths is that there\'s a genuine chemistry between all the main girls in the cast - while they have their occasional disagreements, you never doubt for a second how much they all care about each other, especially the two sisters (Fuu and Itsuki) and the two best friends (Yuuna and Togo).Most of the slice-of-life stuff takes place in the first half of the show, and while some (especially non-SOL fans) may find these parts a bit slow, it’s still worth paying attention to it because a lot of it is setting the table for the second half of the series. Along with letting you get to know the characters better, there’s also quite a bit of foreshadowing too; I noticed a lot of hints the second time I watched the series that were easy to miss the first time.Round One…Fight!:As pleasant as the girls try to make everyone\'s daily lives, when the alarms sound on their phones, it’s time for them to become magical girls and protect the world from the vertex threat. There are several vertex battles throughout the series, varying in length and scope, but some of them can be pretty tense affairs, especially when multiple vertexes (vertices?) appear at once. The girls are skilled combatants with a variety of strong weapons, but they’re not immune to injury and the vertexes are tough opponents who are smart enough to coordinate their attacks and adjust their strategies during battle. It usually takes a total team effort for the Heroes to have any success against them, which leads to some entertaining and occasionally nailbiting fights.Art and Sound:The animation is a bit inconsistent - it can be great in some scenes and merely passable in others - but the overall quality is solidly good. The fight scenes take place in a surreal, colorful alternate world, and showcase most of Yuki Yuna’s best animation work. These scenes appear inspired by the artwork of Shigenori Soejima (Persona 3/Persona 4), as well as the twisty, hyper-organic landscapes of Roger Dean’s paintings, and I’m excited to see how they’ll look in Blu-Ray someday. They also use a fair bit of CG though, so be warned if that’s not your thing. The real world scenes, while still generally cheerful and colorful, have occasional touches such as the unnaturally bent and ruined suspension bridge appearing in several background scenes that subtly remind us this world isn’t quite the carefree place it appears on the surface.The opening and closing songs (like most) will be hit-or-miss depending on your musical tastes. Personally I liked the opening immediately, but the ending needed time to grow on me. The OST itself, however, is outstanding. Most of the tracks fit their scenes perfectly, and the battle music especially stands out as some of the very best in the show, full of soaring choirs and pulse-pounding orchestration. Even the quieter tracks have a few gems, though, such as a very nice flamenco-styled classical guitar piece that appears a couple of times. There’s also not a lot of repetition either. Only a few tracks are used more than once or twice, and they’re all songs (like the main transformation theme) that you’ll enjoy hearing multiple times anyway.Rating:If I rated Yuuki Yuuna on nothing but my personal enjoyment, it would get a 10. I’ve already watched the whole series twice, I know I’ll watch it again in the future, and if Pony Canyon ever gives us a North American release, I\'ll buy it. To give it a fair review, though, I can’t entirely overlook the uneven pacing in the first half of the series, the occasional inconsistency in animation quality, and a few (not many) awkward transitions between scenes. That said, Yuuki Yuuna is still a gem, even if it’s one that’s not completely polished. The characters are easy to like and they all have wonderful chemistry with each other, the OST is outstanding, the themes of the story (which I wish I could actually talk about here without spoiling everything) are timely and appropriate, and despite a few rough patches, the story threads eventually come together in a very satisfying way. It’s a spirited show that’s a little rough around the edges, but like its characters it has a lot of heart and tries its best. And much of the time, its best is really, really good.First half: 8/10. Second half: 9.5/10. Overall: 9/10.Tl;dr! Should I Watch Yuuki Yuuna or Not?:Yes, if magical girl mixed with some drama and slice-of-life sounds appealing to you. The first half isn’t quite as good as the second half, but if you\'re able to stick with it, your patience will be rewarded. Just be warned that this isn’t a relaxing series at all. If you’re expecting Aria with a dash of Cardcaptor Sakura, you\'ll be disappointed. It’s more like Lyrical Nanoha with a dash of Angel Beats. world, but also become heroic magical girls protecting the planet from strange creatures called vertexes.Background/Influences:Yuuki Yuuna  is an original series created by Takahiro (Akame ga Kill!), and it blends elements from three different anime genres. First are its magical girl ancestors, and this one comes from the lineage of adult magical girl shows like Lyrical Nanoha and Madoka Magica. Fans of those series will recognize the influences of both, although Yuuki Yuuna still tells its own story in its own way. Second is slice-of-life, and except for the dark clouds that are almost always lingering under the surface, some of the mellowest scenes wouldn’t feel out of place in a Kyoto Animation series. Third is character drama, and here the series actually shows some surprising Key Visual Arts influence (Kanon/Clannad), along with other influences from Angel Beats and the Persona series (Yuuki Yuuna’s director, Seiji Kishi, also directed both Angel Beats and Persona 4 The Animation, so this shouldn\'t be a surprise). All three genres are done well enough individually that it could have focused on any one of them and been a decent show, but the blend of all three really elevates it above the sum of its parts.Moe’s Scale of Female Cuteness:While this isn’t a true moe series, all the girls in the Hero Club can be awfully cute. Most of their club activities are ordinary community service work, like fostering kittens and performing puppet shows for kids. They also hang out together sometimes outside of school, eating udon, singing karaoke, and doing other fun things together. The catch is that none of this SOL stuff is there just to be cute and funny – while some of it may seem frivolous at first glance, the writers are deliberately giving you time get to know the girls and their personalities and motivations by showing you how they behave and act around each other. All the girls have their own personal demons they’re wrestling with, and most of them did not have happy childhoods. Tensions occasionally flare between them, and even in the most seemingly cheerful moments there are lingering undercurrents of anxiety and doubt about the job they have to do and the risk to their lives and well-being, which all makes these scenes even more effective. One of Yuuki Yuuna\'s greatest strengths is that there\'s a genuine chemistry between all the main girls in the cast - while they have their occasional disagreements, you never doubt for a second how much they all care about each other, especially the two sisters (Fuu and Itsuki) and the two best friends (Yuuna and Togo).Most of the slice-of-life stuff takes place in the first half of the show, and while some (especially non-SOL fans) may find these parts a bit slow, it’s still worth paying attention to it because a lot of it is setting the table for the second half of the series. Along with letting you get to know the characters better, there’s also quite a bit of foreshadowing too; I noticed a lot of hints the second time I watched the series that were easy to miss the first time.Round One…Fight!:As pleasant as the girls try to make everyone\'s daily lives, when the alarms sound on their phones, it’s time for them to become magical girls and protect the world from the vertex threat. There are several vertex battles throughout the series, varying in length and scope, but some of them can be pretty tense affairs, especially when multiple vertexes (vertices?) appear at once. The girls are skilled combatants with a variety of strong weapons, but they’re not immune to injury and the vertexes are tough opponents who are smart enough to coordinate their attacks and adjust their strategies during battle.

If you’re expecting Aria with a dash of Cardcaptor Sakura, you\'ll be disappointed. It’s more like Lyrical Nanoha with a dash of Angel Beats.', '-Spoilers Ahead-The brilliant minds behind Angel Beats and Akame ga Kill joined forces in an attempt to capitalize on their respective ""talents"" and made what some people call ""one of the most underrated masterpieces of the season"" without an ounce of irony. This series is pretty much everything wrong with modern anime, and there are plenty of reasons as to why. It\'s just so up its own ass pretending to be not a grimdark show in a vain attempt to fake out the audience for so long that it ends up boring, and when it actually gets to the grimdark it was leading up to,...it does in the most hilariously incompetent way possible. Many of its other problems include the asinine pacing, lack of character interaction and development, and complete lack of subtlety, which all seem to go under the radar because apparently everyone is too busy crying over ham-fisted drama.That being said, there are some positives about this show- Mainly the visuals. Despite some heavy usage of CG in some parts, it really doesn\'t look that bad at all in motion, and the colors do not make your eyes bleed like NGNL does. Character designs are pretty neat and I do appreciate how they don\'t look like something out of Precure. Not that Precure designs are necessarily bad, but the designs here make thematic sense and at least don\'t look generic by its genre standards- Instead they look like something out of Sword Art Online, not that it\'s a bad thing either. The music is pretty decent- There are two to three tracks that were actually memorable and were reminiscent of something out of Madoka and whatever Akiko Shikata makes, but the overuse of those tracks made them a bit stale.Speaking of Madoka, there\'s a lot of people who compare this show to Madoka and even call it a rip-off. But honestly, it\'s hard to blame them- Shady magical girl contract with a supernatural being? Check. Enemies that appear in a strange world that do not actually offer actual character interaction due to lack of any dialogue whatsoever? Check. Main title character being over optimistic and the most underdeveloped character out of the main cast? Check. Mentor-like character that later goes nuts after reading the fine lines in the said shady contract? Check. The questionable magical girl system existing to prevent the end of the world? Check. This show\'s really got everything. But because this show shares so many similarities with Madoka, it also shares the flaws- And those flaws become more evident with poor direction and pacing.Apparently when Takahiro was writing for this show, he thought he\'d change it up from Akame ga Kill\'s pointless gorefest and decided to turn it into a pointless borefest. This wise decision turned the first half of this show incredibly painful to sit through. The main problem is the lack of characters- The villains and even the fairies are absolutely silent. Therefore, there is no character interaction whatsoever with the opposing side aside from fighting and more fighting. This wasn\'t a problem in Madoka due to the existence of Kyubey, who delivered some form of drama whenever necessary for conflicting character interaction, but that role is severely lacking here. Taishas do little more than send out phone messages whenever they aren\'t busy catering to the crippled, and the supernatural being that gives magical power is a poorly drawn magical tree always obscured in fog. This narrows down all character interaction whatsoever to the five main characters, and everyone else might as well be a cardboard in the background. This effectively turns the series into a Slice-of-Life type of show, which is actually in the description for this series. But then the problem comes from attempting to mix this element with grimdark setting, which was basically the gimmick with Akame ga Kill. But even then, mixing the two isn\'t the problem- It\'s the execution. There needs to be some form of consistent flow in the tone, and this series handles it very poorly by going from one scene to the other with incredibly sudden transition. Having a tea party? Suddenly phone call and everyone\'s warped to fight the giant floating monster thing. Then lots of yelling and chanting in the background, and suddenly they\'re in space. And when they\'re not doing that, they\'re busy being very angsty about something else introduced later in the series.The first few episodes followed the aforementioned formula incredibly precisely, while occasionally increasing the number of enemies to mix it up a little although it didn\'t really hinder the protagonists in the slightest. After managing to kill twelve of these things, the protagonists conclude that their battles are over because the Taishas said so, which is an obvious fake-out halfway into the series. It\'s also odd that the protagonists didn\'t suspect anything strange about Taishas informing them that there were supposedly arbitrary number of these things, which would mean that the Taishas somehow did not manage to defeat any of them at all despite having a detailed sealing process to defeat one. That aside, this formulaic plot progression didn\'t really serve to develop any of the characters at all. Sure, there was some character interaction between the main cast, but character interaction doesn\'t necessarily lead to character development. These particular interactions were just wacky hijinx and comedy, so it did absolutely nothing.After halfway into the series, our good director Seiji decides that he needs to start including actual plot, and the grimdark elements start being introduced. Whenever the girls use their magical powers, they occasionally enter this super mode known as Mankai. The show never explains whether these girls enter the state willingly or whether it\'s done automatically- And even the official website claims that it\'s half and half. Basically, it\'s whenever the plot fucking wants it to happen. Why? Because this is the aforementioned grimdark plot element. Whenever the girls enter this state, they lose a certain bodily function and gain a fairy in the process. The series attempts to fake the audience out by claiming it\'s temporary, and then it spends several episodes that arrive at a not-so shocking conclusion that it\'s permanent. Yuna loses her taste, Mimori loses hearing on one ear, Fuu goes blind in one eye, and Itsuki loses her voice. What does this all lead to? Forced drama. Apparently Itsuki entered a singing audition, which everyone knew nothing about, and suddenly the whole thing gets dumped at the audience\'s face in the most convenient way possible when Fuu is trying to deal with the whole permanent body function sacrifice thing. If that wasn\'t enough, Itsuki goes on a long speech in the recording about how she loves her friends so Fuu can go on a full guilt trip for getting her to tag along on the Hero Club before actually singing for the audition because the judges were too busy looking for their non-existent script, as with every other character in the show. A proper, subtle way to handle this scene would\'ve been to establish the singing audition thing before this happened, and then flash back to it briefly after the realization hit home, instead of just being embarrassingly blatant about it. But I guess subtlety is lost art.Meanwhile, Tougou decides to be dangerous and attempts to test her theory by playing sudoku with a blade, and comes to a horrifying realization that fairies are ""forcibly"" keeping them alive. Apparently it\'s supposed to be terrifying that these tiny things keep the girls alive while they\'re on a dangerous duty that they\'re not being forced to do. Obviously there are huge consequences for not doing magical girl things since it has been established in the first episode that Shinju-sama is protecting the world and these aliens who are for some reason named after zodiac signs are trying to destroy it, but the job itself is still technically optional. They\'re not being forced to do it at gunpoint or whatever, so the supposed horror factor they were going for is completely invalid. Furthermore, Tougou apparently attempted to play sudoku multiple times because once wasn\'t enough and goes on about all these different methods she tried to kill herself for almost no reason other than sounding edgy. But then I realized this was Takahiro\'s specialty- Hammering the exact same point and over and over to arouse some form of emotion. These two brilliant men\'s talents really do shine in this series.Afterwards, Tougou gets warped into the cripple gold medalist\'s room, who was their predecessor and now has over twenty disabilities and the equal amount of fairies. Then the audience is informed during their second meeting about the shocking truth that everything outside Shinju\'s territory is red vomit with white aliens swarming about. It\'s been known that Shinju was protecting humanity from getting fucked up by something since the first episode, so what\'s the shock here? Why does it matter that the villains are aliens or gods who decided humanity sucked? Whatever it was, it drives Tougou insane and makes her come to an ingenious conclusion. Apparently the best way to protect her friends and stop their sacrifices altogether was to blow a hole in the barrier, get the tree killed, and then get everyone sacrificed as a result of her decision. Maybe her ability to form proper reason was taken during one of her Mankai sessions. Would\'ve been better if she actually consulted with her friends first-hand, but clearly that sounded too uninteresting and sensible for the writers. Most of the conflicts in this series also seem self-made, so it\'s also incredibly difficult to actually relate to any of these characters especially when they make stupid decisions such as Fuu attempting to kill the Taishas after the aforementioned forced drama sequence.When the evil tofus attack, suddenly Yuuna is incapable of transforming because of her distressed emotional state despite Fuu being completely capable of doing so during her rage. Then Karin suddenly wakes up from being unconscious and activates Mankai multiple times in a span of few seconds coupled with too much yelling in an attempt to win the ""most crippled"" award in the show. After that, Yuuna manages to punch some sense into Tougou, destroys the Final Boss Vertex, then decides to become Jesus by taking everyone\'s disabilities onto herself by becoming a vegetable. Then suddenly the audience is supposed to accept that the enemies just stopped attacking because either they are really gone for good or they just got bored trying to kill a tree.It later turns out that every fairy represented a physical function the girls lost, so when the fairies disappear, they regain everything they lost and stop being heroes. This may be because Shinju figured that keeping emotionally unstable girls who almost got it killed as its guardians was a terrible idea. Yuuna stays a vegetable for a while because Takahiro figured he could cram in some more sad scenes near the end, but then she gets better through the power of friendship. As stupid as that sounded, the ending isn\'t the issue- Even if the ending resulted in everyone becoming a vegetable, this would\'ve been still a very poorly written series.The happy ending can at least be explained with how since all threatening Vertices are supposedly gone, assuming the sun-shaped Vertex was the last of its kind for a while, Shinju doesn\'t need to exert as much energy to keep the barrier up since there\'s nothing much left to keep out, so it just gave everything it took back. It would explain how nobody is giving a shit about that part of the barrier Tougou blew up earlier.The point is, if there is no actual threat left and the Taishas aren\'t being lying dicks about it this time and Mr. Tree is actually a benevolent god that everyone claims it is, then there really should be no point for it to keep what it took unless it\'s a dick too, which is probably what most people were guessing. And it\'s not like it was ever established that it couldn\'t give back what it took, so all the more reason for it to do what it did. And to the show\'s credit, it did briefly mention through one SoL segment that it was ""alright to eat the offerings if they were there for a while"" so maybe either it was foreshadowing or maybe I\'m giving the show way too much credit. I\'m actually surprised Takahiro managed to learn how to make use of mundane segments instead of cramming them in for the sake of just having them as a contrast to his edgy grimdark parts.There\'s a lot of hate for the ending of the show, but most of that hate seems to be misdirected since it mostly involves ""It had a happy ending, so it sucked."" While it\'s not that having some plot elements that lead to a depressing ending is inherently bad- It\'s that when it does happen, it needs to be well-paced and give the audience enough time to feel actually attached to the characters in question. But with the lack of actual villains to provide any form of conflicting character interaction, there\'s next to no character development, and everything just ends up being a snooze-fest because these characters are just hard to care for outside of them looking cute. Unfortunately, this particular writing style has become quite popular with modern anime (Attack on Titans, AgK, or even Kotoura-san, etc), and for some reason, everyone seems to eat it up. Here\'s a possibility: People are just so used to badly written happy endings that they\'d rather have badly written sad endings, while deluding themselves that sad endings are apparently inherently better than happy endings because they think they are more mature. Something about teaching a moral lesson about heroes not always winning or some shit, I don\'t know. In that case, the preference is determined not by the actual quality of the writing, but just by the inherent difference of definition. It\'s like preferring black shit over brown shit. ""They\'re both shit, but at least it\'s not brown."" While this is no longer applicable for this show since it had a happy ending, it doesn\'t change the fact that it was the direction the series was leading people towards, and it\'s obviously the main reason behind people eating it up.All in all, this show is just yet another attempt at the ever-popular modern formula which involves characters going through depression in one way or the other, whether or not the characters were likeable or the depression relatable and the plot behind it well-written. It was practically tailored to the type of people who ate up the likes of AgK and Attack on Titans, and it did just that right before the end. I guess at least their reactions were entertaining. it does in the most hilariously incompetent way possible. Many of its other problems include the asinine pacing, lack of character interaction and development, and complete lack of subtlety, which all seem to go under the radar because apparently everyone is too busy crying over ham-fisted drama.That being said, there are some positives about this show- Mainly the visuals.

While it\'s not that having some plot elements that lead to a depressing ending is inherently bad- It\'s that when it does happen, it needs to be well-paced and give the audience enough time to feel actually attached to the characters in question. But with the lack of actual villains to provide any form of conflicting character interaction, there\'s next to no character development, and everything just ends up being a snooze-fest because these characters are just hard to care for outside of them looking cute. Unfortunately, this particular writing style has become quite popular with modern anime (Attack on Titans, AgK, or even Kotoura-san, etc), and for some reason, everyone seems to eat it up. Here\'s a possibility: People are just so used to badly written happy endings that they\'d rather have badly written sad endings, while deluding themselves that sad endings are apparently inherently better than happy endings because they think they are more mature. Something about teaching a moral lesson about heroes not always winning or some shit, I don\'t know. In that case, the preference is determined not by the actual quality of the writing, but just by the inherent difference of definition. It\'s like preferring black shit over brown shit. ""They\'re both shit, but at least it\'s not brown."" While this is no longer applicable for this show since it had a happy ending, it doesn\'t change the fact that it was the direction the series was leading people towards, and it\'s obviously the main reason behind people eating it up.All in all, this show is just yet another attempt at the ever-popular modern formula which involves characters going through depression in one way or the other, whether or not the characters were likeable or the depression relatable and the plot behind it well-written. It was practically tailored to the type of people who ate up the likes of AgK and Attack on Titans, and it did just that right before the end. I guess at least their reactions were entertaining.', ""Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is part of a multimedia project of LN, VN, videogame, manga and anime. And despite of it, the anime is completely able to stand on its own.The story is one of the strongest points, but for you to understand this you need to watch the series from the right point of view. As a Slice of Life the story is about the characters, sure world building is important, but ultimately the story focuses on the 5 main protagonists, it makes you care about them, their lives and it gives a proper conclusion to them.The art is pretty good for...a studio with low budget like this one, at the start the CGI is noticeable, but after a while you learn to appreciate the backgrounds, the town and all the locations, you can see they put a lot of job on this.The OST is a solid 10/10, with the composer of NieR is to be expected. From the Slice of Life to the action music every scene has a perfect ambience that lets you get immersed in the story. I doubt it's possible to find flaws about it.The characters are the main motivation to watch the series and also get into the franchise if you're interested in the side material. You learn to appreciate them and you get really attached to them because everything is portrayed and developed around them, the support between the sisters, the romance between Yuuna and Tougou and the character development of the originally lonely tsundere girl is explained at the right pace and given the proper screen time. The fact that this anime (and the whole project) had 2 years of planning is noticeable.The anime is really enjoyable by itself, but as someone who started watching it since the first week, I can say it's extremely recommendable to get into all the other material that is also part of this multimedia project, it contains multiple interesting information that makes you see the characters in a whole different light, and as I said the characters are the more important part of this franchise. The best way to do this is:Watch the first 3 episodes of the anime, read the manga, watch episode 4, read the VN, watch episodes 5, 6, 7 then read the first 7 chapters of the LN, watch episode 8, read chapter 8 of the LN, watch episode 9, 10, 11, read chapter 9 of the LN and then watch the final episode.The videogame is unrelated to the rest and it comes out until February anyway.Overall the series delivers everything you want, good characters, writing, romance, action, interactions and it teaches you exactly what the title says: Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero. It teaches what is a Hero and how to be Hero, to you and the characters.As a side note, even though I said the characters are the most important part it doesn't mean that the world is not interesting, on the contrary, the issue is that the anime doesn't give a lot of focus to it, only the necessary, that's why the speculation is also one of the best parts of this franchise, and this can be proved because it has been less than 2 days since the anime ended and there's already a lot of theories regarding the ending, and all of them are equally likely since this series is famous for leaving foreshadowing and references in all its media. I recommend you to watch it and join those theorists until those points are properly explained, and I know they will be properly explained because this series hasn't ended yet, it's only the beginning. a studio with low budget like this one, at the start the CGI is noticeable, but after a while you learn to appreciate the backgrounds, the town and all the locations, you can see they put a lot of job on this.The OST is a solid 10/10, with the composer of NieR is to be expected.

She\'s relatively one-dimensional, oblivious, airheaded, naive and childish in her ideals, which isn\'t inherently boring, but the world she lives in RESPECTS that allowing her simple and repetitive nature to prevail against any and all problems to the point where you begin to wonder if there\'s any point in growing up at all.I, like many others, stumbled upon the show ""Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero"" after hearing it compared to the illustrious Madoka Magica and were drawn to it by people saying that it was ""better than Madoka"". As a massive fan of Madoka Magica, I was...initially very excited: someone made a better version of one of my favorite shows of all time? I had even heard people saying that Madoka had been their favorite show until they watched Yuuki Yuuna, and since I realized that was pretty much where I was at I could not have been more thrilled to first learn of this show\'s existence. I pulled it up immediately, and went into it with high hopes and an open mind. I didn\'t expect the sort of poignant universal message that Madoka had given, but what I did expect was a damn good deconstruction of the magical girl genre. Compelling characters, enthralling twists, gut-wrenching moments of tragedy, and a genuinely enthralling story.What I found, however, was nothing.Nothing, Christopher? But that doesn\'t make sense. You watched 12 episodes of SOMETHING, right? There can\'t possibly have been NOTHING in those twelve episodes, right?Technically, you\'re right. I did sit in front of a screen for a regrettable four and half hours of my life, and there were words and drawings on that screen, but if I had to really summarize Yuuki Yuuka I would redirect you once more to that word above: nothing.You see, Yuuki Yuuna is kind of like a Frankenstein\'s monster that failed to come to life. It\'s stitched together from bits and pieces of other things but there\'s nothing about it that\'s really its own. There\'s no voice, no soul. It doesn\'t use those pieces to create something new, or stand on its own two feet, or say something for itself: essentially, Yuuki Yuuna just IS those pieces, tossed into a bucket together and just sort of sitting there touching each other. And since Yuuki Yuuna is essentially just pieces of other things that are loosely connected, I have no qualms in using the MAL rating system to talk about those pieces.THE CHARACTERSOne could make the argument that the characters in Yuuki Yuuna aren\'t ""bad characters"". In a sense, you\'d be right: they aren\'t horribly-written people and for the most part they have some semblance of continuity and we can understand where their actions are coming from (though this is not always the case, *ahem* Touga). The problem is, that\'s essentially ALL that they are: ""not-bad characters"". There\'s nothing in them. They\'re just archetypes grabbed from other places that are given mediocre scripts intended to invoke empathy in the audience. That\'s really all that\'s expected from them: they\'re not created to even BE human, their SOLE PURPOSE is to be ""not bad"" enough to the point where the audience cares about them. Not because they have any original ideas in them, not because they carry a piece of the creator, but because they\'re there, they\'re cute, and they\'re not ""badly"" written. There\'s the older blonde sister who\'s spunky and cares deeply about her friends, especially her younger sister. There\'s the younger blonde sister who\'s shy and cares deeply about her friends, especially her older sister. There\'s the tsundere girl. There\'s Yuuki Yuuna herself, who is pretty much the blockheaded hero-of-justice character in a world where the hero of justice never has to actually face the repercussions or naivety of her ideals. There\'s her best friend Touga who\'s really just a mess of a character and is used more as a poorly-motivated plot device than a person, but we won\'t focus on her.The problem with all these characters, however, is that while they are adequately-written versions of the roles they are meant to fulfill there is an emptiness to them that cannot really be put into the words. No one who wrote these characters cares about them at all. They aren\'t trying to express anything with them. They\'re masks, and they\'re treated as if they were people, and that hollow shallowness prevented me from giving a single shit about what happened to them. When you create characters with the express purpose of making the audience sympathize with them so that you can give them ""feelz"" later on by making them suffer, you haven\'t really created characters at all. You\'ve just grabbed pieces of people and stuck them together so that they look like a person. It may be cute, but it has no soul.THE STORYHere\'s the part where it was obvious that whoever was writing this was trying really hard to not be accused of plagiarism. While the literal elements of the story may be put together in a new, the structure by which it is built around is nothing that hasn\'t been seen a thousand times before, and the pieces themselves are unoriginal. Once again, the story feels mostly like pieces stacked together. Rather than have something constant and tight, it pretty much relies on the audience expecting twists and then delivering them often enough to maintain a level of interest. No section of the story can stand on its own as engaging: it RELIES on constant change, because the story possesses no substance of its own to fall back on. In a standstill the audience\'s eyes begin to adjust to the dull nature of the story, so the story has to be constantly adding new levels. It doesn\'t really feel like these levels stack cohesively though; it\'s more like we\'re just jumping from one platform to the next, and since the platforms are getting crazier the story must be advancing. None of these platforms are compelling in and of themselves though: they\'re mostly interesting because of the anticipation for the NEXT platform, which creates a bit of a cycle. All these platforms are as hollow as the rest of the show, being in and of themselves bland rehashes of been-done ideas, and the lack of any sort of central voice of the story means that the show fails to connect them in any meaningful way, so what we\'re left with is almost a pyramid scheme that eventually burns out because it can\'t create a bigger platform. Temporarily engaging perhaps, but inevitably all the more disappointing.ART & SOUNDQ: ""this looks like every other show coming out nowadays, what should we do?""A: ""we\'ll make the magic realm look like a unicorn shat on it, and people will think it\'s stylistic and original.""Q: ""But didn\'t No Game No Life, Madoka, Shinsekai Yori and Penguindrum already do something like that...? Except with far more creativity, heart, and personal flair?""A: ""Shhhh!! These are anime fans, they have the memory of a goldfish. Don\'t worry about it.""The sound is pretty standard, I don\'t really have any complaints but once again it doesn\'t do anything to set the show apart from anything else. It kinda sounds like Fate/Zero\'s OST with more sugary J-pop crap mixed in.All in all, not much to say.ENJOYMENTI had to literally drag myself through the last three episodes of this show. My expectations adjusted pretty consistently throughout. By the episode 5 I wasn\'t expecting too much, by episode 7 the show became a chore, and by episode 10 I wanted to drop it despite being so close to done, with the only reason I managed to finish it being that I enjoyed taking screenshots of moments that were either downright horrible or were pretty much excerpts from other shows, and because at that point I was actually HOPING it would end with a bullshit ""FIST OF BRAVERY!!"" moment because at least that would be hilariously awful. I wont say whether or not I got my wish though, cuz spoilers I guess. This wasn\'t funny-bad, it was bland, empty and soul-sucking.OVERALLIf you\'re looking for a magical girl deconstruction, see Madoka or Princess Tutu. If you\'re looking for compelling cute girls doing cute things, see K-On. If you\'re looking for members of a high-school club having to take on serious issues like death and existentialism, see Angel Beats (it at least has ideas of its own and some passion from the creator). If you\'re looking for a hero of justice show watch Fate/Staynight, and if you\'re just looking for a show to watch for the love of god watch pretty much anything else. There is nothing here you can\'t find in other shows done better. Yuuki Yuuna is nothing: its emotionally-vacant (despite how emotional its characters get) its dry, it\'s hollow, and its inevitably meaningless. There\'s no heart from the creators in this piece, there\'s no passion for storytelling or love for the characters behind it. Yuuki Yuuna is a shameless reaction piece attempting to stitch together the successful elements of other shows in order to appeal to an audience, and as someone with a legitimate passion for writing and storytelling I find this show to be a little angering. Many shows are burdened with flaws, but poor pacing and plot contrivances and annoying characters don\'t bother me nearly as much as something that refuses to even try to be its own thing.I\'ll say it one more time then.Yuuki Yuuna is nothing.Unless you want to watch four and a half hours of nothing, I advise you leave this shiny ambition-less rag buried in obscurity. initially very excited: someone made a better version of one of my favorite shows of all time?

Can they handle it? Well...I can\'t spoil things so you\'ll have to go find that out yourself...If you read the discussions first before watching the episodes..I will go to your house and cave your shins in! No seriously though..YuYuYu is a pretty good show.Take a slice of life anime with Magic girls add a lot of cute moments and well thought out characters and you get YuYuYu. The show leaves the impression of one of those really cute and action-y shows...basically giving the appeal of something out of Kyoto Animation (like K-ON! or Chuunibyou).Suddenly, the show takes a turn into a Madoka Magicka atmosphere...The story progresses into a more depressing and seemingly sinister series at the blink of an eye and you begin to worry about the future of these girls. Things worsen, your feels are tested, and more and more monsters are destroyed, but at the end of the day (series) all that was needed was the will to believe in yourself and your friends.Detailed breakdown:Story (9/10): As mentioned, the story seems very light-hearted and cute, but as it progresses...things get real...and quick. While seemingly slow at the beginning, the entire storyline is well thought out and very very detailed. What was impressive was how well the storyline was able to conceal its gloomy and dark parts of it with cute and warming parts. It\'s ending, however...left a more cliched ending to it....along with its slow start...keeping it from it\'s 10/10 mark.Character(10/10): To me, characters are the most important part of the story. It\'s what really matters in a scene no matter how you look at it. YuYuYu does it right. Not only does it give a background of each character, it also does a good job at showing how they connect to the other characters (through either relation (Fu and Itsuki) or the Hero Club). What I really liked was the mystery that surrounds Togo\'s two year gap.Art: (9/10): Despite having the rather ""generic"" anime style, YuYuYu\'s amount of color and detail in the animation was well done. From the designs of the characters to even the designs of the monsters and the Taisha world (mainly the heavy amount of color here).Sound: (9/10): I can\'t say much about the sound throughout the series. However, the song choice for the opening and closing was well done. Opening remained calm and collected, but at the same time...still a catchy tune. The ending was a completely different story. The use of certain voice actors during the ending really added to some of the ""depressing"" feel that came from the series itself. An example of this is the endings where only the seiyu of Itsuki sung the song during the episodes that were more focused around Itsuki\'s character.Enjoyment: (9/10): It\'s been a while since I felt anticipation for an anime show. This show\'s ability to keep me on my toes and always dying for the next episode is something worth noting. During the light-hearted side of the story, I enjoyed the rather comical side of the series itself...what made the show...well...slice of life. The action sequences and the battles were well done. During the darker side of the series, I felt a lot of anxiety as I began to fear the worst would happen in the series. The last time I experienced this was during my time watching Tokyo Ravens (Fall 2013 -> Winter 2014).Overall: 9/10. To sum up this series, I would say this is a must watch for fans of shows like Madoka Magicka. This series was well done and I cannot express how much I enjoyed the series overall.

It also doesn\'t matter the scope, either.Whether it\'s working at a soup kitchen, babysitting the neighbor\'s kid, or saving an animal from a burning building, it\'s not the grandness of the act, but the act *itself* that means everything. And more often than not, these people are bestowed with...the title of ""hero."" Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is a dark horse capitalizing on this idea, with more to the phrase than at first perceived.**STORY**YuYuYu (what I\'ll be calling it from here on out) follows the girls of the ""Hero Club:"" Yuuki, Togo, Fuu, and Itsuki.  They believe in their five tenets, looking to spread happiness wherever they go.On the outset, YuYuYu appears to be just another slice-of-life anime with no redeeming qualities. But past the first half of the first episode, it becomes much, much more. What this anime excels at is establishing and maintaining its vibe from beginning to end. The world is happy-go-lucky, essentially carefree during the more relaxed bits. Simultaneously, though, the show exerts an ominous feeling. That something is off, something is *wrong*, but one can\'t quite place his or her finger on what it is. It\'s not a shocking twist or some roundabout answer, either. The show slowly builds upon itself, reaching a crescendo, allowing for all of the built up emotion and uneasy feeling to spill over. The result is a consistent ride of trepidation that never lets up.In order to create such apprehension, YuYuYu attempts to go about its story-telling and world-building in a less-than-direct manner. The rules are set early on, with the girls learning about the true nature of what they are doing through observation, association, and even simply visual confirmation. This allows the anime to explore both the slice-of-life happiness and dark drama more compactly, because the information gained is never entirely presented on a silver-platter. It\'s always just out of reach, with enough given to move the story along.The truth is morbid and well done, with the actions of the characters involved being believable given the situation. It\'s not absolutely perfect, but the show more or less covers its bases, providing a fulfilling set of events that culminate in the narrative presented.The biggest controversy involved comes with the ending. Thematically speaking, the anime\'s overall premise is that, as long as one\'s friends are there, anything is possible. It\'s an almost literal ""the power of friendship"" message. The dichotomy that is created during the anime gives the characters a lot of room to connect and support one another. Birthday parties, beach outings, and regular club activities help to provide examples for just how friendly they are.Even during the hidden side, the story presents many opportunities for Yuuna and the gang to show just how good of friends they\'ve become. So, the question is, does the ending uphold the ideals that the anime set? To an extent, yes, it does. The purpose of the anime is not so much about where *all* the girls end up, just where *Yuuna* does. After all, it\'s her story. The whole season, she proclaims and demonstrates the type of person she is and who she wants to be. And in the end, her friends do so, too; by supporting her and being there when she needed it most. It\'s a touching story that may not have ended the way everyone wanted, but it follows through with the pretext it set.As a final note, one of the more prominent yet discarded topics within the anime is the religious aspect, or the ""Shinju-sama."" The girls fight to protect this god, going to extreme lengths to do so. And as the overall message details, it is not the god who saves them, it is ultimately each other. It\'s a snide remark about the ideas of religion and what it really means to devote one\'s self to faith.In YuYuYu\'s circumstance, it argues that religion can be seen as nothing more than self-destructive violence. It isn\'t the gods above who save the day; it is the people on the ground who heed the call to the challenges in front of them. And blindly believing in something without justifiable, logical reasoning merely leads to death and despair. It\'s a risky statement that the show is willing to take, and it does so in full stride.**ANIMATION**YuYuYu is quite the beautiful looking anime.The art style adopted is quite varied, both outside and within the ""forestized"" areas. The real world feels alive, with various locations besides just the club room visited. Lighting effects and other smaller details for the environments can be found, making the pieces themselves feel more alive. As for the ""other"" world, it\'s an explosion of colors and effects that dazzle about in a wide range of patterns. During these segments, the Vertexes, and at certain moments the girls themselves are done in 3D, but it never feels out of place.The character designs for Yuuna and the rest are simple in reality and, perhaps obviously, more intricate when it comes to their transformations. Even their final forms are given much detail, combining a mix of 2D and 3D that, once again, is pleasant to look at. Togo\'s design that includes a wheelchair deserves a special shout-out.As for the actual animation, it is stellar, to say the least. Action packed sequences, well-choreographed battles, and good character movements during the slice-of-life segments are the norm. The show never lets up, providing fluent and comprehensible skirmishes that showcase how strong this side of the anime truly is.**CHARACTERS**The cast of YuYuYu is vibrant, being characterized by not only their own developments, but by how they relate to one another.Before talking about any of them, what the show does well is in the character interactions themselves. And not just that they are right, but that they are done *better* than many other anime. The characters *feel* like friends. Their jokes and conversations make sense, they play off of one another, and they are not afraid to tease each other when warranted. It simply feels natural.As the youngest member, Itsuki is the quiet and kind little girl. She is the sister to Fuu, with the weird hobby of reading tarot cards. Her power, like her singing voice, is able to touch all those around her. More than anything, she wants to convince others that she doesn\'t need the help of the people around her at all times.Fuu is the leader. Loud and outgoing, her massive broadsword further defines her as a girl unafraid to be as ""unique"" as possible. While she may be the first to console a friend, she harbors heavy guilt, with massive built up frustration. As the captain, she works hard to protect the entire club, but especially Itsuki, from the troubles that are brought upon them.Introduced slightly later, Karin is standoffish yet approachable, serious yet playful. Her personality shines through in the armaments she wields: two samurai swords, both sharp and elegant. A ""tsundere"" through and through. For her, proving herself not only as a warrior but as a member is first and foremost on her mind. She doesn\'t want to bring the team down, because she feels she is the most worthy of the title they have been given.Actually handicapped, Togo is very intelligent and serenely beautiful. She almost always hides her emotions, reflecting the long-range sniping she employs. Even though she is forced to be seated, Togo keeps a watchful eye on the rest of the cast. She works as a website designer, and Yuuna is her best friend. And that\'s the truth; she would do anything imaginable to save her.Arguably the most interesting character, and perhaps rightly so, is Yuuki Yuuna herself. Extremely friendly and way too optimistic, she only wants to help everyone and anyone around her. Doing as much as she can with the two hands given to her, her bare-fist fighting style highlights this. She never gives up and she never gives in. The love she has for all her friends is huge, and she exhibits this time and again.Beyond making the characters interact naturally, not only do the characters feel diverse, but they experience development that ties in with the anime\'s themes and overall goal. Itsuki goes from dependent little girl to independent young woman, gaining the confidence she\'s been lacking (and wanting) all along. Fuu starts off as the stalwart leader but devolves into an emotional wreck due to her inability to handle the suffering that her fellow friends all go through. Karin begins hating the group and not understanding who they are, but ends up defending them ardently and unconditionally. And Togo has her trust completely broken and shaken, despite her believing in both the club and the ""Shinju-sama.""There is just one girl who doesn\'t waver or change along the way: Yuuna. Why is this? For her, there is no development because there doesn\'t need to be. She is constantly pushing ahead, never yielding. She is the example, the goal, what the other four girls *aspire* to be. She exudes confidence, stability, friendliness, and trust, all attributes that the members have always wanted. Because while the story may revolve around all of them, it is ultimately about *why* Yuuki Yuuna is who she claims to be.**SOUND**The OP is good. It starts off mysterious, with the differing vocals, violins, and acoustic guitar. It picks up near the halfway point, becoming more powerful and catchy, with the drums and choir-like singing. The ending vocal bit sends it off on a high-note, lending further to the anime\'s always-uneasy vibe.The ED shines as well. It is soft, giving a calming sensation that is sometimes needed throughout the season. There are numerous versions of it, depending on the episode in question, but it\'s a simple song, with simple drums and singing that once again still feels as if something is just not quite right.The soundtrack needs but one word: amazing. Quiet pieces, quick tracks, dramatic arrangements, it has it all at all the right places. The best piece usually occurs when the action is reaching a climax, with the vocalist following along to a repeated three-count. The whole OST is great to listen to both within the anime and outside of it, making it a contender for the top spot of the season.The voice-acting performances reach high heights across the entire cast. Emotional scenes, screaming, and varying inflections are performed by all at one point or another. Special shout-out to Yumi Uchiyama for her role as Fuu, Juri Nagatsuma for her role as Karin, and Haruka Terui for her role as Yuna.**ENJOYMENT**Being completely honest, I actually was not a fan of the ending. Without spoiling anything, what I wanted most was for it to go in the *completely opposite* direction that it went.But the rest of the package is there: comedy, drama, tragedy, anxiety, expectation, and both large and small scale battle sequences, to name just a few. It\'s a combination that is balanced well during the limited amount of time they had, making the experience a good one.Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru began quite strange but ended very strong. Its smart story, diverse characters, and incredible animation really do prove that Yuuki Yuuna is a hero.**SUMMARY**Story: Great, perfect mood, nice world-building, complete theme, religious undertonesAnimation: Great, beautiful art, nice character designs, 2D/3D mix well, fantastic actual animationCharacters: Great, Yuuna, Togo, Karin, Fuu, and Itsuki are characterized, developed, and connectedSound: Great, good OP, good ED, amazing soundtrack, good VA workEnjoyment: Good, has it all except the ending I was hoping forFinal Score: 9/10 the title of ""hero.""

For example, I\'ve heard many arguments that Nagi no Asukara is just a rip-off of From the New World, and while there certainly are similarities between the two, it\'s quiet a stretch to say that a romance drama is just a rip-off of a dystopian horror series. However, there are times where the degree to which something is copied is so severe that...""rip-off"" really is the only way to describe it. So, when a title gets to that point, is there still enough enjoyment to be gleamed from this newer series to justify its existence?I supposed it\'d be best to address the elephant in the room first: this is a magical girl series with an incredibly blatant attempt to cash in on the ""little girls suffering"" idea that Madoka Magica had popularized back in 2011 and is continuously called upon again and again within the anime industry because it continues to print money. While in the past I may have suggested that Selector Infected WIXOSS was also riding the Madoka Suffering Train, at least it also had a plethora of new ideas to bring to the table. Yūki Yūna is an absolutely shameless clone of Madoka, from the suffering girls to the horrifying world backdrop.There\'s also the matter of someone getting the bright idea to insert multiple episodes of slice of life-style comedy that served more to pad out the run time than to get us acquainted with the characters, and by the time we had our third slice of life episode in a row, the pacing had slowed to such an unbelievable crawl that I had considered dropping the series and not even doing this review. Additionally, the tonal shift between cutesy fun and heavy action leaning towards horror creates an incredibly unstable and schizophrenic tone for the series overall. With Madoka, the tamer and more relaxed episodes were confined to the first few episodes, but once the rug was pulled out from under us, the pacing grew more and more intense until it threatened to swallow up everything by the end of the series. With Yūki Yūna, the pacing shifts far too much in the first two thirds of the series for us to get a grasp of the true stakes.However, despite all that, the payoff that occurs when we hit the final third of the series was really solid; predictable, but solid. It also does take a very slight variance away from Madoka, mostly to avoid plagiarism, and ends up gaining its own level of disturbing horror in terms of the ""little girls suffering"" motif. There is also a very definite exploding point that happens, and once it does, the series really does pick up the pace from there and sprints towards the conclusion. It\'s just unfortunate that this doesn\'t happen until the show is almost 70% finished, and at least 40% of that is an annoying slice of life borefest. For that, I\'m sure that we can once again thank our head of series composition, Makoto Uezu (Akame ga Kill!, School Days). There were also quite a few gag-worthy moments in the script that were so unbearably cutesy and friendship-loving that I almost wanted to take a break after each episode and switch to Black Lagoon for a few minutes. As for the ending, I won\'t spoil it, but it certainly didn\'t deserve the ending that it received, and you can take that for either good or bad.The characters aren\'t really anything new either, yet it\'s still pretty satisfying to watch their world start to crumble around them. Yūki is our standard heart of gold ""I can do no wrong as long as I believe in the power of friendship"" lead character, aka Madoka Kaname without the indecision, and I was actually surprised by how little screen time she got compared to the others. Mimori is Yūki\'s best friend who is bound to a wheelchair due to an accident that cost her part of her memory, and her friendship with Yūki ends up being a rather interesting point of development for her. Fū is the slightly older, mentor character of the group who has to deal with the fact that she got everyone involved in this situation in the first place, while Itsuki is Fū\'s little sister who honestly just seems to be there to further Fū\'s development. Finally, we have Karin, who could not be more like Kyoko Sakura if she tried; an outsider who is initially put off by how well the group functions together but gradually grows to like them. On a more general note, aside from Fū and Mimori, it was rather disappointing to see that everyone else\'s character development was done in a rather direct and low effort way, whereas Fū and Mimori are the only ones that really seem to experience any true sense of psychological terror.The animation was produced by Studio Gokumi (Kiniro Mosaic), and let\'s not beat about the bush on this one: the animation for this series was incredibly mediocre. While the idea of making the girls cute did get executed well, it was executed almost too well, and some of the girls\' expression were so full of sunshine and rainbows that it make me rather uneasy. I do have to praise them for the other emotions that filled the character\'s faces though, as you really can feel the absolute terror pouring out of them during the final third of this series, especially with Fū. Aside from that, most of the animation was pretty bad. The Vertexes were rendered in almost eye-bleeding 3D, the fights scenes weren\'t that spectacular and the girls were often replaced with 3D models for said fight scenes, and while the set designs in the parallel world were very ominous and intricate, the backgrounds in the real world felt incredibly generic. On a quick side note, I really would like to know why the wheelchair chick got so much of the gratuitous fan service. It seemed horrifically out of place and started giving me Katawa Shoujo flashbacks.There is currently no dub for this series yet, and I wouldn\'t imagine one coming out in the near future.The soundtrack was composed by the group MONACA, and the soundtrack as a whole ends up being one part Yuki Kajiura imitation and one part generic slice of life background music. However, it\'s in those imitation Kajiura tracks that we find some really solid and meaty chunks that drove home the intensity of some of the more exhilarating scenes. The opening theme ""Hoshi to Hana"" was performed by the main voice cast and plays us in with a rather subdued pop track, while both ending themes ""Aurora Days"" and ""Inori no Uta"" were also performed by them and end each episode with a soft ballad.Overall, in regards to a recommendation on Yūki Yūna is a Hero, I\'m left asking myself a single question to determine my decision: is there something that this anime brings to the table other than what Madoka Magica has already done and done better? To be honest: no, it really doesn\'t. Any enjoyment that can be gleamed from this show can just as easily be achieved by rewatching a much better magical girl deconstruction. ""rip-off"" really is the only way to describe it. So, when a title gets to that point, is there still enough enjoyment to be gleamed from this newer series to justify its existence?I supposed it\'d be best to address the elephant in the room first: this is a magical girl series with an incredibly blatant attempt to cash in on the ""little girls suffering"" idea that Madoka Magica had popularized back in 2011 and is continuously called upon again and again within the anime industry because it continues to print money.

However, it\'s in those imitation Kajiura tracks that we find some really solid and meaty chunks that drove home the intensity of some of the more exhilarating scenes. The opening theme ""Hoshi to Hana"" was performed by the main voice cast and plays us in with a rather subdued pop track, while both ending themes ""Aurora Days"" and ""Inori no Uta"" were also performed by them and end each episode with a soft ballad.Overall, in regards to a recommendation on Yūki Yūna is a Hero, I\'m left asking myself a single question to determine my decision: is there something that this anime brings to the table other than what Madoka Magica has already done and done better? To be honest: no, it really doesn\'t. Any enjoyment that can be gleamed from this show can just as easily be achieved by rewatching a much better magical girl deconstruction.', ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSYuuki Yuna is the hero for wasting your time: (p.s not even a Madoka clone!)Happy time killer Slice Of Life bore, when the main the promo for the show were the battles, 85% of the show was filler. How on Earth will we care?Why is this a madoka clone? It's not. First impressions suggest an interesting thing with the fight royale magicka, but it was binned 8.5/10 times and it had to be a Slice Of Life monotony! And, most of the time, the girls are just screwing about as “Heroes” by being girl scouts, but its even stupider considering that they...don't even do there job often since their still mocking around! Where often left with unnecessary, unmoving and uncharitable amounts of comedic scenes like this sardine-adreniline girl who takes jokes about how much she drugs pills, and it has potential like using the Slice Of Life aspect to get some female bonding which results in “character development” in contrary to madoka at least we had a continuing plot avoiding such filler.At this point, how can we care? The plot progressed upon a snail  pace (even for a 12 episode series) and no one even develops, what a waste of potential! Consequently, how are the “magical” aspects of the show? Well, the girls ganged screwed with like 5 boss mosters, and oh my! Shonen power up – sheeeeeeum! Instant Bankai! The bosses die, no one dies, and am I not surprised? The show even fails to make “decent” tension and considering the biggest flaw, what an ascension! Wait, there are side effects from using Bankai Mankai? Everyone started caring about their side effects right at the end and they made it look like nothing happened to them and Mankai becomes hacks power up.Characters are archetypes. Why am I super surprised? We have the shy one, the energetic one, the vanilla one, the leader one and of course we need more than one vanilla one! This makes everyone two dimensional therefore no even two people give two flap jacks for this decent writing.I doubt will have sequels or prequels for this, and let this show burn at the pits of Antarctica and fade into space remembered as a semi-ish madoka clone?

(YuYuYu for short)Story: 8.5/10In post-apocalyptic age where humans are in near of extinction, humans still live each other peacefully....The story focused on a group of middle-school girls in a club called Hero Club.A Club that has a purpose to help other people who need.They\'re living their happy ordinary live until one day they suddenly dragged in different world(?), no I\'ll say it\'s a different environment.Being the chosen girls by their God, Shinju-sama, they have a duty to fight enemies called Vertex to protect their ordinary life, their world from destruction.Despite being a magical girl anime, YuYuYu uses term \'Hero\' for it which I find that unique.It may be started with light-hearted and happy story, but when you walk further.. everything is changed...Even with only 12 episodes, this anime never felt rushed, or I can say it\'s well-paced.The only thing that I\'m disappointed is the ending, but that doesn\'t change how well written this story is.Art: 9.5/10The art is one of the best aspects of this anime, I can say it\'s one of the best in Fall 2014.Opening scene is very well made, it has a deep meaning that you\'ll never find out until you watch further episodes.The animation and art is improved in every episode, it\'s carefully made that I find no \'derp-face\' when I watched it.The background is awesome, it\'s very artistic with water-paint color.Character design is also great, their transformation outfit is one of my favorite, what can I say, it gives \'ready to fight\' feeling from it.What I like is the action scene, it\'s soooo good, so pumping and so colorful, they even cast flowers in every hit. It matched very well with the background.The only flaw is the CGI in 2 first episodes, but after that it\'s done very well.Sound: 10/10The sound in this anime is outstanding.The OST match very well with every scene in the anime, no flaw, beautiful.It\'ll give you cheering and relaxing feeling in everyday life, and it\'ll pump you up in action scene.The voice acting is also great, they fit the character fully.They show the character emotion perfectly, especially on character breakdown, impressive work.You know, I\'m collecting all YuYuYu music, both OST and character song, just how awesome they\'re.Character: 10/10YuYuYu only has 5 main and 1 supporting characters, which I find it very pleasant since we can focused on the main girls.Every character has a different and unique personality, and they\'re likable.Unlike other magical girl anime, YuYuYu treats their characters equally. No one is stronger than the other, this is important.I like an anime that has a good character development, and this anime has it.The character is the most important aspect in this anime. The development is done carefully in every episode.Each protagonist got a huge development, everyone.I can guarantee that you\'ll emotionally attached with one of the main while the story progressing.Enjoyment: 9/10I truly enjoy watching this anime, if not, why I bother to rewatched it for 4times?I smile.I laugh.I cry.I\'m fired up.I\'m emotionally driven with this anime, and I love it.Overall: 9/10Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is one of other anime that makes me attached to it, and it deserve a spot in my favorite list.I\'ll recommend you to watch this anime, you\'ll not regret it.I\'m sorry if I\'m not that good at writing, it\'s hard to choose some right words.Thanks for reading my review. ^^ The story focused on a group of middle-school girls in a club called Hero Club.A Club that has a purpose to help other people who need.They\'re living their happy ordinary live until one day they suddenly dragged in different world(?), no I\'ll say it\'s a different environment.Being the chosen girls by their God, Shinju-sama, they have a duty to fight enemies called Vertex to protect their ordinary life, their world from destruction.Despite being a magical girl anime, YuYuYu uses term \'Hero\' for it which I find that unique.It may be started with light-hearted and happy story, but when you walk further.. everything is changed...Even with only 12 episodes, this anime never felt rushed, or I can say it\'s well-paced.The only thing that I\'m disappointed is the ending, but that doesn\'t change how well written this story is.Art: 9.5/10The art is one of the best aspects of this anime, I can say it\'s one of the best in Fall 2014.Opening scene is very well made, it has a deep meaning that you\'ll never find out until you watch further episodes.The animation and art is improved in every episode, it\'s carefully made that I find no \'derp-face\' when I watched it.The background is awesome, it\'s very artistic with water-paint color.Character design is also great, their transformation outfit is one of my favorite, what can I say, it gives \'ready to fight\' feeling from it.What I like is the action scene, it\'s soooo good, so pumping and so colorful, they even cast flowers in every hit.

This is my first review (most overused excuse ever, right?). English is not my native language, so I\'m sorry for mistakes.*I\'ll do my best not to contain any spoilers.**Also, this review will be long because I love to write!*When I first started to watch Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (YuYuYu) back in July 2015, I really expected it to be lighter Madoka Magica. I had heard many people talk about it and refer it as \'\'the most underrated anime of 2014\'\'. When I finally got to see the first episode, I was pretty surprised to see Slice of Life-elements - I thought this...was sad anime!Hero Club\'s Five Tenets:""Give a good greeting.""""Try not to give up.""""Sleep well, eat well.""""If you\'re troubled, talk to someone!""""You\'re likely to succeed if you try.""Story:YuYuYu tells a story of four girls (and later fifth) and their Hero Club, which does things like picking up trash, looking for new owners for cats, making summer festivals - you get the idea. One day, however, things change when time freezes and mysterious \'\'Forestize Warning\'\' message appears on girls\' phones. Fuu (Hero Club\'s founder) informs the other girls about their job as real heroes which defend the world.The story is really well-made and much thought is used in creation. It gives little hints from the really beginning if you pay attention. This is a series you could watch again. I would give story 10.Art/Animation:Fantastic. 2D animation is absolutely stunning and detailed and character designs are beautiful. YuYuYu uses 3D mainly for the enemies known as \'\'Vertex\'\', so it might look jarring to someone. I have seen worse 3D in anime before, but this time it was actually pretty good. As for the 2D, animation is really smooth and beautiful. Not really much off-model shots - I would give it 10, but 3D looks sometimes quite jarring - not too bad, however. So 9.Characters:Yuuna Yuuki - Main girl, which the series is named after. She is happy and energetic girl who loves eating and making friends. When Yuuna gets determined, nothing can stop her. She is that kind of a person that you can talk to about everything, from sad things to happy ones.Mimori Togo - Yuuna\'s best friend, but still asks to be called by her last name. She is really patriotic girl who doesn\'t use English loan words in Japanese. She is also very smart and skilled with computers, and thus is the one maintaining Hero Club\'s website. Togo also uses a wheelchair so she has Yuuna pushing her around.Fuu Inubouzaki - Founder of Hero Club and thus the one who runs the things. She loves eating even more than Yuuna and has a lots of \'\'Girl Power\'\', as she herself puts it. At the beginning of the series she was the only person who knew about the real purpose of the Hero Club. Fuu is also very protective of her friends, as she is their senior.Itsuki Inubouzaki - Fuu\'s little sister, who is really shy and sweet. She likes to look at Tarot cards and tell others\' fortune. She is also a really good singer. Itsuki is usually hiding behind her protective sister, but as the time goes on, she herself becomes stronger.Karin Miyoshi - Fifth girl who transferred to main characters\' school. She is a hero of Taisha who doesn\'t really want friends. As tsundere character of the show, she has a lots of pride and a cold heart at the beginning, but eventually evolves into a likable character with a good heart.Overall the cast is pretty amazing and their relationship with one another is really well portrayed in only twelve episodes. I give it 9.Sound:Voice actresses did a really good job in both acting and singing theme songs. My personal favorite is the opening song, \'\'Hoshi to Hana\'\'/\'\'Stars and Flowers\'\', which is really beautiful and well-made song with meaningful lyrics. Ending theme, \'\'Aurora Days\'\' really portrays the calm side of the series while the aforementioned \'\'Hoshi to Hana\'\' has a more serious and mysterious vibe to it. Itsuki\'s song, \'\'Inori no Uta\'\' is also really good and fits her gentle character.Background music in YuYuYu really fits the mood, was the scene intense or just pure Slice of Life. Battle themes have powerful strings or acoustic guitars, while mysterious Jukai has just a piano and vibraphone-ish sounds, symbolising the emptiness of colorful but out-of-this-world nature of the forest. I give overall sound 9.Enjoyment:I admit it - when I saw the first minute of the first episodes, I was so surprised that I thought YuYuYu would be average Slice of Life-Comedy at best. By the time I watched the end of episode and the second one, I thought it was pretty good, but maybe not Madoka\'s level. At the end of the series, I first gave it 8 because I had trouble with some things, but after analyzing it and watching some episodes again, I thought \'\'This is amazing, so why did I give just 8?\'\'Thus I give it 9. I will watch it again later, all twelve episodes, but I doubt that it will rise to 10.*Edit: After watching it again, I find it really hard to not give it a 10. So, even if it may not be perfect, I give it a 10!*Overall:Story: 10Art/Animation: 9Sound: 9Character: 9Enjoyment: 10Lots of 9s, huh? I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys magical battles, well-made characters and stunning animation. Even if you do not regularly watch this kind of shows, at least give it a try. First few episodes might turn someone off, but in the end this is closer to a masterpiece than garbage.Thank you for your time!

If you liked my review, I might do this kind of thing again!', 'Every time I see an anime cover with a cute magical girl/s, I always get the feeling that it\'s going to be similar to Madoka Magica. I tried the show out just to confirm my curiosity and what do you know, it is similar to Madoka but do not think the show is a Madoka rip-off because it\'s not.(There will be SPOILERS in my review)[Story]: (8.8/10) (SPOILERS)The story takes place in the era of the gods, Year 300. Yuuna Yukki lives an ordinary life as a second year middle school but she\'s also a member of the ""Hero Club"", where club activities involve dealing...with a mysterious being called ""Vertex"".This is now the second Madoka-esque anime that I have seen (First being Selector Infected WIXOSS) and I wasn\'t even searching for this anime. I just found it on Netflix, I saw the cover and I decided to try the first episode just to see if it was similar to Madoka. My curiosity confirmed, I decided to watch the whole show since it was only 12 episodes. After watching through 12 episodes, I really wanted more. The show turned out to be way better than I expected.It didn\'t take that long to show the viewers what to expect about this show. Halfway through the first episode, it immediately got straight to the point. They\'re magical girls fighting for the organization called ""Taisha"" and must defeat ""Vertexes"" to keep the world safe. Unfortunately, the organization ""Taisha"" wasn\'t explained that well. Who exactly is ""Taisha""? What was their backstory and how did they know about the ""Vertex""? All we know is they\'re just an organization choosing middle school girls (what was the reason for not picking boys again?) with high marks to fight for them and protect the world. Anything more about them is left to the viewers interpretation.In the second half of the show, the girls find out that there are consequences for being a Magical Girl or what the show calls it ""Hero"". To be more specific, if they keep using their ""Mankai"" powers (special powers), they will permanently lose a body part and it will never heal again. The show used this to their advantage, showing the characters struggling and how they dealt with it. If you have watched Madoka before then the dark plot twist shouldn\'t be a surprise to you. It wasn\'t a surprise for me but it was still a great plot twist.There was one effective dramatic moment that occurred in Episode 9 where Fu broke down after she found out that her sister auditioned for a singing program. She made it through the audition but because of the consequences of using Mankai, she lost her voice and will never achieve her dream of being a singer. I did not sign up for the feels. I never expected that dramatic scene. To be honest, the episode broke me down and I almost cried, no lie. I mean, you can feel (I did) what Fu was going through when she heard that file. On top of that, there was a background song playing while the scene was playing and it made that scene even more sad.Lastly, I want to talk about the ending. I wouldn\'t call it great nor would I say that the ending was downright terrible. The problem with the ending is it threw out everything the show was trying to build in the first 11 episodes. I was expecting the characters to stay that way because........the show claims that it was a permanent damage. Did Shinju-sama heal their permanently damaged bodies after they defeated the ""Vertex"" or was it because of ""friendship""? Either way, it looked like the show did a complete 180 and went for a happy ending with no explanation whatsoever. To be honest, I wasn\'t really disappointed with the happy ending but I would have preferred the bad ending since the tone of the second half was pretty dark.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (9/10)I didn\'t really like the character design when I first saw it. The biggest problem that I had with the character design was their face. I didn\'t really like how they look like they were blushing all the time. I got used to it after 2 episodes so it doesn\'t really matter anymore. The visuals and the animation looks great and I first thought this was a P.A Works anime. Turns out, it was some animation studio under the radar and is not well known.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (10/10)The soundtrack is simply amazing. Did Yuki Kajiura do the soundtrack? No?! Sounds like she did. The OST\'s are amazing, the battle themes are amazing. the theme used for the transformation scenes are amazing, the insert song used in Ep. 9 was amazing..Need I say more?.......She obviously didn\'t orchestrate the soundtrack which was kinda disappointing. Now the OP and ED theme songs.The OP theme song is ""Hoshi to Hana"" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and the ED theme songs are ""Aurora Days"" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and ""Inori No Uta"" by Itsuki. The OP theme song sounds awesome especially when all the 5 singers are singing together. The bass in the background is also another reason why I love the OP theme song. The song is also saved on my phone so if someone will need to get help because I can\'t stop listening to it. The 1st ED theme song is pretty average and I love...love the 2nd ED theme song. Just like Clannad AS\' sad songs, this song also makes me tear up everytime I hear it.I watched the show in English Dub so I\'ll be reviewing the English VAs. In my opinion, the sound great. Especially Fuu\'s voice acting at Episode 9. Her breakdown sounds convincing as hell. There was one slight issue in the voices and I found this to be an issue in both Japanese and English voices. It\'s Episode 11 and 12\'s constant shouting. It was annoying in English and It was even more annoying in Japanese.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Characters]: (9.5/10)My expectations weren\'t that high when I first watched the show. In other words, I wasn\'t expecting the show to be that great because like I said, I just wanted the check the show out to confirm my curiosity. I wasn\'t expecting the characters of the show to have a great character development and to be this fleshed out because it\'s only 12 episodes. I can\'t believe I have to say this but..........the show\'s characters are simply amazing. Do I dare to say that they\'re better than Madoka Magica\'s character? No but they\'re pretty close. All of the characters are fleshed out and all of the characters are mostly developed throughout the course of the show. Almost everything that they do are believable and the way Y(uuki)Y(una is a)(H)ero shows these girl\'s friendship and how they help each other out is almost realistic.If you\'re expecting the characters to be similar to Madoka then get rid of that expectation right now. There is now way in hell in hell these characters are similar and that\'s a good thing. Well, Besides Fuu being similar to Mami (They\'re both the Senpai and they both lead the group), they\'re not similar. They didn\'t copy every element from Madoka and the show did something of their own.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (9/10)As someone who only wanted to watch 2 episodes just to confirm his curiosity (I\'m talking about me in case you didn\'t notice), I did not expect to enjoy this show as much as Madoka. By the 3rd episode, I ended up marathoning the show just like I marathoned Madoka a few months ago. Sad to see the show end, to be honest.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[VERDICT]Despite the amount of Madoka rip-offs in today\'s anime industry for whatever goddamn reason, ""Yuuki Yunna is a Hero"" is not one of them. It borrowed most of its element from Madoka while at the same time, doing something on its own that makes it a unique show to watch and not a blatant rip-off just so they can try and garner the same amount of popularity as Madoka. If you\'re a big Madoka fan or you\'re looking for a great character-driven story then this anime is a must-watch. It is one of the most underrated anime shows that I have ever watched. Just watch out for the ending which might kill the show for you.[OVERALL]: (9/10)Pros:+Great Story+Stunning Visuals and Animation+Great Character Designs+Outstanding Soundtrack and OST\'s+Great and Believable Characters+Characters are Fleshed Out and Mostly Developed+Effective Dramatic Scene in Episode 9Cons:-Ending might kill the show for some people-Tons of annoying shouting at Ep. 11 and first half of Ep. 12 with a mysterious being called ""Vertex"".This is now the second Madoka-esque anime that I have seen (First being Selector Infected WIXOSS) and I wasn\'t even searching for this anime.

The show used this to their advantage, showing the characters struggling and how they dealt with it. If you have watched Madoka before then the dark plot twist shouldn\'t be a surprise to you. It wasn\'t a surprise for me but it was still a great plot twist.There was one effective dramatic moment that occurred in Episode 9 where Fu broke down after she found out that her sister auditioned for a singing program. She made it through the audition but because of the consequences of using Mankai, she lost her voice and will never achieve her dream of being a singer. I did not sign up for the feels. I never expected that dramatic scene. To be honest, the episode broke me down and I almost cried, no lie. I mean, you can feel (I did) what Fu was going through when she heard that file. On top of that, there was a background song playing while the scene was playing and it made that scene even more sad.Lastly, I want to talk about the ending. I wouldn\'t call it great nor would I say that the ending was downright terrible. The problem with the ending is it threw out everything the show was trying to build in the first 11 episodes. I was expecting the characters to stay that way because........the show claims that it was a permanent damage. Did Shinju-sama heal their permanently damaged bodies after they defeated the ""Vertex"" or was it because of ""friendship""? Either way, it looked like the show did a complete 180 and went for a happy ending with no explanation whatsoever. To be honest, I wasn\'t really disappointed with the happy ending but I would have preferred the bad ending since the tone of the second half was pretty dark.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (9/10)I didn\'t really like the character design when I first saw it. The biggest problem that I had with the character design was their face. I didn\'t really like how they look like they were blushing all the time. I got used to it after 2 episodes so it doesn\'t really matter anymore. The visuals and the animation looks great and I first thought this was a P.A Works anime. Turns out, it was some animation studio under the radar and is not well known.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (10/10)The soundtrack is simply amazing. Did Yuki Kajiura do the soundtrack? No?! Sounds like she did. The OST\'s are amazing, the battle themes are amazing. the theme used for the transformation scenes are amazing, the insert song used in Ep. 9 was amazing..Need I say more?.......She obviously didn\'t orchestrate the soundtrack which was kinda disappointing. Now the OP and ED theme songs.The OP theme song is ""Hoshi to Hana"" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and the ED theme songs are ""Aurora Days"" by Yuuki, Tougo, Karen, Fuu and Itsuki and ""Inori No Uta"" by Itsuki. The OP theme song sounds awesome especially when all the 5 singers are singing together. The bass in the background is also another reason why I love the OP theme song. The song is also saved on my phone so if someone will need to get help because I can\'t stop listening to it. The 1st ED theme song is pretty average and I love...love the 2nd ED theme song. Just like Clannad AS\' sad songs, this song also makes me tear up everytime I hear it.I watched the show in English Dub so I\'ll be reviewing the English VAs. In my opinion, the sound great. Especially Fuu\'s voice acting at Episode 9. Her breakdown sounds convincing as hell. There was one slight issue in the voices and I found this to be an issue in both Japanese and English voices. It\'s Episode 11 and 12\'s constant shouting. It was annoying in English and It was even more annoying in Japanese.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Characters]: (9.5/10)My expectations weren\'t that high when I first watched the show. In other words, I wasn\'t expecting the show to be that great because like I said, I just wanted the check the show out to confirm my curiosity. I wasn\'t expecting the characters of the show to have a great character development and to be this fleshed out because it\'s only 12 episodes. I can\'t believe I have to say this but..........the show\'s characters are simply amazing. Do I dare to say that they\'re better than Madoka Magica\'s character? No but they\'re pretty close. All of the characters are fleshed out and all of the characters are mostly developed throughout the course of the show. Almost everything that they do are believable and the way Y(uuki)Y(una is a)(H)ero shows these girl\'s friendship and how they help each other out is almost realistic.If you\'re expecting the characters to be similar to Madoka then get rid of that expectation right now. There is now way in hell in hell these characters are similar and that\'s a good thing. Well, Besides Fuu being similar to Mami (They\'re both the Senpai and they both lead the group), they\'re not similar. They didn\'t copy every element from Madoka and the show did something of their own.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (9/10)As someone who only wanted to watch 2 episodes just to confirm his curiosity (I\'m talking about me in case you didn\'t notice), I did not expect to enjoy this show as much as Madoka. By the 3rd episode, I ended up marathoning the show just like I marathoned Madoka a few months ago. Sad to see the show end, to be honest.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[VERDICT]Despite the amount of Madoka rip-offs in today\'s anime industry for whatever goddamn reason, ""Yuuki Yunna is a Hero"" is not one of them. It borrowed most of its element from Madoka while at the same time, doing something on its own that makes it a unique show to watch and not a blatant rip-off just so they can try and garner the same amount of popularity as Madoka. If you\'re a big Madoka fan or you\'re looking for a great character-driven story then this anime is a must-watch. It is one of the most underrated anime shows that I have ever watched. Just watch out for the ending which might kill the show for you.[OVERALL]: (9/10)Pros:+Great Story+Stunning Visuals and Animation+Great Character Designs+Outstanding Soundtrack and OST\'s+Great and Believable Characters+Characters are Fleshed Out and Mostly Developed+Effective Dramatic Scene in Episode 9Cons:-Ending might kill the show for some people-Tons of annoying shouting at Ep. 11 and first half of Ep. 12', 'A show that might be overlooked for its frontal advertisement. Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha (Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero) isn’t your typical ‘cute girls doing cute things’ type of show. Well, it is for some parts or at least the first 10 or so minutes of the pilot episode. Then, we realize the show is a lot more after a strange message on a cell phone that transports the girls into a world of the unknown. If ‘magical girl’ is something you’re familiar with and find enjoyable, then this show may be a treat.To trace back a bit, the show is an original work...animated by Studio Gokumi. Director Seiji Kishi is in charge of this project while Takahiro (author of Akame ga Kill) does the series planning. What this brings to mind is a strange collective of individuals to craft the series’ story. By all means, this show does sound like what the title suggests but the promotion suggests otherwise. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the girls’ lives in this series are about to change forever though.Understanding the series should be simple enough. There are two worlds – one in the human world that takes place at Sanshu Middle School and another world where strange entities known as Vertex has taken refuge. The first episode quickly introduces the main cast that composes a club known as the ‘Hero Club’. As the name suggests, it’s made of members who wants to help the helpless; kind of like trying to be heroes. The club also does other activities ranging from arts, craft, music, and literature. Making up the club are Yuna, Fu and her younger sister Itsuki, and Mimori. While their personalities aren’t alike, they connect well as a unit and often enjoy their time in the human world. The show quickly turns the pages towards another side when we see the girls getting transported to another world. As gimmicky as it sounds (complete with the cell phone trope), it may take some people by surprise especially for those who are unfamiliar with the premise or staff. The catch here is that the girls gets to be heroes for real in this other world by combating against the mysterious Vertex.An interesting concept to note about the show is how the characters’ personalities change or perhaps show their true selves once their circumstances are different. Mimori becomes a prominent an example of this especially after she realizes the true visage of Shinju, the very essence that the Vertex is trying to destroy. Faced with the possibility of losing what she values, Mimori suffers mental breakdowns throughout the show. Another part is the show’s focus on dealing with loss. The first half of the series shows the girls fighting and actually succeeding on most parts in their battle against the Vertex. Unknown to them, there’s a sacrifice (no, not their lives) to be made. The moral of the show suggests that nothing comes without a price and for becoming a hero, there’s also something in exchange to be paid. It brings about a sense of despair that is a solid mixture with the fantasy premise. The show chooses to make this bold choice rather than relying solely on slice of life to craft cleverness. Indeed, this show has its clever moments whether it’s the dark revelations or the character performances.The characters are a main part of the show as there is only a handful. Each of them stands out in some way although titular character Yuuki is the one that takes most of the spotlight. This is actual primal considering the way each characters’ roles are played throughout the series. They become magical girls, go to this other world, and fight with the future of the universe on the line. What bigger stakes are there? Each character must accept their destiny to overcome a tragic fate. At the same time, the girls’ struggle internally with the truth after realizing that their lives will never go back to the same way before. It’s when you realize that if it’s too good to be true, it probably isn’t. The battles against the Vertex is surprisingly not the reason why the girls suffer from despair. In most parts, the girls does fairly well against them but it’s not until they realize what they are fighting for that they break down. Some folks might see this as a ripoff of Madoka or another cheesy gimmick to deconstruct the magical girl trope. However, it’s also important to realize that the show retains its wit and focus. It also has a good momentum and ability to build up events while dropping foreshadowing throughout the story. For anyone who can appreciate a darker side of a magical girl series, then this is something to take notice of.Despite some of the appealing concepts of the show, the characters does suffer from a bit of stereotypes. In terms of characters, they are still middle school girls so it’s hard for older audience to take seriously at what they say. And because of their age, the girls’ emotional suffering can seem a bit forced with some repetitiveness. The story itself also has some balancing issues where we get a beach episode and introduction of another character (transfer student) to break apart the fantastic four. I don’t mean it literally but rather how the show can create a sense of annoyance as our new character Karin has an ego unlike no other. The series also has a strange direction as the characters seems to be fighting this enemy because it’s just the right thing to do. There’s a lack of a true villain or purpose that makes the series hard to predict. Thankfully, the series does know what it can do with its characters by presenting their desire (through flashbacks) and not steer away from what it has set up. The latter half of the series also has a much better focus without losing balance of the main story.Judging on artwork and character design, the show is probably is a mixed bag. Let’s face it, the characters look childish. They look like kids with cardboard box designs complete with the magical girl decorations. Although the series has decent production quality, there’s an auto-pilot like expression on the characters’ faces most of the time. That is until the second half, you’ll see how everything changes. Still, the show does deserve some credit for its elaborate design when it ventures into the supernatural realm. The Vertex are designed to look indiscriminately malevolent while their world also has a great degree of otherworldly elements. The magical girls’ designs may look generic but does go through evolution including their weapons and battle gear. And speaking of battles, the show has great choreography and non-stop action when the pace picks up.Soundtrack is surprisingly noticeable throughout the course of the show. The majority of it relies on parts when the series focuses on its battles. Later on in the show, we also get the more emotional aspect where we see characters expresses their desires and fears. I give praise to the actresses with their performances. It’s their ability to convey the suffering of the characters that make them almost seem realistic despite the fantasy gimmicks. To take this further, the series creates a sense of tragedy that seems to be unresolvable with its quiet atmosphere and OST. The OP and ED songs also does well with its well-crafted choreography.So what’s the best way to describe this show? Perhaps unorthodox would be a word to use considering the stark contrast of its first and second half with the story. Some people may see this as a Madoka clone when considerations are taken for the usage of tragedy, magical girls, and war against mystery forces. Technical wise, the show does justice in the end with its conventional direction. In retrospect, this show is refreshing for its ability to craft satirical story about heroes. As a kid, I’m sure everyone had his or her own dream but you may wonder the moment when that is shattered.

Step into the shoes of these girls and you’ll realize the experience.', 'Halfway through I took the snarky adage when dealing with Modern Japanese Literature to heart: ""All Literature after WW2 is about the Atomic Bomb"". I\'m sure somewhere out there, some extremely bored Lit student is spinning something like that out of Yuuki Yuuna.I\'m not going to go into anything weird like that though. I\'m aiming for fairness, and giving what is due, its due.There is a premise you have to accept, even if you deny the characters, the narrative, and the whole concept as a rehash of a lot of things (I can think of analogues from Eva - with the 12 Aliens, to Muv...Luv Alternative). You have to accept that if you like Madoka, then you must like Yuuki Yuuna, because Yuuki Yuuna is fairer in its narrative.(At least until the ending, but both Madoka and Yuuki Yuuna suffer equally in this regard)In this case, the under-reliance on dark twists (well, comparatively, to Madoka at least), and focus on Slice-of-Life, is actually a boon. One of the weaknesses of Madoka was simply that lack of care to have sustained characterization, in that I couldn\'t see clearly, for example, why Homura was so fixated on Madoka in the first place.People don\'t give Tougou her due. She has everything you would label as the \'dark brooding character\', and she is one, but she also has a sense of humor, and a personality (even if half of it is made out of a mix of running gags about Nationalism). That\'s a complete slap in the face to Homura as a character. She\'s probably the best character of the show because she shows a greater and more human diversity of emotions and reactions to the events around her.Everyone else can fall under quite a number of stereotypes. Cool Big Sister. Shy Little Sister who wants to gain the strength to protect the one she loves. The Shounen Archetype. The Recklessly Anti-social girl. I wasn\'t expecting much from the characterization here, but what it actually did with the stereotypes surprised me, because it made them more than stereotypes.The other thing is that, if Madoka is beautiful, and experimental, and avant-garde, Yuuki Yuuna has focus. Although none of the scenes really reaches the titanic psychological framing of Hideaki Anno, for example, there are some great subtle touches in various places. Usage of Silence, especially with some parts involving the sisters. Subverting Karin\'s growth as a character by adding further awkwardness in her development arc. Scenery fleshes out the town. Sometimes repetition of scenery, beyond just cutting costs, is used to frame a sense of monotony. A few bits here and there show, at the very least, a adequate control of direction, though not overwhelmingly so.In the end I came into Yuuki Yuuna expecting Entertainment and Emotions. I wasn\'t expecting a grandiose masterpiece. At the end it delivers wonderfully on this aspect. The battles here are simply more tense than Madoka\'s are. There are multiple curves and bends tracking ups and downs, with the adequate punctuation and reveal when things \'ramp up a notch\'. You feel the sense of danger, and the sense of rebound, and the sense of getting higher and pushing through, which fits the whole main theme of the show to a T. Madoka fight scenes are like Giallo scenes - stupidly lush and intricate, although more for the aesthetic. Yuuki Yuuna has those full Indiana Jones or Mad Max Fury Road fights with tension and thickness.Neither is the story straightforwardly a \'darkness for darknesses\' sake\' story. This is where I call it fair. There are dark reveals. But the conflicts come from purely, and purely, character\'s reactions to these reveals. Madoka only has one developed \'be careful what you wish for\' type deal, stemming from a character\'s actions, while the rest is purely plot-flow (wow Sakura had this weird religion-related plot backstory. Does that aspect of sin or Christianity even play in her whole character? Nowhere in sight). Yet Yuuki Yuuna manages to explore the effect on all its characters. In the ending, at least until the last part, everyone reacts within the frame of what was set for them. All of their motivations led them to fight on their own terms, and this is something that many action shows lack, giving no discernible foundation for characters to act the way they do. The tragic backstory is really only abused twice, and, even then, it fits at key moments, while the characters already had enough to stand on their own, such that it became complementary to their motives, rather than supplementing them entirely for a cheap knock-off. (I\'m looking at you too Jun Maeda)(You also cannot criticize Yuuki herself for having Shounen Hero-Blood, since she has it from the start, and acts upon it at every turn, and never shuns away from this premise, as opposed to Madoka, who literally has her Will come out of nowhere.)Even the weakest characters, the sisters, have their primary struggle arise from a set-up that was established quite early (episode 4). I\'m really aiming at quite a number of people who somehow have Madoka on their list as higher than this, when Yuuki Yuuna is foundationally stronger, and then proceed to try and attack characterizations without much else than saying ""they\'re stereotypes"". Yea, they are, and the director was obviously working with full knowledge of that, and how he makes a fuller statement is noteworthy of itself. (Think, for example, of how many death flags he purposely triggered)Even then, Madoka is still unshakeable in my heart for the level of pure spectacle and pushing formal boundaries animation-wise. Yet I\'m not really laudatory of its other aspects. Logic, people, is what Yuuki Yuuna has in spades more than Madoka. Logic to push through a premise for the most part, in a fair (notwithstanding the ending) way that gives credence to what it set out to be, and Yuuki Yuuna set out to be Entertaining Fun Emotional.So, if, somehow, you\'re a person that hates a fully Entertaining Fun and Emotional slice-of-life-action-comedy-drama, then you need more Yuuki blood in you.

Understandably, it is very hard to compete with a show that got not only its twelve episodes, but its drama CDs and several movies. Yuuki Yuuna just seems something of...a wannabe Madoka.The story has faults in that the pacing is incredibly uneven; toward the middle of the anime, there are several filler episodes that are hardly worth watching, as it seems like Yuuki Yuuna tried to drop from the magical girl genre to the slice of life genre. I have little problem with slice of life, but I do have a problem with being ripped out of an action-ridden battle to hear about how helpful each girl is to the community.The slow realization of the catch to the magical powers is a good cherry on top of the cake, as that is the moment where one gets the most out of the characters. It's almost satisfying to see each of the girls suffer a touch after having one too many episodes of ease.Additionally, the realization of demise brings emotion out of the characters that you just don't see early on.Yuuki Yuuna herself acts as a weak link in the cast. While this girl is the supposed main character, she hardly gets as much screen time as a main character should--nor just she get enough character development. Next to her friend Togo, who only gets more and more dynamic with each episode, Yuuna remains a flat, peppy girl who solves all of her problems with willpower and a strong belief in friendship.That belief acts as a major cop-out during the series as well, solving every single one of the girls' problems in a very developed tragedy.It may sound cruel, but I am almost disappointed these characters didn't suffer more--or rather, I am disappointed their suffering was disgustingly impermanent.Yuuna, as a character, did not deserve to have all of her problems fixed by her one-note personality. She watches as her friends lose hearing, sight and the ability to speak everyone pities her because she can no longer taste snacks. Yuuna takes none of the blunt force of repercussions until the final moment, and even then, the satisfaction of watching something happen to her is pulled away in an instant with the 'friendship conquers all' cliche.Other than the despicable treatment of the main character, the art and sound were not incredibly notable. The design for the areas where most of the action takes place are interesting, and the choice of watercolor and pastel is a unique juxtaposition coupled with the battle that is taking place in the foreground.Let a quick warning be given, there is a bit of shameless fanservice involving Togo, the disabled girl in the wheel chair; ask yourselves, is it /really/ necessary to sexualize the girl in the wheel chair of all people?Yuuki Yuuna did, however, do a good job of wrapping up the plot in a way that satisfied the anime's needs. The climax pulled through despite some difficulty managing the show's pacing. Someone less critical than me might enjoy the show more even--just don't look for Yuuki Yuuna to be anything other than the one-note courageous hero the title promises her to be. a wannabe Madoka.The story has faults in that the pacing is incredibly uneven; toward the middle of the anime, there are several filler episodes that are hardly worth watching, as it seems like Yuuki Yuuna tried to drop from the magical girl genre to the slice of life genre. I have little problem with slice of life, but I do have a problem with being ripped out of an action-ridden battle to hear about how helpful each girl is to the community.The slow realization of the catch to the magical powers is a good cherry on top of the cake, as that is the moment where one gets the most out of the characters. It's almost satisfying to see each of the girls suffer a touch after having one too many episodes of ease.Additionally, the realization of demise brings emotion out of the characters that you just don't see early on.Yuuki Yuuna herself acts as a weak link in the cast. While this girl is the supposed main character, she hardly gets as much screen time as a main character should--nor just she get enough character development. Next to her friend Togo, who only gets more and more dynamic with each episode, Yuuna remains a flat, peppy girl who solves all of her problems with willpower and a strong belief in friendship.That belief acts as a major cop-out during the series as well, solving every single one of the girls' problems in a very developed tragedy.It may sound cruel, but I am almost disappointed these characters didn't suffer more--or rather, I am disappointed their suffering was disgustingly impermanent.Yuuna, as a character, did not deserve to have all of her problems fixed by her one-note personality. She watches as her friends lose hearing, sight and the ability to speak everyone pities her because she can no longer taste snacks. Yuuna takes none of the blunt force of repercussions until the final moment, and even then, the satisfaction of watching something happen to her is pulled away in an instant with the 'friendship conquers all' cliche.Other than the despicable treatment of the main character, the art and sound were not incredibly notable.

Moving on, may I present to you the second (and hopefully the last) anime that made me cry.Story (10/10)I think I already pointed out the story but for those that have yet to watch neither of the anime that I stated earlier, read on.Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is not just a fluffy show where ""cute girls do cute things"" or...in short moe, yes there are moe in this series but there\'s more than that. The series just shows you what happens if you give out powers to young girls that are undergoing puberty. There will be one point when you\'ll feel like the character in the series and just understand their feelings, you\'ll get painfully attached (I hope i\'m not the only one.)I just felt that the authors tried their best not to make a rip off out of Madoka Magica, I would like to say they did a great job but there are still similarities but aren\'t all stories \'almost\' the same these days?Art (10/10); Sound (10/10)They are just amazing considering this a modern anime.The sound and the art will not bother you one bit.Character (10/10)I will not enumerate each and every one of them but i\'ll summarize them in one.Every character has their perks, good and bad. We have this set of friends in one club that helps other people, thus the Hero Club. The club says it all they are heroes helping the weak.Each character grew in every episode, as you progress through the series the characters realize that what they\'re doing are no fun and games. You\'ll just feel every pain that these characters have gone through.Enjoyment (10/10)I love this series so much (still being selfish hoping that they\'ll milk the franchise) but the story\'s ending was good enough so i\'ll just leave it there, i\'ll just be wishing for an OVA or special.Also to mention this series is overlooked a lot because they thought that they\'ll just be seeing a copy of Madoka Magica I would like to tell you that you are wrong my good friend, give this show a chance and if you hated the series be feel free to hunt me down. in short moe, yes there are moe in this series but there\'s more than that.

I\'m also one of those person who watches series at least 1 or 2 ep to see if I\'ll drop it or watch it, at first no doubt about it, the characters were so CUTE and that really helped me to watch it...then I didn\'t care about how cute they were now, the plot caught my eyes, and I was pretty much getting really close really really close to dropping this series, but then....oh boy I\'m glad I did not drop itYuuki Yunna...is prob one of the highly underrated series of fall 2014(by my guess from views on kissanime.com crunchyroll, wao, sites that I use). I somewhat had a gut feeling that I would like this series and as each ep. came out weekly ratings 6.50ish and now look where it\'s at, slowly, but surely, this series got better as it went on.Story/Enjoyment/ArtI\'m not going to review the series into details of the plot, but the plot was what made me really change my mind of this series(watch the series yourself for full detail of-course :D)The series starts of with a club know as the hero club, witch does a lot of community services in a way, after being ""it"" the hero club(4 members at start) are randomly taken  into another dimension where they fight these ""vertex"" where they have to defect 12 vertex and their battle would be over, so they thought...the series starts of really light and simple, and as I was watching my enjoyment was slowly dropping down on it until a bit more into the series their was a lot of hints of a different factor in the plot, the dark areas of the plot. Honestly it has been a while when I last saw a series that has brought some tears to my eyes. I would have to say this series felt really really close mahou shoujo because of the slow start and from the plot just giving hints and hints and here it is.... a twist, but I wouldn\'t say that this is another mahou shoujo despite the fact both series girls transform and fight, they do have their differences. The artwork of the other dimension is also really similar to mahou shoujo. And the ending is one of the difference, but just because it ended this way, that did not mean it was over(or so i thought).Genres: Slice of Life, Fantasy, MagicBeing in a part of a club pretty much that will lead to the slice of life eventthe dimension world that they are taken to brings out the fantasy genre to the seriesI\'m not fully sure if I would be able to consider this as magic, it felt more like it was super power/action, but also there wasn\'t much action at all, the hero club members didn\'t really use magic, but they did got their powers from something else may have consider it as magicCharactersYES, these characters were so.....CUTE, when they transformed to their hero form.... EVEN CUTER, but...it\'s not just their cuteness, their development as a character went really well, even tho as you might be able to tell, the plot will be around Yuuki Yuuna because of the title, but the plot did have room for development of other main characters which was really good, even a character that came in later had development, because this is a 12 ep series don\'t be expecting one whole ep. about one character, their developments were quick and simple and may even bring some tears to your eyes or heart warming at the very least?SoundThe sound was not really well I can honestly say from my view, the opening itself felt a bit dark to it, and then the ending it felt a bit more light? happy? it was a bit weird for me, but it didn\'t effect my enjoyment of the series. I would say the OST is a bit balanced with some dark theme, sad theme, light theme OSTs.Last Ep on Christmaswhat can I say? after eating lunch with the family and opening presents and then finally getting to watch anime, I can really say, I enjoyed my afternoon a lot more then I thought.

Coming back to it years later after having seen the prequel and sequel series and watching it a couple more times I think it\'s excellent.I love the abstract eastern-mysticism theme.  I got a better feel for the characters the second time through.  The visual design is unique and appealing.  The voice acting is excellent, as is the music.It\'s not really playing the ""subversion"" card, rather it\'s being straight-up slice of life to get the viewer attached to the characters so...that when tragedy befalls them it actually means something.  In fact, I feel these events are more tragic than a character dying.  The Taisha organization isn\'t evil.  They\'re inept humans dealing with things they don\'t fully understand.  The Vertex are more of a force of nature (or the supernatural) rather than villains.Comparisons to Puella Magi Madoka Magica (my favorite series) are only superficial.  In Madoka characters suffer from the karmic cycle of the wish they were granted.  Yuuki Yuuna takes the idea of the sacrifice of pure maidens, but their sacrifice is in defending the last remnant of humanity.  It\'s choosing versus being chosen.Some people seem to be negative about it having a good ending, but having been invested in the story and characters it was a relief to me.  And a breath of fresh air these days.  Yuuki Yuuna joins the ranks of Madoka, Clannad, and Angel Beats in being the few stories that actually bring tears to my eyes.  I\'d say a big part of that is in the acting.  Both the animation and voice actors combined in a way that gave me real empathy with these characters.Being positive and trying their best in the face of an impossible situation.  Genuinely trying to support each other even when they make mistakes and get hurt.  Learning what it means to sacrifice for the sake of others.  These are themes that I connect with, even if I fail at them in daily life.  I guess your enjoyment of this series might depend on whether you connect with them as well. that when tragedy befalls them it actually means something.

I must say that it was not what I first expected, but I am a huge fan of it now. I hope my review will be helpful to decide if it is also something for you :)What am I going to discuss in this review?- Short summary of the anime- Why watch this anime?- short list of Pro\'s & Cons- Best order to watch the anime series...And for fans of Madoka Magica:- Is it similar to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica?- in what ways are they similar?Short summary of the animeYuYuYu (short for Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru, since it is a bit a long name to keep repeating) is about a group of girls that started a hero club to help people with everyday problems, to make the people around them happy.But soon they also find themselves chosen to save the world from Vertexes, forces that try to destroy the world they love so much. The hero club has to find a balance between their normal activities and saving the world.What does it mean to be an hero, how do you cope with knowing of evil others can\'t ever see?Why watch this anime?YuYuYu is a great anime to easily get hooked on. I was not planning to watch the entire season in one day, yet I did.The anime gives you a good variety of different emotions through a combination of story, music and visuals.The anime does not use too mainstream characters.One of the main characters is a girl in a wheelchair. And no one is like: ""Ahw you poor girl, you are bound to this wheelchair, let me help you."" I think it is amazing how they made this character an actual representation in the series, where a lot of series totally fail at this.That being said I don\'t have a favorite character, nor do I hate one character. The characters are all balanced and realistic, they all have their flaws and go through a development.The soundtrack is amazing and synchronizes well with the events in the series. It gives you a hint of what is coming, yet the series is full of plot-twists and unexpected events.Pro\'s- Good character building.- Plays with your emotions, but in a good way.- Semi-unexpected plot-twists and unexpected events.- Great soundtrack, well balanced and in sync with events.- Great animation of the ""Vertex forest"". I honestly love this part of the animation.- One of the main characters is a girl in a wheelchair.- Characters are equally likeable, balanced and realistic.Cons- Vertex animations are robotic, although it does give them an eerie look.- I think the love/friendship bond might be a little too much sometimes.- I find that YuYuYu does too much fan-service, like in the transformations in later episodes, you see more and more big boob and under skirt shots. No. Stop it. They are children.- I have to cry when I hear certain soundtracks. But I like them anyway. Help.Best order to watch the seriesAs this is an anime review I will only give you the order to watch the anime series. If you wish to read the light novels as well, there are plenty of viewing guides on the web, but I only watched the anime (and I am fine with it).1) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (obviously).2) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Washio Sumi no Shou (choose between the movies or the tv-version, there are minor differences).3) Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou.I am personally most fan of the second one, Washio Sumi no Shou (again, it doesn\'t really matter whether you watch the movie or tv-version) since it explains a lot of things that happen in the first and it has the best story. But even though this is a prequel, you won\'t understand parts of it unless you watch YuYuYu first.Is it similar to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica?Just like many others, I found this anime when trying to find something like Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. Note: I did not want to find something exactly the same, I know many YuYuYu fans hate the comparison with Madoka Magica but I did want to find something that would get me hooked and gave a similar feeling. For me, YuYuYu did that. And more.So in what ways are they similar?- Great soundtrack.- Plot-twist heavy, something I really love.- Well played on the emotions: Prepare to be amazed.- Nice artwork, I loved the mazes in Madoka and though the artwork of the forest is different I think it gives the same feeling. I am not really fan of the Vertexes animation (clearly robotic, digital animation) but they do fit in and give an eerie look.Thank you for reading my review!

The characters are a joy to see on the screen and their interactions with each other is also very nice!I would give this show all the worlds praises if I could for driving me in so deep, but I might also end up over...selling this lol.+1. If I take my time and sit down to analyze the story and plot, it\'s very interesting and the world has a lot to it.2. It\'s a real joy to watch; from a personal standpoint, the story really just makes me cry. I\'ve not been able to watch this even once without crying haha.3. The art is adorable and the girls are even more so (I\'m adopting them as my daughters). Their interactions with each other and their friendships... You can really tell how close they are and how much emotion there\'s written into their characters.%1. There\'s a couple things that sort of feels like they\'re just thrown in there as a ""shit right, this was important too"". If you\'re unaware of the other animes that exists to explain that, it\'ll be very confusing to watch.2. The characters can feel very one dimensional (I say with all my love for them). You can clearly see most of their character tropes and there\'s very little character development (looking at you Yuna and Karin)3. There\'s bad focus in some shots... Normally I go unbothered by it, but I can\'t help but feel like that it was unnecessary and only went to provide fanservice, tho this is easily a thing to just think ""whatever"" with if you want...> I\'m not great at writing reviews, but if you found my ramble useful that\'s good! If you\'re considering watching it, I would strongly recommend it lol.I would say if you like Madoka, you should watch this.And if you don\'t like Madoka, you can still watching this lol selling this lol.+1.

You\'re likely to succeed if you try.Those are the adorably uncertainly-worded 5 tenants of the Hero Club, whose members comprise the main cast of YuYuYu, which has become one of my favorite series of all time.YuYuYu is a magical-girl (though they\'re called ""heroes"") saga combining some of the cutest shit I\'ve ever seen with some of the darkest. The ability for this series to keep me thinking about it while I wasn\'t watching was astounding. In those respects, along with most others I...can think of, I believe this series surpasses even Madoka, a similar show which I regard highly.Aight so remember when I said YuYuYu had some of the cutest shit I\'ve ever seen? The art style is so fluffy, and, especially in later seasons, they\'ll use exaggerated animation to increase both the cuteness and hilarity. The girls are so, so cute.My feelings towards these changed, however, when I started to see how they\'d be used against me. My precious hero club(s?) suffers a lot, and each time the emotional pangs were of the strength most shows barely deliver one of.I go back and watch YuYuYu1\'s ED often; it\'s so simple yet so catchy and even emotional. The OP is similar in that regard, carrying a somber tone. WaSuYu\'s OP and ED are adorable and sad at times, and YuYuYu2\'s convey the sense of finality of the season. The OST wasn\'t the kind of thing I noticed for most of the run time, but good god when it was necessary it could get to Demon Slayer Ep19 levels. (Even I\'m pretty sure that counts as an insert song, eh.)It\'s often confusing as well. While and while not watching I\'d be theorizing about why something is the way it is or even just what exactly happened, sometimes to get an answer later. I remember sitting in class one day and realizing the implications of an episode I thought was filler on a new development. I\'ve already started reading the unadapted light novels, of which there aren\'t many, and they provide a lot of background.Overall, YuYuYu is a series I\'m happy to say is among my favorites, and that I\'ll probably be obsessing over for a while longer, since there\'s a lot of content outside the main anime seasons. can think of, I believe this series surpasses even Madoka, a similar show which I regard highly.Aight so remember when I said YuYuYu had some of the cutest shit I\'ve ever seen?

The OP is similar in that regard, carrying a somber tone. WaSuYu\'s OP and ED are adorable and sad at times, and YuYuYu2\'s convey the sense of finality of the season. The OST wasn\'t the kind of thing I noticed for most of the run time, but good god when it was necessary it could get to Demon Slayer Ep19 levels. (Even I\'m pretty sure that counts as an insert song, eh.)It\'s often confusing as well. While and while not watching I\'d be theorizing about why something is the way it is or even just what exactly happened, sometimes to get an answer later. I remember sitting in class one day and realizing the implications of an episode I thought was filler on a new development. I\'ve already started reading the unadapted light novels, of which there aren\'t many, and they provide a lot of background.Overall, YuYuYu is a series I\'m happy to say is among my favorites, and that I\'ll probably be obsessing over for a while longer, since there\'s a lot of content outside the main anime seasons.', 'Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru – “You’re likely to succeed if you try” Many have claimed it is just a  \tMadoka copy, and yes the character designs are Madoka based. That I can’t refute when Yuuki  \tlooks exactly like Madoka and Fuu looks very much like Mami. But once you start to watch  \tthe story and understand what is going on, Yuuki Yuuna is its own story, with its own characters, \tand its own beauty.Story – 8/10In an alternate world everyone worships a divine being known as the Shinju. The Hero Club is a small group of four girls who...do random tasks to help others, when suddenly they get transported to another world in which they have now been tasked with protecting the Shinju from twelve “Vertexes” that will try and destroy it.As we follow them through their struggles the story, despite all the problems they are dealing with, always feels happy. As the girls fight Vertex after Vertex they do it with a smile. We also constantly look onto the lives the girls live each day when they are not battling. At times it can even fool us into thinking it’s just a normal slice of life and that everything will be ok. However the writers played it perfectly, lulling us into a sense of safety as we believed these girls would finish their tasks and we would see them succeed without consequence. An epic battle of the last remaining Vertexes at once and when they defeated they were done, they had done their task and succeeded. And then it happened. A dark turn into which no one saw coming, the heroes injured, each losing something vital in exchange for using the great power that come with using their “Mankai” and without a way to take back what was lost. The story grows ever darker as they try to discover why this is happening to them and to even discover the truth of the world.Characters – 9/10Happy and upbeat is something that can describe the first four members of the Hero Club. Yuuki Yuuna is the eternally happy girl always looking out for her friends. She’s the one girl who even everything is against them will always smile. Because of the love of her friends she also tends to be the one more willingly to sacrifice herself in order to protect them. Mimori Togo has always been Yuuki’s best friend but she has always felt ashamed of herself for being a burden due to her confinement in a wheelchair. Her story is one of pain and resentment which is slightly lightened when she discovers that she too can fight beside her friends. After defeating the twelve Vertexes she is the first to research why the injuries cannot heal which ultimately will lead her to discovering the truth of the world. The Inubozaki sisters are always together, yet could hardly be any more different. The elder, Fuu, is the strong willed senior of the group and constantly watches over everyone most notably her sister. She is quick to anger and even when upon hearing that their injuries even tries to attack the Shinju is vengeance for her sister. Itsuki was the quite girl of the group, yet no less helpful than all the others. Her constant helpfulness and eagerness was always shown so brightly. Even when she **Spoiler** lost her voice she never stopped helping others and wishing others to get well themselves. **Spoiler over** The late comer to the group was Karin, self-described as the superior version to the current girls she was trained by the Taisha to combat the vertexes at all costs. She can be considered a tsundere as she slowly yet surely becomes dear friends with all the girls. She is the one girl who after the final battle of the twelve vertexes was uninjured as she was unable to find the opportunity to use her “Mankai”. This actually helps lead her to become closer to the girls as she feels great guilt in not helping more.Art/Animation – 8/10The main target of much of the controversy that this was just a Madoka copy. The art is entirely different when in the real world looking very beautiful and serene, but once inside the plains around the Shinju where they fight the world is entirely different with strange vines and roots everywhere and strange looking Vertexes to fight. The character design, which two are based off Madoka and Mami are very different and beautiful.Sound – 9.5/10Oh the music was memorizing. Almost hypnotic tracks of beautiful sounding music. However strangely enough the music except at times was never overly positive or overly negative. It remained neutral throughout almost serving as a reminder of the situation that during peak times that not everything is as it seems, yet also when everyone was in anguish and denial that it would soon become better. A rather memorable moment was actually the ending credits of episode 10 in which they forewent the instrumental background in favour of pure vocals, it sent chills down my spine and was so sad without the music in order to prepare us for the final episodes.Enjoyment – 10/10Few anime this year have moved me in the way that Yuuki Yuuna has. A perfect combination of happiness and sadness. A story showing both times of joy, and times of anguish. Characters being ever proud, and ever doubting. It balances every aspect on such a fine thread, yet never slips. And in that perfect harmony of light and dark, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru shows its true beauty.Total Score – 9.14/10 do random tasks to help others, when suddenly they get transported to another world in which they have now been tasked with protecting the Shinju from twelve “Vertexes” that will try and destroy it.As we follow them through their struggles the story, despite all the problems they are dealing with, always feels happy.

Well, unless it\'s so iyashi it literally puts me to sleep. So seeing the Hero Club do a puppet show for a preschool turned my brain to pudding in a hurry... and then there was a literal punch line, a ""Hero Punch!"" line if you would. LOL.So for the next 15 minutes or so it looks like a slice-of-life show with comedic elements. OK, cool, so why is it called Yuuki Yuuna Is a Hero?As Yuuna is scolded...for leaving her smartphone on, time stops. Fu runs to her sister and says, ""We\'ve been selected!"" Reality fades away in a rush of petals.Oh. This could get interesting.There\'s a niche industry in Japan that caters to people who want to cry. Melodramas, beautiful music, that sort of thing. The way YuYuYu does it is... well, think Saishuu Heiki Kanojo, but more of a magical girl show.I say ""magical girl"", but this ain\'t no Sailor Moon or Cardcaptor Sakura. The action scenes are intense, and even though these girls have the ability to save the world, it comes at a terrible price. It\'s more akin to Uta Kata in this respect. This price will ultimately lead to some of the most emotionally intense scenes I\'ve ever watched in anime (even more so considering the chemistry these characters have), capping it off with an epic finale, both in action and emotional weight. This series does get a bit melodramatic, but then, it is a life-or-death scenario.The soundtrack is a work of art in this show. The battle music combines driving beats on the synthesizer with a soaring choir, employing melodies that evoke traditional Japanese religious ceremonies. Another big battle theme evokes the valor of the Heroes, but is in a minor key, and sometimes the phrase ""lamb to the slaughter"" comes to mind as it plays. The songs play an important role as well-- important episodes for a character usually end in a solo by her voice actress. Other nice touches include an opening animation that changes as each Hero builds up power, and episode titles that are the ""messages of flowers"" (which is a thing in Japan).The villains, such as they are, are pretty much really powerful Neuroi but with much better art style and no lasers. Why do I say Neuroi? No one knows how they originated, not even the series creators (or no one really bothers to put it in animation, anyway).Finally, if I may be so bold, whoever is in charge of the soundtrack needs to release the song Mimori sang in the karaoke booth. for leaving her smartphone on, time stops.

And it actually turned out to be more like a contemporary Magical girl anime”.As of late, the Magical Girl genre has given us anime like “Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica” and the “Selector WIXOSS” series.  Joining their ranks is “Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru”, an anime that shares many themes with the aforementioned ones.  The primary theme, of course, is the power...created by friendship.  Here, our heroine is Yuuna, a junior high girl whose devotion to Tougou, her paraplegic best friend, is praiseworthy.  The two of them are part of the “Hero Club”, members of which also include their senpai and club originator, Fuu, and Fuu’s younger sister, Itsuki.The Hero Club is a supportive group in Sanshu Middle School – Their duties generally include volunteer work and providing assistance to the other clubs.  When everyone first joined the club, Fuu had them download a special app that contains hidden features which are activated when they’re summoned to a surreal forest by the Divine Tree.  Unbeknownst to everyone except Fuu, the members of the Hero Club are the next in line to protect the Divine Tree against monsters called “Vertexes”.  Should the Vertexes (Vertices?) reach the Divine Tree, the world as they know it will be destroyed.  And if they’re up to the challenge, they’re able to use the app to transform into heroes who are aided by Pokémon-like fairies.  However, any damage that results from battling Vertexes is reflected as collateral damage in the real world.It seems like a conventional good-VS-evil story, right?  That’s how it starts out, but there are several revelations unloaded in the second half that’s more reminiscent of Madoka.  What has basically been subtext in similar anime is the main focus here.  There’s a heavy emphasis on what it means to be a hero and what one is willing to sacrifice to that end.  Heroes aren’t perfect – they go through trials and tribulations like any normal person.  With that in mind, several of the girls experience doubt and begin to question whether or not their efforts are in vain.  That kind of exploration is the real appeal of contemporary Magical Girl anime, and it’s also all you need to know from a plot standpoint.  And even though comparing this to Madoka might be a spoiler in and of itself, it works better going in with the knowledge that this isn’t a sugary, saccharine Magical Girl anime.As I alluded to, the second half provides startling answers to any questions you may have about the characters’ purpose.  But the first half sets the rules, characterizes the girls, and establishes what’s at stake should they fail.  You know, aside from the obvious end-of-the-world setup – namely, their personal goals and keeping everyone together.  Seeing the interaction amongst the girls gives you a warm feeling in your heart.  The feeling manifests even more when you see how they welcome a lone wolf-type into their group.  Their bond in the real world is strong and it never wavers once the battles get underway.  Most of the time, they wins battles through support and sheer determination.  As for the battles themselves, outside of “Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works”, “Rage of Bahamut”, and “Garo”, Yuuna has some of the best choreographed battles of late 2014.  The colors are clean and bright, the characters move gracefully, and the Vertexes have that otherworldly look that Madoka captured so well.Likewise, the transformations are stylish and gorgeously animated, but I couldn’t help but notice how slyly the anime tries to insert gratuitous fanservice.  The fanservice is not restricted to their transformations either, as on occasion, the director shoots the girls from suggestive angles.  The anime wants to portray these girls as paragons of purity, yet conversely takes time out to say, “This girl has a tight body” or, “This girl has huge boobs”.  I don’t know for whom this level of fanservice is directed, but there’s not enough to satiate those who crave it and it’s distracting to those who actively avoid it.  However, from what I hear, the fanservice is toned down from other Yuuki Yuna properties, so I can somewhat accept it as a compromise that leans more towards my sensibilities.“Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru” is an anime with an unassuming beginning that artfully raises the stakes as the series progresses.  Despite the homogenous character design, the entire anime is exceptionally drawn and animated.  The music is at times delightful, energetic, and ominous.  And as a final note: The character of Yuuna is one of the kindest, most dedicated female characters in recent memory.  I mean, she’s stubbornly dedicated to – not only her friends – but her ideals.  Characters like her can come off as cloying, but in the second half, her hopeful nature is very reassuring.  Even when the situation is at its bleakest, you can count on Yuuna to display true heroism.  Those who like Magical Girl Anime with a tinge of darkness to it should give this a try.

Welcome to the world of Yuki Yuna is a Hero where hope is sometimes all that’s left to stand on, but it might just be enough to get you over the line. A story following a school hero club thrust into an unexpected fight, Yuki Yuna starts slow but finishes with a bang to make for a magical girl experience that ranged from frustrating to thrilling.StoryThis is probably the first show I’ve watched where the enjoyment I got out of it was hampered...by comparing it to another show. I heard the talk before watching about how the anime was a ‘rip-off’ of the 2011’s massive hit which shook the magical girl genre, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. The answer? Yes and no. Character traits and roles in the Yuki Yuna team do feel somewhat familiar.Can it still stand on its own accord? Absolutely. There’s an interesting complication plus some reveals that kept me interested. Many also like to claim that the ‘darker’ themes of the shows fall too close together but I think the two shows take them in different directions. To say how this is achieved is quite the spoiler. Just don’t go in expecting a blanket copy of the story – I can give it that much credit.Enough comparing, let’s actually talk about Yuki Yuna as its own work.Yuki Yuna Is A Hero is a story that follows the title character and her classmates during their fight with the mysterious enemy known as the ‘vertex’. Naturally things aren’t as smooth sailing as they would seem at first glance. The truth behind the enemy and the girls’ purpose for fighting slowly comes to the fore. The real meat of the story is watching how the team cope with the revelations thrown in front of them. It’s a story with nothing you haven’t seen before: ‘Hope being the strongest weapon’ – but the delivery is entertaining the later it goes on.The opening portion of the show felt formulaic and everyone seemed too accepting of the role they’ve been thrown into. While there’s some great looking battles there’s nothing that made me say ‘wow’ or feel like something I hadn’t seen before. I did like the dynamic between the team members, and although they may fall into some ‘tropey’ behaviours, I was at least made to care about them from an early point.Here’s my biggest gripe with the show by a country mile: The middle third.This section had the problem that the content and the pace was too drastic of a change-up compared to what came before it. The trouble was that the shift in tone was so out of nowhere that it made it difficult for me to keep taking the show seriously. If an anime wants to spell out its themes, establish the mood it’s going for but then decide to take time out in favour of clear eye-candy moments - that serve almost no purpose to advancing those said themes - then I’m left with a bad taste in my mouth. I do understand that this brief slow-down in the story helps develop the characters a little but it certainly could have been done a different way. Don’t pull me in then in just the space of a few episodes make me start asking “when does it end?” You’ve clearly done something wrong.Thankfully the final third of the show is a thrilling conclusion and although the ending didn’t rub me right way I was definitely hooked in the lead up to it. One big problem with the said ending was that I didn’t get any sense of closure and it all made me wonder whether the plight of our characters was worthwhile. The second half still saves the show and at least made my personal plight, as viewer sitting through this, feel worth the ride. Knowing there’s challenges and burdens to carry that go beyond just fighting the Vertex is excellent. There’s actually some complexity to the tale and it’s great to see characters having to seriously question what is right and what is wrong when it comes to fighting.It’s just such a pity that story is so ‘fractured’ into these different segments. There’s practically no flow between them.CharactersI mentioned earlier that some characters feel a bit too familiar from another magical girl show. I don’t, for instance, have to tell you who Fuu Inubouzaki reminds you of. Even though part of me wants to go on comparing shows, I’ll stop there because Fuu is one of the stronger characters in Yuki Yuna. As the team leader her role goes beyond just giving the orders but when things go wrong she’s the one that feels the brunt of the problems. And boy does she have to carry some big ones. Watching her trying to maintain her leader’s position and cope with those is one of the more interesting aspects of the show.Her younger sister Itsuki is part of her personal motivation but Itsuki herself felt a bit forgettable when it comes to being part of the larger picture. She gets her own moment in the spotlight but it was perhaps a little cheesy. While I also found Karin Miyoshi’s character annoying, and also very predictable in her development, she was at least important for the team’s character development as a whole.Mimori Tougou is easily the most interesting character. Bound to a wheelchair she’s instantly at a disadvantage from the get go. She makes up for her lack of physical presence by being resourceful and level-headed – whether in or out of a fight. She’s the anchor that keeps the group grounded. Her intelligence also sees her feel confident to make some huge decisions at critical times, decisions that have the potential for massive repercussions.Finally there’s our main character. I do love that Yuna is the catalyst for helping everyone else find themselves and overcome their problems. She carries a sense of abundant optimism that no one else in the team shares. She’s the standard ‘if you believe you can overcome anything’ character but there’s no harm in that. It goes hand in hand with the theme that the show goes for: that hope can overcome despair no matter how great it may seem. Her individual contribution to moving the show’s story forward is actually quite minimal but she’s a decent lead character because you do feel like she’s having an effect on the other members.I also appreciated that fact that all the characters’ motivation made perfect sense. Each of their reasons to be involved and look out for one other were spelt out clearly for the viewer. The troubles that inflict each of them make for some good complication and there’s always that lingering sense of fear that someone is going to push themselves over the edge. Consequences for actions, whether said actions be seemingly right or wrong, feel huge. Reveals about the enemies and their origin did a good job of making me wondering what would happen next.Art & SoundFighting is the core of this show so plenty of work has clearly gone into making the environment unique. It’s a colourful, tangled universe that’s cool to look at. The CG features heavily and it ranges from hilariously out of place to solid. I think the abstract style of the world our characters fight in helps out the CG models a lot as they don’t look horrifyingly out of place.The string-laden OST is nice though there’s nothing that stands out. It does its job. Sounds effects in battle give plenty of impact and also goes a long way to giving the Vertex that ‘otherworldly’ feel.SummaryWhile copping a flak for being a little too similar to something before it I found Yuki Yuna worth the watch. There’s nothing revolutionary to be seen, and it’s a pity that it takes so long to get to the true complication of the story, but it’s worth it. There’s wonderful chemistry between the characters, the fights are usually entertaining and the problems the team become burdened with keep things engaging. Getting through the lulls in the story is a challenge. It may require you to push yourself through episodes at times but you’re bound to take away something from the show. by comparing it to another show.

I did like the dynamic between the team members, and although they may fall into some ‘tropey’ behaviours, I was at least made to care about them from an early point.Here’s my biggest gripe with the show by a country mile: The middle third.This section had the problem that the content and the pace was too drastic of a change-up compared to what came before it. The trouble was that the shift in tone was so out of nowhere that it made it difficult for me to keep taking the show seriously. If an anime wants to spell out its themes, establish the mood it’s going for but then decide to take time out in favour of clear eye-candy moments - that serve almost no purpose to advancing those said themes - then I’m left with a bad taste in my mouth. I do understand that this brief slow-down in the story helps develop the characters a little but it certainly could have been done a different way. Don’t pull me in then in just the space of a few episodes make me start asking “when does it end?” You’ve clearly done something wrong.Thankfully the final third of the show is a thrilling conclusion and although the ending didn’t rub me right way I was definitely hooked in the lead up to it. One big problem with the said ending was that I didn’t get any sense of closure and it all made me wonder whether the plight of our characters was worthwhile. The second half still saves the show and at least made my personal plight, as viewer sitting through this, feel worth the ride. Knowing there’s challenges and burdens to carry that go beyond just fighting the Vertex is excellent. There’s actually some complexity to the tale and it’s great to see characters having to seriously question what is right and what is wrong when it comes to fighting.It’s just such a pity that story is so ‘fractured’ into these different segments. There’s practically no flow between them.CharactersI mentioned earlier that some characters feel a bit too familiar from another magical girl show. I don’t, for instance, have to tell you who Fuu Inubouzaki reminds you of. Even though part of me wants to go on comparing shows, I’ll stop there because Fuu is one of the stronger characters in Yuki Yuna. As the team leader her role goes beyond just giving the orders but when things go wrong she’s the one that feels the brunt of the problems. And boy does she have to carry some big ones. Watching her trying to maintain her leader’s position and cope with those is one of the more interesting aspects of the show.Her younger sister Itsuki is part of her personal motivation but Itsuki herself felt a bit forgettable when it comes to being part of the larger picture. She gets her own moment in the spotlight but it was perhaps a little cheesy. While I also found Karin Miyoshi’s character annoying, and also very predictable in her development, she was at least important for the team’s character development as a whole.Mimori Tougou is easily the most interesting character. Bound to a wheelchair she’s instantly at a disadvantage from the get go. She makes up for her lack of physical presence by being resourceful and level-headed – whether in or out of a fight. She’s the anchor that keeps the group grounded. Her intelligence also sees her feel confident to make some huge decisions at critical times, decisions that have the potential for massive repercussions.Finally there’s our main character. I do love that Yuna is the catalyst for helping everyone else find themselves and overcome their problems. She carries a sense of abundant optimism that no one else in the team shares. She’s the standard ‘if you believe you can overcome anything’ character but there’s no harm in that. It goes hand in hand with the theme that the show goes for: that hope can overcome despair no matter how great it may seem. Her individual contribution to moving the show’s story forward is actually quite minimal but she’s a decent lead character because you do feel like she’s having an effect on the other members.I also appreciated that fact that all the characters’ motivation made perfect sense. Each of their reasons to be involved and look out for one other were spelt out clearly for the viewer. The troubles that inflict each of them make for some good complication and there’s always that lingering sense of fear that someone is going to push themselves over the edge. Consequences for actions, whether said actions be seemingly right or wrong, feel huge. Reveals about the enemies and their origin did a good job of making me wondering what would happen next.Art & SoundFighting is the core of this show so plenty of work has clearly gone into making the environment unique. It’s a colourful, tangled universe that’s cool to look at. The CG features heavily and it ranges from hilariously out of place to solid. I think the abstract style of the world our characters fight in helps out the CG models a lot as they don’t look horrifyingly out of place.The string-laden OST is nice though there’s nothing that stands out. It does its job. Sounds effects in battle give plenty of impact and also goes a long way to giving the Vertex that ‘otherworldly’ feel.SummaryWhile copping a flak for being a little too similar to something before it I found Yuki Yuna worth the watch. There’s nothing revolutionary to be seen, and it’s a pity that it takes so long to get to the true complication of the story, but it’s worth it. There’s wonderful chemistry between the characters, the fights are usually entertaining and the problems the team become burdened with keep things engaging. Getting through the lulls in the story is a challenge. It may require you to push yourself through episodes at times but you’re bound to take away something from the show.', ""A very enjoyable, well-rounded show that wonderfully tells a story through emotions, color and flowers.Imagine an anime being born from the visual appeal of No Game No Life, the moe from YuruYuri, and the plot of Madoka Magica having a threesome.Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru is that anime.The art is so crisp and clean, flaunting all those magnificient colors and oftentimes showing the beautiful contrast between hope and despair.The music is really lovable.

It will be time well spent.', ""Yuki Yuna is a Hero, for now on being called Yuyu, is a magical girl series that surprised me. Being a seemly dark magical girl anime released after Madoka, and with another show making that a negative thing, (Daybreak Illusion), I really didn't go into the show with much expectation. Though Yuki Yuna is a Hero is a title worthy of being a stand alone anime that shouldn't be seen as a madoka rip off.In a world ruled by a being named, Shinju-sama, Yuki Yuna and the Hero club help out the community. The Hero Club is chose by...the Shinju-sama to fight off 12 monsters called vertexs. And so, the Hero Club ensembles with the power of cellphones and friendship and protect their everyday life. Though as their lives go on they learn of the truth of their duties. The brutal truth that make them question the world around them, and ask the most important question of all, why are they even fighting.Yuyu is centered around a concept that is rather overused in the media, known as the power of friendship. While I do enjoy the concept; usually I find media to handle that concept horribly, due to fact that many shows don't exploit the actual friendship in question. Yuki Yuna does the exact opposite of that. Yuyu gets that friendship is about sticking up for your friends, but that what makes them so strong is being with them. Yuyu understands character interaction. The way the characters interact feels like how my group of friends act together, we just be ourselves. The conversations the characters feel like they do strengthen the bond between the Hero Club. It's because of those silly moments in the show that the serious moments have real impact. You feel the tension and the risk of their everyday lives, and their moments of happiness fading away.The show is very character driven, and it’s a refreshing break from the plot and world driven show that is Madoka. The characters for the most part are likable and I really don’t think any of them are badly written. While I wouldn't call any of them complex; their simplicity is really what sells them to me. Everything about them is clear cut and simple. Even with huge explosions and fighting going on, their conflicts are understandable. Though admittedly I am a bit disappointed by the lack of inner conflicts. Yes, while I could understand what a character is going through, none of the conflicts in the characters are really personal. In short, a lot of the characters are missing the big flaw. The thing that makes them a bit more relatable. With the exception of a few, I feel that the cast is really lacking a human element. Even so, they are likable enough and I do care when something happens to one of them. By the end I felt that all of them went through some kind of character arc, and that they have grown as a person at the end.Though...except for one... Yuki Yuna herself...Yuki Yuna is admittedly a very undeveloped character. She really doesn't have a character arc no matter how much I think about it. Yuna is kind of the same person she is at the end. She's heroic and selfless from beginning to end. So she kind of just exists for the sake of the plot and Togo as a character...Though she's not a complete Mary Sue, almost but she does have those moments when she's weak. She's not a perfect little flower, almost but no. Though despite all of that, I still cared for her at the end. For awhile I couldn't think of why I would like such an undeveloped character. Though it kind of just hit me when Yuna was fighting in the last episode. She was really similar to Hikaru Shidou, a childhood hero of mine. While Hikaru is a much better character, their personalities are similar; their outgoing and positive attitude and their I will never give up frame of mind. Yes, a bit of a shallow reason even for me, but yes I don't find Yuna to be a negative factor even though she should.So I was pretty satisfied with the character work, even if it was nothing too complex, and it did disappointed me in some aspects.The show’s biggest weak point is no doubt is the dialogue. I don’t think any of the dialogue is too bad, but it’s just that..some of it was bordering on cheesy due to the way the characters delivered their lines. (Both Languages)  I mean someone times it worked, because it fitted some of the characters. Example, whenever Yuki screams shit about the Hero Club’s rules during battle, it fits because Yuna is a huge fan of those rules and it fits her outgoing and positive personality. Though in a case where things don’t work is when Togo screams her heart out. Yes while those lines are okay and aren’t something to complain about, what I mean is that Suzuko Mimori, while a great actress I felt like the direction given was basically: “Uhhh try to sound like you’re suffering, but...keep it cool some how...”.The ending was a bit disappointing, I was hoping the show could go out with a bang and end with a bittersweet end, but I felt like it was a cop out. Though after re-watching the show, I have to say it fitted. The writers wanted to give the girls a happy ending, and they did it in the best way possible. While I'm disappointed, I can't say that it came out of nowhere.Yuyu is a great treat, it's story is a spin on what is now a Madoka inspired landscape. The script and the lore is interesting enough for me even though it's simple and grabs things from Madoka. Though it really is the simpler things that make the story and characters so likable. No matter no messed up a situation is, I could always understand, emotionally what is going on. Since the show sets up its characters to be endearing and relatable.Technically, Yuyu is quite impressive and performs well. Which is unexpected from a relatively young, Studio Gokumi. The color palate is light and fluffy, which gives the show a nice light hearted tone, but because of impressive lighting effects. The show got what it wanted across.Directed by Seiji Kishi, Yuyu is what I'd like to say is his directing skills in one show. Yuyu has his dramatic and emotional direction tactics as well as his comedic ones. Ala Angel Beats and Carnival Phantasm. The show's comedic scenes have the familiar quick editing and goofy shots. It strangely works, despite the type of comedy this show works with is different than something like Carnival Phantasm or Persona 4. Whole those shows have comedy that relies on anime tropes greatly, Yuyu uses the familiarly of the characters and certain situations to get across it's comedy. I still found it strange that his comedic direction still works well, even though I think the style is more suited to silly anime comedy.Kishi's dramatic directing also exists, pulling off a lot of emotion through character expressions, and dramatic shots. Though to be honest, I could have used more subtly. For example, in Togo's emotional climax, the shot is positioned right at her face. Yes, while it's okay for her to cry and scream, I felt like the scene could have been more effective if they just kept a back shot and the background being quiet. The expression while didn't bother me too much, I feel like it's a tad over the top. So I feel like the scene should have let the admittedly great acting shine through by itself. Though the scenes still come off as emotional and it still hit me. It's just my wishful thinking. The lighting is also a great factor. I noticed that in the most emotional scenes Kishi uses the darkest variations on the already existing colors. Which is nice since it shows how straining and heart breaking a scene is.On to the music aspect, the music is composed by KEIICHI OKABE, the man responsible for my favorite video game osts. I’m was honestly surprised when I saw him on the staff list. Didn’t know he did anime osts. I found this sound track of his in particular to be a rather interesting work of his..Throughout the show I always had a lingering feeling that the music was at least inspired by Okabe, as the arrangement of instruments and vocals were similar (and actually is) his style. So when I found out that he was the composer I was kinda surprised. Surprised that it wasn’t inspired, I began to see the OST in a different manner since it was composed by someone who has impressed me before.I began to listen and compare my impressions to his past work. After listening to the OST a few times in it’s entirety. I feel that with a lot of his work, this soundtrack, was different. That’s why I like Okabe, with each soundtrack he does for a piece of work, he does something different. Even with his style being prominent, I always felt that the music he composed was fresh each time. That is the same for the score here. Since Yuki Yuna is a show very different in terms of tone compared to Nier and Drakengard 3, the soundtrack reflects this. There are a lot of calm and more simple pieces, but there are pieces with more intensity because this is an anime. Because it is an anime, the pieces can be short and not have a loop, unlike Nier and Drakengard 3, which are video games.And really, that's the reason why Yuki Yuna's soundtrack is my favorite anime OST of all time. It's refreshing. It's style of music is refreshing from the bombastic and SUPER DRAMATIC osts from Madoka. (Still love the Madoka OST to death tho) The action pieces uses a combo of the violins and choir, but the way the drums were used made the scenes have more of an impact on me. The emotional pieces, with the exception of one are simple and contain the right amount of punch to get emotion across. You don't have to have an arsenal of violins to make a piece emotional. All it takes is one vocal and a guitar, then maybe a bit of violin. While this isn't Okabe's best work critically, it's an OST that I honestly liked because of the context I had while listening to it.In terms of voice acting, the cast consist of mostly new people. Which is something I adore the producers deciding, since the acting also felt fresh and different than the usual Kana Hanazawa performance. (She's in the show too by the way, she does the job like always). Though the cast do have their fair moments where they mess up. While I do think the acting is solid for the most part, there are few times where I felt like some lines could have been delivered better. Sometimes I felt like it was the director's fault (the Togo scene previously mentioned), and sometimes I just felt like the actress could have put more into it. (Yuna mostly) Still, those moments when the acting falters, they are few and far between. Plus when I was watching the show without a critical eye, I was sucked in enough to not care about the acting.In terms of the dub, which currently only has 4 episodes out at the time of this review. I like the fact the the dub also opted for newer voice actresses. They perform well, and is about the same level of the Japanese performances, for now. Though the script is mostly faithful, I do feel like the script does changes how a few characters feel. For example, Itsuki is less reserved, calling out on her sister's crap a bit more harshly. Fu is a bit more soft, with her tone of voice slightly less...Senpai like. I actually like these slight changes. Fu comes off a bit more relatable and Itsuki is quite nice as well. Though these changes don't make the two different characters. They still are the same Fu and Itsuki we know.Overall even with the minor hiccups, Yuki Yuna performs amazingly. Certainly one of the better shows of the 2014 fall season. Yuki Yuna is a Hero was an enjoyable experience that is everything I wanted in a show. It reminded me of the times I had as a child as well as the special moments of friendship I have now. So even if it's flawed I'll always remember it as something more than a Madoka rip off. the Shinju-sama to fight off 12 monsters called vertexs. And so, the Hero Club ensembles with the power of cellphones and friendship and protect their everyday life. Though as their lives go on they learn of the truth of their duties.

Except Madoka was great all 12 episodes, even the first three slow ones have replay value once you understand the full context. Madoka Magica is pitched as a magical girl show with dark tones and little cute girls suffering. Yuki Yuna attempts the same except I’m the one that’s suffering because it’s so boring. The emotional payoff—while fantastic—is NOT worth it.Look, there’s...only so much time and energy we all have. We work, we go home, and our free time is precious. I can work through my Steam library of 300 games, I can finish reading The Hunger Games, I can catch up on Breaking Bad, or I can watch some anime. Point is, there’s a million alternatives I can do which are far more satisfying.The premise is that these girls are chosen to defend the world. They can transform to have magical powers, and they fight off monsters. Turns out there’s a cost. Who knew? I do not recommend this show to anyone. It drags on far too much, and it’s so boring you’re left numb. I was begging for something interesting to happen. The emotional payoff is good I’ll admit, but it’s not worth it. Furthermore, the girls can go into a second more powerful transformation to defeat the increasingly stronger monsters, but they suffer permanent damage to their bodies like going deaf, mute, blind or even losing limbs.It’s this sacrifice that carries the dark undertone of the show, and it’s a fantastic story element. I’m sick of power ups with no cost. Oh, there’s a new stronger enemy? Lemme get in my hyperbolic time chamber and train and go Super Saiyan 4. This is how you get power creep. But the fact that the girls literally sacrifice life and limb for their powers makes the battles a lot more engaging. Unfortunately, there’s very little action until the end of the series.These sacrifices are hidden from the girls until they find out which drives the emotional payoff. For example, one girl wants to be a singer but later (after using her secondary power up) she goes mute. Everyone thought their injuries would heal, but they soon realize that it's permanent. There’s a great scene where the older sister realizes this and breaks down. Before, there was a heartbreaking moment where the sisters were eating dinner in silence after earlier episodes showed them eating, talking, and laughing. It's a subtle but excellent scene with set up and payoff. One of my favorites from the show.The character and enemy designs are so generic and bland. Not that Madoka’s character designs were much better, but they had enough style to make them distinct. Here the characters look like anyone else. The enemies aren’t threatening looking in the least. They’re masses of bland parts thrown together. Madoka’s witches had that surreal, nightmarish quality to them.I didn't watch this constantly comparing it to Madoka Magica. The similarities are shallow at best. I let Yuki Yuna stand on it own. I WANTED to like this, but Yuki Yuna is just...So. Fucking. Boring.The characters themselves aren’t actually interesting at all. They’re just as boring as they look. The reason the emotional payoff near the end is so great is because of the story’s set up and not the actual characters. The elements and the plot details are there so when they click together it’s great.For example, in the third episode there’s a new girl. She’s the tough, “I don’t need friends” kind of character. The other girls eventually throw a birthday party for her and she realizes the value of friendship. Shit like that. Later there’s a big battle in the middle of the show where she doesn’t use her secondary power up. This was before they realized the bodily costs of the second power up. This was early in the show and good set up.Later, during final battle she goes all out and uses her second power up over and over. She fights the monsters while yelling about protecting her friends. After it’s done, she’s left blind and deaf. This was the payoff, and was very satisfying.The pacing of the show is awful. It drags and drags. It doesn’t help the characters are boring, but the actual events in the show are dull slice-of-life. They eat udon, they hang out at karaoke, they go to the beach—it’s all so mundane. There’s nothing else happening. It’s all very linear. There are no subplots to keep it exciting. And this is most of the show. I constantly felt numb at how boring it was. I kept asking “When is this going to get better?” A good show should never make you feel numb.I kept track of how each episode left me feeling and 7 out of the 12 episodes I’ve watched were terrible. Fucking seven. That’s 58% of the show that’s shit.- Would you watch a movie where half of it was boring?- Would you read a book where half of it was a chore?- Would you watch a TV series where it doesn’t get good until halfway through the season?Absolutely not. Worse, you can’t skip the episodes either because through the boredom they sprinkle in details as set up for the later payoff. The boring episodes develop the characters and sets everything up for later, but this doesn't mean the development itself was good. You still have to make the actual, minute-by-minute screen time of the characters exciting. Just showing them off and setting up by itself isn't interesting.Now here's the worst part. After any investment you had in these boring characters, guess what? It's all ripped away by the final episode. All their sacrifices, all the damage to their bodies, the entire emotional drive of the show is made worthless. The mute girl talks again, the crippled girl can walk now, any blindness is gone—the emotional payoff that you waited for is given and taken away by a happy ending that wasn't earned.So was there anything I liked about the show? Little details here and there. I liked the crippled girl in the wheelchair. She was my favorite because it was a novelty.They use smartphones to transform so it makes it feel modern.I was so bored I actually enjoyed the fan service, and I almost never do.The animation is good enough. There's some nice jokes.There’s actually a lot of subtle foreshadowing which I really appreciate.There were moments that showed character emotions and intentions instead of using cheap monologue.I don’t recommend this show at all. The emotional payoff is fantastic and satisfying, but it’s not worth it. I’d say because I was so bored that the payoff probably felt better than it should have. The show has hints of good writing when they set things up, but most of the plotting is so fucking boring and mundane you’re left feeling numb and exhausted. This should’ve been a movie instead. only so much time and energy we all have. We work, we go home, and our free time is precious.

This should’ve been a movie instead."", ""It's been compared to Madoka since Episode 1. But as the story progresses, it becomes pretty clear that the producers've intentionally made it similar just to play with audience expectations. The result is a well-paced, high-tension anime that somehow manages to balance super serious action mahou shoujo and blissful slice-of-life.And that kind of hybrid actually works really well together! When the show gets dark, the characters keep their heads up by being there for each other. That's good stuff, and the perfect anchor for when the show gets really emotionally demanding into the latter half of its run.Yuki Yuna isn't about how these girls solve...plot problems, but rather how they react and cope with being given such a heavy responsibility.Unfortunately, this does backfire a few times, as the-power-of-friendship and doing-my-best can lead to cheesy resolutions - Yuki Yuna isn't afraid to take plot shortcuts in order to focus on the characters' relationships. This gambit has definitely polarized reviews, but I like the direction the producers took with it.9/10, this show is terribly underrated! (On a final note, the animation and music are shockingly good for such an obscure show.) plot problems, but rather how they react and cope with being given such a heavy responsibility.Unfortunately, this does backfire a few times, as the-power-of-friendship and doing-my-best can lead to cheesy resolutions - Yuki Yuna isn't afraid to take plot shortcuts in order to focus on the characters' relationships.

(On a final note, the animation and music are shockingly good for such an obscure show.)"", 'This magical girl anime is yet another dark magical girl anime that has been influenced by Madoka Magica. There are some similarities between this anime and Madoka, but to me that wasn\'t a bad thing. It was because I liked Madoka Magica and magical girl anime in genre that I decided to watch this.The first aspect of this anime that I enjoyed was the animation. It is like Hayao Miyazaki meets the watercolor artwork of Syu (who did the artwork for Nujabes album Metaphorical Music). It is beautiful and there were times I wanted certain images as my laptop wallpaper.The next aspect of this anime...I enjoyed were the magical girl transformations and abilities. This is one of the things that reminded me of Madoka, but I actually like some of these girls abilities better than the Madoka ones. One girl has super-powered fists that can do ""Falcon Punches"", one girl has a large sword, one girl has vines, one girl has a pair of katanas, and one girl has a sniping rifle. Each girl has a basic form and then a ""Mankai"" form that is like a leveled up version of their original powers. The Mankai forms are basically run by ""nakama power"", but one girl gets her Mankai form in such a touching and kick-ass way that makes this less cliche.The characters were the third thing I enjoyed. While three of them are reminiscent of Madoka Magica characters, all of them have genuinely care for each other as friends and get development that makes them sympathetic. My favorites included the siblings Fu and Itsuki, Togo, and Karin. Togo in particular, was enjoyable because she was a less crazy version of Homura from Madoka Magica. I also liked that even though she is a wheelchair and can\'t walk, she could still be a magical girl without having her disability magicked away.As for the fourth and fifth things, they are the soundtrack and the plot. The soundtrack is nice, particularly during the girls\' transformation sequences and certain battles. The plot  has some nice symbolism involving flowers, a dark and interesting take on gods and sacrifices to them,  nice behind-the-scenes commentary through ""a hero\'s play"", and a happier ending than that of Madoka.With all the good aspects, you\'d think I\'d consider this a masterpiece. However, I feel like there is one small loose end involving a certain secondary character that prevents it from being so. Nontheless, this might be the best post-Madoka Magica magical girl anime out there and I may rewatch it (and Madoka) again sometime. I enjoyed were the magical girl transformations and abilities.

Well, worry not, my friend! There\'s a new superpowered monster-fighting 13-year-old pink girl in town and she has a fist with your name on it! Her name is Yuuki Yuuna and she is going to PUNCH your sadness RIGHT IN ITS STUPID FACE. The most succinct explanation of why you should watch this show is as follows - if Madoka Magica is ""Magical Girl Evangelion,"" then YuYuYu is Magical Girl Gurren Lagann.What are you still doing reading this? Go. Go watch it. That should\'ve been all the convincing you need. Like, the first episode ends with her...punching a cannonball out of the air and then punching a giant flying death monster so hard that half the thing explodes. Holy Christ, it\'s amazing. Just go already.For those of you stragglers, let\'s start from the bare bones. Comparing this show to Madoka is honestly unfair and cheap (but the same could be said of EVA and TTGL, so the comparison still stands) because YuYuYu is absolutely brilliant of its own merit in very nearly every capacity. The art is gorgeous, the music is epic, and the plot is a fantastic showcase of everything that appeals people to the Magical Girl genre, both modern and classic. When our heroes are hit with despair, you feel it, and when they triumph, you will be cheering on the edge of your seat. The ""power of friendship"" has never felt so tangible - you\'re gonna believe.This show\'s story is masterful at preying on your expectations of what\'s to come. As little as it deserves the comparison, this show WANTS you to think that you\'re watching Madoka. It wants you to keep your eyes constantly peeled for foreshadowing and eagerly wait for that ""dark twist."" When the final act sets in, you\'ve forgotten all the little things that made up who these characters are and why they\'re doing what they\'re doing. Then, it reminds you. The small things - the bonds that are gained between people (reminder: this guy also directed the Persona 4 anime) - are what save the day. The main point of this show is that suffering and hard emotions aren\'t what makes a person strong; strength comes from standing together with people who believe in you and having the determination to push through those obstacles.With that being said, what sets this show apart from a storytelling perspective is its use of ""filler"" as a tool instead of a gimmick. The overall plot to this show is streamlined, with only a single third act dedicated to the actual twists and turns of the story itself. A large chunk of the show is goofy, comedic slice-of-life with little connection to the action and the drama from later. Unlike most filler segments, these moments are used to enhance the subsequent drama instead of stall for its coming. You understand the livelihoods that these kids are fighting for. You understand how close they are to each other, so that when a big speech about ""the power of friendship"" is delivered in true Magical Girl form, you understand exactly what they\'re talking about. You get to see what is at stake - and what is already lost - when they are put in dangerous situations. As mentioned before, the bonds between people are what makes them strong in this show\'s moral, and so any time it can take to show you these bonds is a wonderfully calculated build-up to the final climax.This show is a roller-coaster of clashing emotions. It\'s a comedy, and a serious drama, and a straight action series all wrapped up into one. What\'s most important, though, is that at the end of the day, all of these elements come together to a satisfying conclusion. It shows what can really be accomplished if a show is allowed to be fun in an industry that applauds angsty brooding. Get ready to cry and cheer and laugh and, overall, have fun.Did I mention that the main character punches things really, really hard? \'Cause she does.

It\'s awesome.', ""This anime was definitely a hidden gem last winter and I'm so glad I went back to watch it. While watching the series, you can't help but feel bad for the girls and wish that someone would please give them a break. At the same time, you just can't stop watching.If you want to see a mahou shoujo anime with a great story, characters, fantastic music, shocking plot twist and a very satisfying ending, do watch Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru. "", 'Ever since Madoka Magica\'s popularity skyrocketed, many people have tried to emulate it and imitate it\'s success. Some have succeeded whereas others failed, Daybreak Illusion being one such failure. It focused too much on shock value and being dark without properly developing its characters and giving us reasons to care about them. The most important thing in making a form of media is making it stand out from the rest. If it\'s too much like another work, people won\'t be interested in it. A form of media needs to stand on its own two feet and give us something other forms of media haven\'t Thankfully,...Yuuki Yuuna Is A Hero isn\'t yet another Madoka Magica rip-off, and succeeded where Daybreak Illusion failed. It even did some things better than Madoka!The story is about four girls, soon to be five, who form a club at school called the Hero Club (why they don\'t call it the Magical Girl Club since it\'s about magical girls is beyond me) who go around doing good things for people, such as putting on puppet shows for kids, giving abandoned pets permanent homes, and just doing community service for their town. Every day, they pray to a divine tree that protects them. But one day, out of the blue, they\'re forced into another world, fighting monsters called Vertexes that threaten the peace of the world. They become magical girls to protect their precious world because it\'s the right thing to do. But...there are many secrets about the Vertexes and the concept of Heroes, and what happens when they find out the truth?The animation has a bright, soft color palette during the slice-of-life scenes, but the battle scenes are bombastic, epic, and extremely colorful, going from light to dark in a matter of seconds depending on the situation, complete with flashy lights, fiery punches, and explosions. The character designs are relatively decent, and the transformation scenes are very well animated...though I\'d prefer it if they didn\'t close in so much on Togo\'s chest and sexualize the girls so much. But for the most part, there\'s pretty much no ecchiness at all, even though it\'s a magical girl anime aimed at adults, so for the most part, it\'s okay. The soundtrack isn\'t really anything special, and some of the battle tracks with vocals sound too much like bad imitations of Madoka Magica\'s soundtrack. But I do love the opening and ending themes. They\'re soft, well sung, and know when to be subtle and when to hit hard.The characters are a bit hard to talk about. They\'re all amalgamations of typical magical girl cliches at first glance: the cheerful pink girl, the smart and reliable older girl, the polite blue girl, the shy cutie, and the arrogant snob. I do admit they\'re a bit bland and could have used more development and fleshing out, but for the most part they\'re relatively decent, and do have their fair shares of hobbies and interests, so they\'re not entirely bland. I think a few more filler episodes dedicated to them just having fun and doing what they like could have benefitted the show a lot. But they do have a decent amount of character and personality, so we have more reasons to care about them. My favorite out of all of them is Itsuki. She\'s the most well developed out of all of them. She wants to be strong, has a dream she wants to fulfill, is trying to overcome her flaws in whatever ways possible, and loves her friends dearly, and she isn\'t the cute pure girl who doesn\'t know anything about the situation either, no matter how much her sister tries to hide it from her. She wants to throw herself into danger, be brave, and help her friends. To me, that\'s a character worth respecting.Unfortunately, there is one character I seriously cannot stand: Karin. God, I can\'t stand her! She\'s a typical tsundere, she\'s arrogant and has a superiority complex, acts like she\'s better than everyone else because she\'s supposedly an artificial human, her annoying voice makes my ears bleed, and she does nothing throughout the entire show until too late in the series. Really, you could cut her out of the show entirely and nothing would be lost! Plus, she claims she\'s an artificial human, but we see absolutely no evidence of this. She could easily pass for a normal human with the way she acts. Worst of all, the characters actually approve of her bad attitude and don\'t make a big deal out of it. I\'m seeing this a LOT in most anime, and it\'s bugging me. I know it\'s probably shoehorning in the moral ""Be nice to someone in the hopes that they\'ll reciprocate, see the errors of their ways, and change for the better,"" but wouldn\'t it be more believable if SOMEBODY got angry at her or called her out for being such an annoying, whiny little brat?But this isn\'t the only flaw the show has. Since the series is only 12 episodes long, there isn\'t time to really develop the characters and explain some very crucial plot related issues. There\'s also the ending. I won\'t give anything away, but I feel it\'s just too happy and convenient for it\'s own good, and with some things not being permanent raises a lot of unfortunate implications. But I won\'t let those kill my enjoyment of the show. It has its problems, some minor some major, but I really enjoyed it for what it was, and it\'s very inspiring. I also praise it for managing to keep a good balance of both lightheartedness and seriousness without going overboard with both, complete with subtle hints and a general sense of unease throughout the series, keeping us on our toes. Daybreak Illusion tried too hard to be grimdark, and it failed in its presentation with its bland characters and no usage of basic characterization and storytelling techniques to make itself better. Yuuki Yuuna knows what it wants, but knows it has to make us care about the characters and restrain itself in getting there in order to be effective, and for the most part, it did very well.It\'s not the best magical girl show out there, but I found it enjoyable.

She wants to throw herself into danger, be brave, and help her friends. To me, that\'s a character worth respecting.Unfortunately, there is one character I seriously cannot stand: Karin. God, I can\'t stand her! She\'s a typical tsundere, she\'s arrogant and has a superiority complex, acts like she\'s better than everyone else because she\'s supposedly an artificial human, her annoying voice makes my ears bleed, and she does nothing throughout the entire show until too late in the series. Really, you could cut her out of the show entirely and nothing would be lost! Plus, she claims she\'s an artificial human, but we see absolutely no evidence of this. She could easily pass for a normal human with the way she acts. Worst of all, the characters actually approve of her bad attitude and don\'t make a big deal out of it. I\'m seeing this a LOT in most anime, and it\'s bugging me. I know it\'s probably shoehorning in the moral ""Be nice to someone in the hopes that they\'ll reciprocate, see the errors of their ways, and change for the better,"" but wouldn\'t it be more believable if SOMEBODY got angry at her or called her out for being such an annoying, whiny little brat?But this isn\'t the only flaw the show has. Since the series is only 12 episodes long, there isn\'t time to really develop the characters and explain some very crucial plot related issues. There\'s also the ending. I won\'t give anything away, but I feel it\'s just too happy and convenient for it\'s own good, and with some things not being permanent raises a lot of unfortunate implications. But I won\'t let those kill my enjoyment of the show. It has its problems, some minor some major, but I really enjoyed it for what it was, and it\'s very inspiring. I also praise it for managing to keep a good balance of both lightheartedness and seriousness without going overboard with both, complete with subtle hints and a general sense of unease throughout the series, keeping us on our toes. Daybreak Illusion tried too hard to be grimdark, and it failed in its presentation with its bland characters and no usage of basic characterization and storytelling techniques to make itself better. Yuuki Yuuna knows what it wants, but knows it has to make us care about the characters and restrain itself in getting there in order to be effective, and for the most part, it did very well.It\'s not the best magical girl show out there, but I found it enjoyable. Feel free to check it out if you have the chance.', ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.This is review is more or less 100% spoilers so if you haven't seen the series, don't read this review.Alright, down to business. I liked the plot twist in the middle of the series where the heroes find out that the effects of going Mankai is permanent, and not temporary. I thought it would create an interesting balance between duty and self preservation. I also understood why Tougou and Fuu wanted to destroy the tree of life or whatever. If they managed to go through with it, I would've probably given the show a 9 or a 10 just for having...the balls to be unique and say 'fuck you' to the formula.But no, something or other happens, after the show spends like 10 episodes telling you actions have consequences, actions no longer have consequences because of reasons. Everybody gets better, the end. Probably the only show that has managed to make me sad that the ending is happy. Probably because of all the squandered potential. the balls to be unique and say 'fuck you' to the formula.But no, something or other happens, after the show spends like 10 episodes telling you actions have consequences, actions no longer have consequences because of reasons.

I went into this with an open mind and left disappointed.It\'s a missed opportunity. I\'d like to address that the ending is almost as bad and cliche as ""but I woke up and it was all a dream."" The audience is robbed of any pathos. There are consequences in this show, but they don\'t matter at all because at the end of the day they\'re all hand waved away. Moreover, I think it needed at least a 26 episode run to fully explore what it was. This would...have helped the plot in a couple places with a ""show don\'t tell"" approach. Unfortunately, with the breakneck speed that the narrative has to take the audience is denied that as well.There are also problems with the dialogue. There are several places where the characters refer to a ""level up"" for their magical girl powers. This is not one of those trapped in the virtual reality game shows either. That should have been edited to say a different thing as it\'s incredibly clumsy to say that in a magical girl show that has leanings towards slice of life.There\'s also another caveat I have with magical girl shows. The battles aren\'t that interesting. The girls literally engage in curb stomping the poor things that want to destroy their world. I would take less battles in a show if they were better animated and the girls had to outwit their opponents or something of the sort. The stakes never seem high enough.There are several plot twists in the show, and I think if it had a few changes and a longer run to really establish the setting, and characters, then this show would have been legendary. have helped the plot in a couple places with a ""show don\'t tell"" approach.

It makes promises it can\'t keep and that\'s one of the biggest problems I have with this anime.In the beginning I was sure that it would break my heart, because it started really well. After watching Madoka I had a lot of hopes for this magical girl anime, but it just didn\'t get there.It tries really hard to go places, but isn\'t able to succeed with what it\'s offering. We get teasers for really emotional storylines, but they remain teasers. There are moments...when I really felt for the characters and wanted to hug them, but not as much as I felt the anime wanted me to.You will find a lot of the typical magical girl tropes in this anime, which isn\'t inherently bad, but paired with a semi-consistent story, it just feels lacking. Yuuki Yunna had a lot of potential, but it just goes downhill, after the seventh/eighth episode.The first few episodes are setting the mood for a bad end or at least a bittersweet one, but that\'s not what you get, because Yuuki Yuuna just didn\'t go there. While you have the friendship factor and a few happy cute girls in the beginning, everything takes on a dark tone pretty soon. Still the girls are optimistic and so are you, until they fall prey to the effects of their powers.That part is something I liked. Magic – at least for me – should always come with a price, so it is fine with me, that they have to pay for the powers they\'re using. But that is where the problems start. The organization is lying to the girls, the girls are lying to each other (all in the sake of not afflicting the others), while one of them goes down a really dark path, but no one really cares about it.And this is the part where Yuuki Yuuna lost me for a bit. Their whole club is about talking to each other, but none of them does that. The episodes are dragging along now, you get a lot of slice of life (which would be fine, if it wasn\'t trying so hard to add something to the story and failing) and it isn\'t until near the end you get back into feeling something for the characters. You learn that they can enter another form of their transformation, but it is never explained how that works (are they controlling it?). There are a lot of things that aren\'t explained well, but especially how their powers work was something I would\'ve been really interested in.Then you get the end and it is just a wild mess. When you think about it, it doesn\'t make a lot of sense:They fight for Shinju, offering parts of their body/senses in exchange for the powers that are granted by Shinju, only to get them back, when he decides that they did enough fighting? When the vertexes stopped attacking? I didn\'t quite catch the initial part on the ""why"" he decided he could give them back all the costs that they paid, just because they exhausted themselves. (Also: Did all of the heroes get healed or just the main five? What about the girl in the hospital bed?) Like I said the ending is a wild mess.You get a happy ending, where the power of friendship makes everything alright.The overall writing was okay, but sometimes really cheap. There where a lot of sad scenes that wanted to force you to feel something and a lot of subplots that felt abandoned halfway through. I felt like I got promised something very different than what I got in the end, which makes it very hard for me to rate this anime.The end felt really rushed and I just have to compare it to Madoka, because there are a lot of identical pictures, so it just feels like it wanted to try a different approach to the ending of Madoka, but fails miserably, because that\'s what caused the whole ending to be illogical within the universe of the series. We were shown a lot of hard stuff, like the girl in the hospital bed, the memories of Tougou and the fairies, but in the end Yuuki Yuuna wasn\'t able to keep the consistency of its world to deliver a great ending.Another thing that really ticked me off was how they handled Tougous disability. When I started watching Yuuki Yuuna I was so happy about a character in a wheelchair, I was even more happy when it wasn\'t really addressed, but just accepted. The scene when Yuuna and Tougou meet was so sweet to watch and it made me really happy that Yuuna just didn\'t care about the wheelchair, she talked to Tougou without even mentioning the disability.Even happier was I when Tougou got over her initial doubts and transformed as well and even in her magical form still had her disability. I squealed when I saw that they even took the time to design her suit of armor so it would counter her disability. I was so so happy, just until the end, when they decided to magically cure her and take away all of the good things they build before. In a group with five girls, is it too much to ask, that one of them could be disabled before Shinju chose her? Is it too much to ask, just not to heal her and have her be a good representation for the disabled community? Tougous character and her disability where handled really well, until the last episode. (Yes, I know, you will tell me that it makes sense, because Shinju healed everything they gave up for the sake of their powers, but that doesn\'t make it okay, to handle a disability with a magical cure.)Overall I can\'t recommend this anime, because the poor storytelling and the all-over-the-place-plot, combined with the really illogical happy ending made it hard for me to enjoy it. The first few episodes where really good and I thought I would like this anime a lot, but I was wrong. The change of direction near the middle just didn\'t work for me, even though I really liked the dark themes and how bittersweet some things were, the ending just didn\'t work for me at all. when I really felt for the characters and wanted to hug them, but not as much as I felt the anime wanted me to.You will find a lot of the typical magical girl tropes in this anime, which isn\'t inherently bad, but paired with a semi-consistent story, it just feels lacking.

This anime tests the characters itself if they want to continue to be a hero or not. Can they sacrifice their own life, happiness, social life, goals to save the world?Every time they use their powerful modes (Sorry. I don't remember their term.), one of their physical abilities will be disabled. But In the end, before they lose their powers and bodies, they finally saved the...world.Art: 8/10 - I like the art itself. It's simple, clean and well-developed.Sound: 7/10 - The OP and ED are good and easy to understand. The background music is very good which makes my heart melt.Character: 8/10 - Every characters has their own personalities. I like the way they help each other both on life and battle.Enjoyment: 9/10 - Simply the best!Overall: 9/10 - No matter how many times I rewatch it, it's still great. I'll recommend it my kids to watch this in future to teach them what and how the heroes really feel and do. world.Art: 8/10 - I like the art itself.

If this is the case you are unfortunately going to have a bad time with this show because it is NOT like Madoka Magica and you will be expecting it to be. While the show does offer some interesting parallels to serving in armed forces and PTSD it ultimately falls flat and neuters itself with a very bad ending. This review will have very generalized story descriptions with minimal spoilers. Still, if you would prefer to go into it with you eyes...closed.... skip to the end of the review for an overall section.So lets get to it: On the surface Yuuki Yuuna is a pretty standard magical girls show about middle school girls doing middle school things. The girls are part of the Hero club, and become magical girls that fight evil for the guardian spirit of the Earth. The show has a tremendously long wind up (for a 12 episoder) as episodes 1-6 are basic monster of the week/ cute girls doing cute things style of anime. Again if you watched Madoka Magica and someone told you to make sure to watch to episode 3, I guess in this show it would be watch to episode 7, more than halfway through the show.Episode 7 is where ""$hit gets real"" and the real themes of the show come out. For what it\'s worth, episodes 7-10 are quite good and deal very interestingly with PTSD, regret, shell-shock, and survivor guilt. As the story unfold you learn about the less nice aspect of the girls\' powers and the toll it takes on them. As with many anime, Yuuki Yuuna focuses heavily on the theme of indomitable fighting spirit and power of friendship, which begins to ring hollow.The ending is where the story completely falls apart. Instead of sticking with a strong and poignant story that episodes 7 onward set up, the show throws up its arms, calls on the power of friendship and undoes all of the difficult decisions and character moments leading up to it. The ending is ABSURD especially considering what is said by one of the plot relevant characters as a part of the ""oh shit"" moments. But everyone loves a happy ending right? /s. The outcome of the ending is also inconsistent in terms of the world of the show.The characters in the show range anywhere from MAIN CHARACTER WITH HEART to moderate chuunibyou to ""I\'m too good for this shit anyways"" fighter character. While the character tropes are pretty standard, they\'re well fleshed out, each one filling a niche. Again here the comparison to armed forces service comes in very well. You have the guy who joined to serve his country, the guy who was in who recruited the others, the younger brother who follows his big bro in, the guy who thinks he can\'t hack it but does it for his comrades, the guy who\'s been training his whole life for this moment, etc.The art in the show is quite good with beautiful visuals during fights, and solid animation otherwise. Each of the girls has a good design and a somewhat memorable look. The sound is solid with good music, a good dub and nice sound effects. During the end quarter of the show, theres a good bit more yelling, but it\'s done decently.The overall enjoyment of the show is crippled by a very long lead-up before any interesting thing happens. For 6 episodes this show is the most mediocre magical girl show I can think of. For 3-4 episodes it is a fascimile of Madoka Magica. And for the last 1-2 episodes its Dragonball Z with the power of friendship, blissfully undoing any parts of Madoka Magica that may have been lingering around.It was a chore to reach an interesting and watchable point in the show, and it was over too soon. The ending left a horrible taste in my mouth and I wouldn\'t recommend it. I would suggest reading a plot synopsis on a per episode basis to get some of the thematic elements if you\'re into that. Skip the ending altogether unless you enjoy hackneyed bullshit. closed.... skip to the end of the review for an overall section.So lets get to it: On the surface Yuuki Yuuna is a pretty standard magical girls show about middle school girls doing middle school things.

I wasn't expecting much from this anime, but even then I was disappointed. This is my first review, and it will be spoiler free!STORY: 7/10. Good. Basically your average magical girl plot formula, so don't expect much there. The first 6 episodes are basically just filler, and nothing happens until the last few episodes, where the show decides it wants to be all grimdark like Madoka.ART: 7/10. Good. The areas are colorful and the character designs are cute, but they don't stand out much.SOUND: 6/10. Fine. There was one song...that stuck out. The opening and ending are nothing special. The music, however, fits the show pretty well.CHARACTER: 3/10. Poor. This is the area I was most disappointed. Before watching, I had heard that this show was character driven rather than plot driven, and I hoped that I would see great character development and growth. However, the characters are not only cliche and typical, but they are complete rip-offs of Madoka Magica characters, right down to the color scheme. Fu is obviously a rip-off of Mami, Togo is exactly like Homura, and Yuna is a carbon copy of Madoka. Even Karin took some inspiration from Kyouko. The only character that didn't feel like a PMMM clone was Itsuki, but she isn't anything special herself. The only saving grace are the decent interactions between the characters during the last few episodes, but they don't do the show much, because they are quite cheesy.ENJOYMENT- 5/10. There is a beach and hot springs episode, and there is enough fanservice for those who are into that. Like I said earlier, half of the anime is filler so if you like that then you may like this anime.OVERALL: 4/10. Sorry, but everything about this anime is average, even for a magical girl anime. Nothing really stands out, it's all been done before, and the entire time I watched this, I was plagued by the fact that it clearly rips off PMMM. that stuck out.

But it\'s the end of hero month and let\'s hope we can end it like we began it, on a high note. Because, so far, the only good series we\'ve looked at this month has been Boku no Hero Academia.Story:We open with our titular heroine, Yuuki Yuuna working with members of her middle school\'s Hero Club to put on a puppet show. Basically, these four girls get...together to help out in other clubs, finding homes for kittens and other public services. Things change when, one day, everything freezes during class and the four find themselves in an altered landscape. It turns out the hero club has a hidden purpose, to defend the barrier created by the Shinju that preserves their world. They become magical girls, fighting whenever they\'re called but they quickly learn that there\'s a secret behind their powers and it may be too much for them.My biggest issue with the series, narratively, is that the final climactic turn may be a bit too easy. Basically, the big ""antagonist"" is too easily dissuaded from what she\'s doing. It kind of makes sense in context but it might work a bit better if it took a little more effort. The ending may also be a bit too predictable once things get going. Though I\'d be lying if I said I disliked it.That being said, there are a lot of good things about the series. The events leading up to the big climactic clash are very well handled. There are some strong emotional scenes. Two of which definitely may have elicited some tears from me. The series does a good job of subverting some aspects of magical girl shows while embracing others, including the optimistic outlook. Holding on to hope is a big theme in this series and it works really well. Honestly, I appreciate that it can incorporate some elements that are dark for a magical girl series while still keeping things generally optimistic. There are too many works out there that treat dark content as something you have to go all the way with or just can\'t have at all. It\'s nice seeing something with a more nuanced take on it. I also appreciate the way the world building is handled. We don\'t get a bunch of boring exposition, instead they show us throughout the series what the world they\'re living in is like and what the more unusual elements like Shinju, Taisha and Vertexes actually are. Foreshadowing is pretty well handled as well.Characters:The cast is mainly composed of five characters. Yuuna, Tougou, Karin, Fuu & Itsuki. On the surface, they\'re a pretty archetypal magical girl group. However, every single character goes beyond the typical tropes that they start with. Whether it\'s accomplished through their reactions to tragedy, their interactions with one another or their way of pursuing their own dreams. Which makes the cast quite compelling. The character interactions are quite strong as well.I also do like the way shifting loyalties are handled. There is solid reasoning behind them that makes sense while also revealing information about the characters in question. The only real issue I have is that the vertexes are kind of nothing villains. We know what they\'re trying to do and we know the basic reason why but that\'s about all they have. To be fair to the series, they do provide an in universe explanation for why that is.Art:There are a lot of positive aspects to the art. The vertexes have interesting designs. The heroines are well designed and their magical girl forms are nicely detailed. The supernatural world where they do their fighting looks pretty interesting. The fights themselves are quite well done. They involve actual weapons too. Fuu has a buster sword. Karin uses a pair of katana. Tougou has guns. Which leads to some interesting action sequences.Sound:They got some strong actresses for this series. Terui Haruka, Mimori Suzuko, Nagatsuma Juri, Kurosawa Tomoyo & Uchiyama Yumi are all really good in this. The emotions they convey just come across as so genuine and the way they converse with one another has a good level of verisimilitude to it. The music by Okabe Keiichi & Hoashi Keigo is really good as well.Ho-yay:There\'s a general undercurrent among most of the girls. The sisters being the obvious exception. It\'s clear that they care about each other but it\'s equally clear that it\'s familial. The most prominent les-yay is between Yuuna and Tougou. They come across as being deep into their first feelings of romantic love. Once Yuuna figures it out they\'ll probably start dating.Areas of Improvement:I\'ll try to go into these without giving too much away.I\'d make that final conversation that leads up to the climactic turn a little more substantial.Extrapolate on the effects change at the end a bit more.Have some anger directed at Fuu. Basically, Fuu knows that they could be called on to act as heroes, but doesn\'t tell the others. That\'s not much of a spoiler since it\'s a part of the first episode. But what bothers me a little bit is that everyone else is immediately okay with it. I\'d like to see them take some time to get over the feelings of betrayal over that. I think it would make for some interesting character moments.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, Yuuki Yuuna was Yuusha\xa0has a lot of good elements. It has a lot to recommend its story and its characters. It has great art, great acting and solid music. It could also be improved with more time to flesh things out properly but, for what it is, it\'s a great series. In the end, I\'ll give it an 8/10. And I do recommend it for those of you who like magical girl series that do things a bit differently. together to help out in other clubs, finding homes for kittens and other public services.

VERY loose) of mahou shoujo wherein girls pay a steep price for their magical status. in this show, that exploration of genre is used as the center for larger themes of SACRIFICE and FATE, but...it feels borderline.... exploitative. manipulative, even. don\'t get me wrong, i like plot twists, i love tone shifts, but here, it feels as if the theme wasn\'t thought through, wasn\'t properly threaded throughout the story. where madoka kicks itself into gear pretty quickly, leaving a lot more room to develop and extrapolate, yuki yuna seems to wander for a bit before KNEEJERKING into nihilism and ""edgy territory"" around episode 8.this is where most of my problems come in, because. the first two episodes have a dark cloud looming over them, with some nice foreshadowing, but then i was really pleased to see it NOT go all the way overboard. instead it really slows down and stretches itself out. there aren\'t even vertex fights for a lot of the show\'s run, in fact a lot of it is bordering on slice of life. and, i REALLY like this cast. yuna is the glue that holds everything together and she\'s extremely likeable as the hyperoptimist, but togo and karin steal the show for me - karin as being (for a while) a fun take on a mami tomoe/kyouko sakura-type role (extremely athletic, health food nut) and togo as being really great disabled rep in a genre that more or less uses disability as a central character conflict and not just an attribute. but of COURSE when the show takes the nosedive it (not so subtley) wants to, it feels like character is hurled out the window. sure, yuna is still yuna, but everyone else just loses all their personality to become ""crying girl"". and not only this, but the show gets very bleak. EXTREMELY bleak. HEAVILY nihilistic. it\'s. very frustrating. sure, there\'s some more twists and things work themselves out by the last episode but it\'s hard to ignore or forget all the weird, almost unwarranted amounts of suffering this show pushes you through.and for this reason it\'s really hard to recommend it. the show wants you to go in blind but i can\'t envision someone coming out the other end excited about what they just watched. to sit through 5 episodes of a pretty upbeat slice of life anime and suddenly watch characters be horribly injured, depressed, suicidal, and worse, to have the tone just SUDDENLY CHANGE LIKE A LIGHTSWITCH, it just. hmmm. i don\'t know. this probably won\'t be a madoka for a new generation.that all being said, it isn\'t that bad. like i said, all the characters are likeable. the mythology of it all is interesting. the themes, even though they only rear their head in the LAST SECOND, they do a few pretty neat things with them. but, eeeeeeehhhhh. i think i\'m tired of MAHOU SHOUJO BUT F*CKED UP. and i do really feel bad for anyone looking for just a cute magical girl show having to sift through piles and piles of ""girls crying"" shows. i don\'t know.overall, all i gotta say is.... men ruined magical girl shows. thank you. no, you don\'t have to respond it feels borderline.... exploitative. manipulative, even. don\'t get me wrong, i like plot twists, i love tone shifts, but here, it feels as if the theme wasn\'t thought through, wasn\'t properly threaded throughout the story. where madoka kicks itself into gear pretty quickly, leaving a lot more room to develop and extrapolate, yuki yuna seems to wander for a bit before KNEEJERKING into nihilism and ""edgy territory"" around episode 8.this is where most of my problems come in, because. the first two episodes have a dark cloud looming over them, with some nice foreshadowing, but then i was really pleased to see it NOT go all the way overboard. instead it really slows down and stretches itself out. there aren\'t even vertex fights for a lot of the show\'s run, in fact a lot of it is bordering on slice of life. and, i REALLY like this cast. yuna is the glue that holds everything together and she\'s extremely likeable as the hyperoptimist, but togo and karin steal the show for me - karin as being (for a while) a fun take on a mami tomoe/kyouko sakura-type role (extremely athletic, health food nut) and togo as being really great disabled rep in a genre that more or less uses disability as a central character conflict and not just an attribute. but of COURSE when the show takes the nosedive it (not so subtley) wants to, it feels like character is hurled out the window. sure, yuna is still yuna, but everyone else just loses all their personality to become ""crying girl"". and not only this, but the show gets very bleak.

I heard it was like Madoka, which was why I gave it a shot, but it just left me feeling bored at the very end of it.The pacing, the worldbuilding, the narrative; those were all over the place. I can’t really go into details because of spoilers, but they just didn’t work at all. Have of the time it’s trying to be a magical girl show, then it’s trying to be a slice of life, then it’s trying to be some kind of grimdark apocalypse....Shows can do this right, but this one just made it all over the place.The story would jump around like a frog on caffeine. The vertex boss battles were so incoherently paced that I could barely even make sense of it all by the end. It tries to plant a red herring a few episodes in, but it feels so blatant that it makes me feel absolutely nothing.Also, warning: the show pictures multiple suicide attempts later on, and the lack of respect for them was so jarring that I nearly felt sick to my stomach. It’s thrown in there, and the mental health of the character is never brought back up again, and everybody just ignores it. This was a huge problem that I had with KimiUso, but in here it’s just so BAD.A majority of the characters were very bland and forgettable. Purple Girl (I won’t give out her name because Spoilers) was only there to give exposition, despite the fact that she had the potential to be very interesting. Yuna is one-dimensional as can be, while Fu is blander than Yuna’s sense of taste. Togo and Itsuki had moments of brilliance, but they spent a majority of the time doing pointless or idiotic things that barely mattered to the story.The thing that I loved about Madoka is that we could see the world around them work, well, without them. Junko, Hitomi, Kyousuke, Kazuko; each one lived in the world, same as our main characters. Here it just feels like the main characters’ world, and everybody else just so happens to be props for them.Keep in mind that I said the majority. I ADORED Karin. She was technically two-dimensional, but the way that I interpreted her behavior just made her be so fascinating. The only moment I cried in the show was about her, which seems pathetic but she was one of the few good things about the show. Too bad that this was the anime she had to appear in.The show consistently tries to push shippings onto you, without caring about how shippings actually work. That’s about all I can say about the topic.While the art was great (except for moments of random 3D), the music was pretty forgettable. It sounded nice, but that was pretty much it. I did like Dandelion, I guess.I watched the series dubbed, and OH BOY DID THESE VAS DESERVE BETTER. Erica Mendez sounds very bland in this, which is very strange because she’s usually one of the better voice actors. I saw Xanthe Huynh in Anohana, and while I loved her as Menma, I just couldn’t stand her Yuna.Brianna Knickerbocker was actually okay as Itsuki. Sure, the forced fake singing was atrocious, but she wasn’t all that bad. I saw Erika Harlacher in Violet Evergarden, and she sounds much better in this than she did in that, especially in her more emotional scenes.Christine Marie Cabanos did alright, which is actually pretty good because she had one of the blander characters to work with. And, I REALLY liked Sarah Williams as Karin. Sure, it isn’t better than Sayaka, but she did amazingly on her own. I really did think that she fit the character.Overall, I don’t recommend it, especially if you’re looking for a fill-in for Madoka. I’m going to be watching the second season just to see how terrible it is, so we you next review!

I’m going to be watching the second season just to see how terrible it is, so we you next review!', 'Warning: spoilers aheadWhen I was first introduced to Yuuki Yuuna, I went in expecting darkness. I went in expecting tragedy. I went in expecting suffering little school girls. So I was therefore unsurprised when horrible things started happening to the characters. “Okay”, I thought, “I can enjoy this”. And I did, very much. However, there were flaws that I noticed and simply can’t ignore.Plot: 6.5/10As great as this anime is, there are things it definitely got wrong, and one of those was pacing. I don’t mind slice of life elements mixed in with my tragic story lines of suffering little girls. Gakkou Gurashi is...a perfect example of an anime that balances both slice of life elements and horror/tragedy elements without killing the pacing. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about this anime. There are times when the slice of life just shows up seemingly out of nowhere, such as episode 5 when they go to find a home for a cat. It just kills the pacing. The twists in this story are great, with things slowly being revealed over time rather than all at once. You don’t learn everything about the world and about the hero system until the very end of the anime, which is something I like a lot. And let’s just talk for a moment about the mankai. The idea that magical girls suffer and pay for their actions is nothing new. We’ve seen it before. But this anime takes it to a whole new level, with heroes gaining disabilities every time they go mankai, eventually losing all functions of their body and turning into logs. It’s an idea I haven’t seen before and it’s so great. The author is so cruel to his characters though. I can imagine him sitting in front of his computer planning out the story and saying “hmmm should they die or turn into vertexes when they use their powers. No, I have a better idea. Let’s give them disabilities instead lol.”Now you may be asking “if you loved the plot so much, why does it only get a 6.5/10?” The answer is the ending. Rarely do you come across an anime with an ending as lazy as Yuuki Yuuna’s. Basically, they all get better in the end. Now, this is not horrible in and of itself. I’ve had happy endings to tragic stories before that I loved. Higurashi is a fine example of a happy ending done right. However, this anime’s happy ending comes out of nowhere, makes no sense, and contradicts everything that has been said thus far. All the drama, all the urgency, all the pain and suffering these characters went through in order to save the world, all of it meant nothing at all. Suffering and sacrificing for the sake of the world is fantastic. It’s a great idea. Here are these heroes at the end of episode 4, helpless, having lost everything, but knowing it was for the sake of saving the world and the people in it. But then the writers were like lolnope. This is borderline Angel Beats levels of bad, with events taking place that had no impact on the plot whatsoever. There’s so many problems with this ending I don’t know where to begin. First of all, why did they get better? Like, why them? There were countless heroes before them, based on what I heard. Why did none of them get better? And don’t tell me it’s because none of them tried to rebel against the system before. If there really were a ton of heroes before them, wouldn’t at least one of them have the same idea Togo did? Second, why did only Yuuna not get better? She was in a magic coma for a while. That was another thing I had an issue with. What the hell is up with this coma. I mean, ignoring the question of why the hell she’s even allowed out of the hospital, since it’s against hospital regulations for her to be allowed out, why does she come back? She just all of a sudden comes back from the coma grave and says “Togo… I heard your voice…” Um, excuse me, what? That isn’t how a coma works. You cannot hear people. You cannot see. You cannot do literally anything. But apparently this is like some kind of magic coma where you can hear people and can come back to life because you heard your friend’s voice. I’m beginning to think they hired guest writer Jun Maeda to write this ending for them.Characters: 7/10I know I say this a lot in my reviews, but I really want to give this a higher score. I wish I could give the characters a 9/10, but I can’t for a few reasons. First of all, they don’t really develop that much. I mean, if you asked me to name everything I knew about Fuu, I’d tell you she was a leader and she loved her younger sister. But that’s true at the beginning of the series and that’s true at the end of the series. Yuuna also doesn’t change or develop. She’s the Genki Girl who fights for love and justice to protect her precious friends. Itsuki is pretty much a prop from start to finish with nothing interesting about her other than she likes to sing, used to develop Fuu. However, despite these flaws, the way the characters interacted was beautiful as well as their reactions to the others’ problems. Episode 9 illustrates this very well with Fuu’s reaction to her sister’s inability to sing for the music group she wanted to. She completely breaks down, drowning in grief and guilt at the knowledge that it’s her fault her sister had this happen to her. I mean ffs, the episode is literally titled“Those Who Know Grief”. Every interaction between the characters feels meaningful, even if the scenes they are in don’t. They establish relationships and reinforce bonds, especially with Karen. She is far and away the most developed character in the show. The person she started out as and the person she became between episodes 3 and 11 are almost as different as pre-mercy kill Homura and post-mercy kill Homura. She goes from being an introverted tsundere with no friends to being comfortable with these girls and seeing them as friends, people she’s willing to sacrifice parts of her body for. Seriously episode 11 was one of the most emotional episodes for me, since I love Karen.Art: 8/10The character designs were gorgeous and the surreal look of the dimension where they fight the vertexes looks great, although there may be people who argue with me on that. The mix between traditional animation and CG was noticeable but not distractingly so. It was pleasant to look at, and that’s really all I look for when it comes to art in an anime.Sound: 10/10The music in this show is amazing, reminding me a lot of Madoka music. The exciting parts are made even more hype by the bad ass choir in the background. The sad parts are made even sadder by the music. It’s one of those soundtracks that I can just put on and listen to all day. It’s music that I can hear and be like “Oh, that’s Yuuki Yuuna music”. Also worth a mention is the series’s opening song. Seriously, I could listen to that shit all day long. So relaxing. It reminds me a lot of the second opening to Higurashi.This anime had the potential to be great. It had fantastic ideas. It had a good opening, lulling us into that false sense of security. However, the characters are underdeveloped and the pacing is broken by the slice of life that’s put into the middle of it seemingly for no reason. Like, honestly, what did that cat scene accomplish? The real killer, however, was the ending. It was a lazy cop out that served no purpose than to give us a happy ending. There was a comment I read about it once that sums is up perfectly: “behold, the hardest, most cynical downer ending ever written, ruined by Deus Ex Machina.” You know with the underdeveloped characters and poor ending, you’d almost think this was written by the same writer as school days…Oh wait… a perfect example of an anime that balances both slice of life elements and horror/tragedy elements without killing the pacing. Unfortunately, this cannot be said about this anime. There are times when the slice of life just shows up seemingly out of nowhere, such as episode 5 when they go to find a home for a cat. It just kills the pacing. The twists in this story are great, with things slowly being revealed over time rather than all at once.

First of all, why did they get better? Like, why them? There were countless heroes before them, based on what I heard. Why did none of them get better? And don’t tell me it’s because none of them tried to rebel against the system before. If there really were a ton of heroes before them, wouldn’t at least one of them have the same idea Togo did? Second, why did only Yuuna not get better? She was in a magic coma for a while. That was another thing I had an issue with. What the hell is up with this coma. I mean, ignoring the question of why the hell she’s even allowed out of the hospital, since it’s against hospital regulations for her to be allowed out, why does she come back? She just all of a sudden comes back from the coma grave and says “Togo… I heard your voice…” Um, excuse me, what? That isn’t how a coma works. You cannot hear people. You cannot see. You cannot do literally anything. But apparently this is like some kind of magic coma where you can hear people and can come back to life because you heard your friend’s voice. I’m beginning to think they hired guest writer Jun Maeda to write this ending for them.Characters: 7/10I know I say this a lot in my reviews, but I really want to give this a higher score. I wish I could give the characters a 9/10, but I can’t for a few reasons. First of all, they don’t really develop that much. I mean, if you asked me to name everything I knew about Fuu, I’d tell you she was a leader and she loved her younger sister. But that’s true at the beginning of the series and that’s true at the end of the series. Yuuna also doesn’t change or develop. She’s the Genki Girl who fights for love and justice to protect her precious friends. Itsuki is pretty much a prop from start to finish with nothing interesting about her other than she likes to sing, used to develop Fuu. However, despite these flaws, the way the characters interacted was beautiful as well as their reactions to the others’ problems. Episode 9 illustrates this very well with Fuu’s reaction to her sister’s inability to sing for the music group she wanted to. She completely breaks down, drowning in grief and guilt at the knowledge that it’s her fault her sister had this happen to her. I mean ffs, the episode is literally titled“Those Who Know Grief”. Every interaction between the characters feels meaningful, even if the scenes they are in don’t. They establish relationships and reinforce bonds, especially with Karen. She is far and away the most developed character in the show. The person she started out as and the person she became between episodes 3 and 11 are almost as different as pre-mercy kill Homura and post-mercy kill Homura. She goes from being an introverted tsundere with no friends to being comfortable with these girls and seeing them as friends, people she’s willing to sacrifice parts of her body for. Seriously episode 11 was one of the most emotional episodes for me, since I love Karen.Art: 8/10The character designs were gorgeous and the surreal look of the dimension where they fight the vertexes looks great, although there may be people who argue with me on that. The mix between traditional animation and CG was noticeable but not distractingly so. It was pleasant to look at, and that’s really all I look for when it comes to art in an anime.Sound: 10/10The music in this show is amazing, reminding me a lot of Madoka music. The exciting parts are made even more hype by the bad ass choir in the background. The sad parts are made even sadder by the music. It’s one of those soundtracks that I can just put on and listen to all day. It’s music that I can hear and be like “Oh, that’s Yuuki Yuuna music”. Also worth a mention is the series’s opening song. Seriously, I could listen to that shit all day long. So relaxing. It reminds me a lot of the second opening to Higurashi.This anime had the potential to be great. It had fantastic ideas. It had a good opening, lulling us into that false sense of security. However, the characters are underdeveloped and the pacing is broken by the slice of life that’s put into the middle of it seemingly for no reason. Like, honestly, what did that cat scene accomplish? The real killer, however, was the ending. It was a lazy cop out that served no purpose than to give us a happy ending. There was a comment I read about it once that sums is up perfectly: “behold, the hardest, most cynical downer ending ever written, ruined by Deus Ex Machina.” You know with the underdeveloped characters and poor ending, you’d almost think this was written by the same writer as school days…Oh wait…', 'I wonder if Yuki Yuna is a hero, the title of this anime is so ambiguous.Story:One thing that I keep hearing over and over again is that Yuki Yuna is a Madoka Magica rip-off. I think that is not true. There is no denying that this show is inspired by Madoka, but despite some similarities (which have more to do with both anime being magical girl shows than anything), Yuki Yuna goes its own way. The heroines get deceived and becoming a magical gi…I mean hero has a big downside. But that is about it. The character dynamics are different, there is no personified antagonist...and most of all, the development and pacing is completely different. But let’s stop comparing it and take a look at what Yuki Yuna actually does. In its core, it is a slice of life-driven magical girl story, not unlike others that came before. Halfway through however, it evolves into a more serious story. I found the development of the story to be interesting and well made, but the writing is all over the place. You don’t need to explain everything in a story, but some things were left unexplained that needed to be addressed. Like, who the hell is that Shinju-sama? Why is the world like it is right now? And what the fuck was up with that ending?(SPOILERS FOLLOW, SKIP THE REST OF THIS SECTION TO AVOID THEM)I don’t mind a happy ending. In fact, I really wanted the girls to somehow recover and be normal again. However, you can’t just give them back everything for no reason whatsoever. So, the Shinju just realized that the hero system is shit and changed it, because…why? What did these girls do that others before them didn’t? And if it’s that easy to just change the system, then why the fuck didn’t they do so from the very start? What was the fucking point? Just to give us a happy ending? Happy my ass, that’s bullshit. I absolutely HATE when anime do that. I hated it when Future Diary pulled something out of its ass, I hated when Izetta decided to have the main character survive something unsurviveable and I am extremely pissed at what Yuki Yuna did. You see, if the anime was shit, I wouldn’t give a flying fuck, but Yuki Yuna is a GOOD anime. Why did you have to take a huge shit on it with such a dumb ending?7/10 (withouth ending)3/10 (with ending)Art:There isn’t much to say about the art (I’m gonna do it anyway). Yuki Yuna looks very good for a slice of life anime. During their fights in the…whatever that kinda dimension is supposed to be, this anime looks amazing. So many shapes and colors and they are all done well. The action sequences are really, really, REALLY good. The character design isn’t that outstanding, but Fu looked pretty cool with her eyepatch.9/10Sound:If you desperately want to find something to put your finger on and call Yuki Yuna a Madoka clone, it would be the soundtrack. And why not? Madoka had one of the best soundtracks of all time and this show does a very good job at using music in a similar way. Opening and ending were well done, though not really all that memorable. Itsukis song (used as ending for episode 9) hit right in the feels. The voice acting was great, all the emotions were believable all throughout the cast.9/10Characters:Yuki Yuna is NOT a Madoka clone. She is very upbeat, determined, never loses hope and is clumsy in everyday life. Basically, she is a stereotypical main character. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it leaves me with very few possibilities to comment on her. Togo is the more level-headed, more mature and more scrutinizing character (no, she is NOT a Homura clone). She’s actually a very interesting person (compared to the rest of the cast), especially in the latter half of the show. Fu is a terrible, but exerted leader, who completely fails being a leader (redundancy ftw). I liked that, a teenage girl is rarely a born leader and commitment is no replacement for expertise. Itsuki was cute, but not much more. She was basically just there to make us sad. Karin is a tsundere that opens up to the others over the course of the series. It’s no secret that I am anything but a fan of tsunderes, but I can accept them if they are either a) well written or b) played for laughs. Karin falls into the second category, so I am fine with her. As you can see, the cast isn’t that exiting, but I kinda liked the girls, which made the story work better.7/10Enjoyment:Yuki Yuna is a good anime, that takes ideas from other magical girl animes and does something else with it. It doesn’t play the genre entirely straight, but it also refrains from copying what other anime have already done. For some, this may appear as a half-hearted attempt to cash in on the “new era” of magical girls, but to me, it was a unique little show that didn’t do everything right, but a lot. Only the terribly written ending spoils my enjoyment greatly, what a shame.7/10Overall:7.0/10 and most of all, the development and pacing is completely different.

Mimori attempts suicide 10 times. This is thrown out as some kind of fact, but actually nobody questions why she would try and kill herself. What\'s her personal motivation? If she was doing it solely as an experiment, does she value her life so little? Why do none of the other heroes who she informs of this seemingly not care, at all? Her suicide attempt is NEVER MENTIONED as an ""Oh no, Mimori, why would you do that? Please don\'t do that, we care about you."" WHY?...This is a massive plot hole.2. Mimori breaks the barrier. This in itself is fine, but the fact she does a complete 180 and nobody gives her a hard time for it? She essentially betrayed the entire world to save her friends, yet she so easily flicks back to wanting to protect it again?

Additionally, the Taichi and the Shinju-Sama are never really explained.

The creators of Yuuki Yuuna felt the need to let us know. Let me get one thing straight: This isn\'t really a bad show. If SOL and cute girls but weak plot is your thing, you might actually enjoy Yuuki Yuuna. Hell if you think shows like Non Non Biyori deserve a golden statue in the anime hall of fame, and you like magical girls, you might even absolutely love this show. If that kind of anime isn\'t your thing, then this review is here to warn you that you probably wont...have fun here.Yuuki Yuuna does actually have a story and some decent character interactions, the problem is a lot of it just honestly isn\'t very good. Just not quite enough to escape the ""plotless moe"" label. A lot of the lines are your typical ""I will protect the ones important to me!"" MAMORUUUUUUUU!!! The sort of contrived deal that has become more and more stale over the years. Some of the conversations the girls have with each other are also amazingly boring. The writing just doesn\'t give you enough to care. The suffering feels thrown in to be there for the sake of making the show appear to have more depth than it actually has.A big problem that makes Yuuki Yuuna so meh-tier is for most of the story the bad guys appear as nothing more than evil monsters with zero personality out to destroy the world for the sake of being evil monsters. This part of the plot is eventually redeemed and the shows story does eventually become better. But by eventually I mean the very last couple of episodes.

I\'m somewhat glad that I didn\'t, but the problem still lies there. A good anime should get its story rolling by the third episode, not the last minute.So this then brings up the question: Does a decent end justify the other 80% of a show being a mediocre ripoff ? Not enough to justify giving it higher than an average rating.

It's surprisingly quite good, better than BGHS by a mile in terms of character development and animation. However, I gotta say, this is one of the most messed up animes I've seen so far, due to the lore. The story is good, but the lore.... seriously messed up. Like, you become a hero only to lose your body afterwards? No way am I becoming a hero.Story: The story follows 5 girls, Yuuna, Togo, Itsuki, Karin and Fuu as heroes to...protect the earth from Vertexes, mysterious creatures from the real world(cos the world they're living in is fake :v. Messed up right?) I find the story concept similar to BGHS and to an extent TnM, a bunch of schoolgirls battling evil creatures and eventually winning. But, Yuuki Yuuna just takes the after-battle to a whole new level because after the main characters fight in their Mankai form, they function of a body part, which is messed up like, why would you fight to protect the earth and kill creatures if you know that you're gonna be incapacitated for life? And the feels bois. I cried at episode 9 poor Itsuki losing her beautiful voice. Yuuna losing her sense of taste, Togo losing her sense of hearing in her left ear, Fuu losing her sense of sight in her left eye and Karin losing.... pretty much everything when she went mankai 4 times. RIP. But luckily, the anime has a happy ending, but not before another feels ride in episode 12 with Yuuna in a coma. Apart from the messed up lore, the story is actually well executed and interesting.Rating: 8.4/10Animation: Love the animation of the Vertexes, the battle scenes and character design. And the explosions.Rating: 8.2/10Sound/Music: Pretty nice opening ending i just skip cos there's no point hearing the ending when you're marathoning an anime. And the sad ost, leaves an impact and makes you cry.Rating: 7.9/10Characters: I've got nothing much to say about the characters, because this anime is mainly about the story that's the main focus. My fav character is Itsuki cos she's cute and has a beautiful voice. And, I can't help but lay the connections between some of the characters in this anime and Toji no Miko. Yuuna=Kanami cos happy-go-lucky. Togo=Mai cos she cares for Yuuna just like how Mai cares for Kanami. Fuu= crossover between Mai and Ellen? Cos she cares for her sister Itsuki and is quite serious when it comes to battle. Karin=Maki cos she's the no nonsense type but is tsundere(to an extent). Itsuki=Sayaka cos she's under the care of Fuu like how Mai cares for Sayaka. And that's it for characters.Rating: 8.0/10Overall a pretty good anime quite surprised I actually enjoyed watching this. Cos I don't really watch this type of genre. The feels really gives the final rating a boost but then again, the messed up lore cancels that out. Would I recommend this anime? Yes absolutely it's enjoyable and feels reeeeeeeeeeeee. Now that this anime is done, time to watch the sequel and prequel of this.Final rating: 8.1/10 protect the earth from Vertexes, mysterious creatures from the real world(cos the world they're living in is fake :v.

Itsuki=Sayaka cos she's under the care of Fuu like how Mai cares for Sayaka. And that's it for characters.Rating: 8.0/10Overall a pretty good anime quite surprised I actually enjoyed watching this. Cos I don't really watch this type of genre. The feels really gives the final rating a boost but then again, the messed up lore cancels that out. Would I recommend this anime? Yes absolutely it's enjoyable and feels reeeeeeeeeeeee. Now that this anime is done, time to watch the sequel and prequel of this.Final rating: 8.1/10"", 'This is my first review, just saying.After Madoka Magica, I tried watching more magical girl anime, similar or not, like SM crystal, Fate/Kaleid, and Magical girl raising project. Then, I heard about this one, so I gave it a try.At first, I wasn\'t impressed, but then I started to like it.The story is good IMO. The ""dark"" element of being a magical girl (in this case, a Hero) is different from its (obvious) inspiration, Madoka Magica. The slice of life part wasn\'t bad, although it\'s like, 49% of the show. The pacing is not so great tho IMO. Their fight with the Vertexes felt...too short, and it focused a little but too much on slice of life, sometimes I just forgot it\'s a magical girl anime. The humor is not funny, but it\'s not really that much of a problem.The art is great, but nothing original. The animation is fine, although I didn\'t like the CGI for the Heroes in the first few episodes. Glad they got rid of it .The Vertexes being in CGI is not a problem for me tho.Also, why on Earth would you include fan service in a dark magical girl show with 14 years old girls ?! I liked all the transformation scenes, with the exception of Togo\'s, because during hers, the camera focused on her enormous chest, which was then grabbed by tentac- I mean ribbons I guess. We get it, Togo has a big chest. Why ?If it had nothing dark and focused mainly on comedy, I wouldn\'t mind it, but it is the worst idea they had when making this show.The fight scenes were boring. There was nothing exciting. And that\'s not because it\'s a magical girl show that the battles are not interesting. You have Madoka (Homura vs Mami ? Purely amazing), Magical girl rasing project, and Lyrical Nanoha who have great fighting scenes.The sound is good, but it\'s not something really memorable IMO.Now onto the characters, the bad part of the show. They are all uninspired and don\'t act like a human being at all, aside from Fu (I won\'t spoil anything but you\'re gonna know what I\'m talking about).Yuuna is unrealistically always positive, her childish side is just annoying, and at times she is outright dumb.Togo is literally the Homura of the show. Her motives, her personality, her main color (I\'m aware that it\'s blue, but at some point it was violet), her haircut, guns, the fact that she discovers the truth and is one the MC\'s best friend, an episode focused on her and her backstory. And to add onto that, she is the closest character to being a Mary-sue (rich, pretty, smart)Itsuki is just that one sweet and innocent girl stereotype, although I don\'t really mind her.Fu is a nice girl tho. While the fact that she keeps talking about girl power is annoying, she is quite likable. Not to mention, [SPOILER ALERT] she is the only one who had a reason to go Mankai. [END OF SPOILER]And of course, there HAD to be a tsundere. Twintails, red colored girl, and her attitude overall. Aside from that, I enjoyed the moments where Karin did not act like one.Even with all the bad stuff, I enjoyed the show. This is not as good as most of the people say it is(better than PMMM ? It\'s your opinion, but YuYuYu is not even near as good as this), and not as horrible as some of the guys here say. too short, and it focused a little but too much on slice of life, sometimes I just forgot it\'s a magical girl anime.

It\'s your opinion, but YuYuYu is not even near as good as this), and not as horrible as some of the guys here say.', 'So first thing; if you like the look of this show and you’ve somehow managed to get this far without seeing any other information or reviews, stop reading this right now and go watch the first couple of episodes. If you like what you see, watch the rest.…honestly that’s my recommendation for pretty much any show (…why do I write these again?), but in the case of Yuuki Yuuna, I’d say it’s all but mandatory to fully enjoy the experience. It’s not so much that there are huge, earth-shattering twists or specific spoilers you’d want to watch out for; it’s more that the best thing...about the show in general is the way it builds atmosphere and tension episode-to-episode, engages in really well-executed shifts in tone and keeps you guessing right up to the end. I strongly suspect that having more of an idea of how things were going to turn out from the start would have poked some nasty holes in that for me.The second reason not to read this review, is that it’s virtually impossible to talk about Yuuki Yuuna without talking about the ending. Now I’m not going to get into specifics and I’ll go as spoiler-lite as possible, but for the reasons I’ve already gone into regarding atmosphere and tension building, I really don’t recommend knowing anything about the ending before you’ve actually seen it.…sure you don’t want to go watch the show first?Okay.So first of all, I enjoyed Yuki Yuuna a lot. As I mentioned in my disclaimer above, I think the way the series builds, maintains and manages tension throughout all twelve episodes is seriously impressive. It also juggles tone brilliantly; anime in general does a lot of genre hopping and personally I find that this can result in a kind of tonal whiplash that really pulls me out of the experience. YY is able to shift really smoothly from feather light Slice of Life comedy to surprisingly dark drama in a way that doesn’t grind any narrative gears.I think one of the highlights of the show for me in that respect was episode 7 ‘Idyllic Happiness’. On the surface, it’s a really stereotypical ‘beach episode’ with all the cliches that entails, but the whole thing is undercut with a subtle but ominous sense of melancholy and impending doom. Even though it’s uneventful as far as flashy life-or-death battles are concerned, I was on the edge of my seat for the whole thing waiting for the other shoe to drop.I’m also a real sucker for ‘in medias res’ starts and subtle world-building (à la Dark Souls, to use a non-anime example), and I loved the way that was done here. We start off with what looks like modern day Japan, but through all twelve episodes we’re provided with bits and pieces of background information that doesn’t seem to add up. I imagine some people found the use of strange and unexplained, alien terminology by the characters frustrating, but I really enjoyed the gradually unfolding mystery of the setting. It culminates in a reveal of the true nature of that ‘Earth’ in the last couple of episodes that I found really quite shocking.So what wasn’t so good? Well, visually it’s extremely derivative. Throughout the first few episodes, I was experiencing some serious deja vu; there’s a LOT of Puella Magi Madoka Magica in YY’s DNA, and about halfway through episode 2 I was seriously wondering if the whole thing was just going to be a bland pastiche. The transformations, the costumes, the unearthly beings the cast battle and the surreal alternate landscape that the battles take place on all feel a lot like a less abstract version of the equivalent scenes in Madoka.Now I don’t actually think there’s anything wrong with being derivative in principle, and I don’t expect every bit of new media to be stunningly original, but Madoka WAS stunningly original and just…well, stunning, and as such is not a show you want to invite visual comparisons to.Interestingly I had thought the plot was going to go the same way, but while there are certain parallels to be made, I think you could probably make a more direct comparison between Yuki Yuuna and Neon Genesis Evangelion than you could with Madoka, in spite of the superficial similarities.Now, the ending. If you’ve been involved in any previous discussion of the show, you’ll know that the ending is very much the elephant in the room, and is a bit of a make-or-break, love-or-hate moment for a lot of people. I’m kind of in the middle, in that I really don’t think the ending works, but it didn’t kill the show in general for me. It’s certainly the reason this is sitting at a 7 instead of a 9 though.Again, I’m aiming to avoid specific spoilers wherever possible so I’ll avoid specifics, but in general terms, YY has a happy ending and I don’t like it. Or more accurately, I don’t like the way that the happy ending is arrived at.The show closes with a very literal Deus Ex Machina. Around episode 5, the ultimate, ‘limit break’ style powers wielded by the central cast are established as having an immediate and permanent physical consequence for each use. Consequence and sacrifice, both in the personal and religious sense are both major themes of the show, but these both seem to get thrown out the window in the last ten minutes of episode 12, and you’re just left with a vague idea that the power of friendship/willpower has prevailed. Those seemingly permanent consequences for the main cast are removed in a way that violates the established rules of the fictional universe without adequate explanation as to how and why. Why were the sacrifices required in the first place if they could be so easily disregarded in the end? What, when you get right down to it, was the point of it all?If you search for ‘Yuki Yuuna ending theory’ on google you’ll find a number of reddit and blog posts that contain some quite interesting speculation that the ending might not be quite what it seems. Honestly, I think the possibility that those theories might be right actually annoys me more than the ending just being the cop-out it appears to be at face value, because if it’s true then there was absolutely no reason to be that damned cryptic about it. I’m not against open endings with a bit of mystery about them in general. Without going into any spoilers whatsoever, Code Geass has an ending that fans have been debating since the show ended - the key difference there is that the question raised at the very end of Code Geass doesn’t actually have any impact in how the ending played out. The answer to that question doesn’t make Code Geass a better or worse show or really change the meaning of the ending in any way whatsoever.For YY however, the possibility of the fan theory ending really turns the whole thing on its head, and would radically change the way that the themes and events of the preceding 12 episodes are framed. …but there’s just not enough information provided by the script itself to say one way or the other. I see extremely convincing fan theories backed up by all sorts of evidence torpedoed by the original author or later sequels all the time, so for now I’m forced to take the ending of Yuki Yuuna at face value; a kind of disappointing and tepid finale to an otherwise very enjoyable show(As a quick aside; although the Mahou Shoujo elements of YY are now all over pretty much every piece of promotional material and preview that might draw you into watching this, it looks very much like this originally aired as a complete bait and switch, presenting itself as a run-of-the-mill ‘Cute Girls Doing Cute Things’ after-school club based slice of life. I’m not sure if this was intentional on the part of the creators or if it was just a matter of the preview stuff being poorly translated for the english-speaking audience, but either way I think that’s fantastic, and I wish I saw this first time around to experience that.) about the show in general is the way it builds atmosphere and tension episode-to-episode, engages in really well-executed shifts in tone and keeps you guessing right up to the end.

Succeeding seems to be at best a 50/50 chance. There\'s so much they tried to do that they didn\'t manage to pull off.The single biggest problem with Yuuki Yuuna is the incredibly slow start of the series. The creators are trying to get the viewer to bond with and in general empathize with the main characters. The problem is they don\'t manage to pull it off. The characters they need you...to feel for don\'t get enough screen time and development.

This review just has too many spoilers.This could be known as a ""Madoka Magica"" ripoff. It\'s all about the dark magical girl genre. Even if that is quite true, I think that Yuuki Yuuna surpasses Madoka Magica in many ways.Story: The story isn\'t much to brag about. A bunch of girls need to protect the world from the ""Vectors"" and they fight them. Blah Blah. After the first couple of episodes, it starts to get pretty good. The foreshadowing was very subtle, unlike Madoka. I like to think that if foreshadowing is subtle then that makes the plot twist more dramatic.Art/Animation: Not as...good as Madoka. But you should be able to get used to it. It\'s pretty fluid and very colorful. The 3D animation is very noticeable but isn\'t as bad as others.Sound: The soundtrack seemed Madoka-Esque. With Latin or some other language in it. The Opening was catchy with some subtle changes in it and the ending was forgetful. I enjoyed the Voice Acting. The screams were very realistic. The girl\'s screams weren\'t perfect and beautiful. The screams were cracked, high pitched and realistic.Character: The character\'s had their very own reactions to the crisis they were in. Some of them broke down, some couldn\'t believe it and some tried to make it positive. They all had their episodes and they had their defining personalities. The character design was pretty weak though. Just looked like some fancy Madoka characters.Enjoyment: To me, this series was a lot more tragic and darker than Madoka. That the girls couldn\'t die with their unmoving bodies. That they would forget all their memories. I felt that the friendship theme in Yuuki Yuuna was a lot more stronger than the other mahou shoujo shows. How the girls dealt with their broken friendship and how they tried to mend and fix it.Overall: I would certainly pick this over Madoka. How subtle it was and how the girl\'s friendships were portrayed. It has a pretty slow and boring start but it\'s all worth it in the end. One of the many madoka alternatives. good as Madoka.

It has a nice slow build that leads into a fantastic climax.It's power packed with great messages about strength, willpower, standing strong and believing in yourself. The power of each girl resonates in a big way. I'm not sure I'd recommend this to a younger crowd, but everything 13+ would probably do well with it. The girls are individually relatable and would resonate with the demographic.Then there's the emotions. RE: Episode 9.Your heart breaks with each emotional truma that they incur. Did I mention Episode 9?Take the time to watch this. You'll be ever so glad you did. "", 'Yuuki Yuuna Is a Hero combines the “tragical girls” approach that became popular in Madoka’s wake with traditional slice-of-life elements, resulting in a mix that feels too mismatched to be great but shines at times and is entertaining enough to watch again.The title “Yuuki Yuuna Is a Hero” is at once appropriate, since this is most of what constitutes Yuuna’s personality, and misleading, since it suggests that Yuuna is the driving force of the show.  I can see the intent to make her the chief protagonist among these five Heroes, but in practice, she does not possess the means to carry the narrative....I don’t dislike Yuuna by any means – she’s chipper and sweet and unflaggingly positive in that special anime way – but she never seems to change.  You can predict how she will act in every scene and react to every event.  All of the substantive developments come from Togo, Fuu, Nogi, or some inanimate factor, leaving Yuuna herself as a bystander or companion whose primary point of interest is her friendship with Togo.The true protagonist of this show is Fuu.  Fuu brings with her credible motivations, emotional turmoil, and a more interesting character altogether, from her design to her portrayal to her role in the story.  I do love the title Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru because of the assonance and the fact that it can be abbreviated as YuYuYu, but this show really should have been called Fuu Inubouzaki Is a Hero.  Fuu displays identifiable flaws and has a compelling arc behind her, making her perfect subject material.  Togo is an easy runner-up for the same reasons, and even Itsuki would have made for a more believable and relatable lead.  Fuu and Togo are functionally the main characters; the only reason this is even worth debating is that the name of the series insists on showcasing Yuuki Yuuna for reasons that aren’t clear.  It would be like if the main character of Harry Potter were Ron Weasley.The twist is suitably dark, even leading to some genuinely distressing scenes later on, and the unexpectedly mythic spin lingers powerfully after the conclusion; YuYuYu could capitalize on these elements, having the thematic and visual framework to become a much more stylized show, but it chooses not to pursue this path to its jarring end.  YuYuYu is a much calmer, brighter show than that; despite its sinister undercurrent, this is still half slice-of-life, and the upbeat, comical, and easygoing personalities and plot points often serve to pull the show away from its morbid fascinations.The show’s bright face serves it well sometimes and other times undercuts the larger narrative.  Some amount of normality is necessary in order to give weight to the tragedy, but the darker side of the show could function much more effectively without this level of contrast.  Coupled with the ham-fisted delivery of certain scenes, the show can feel a bit shallow.  In a lot of areas, YuYuYu doesn’t commit itself fully, whether it’s fostering emotional depth or crafting a unique aesthetic.  The visuals and soundtrack both have strong creative elements, but interspersed with long stretches of blandness that prevent the show from reaching a personal, recognizable look and feel.  What makes YuYuYu disappointing is that it could go the extra mile to be dedicated wholly to one strange aesthetic and could be a deeper, more challenging story, but it shies away from this.  If YuYuYu were entirely a shallow show watchable only at face value, I’d still probably enjoy it and maybe even score it about the same, but there are hints that it could be more.The show’s ending is a gentle contrivance, forgivable because it basically suits the tone of the show and by that time asking for anything more would be an unnecessary risk.  As the delicate, airy OP indicates, YuYuYu has an innocent charm that often powers through the show’s failings.  It’s nothing groundbreaking, nothing especially exciting, but I felt justified in watching it a second time and enjoyed it to a similar degree as the first time around, so I would consider it worth the expenditure.

I never thought I would enjoy it, as it seemed very childish, however, I became one of my favorite Animes for good reason. I adore development and progression, and I didn't expect Yuki Yuna to have it due to the small episode amount, but I was wrong and you do see the characters progress and grow, as well as their friendships changings. I know it is a follow on of Washio Sumi Is A Hero, but you don't need to have read it to enjoy the show. I personally haven't read it yet, and I LOVED the show....It has good soundtracks and singing, and the characters are diverse and relatable. This is why I'd recommend Yuki Yuna to anyone looking for a fun anime, with a darker undertone, without being too deep.

Once this unrecognized—weird—creatures enter the world, then the world will be annihilated in an instant, in order to protect the world, Shinju-sama chose these girls from Hero Club as the next successors to look after the world with the magical power they obtain from being ""Hero""....Honestly this series got me interested after watching the 1st ep for the first 20 mins. Within this time, I declared that this one will be on the top of my download list. The first impression the series gave was so thrilling, when the enemy appeared to attack their world, then the transformation, and fight, and everyday school life—all of it. The art changes when they enter another dimension to fight the Vertex—name of those enemies. As the pic above, the colour and graphic is nice, it is really illustrate smooth aura of elementary students. My favorite parts, yeah, the battle scenes, another world illustration, they are so breathtaking. And I don\'t think the series is similar like Puella Madoka Magica (and I don\'t really want to compare these two).The characters improvement is revolving step-by-step, along with the troubles they need to bear. I can say the series unify the sorrow, the happiness, struggles, emotions into a well-made story. Despite of emotional plot—sad problems—don\'t worry you will always find yourself cheered up by the comical and generous of heroines act.For the music aspect, OP theme ""Hoshi to Hana (ホシトハナ)"" by Sanshuu Chuugaku Yuusha-bu is heart-warming and I love it in a blink of an eye. The ED theme is ""Aurora Days"" also by Sanshuu Chuugaku Yuusha-bu is so mellow, well, to say it clearly, I\'m not into this one. For special occasion~ep 4 & 9~the ED theme is Inori no Uta (祈りの歌), well-composed I like this one! In addition, I like the instrument for few scenes of the series, such as when it\'s a sad scene, battle scene, and trouble rises.Overall, I give the series rate for 8.Pros:The art, colours, graphics. So eye-catching!The plot and its progressThe characters and moe-ness!Cons:The theme songs might be more than the series could offerSomehow I think \'the Shinju-sama\' concept is.... eeerr..*) Shinju-sama refers to (something) like a god.

Growing bigger than many may have potentially foreseen.Instead of preaching to you why I like this series or why I didn't, I'd like to say this: If you liked what you saw in S1, I would recommend this order or reading and watching, provided you have the motivation to look up the fan translations.Animé: YuYuYu S1.Animé: Washio Sumi wa yusha de aru (WaSuYu)Short story: Sonoko afterShort story: Second hero diaryLight Novel: Nogi Wakaba wa yuusha de Aru (NoWaYu) *Short story attached...to that LN: Shiratori Utano wa yusha de aru (ShiUYu)Animé: YuYuYu S2.Animé: YuYuYu S3.Light Novel: Kusunoki Mebuki is a hero (KuMeYo)There is so much more out there to consume that it's almost overwhelming, including a whole-ass PS Vita game.

This shift in tone is also reflected in its art direction as the largely standard opening scenes are completely opposed to the surreal flowery like battleground the girls find themselves in. This change in direction both in story and animation certainly make this an episode to remember. Beyond the sudden twist this season opener throws a lot at the viewer and characters and will have you asking numerous questions about what just happened and what to expect next....It is a strong started that can easily get you hooked.The following episodes take a more measured approach in pacing as we delve more into how the girls manage their new reality. Bit by bit we learn more about these vertexes and what is required from our magical girls to save the world. Naturally it is hard for the girls to accept these revelations and it not long before various girls have their own doubts and misgivings about the new powers thrust upon them.These issues and the way they resolved is effectively done and we get significant growth not just in the individual characters themselves but the chemistry between the girls. In these episodes it becomes clear that the relationships between Yuuna Yuuki/Mimori Tougou and the Inubouzaki sisters are particularly strong. For people who are fans of drama or even yuri there is much to be had here about these two key relationships. More important though is that these relationships will have greater relevance later in the anime’s plotline.Nestled in these plot and character developments is a lot of light hearted slice-of-life content. In that regard we get a lot of classic scenes that we often associate with slice-of-life anime. If you are not into that then the early episodes may seem draggy. This slice-of-life action coupled with the magical girl fights being resolved in a fairly quick fashion means that the first half of Yuuki Yuuna carries a light-hearted tone which could be easily described as a standard magical girl series.It is in the second half when Yuuki Yuuna shifts gears and the tone of the series becomes darker. A major revelation is made in regards to the true nature of the magical girl’s power. It is this new found power and the consequences it entails that causes a great deal suffering for our girls. How they cope with these problems form a key source of drama. This drama is elevated further by the strain it causes for the key relationships described earlier. This drama and sense of hopelessness only grow stronger in the subsequent episodes when more truths about the origins of the magical girl hero is laid bare to the audience.This drama naturally reaches a crescendo in the season finale where the girls are confronted with their final opponent and it is here where I felt the series stumbled somewhat. The biggest issue I saw was the ending was simply rushed. If more time was devoted to exposition and explanations the impact of these climatic scenes would have carried more weight. In addition to the rushed nature of the ending the other problem I saw was the direction of the ending itself. Now what constituents a good ending is always going to be subjective but the issue I had is while the ending is not an asspull (there is foreshadowing to the events that occurred) it did seem very convenient. Neverland convenient if you get my drift… Despite my misgivings though you may like it I just think the ending is a point that will prove decisive among anime fans.Animation/musicThe animation in Yuuki Yuuna remains solid throughout the show and this high standard is maintained with only minor declines in animation here and there. The fight scenes in the battleground are always enjoyable to watch and the transformations cute. Speaking of cute all the main cast are moe so if you are into that thing this will be another plus point. In terms of music, I felt indifferent to it and the accompanying opening animation. This was doubly so for the ending theme animation. The opening song is 1: ""Hoshi to Hana"" by Sanshuu Chuugaku. The series has seven (yes seven) ending songs. One is the opening whilst another four are various mixes of ""Aurora Days"". The final two endings are mixes of “Inori no Uta”.Summary:If you are a fan of magical girls/drama or slice-of-life then it is likely you will dig Yuuki Yuuna. For much of this shows running it is largely a light-hearted character driven show that deals with many everyday events. The ante does go up in the second half of the show where a major revelation is discovered that turns the girl’s life’s upside down. This turmoil naturally brings its drama and angst but what is most notable here is the strain it puts on the key relationships of Yuuna and Mimori plus the Inubouzaki relationship. This is perhaps the strongest part of the show and will be enjoyed by all. Drama lovers will particularly like this segment.The ending will prove to be a more decisive point so it is hard to judge how you will like it. This could go either way but on the plus side there is closure and there are no loose ends so you need not concern yourself over those kinds of problems. The issue mainly stems in the direction of the ending which to me was rather questionable. If you like magical girls series that is filled with good relationship drama you are likely to have positive feelings for Yuuki Yuuna that will likely stick regardless of how you perceive the ending. Moreover, with the prequels and subsequent seasons adding fuller explanations to what happened at this shows final moments you can always pursue those seasons if you are keen on getting more complete answers.Story 6.5 – Yuuki Yuuna starts with a bang with an opener that has it all. Things do slow down in the subsequent episodes as the focus largely shifts on the characters. The series does kick on from the midpoint as we are faced a major twist. It is here where Yuuki Yuuna reaches its high point in plot development and things do look promising but this high is stifled with an ending that I found somewhat unsatisfactory.[B]Characters 8 –[/B] Strongest part of the series. While there is not a great deal of depth to be had all the girls are likeable. They all have their quirks and weaknesses and although they are not the complicated characters you’ll ever see they all have a nuance behind them. The biggest plus point though is the relationship these girls form with each other. These relationships are not only good but they do an effective job in elevating the plot in the latter parts of the series.Animation 7.5 – Solid and consistent throughout. The battle scenes are original and often enjoyable to watch although at times can be a touch static. There are also some CGI scenes included in the fights but these are mixed well with the 2D animation so it never feels out of place. The musical score is weaker and were not memorable for me. The animation for the opening and ending was very average.Overall 7 – A recommendation for people who are fans of the magical girl genre. You are also likely to enjoy this if you enjoy drama, slice-of-life or a fan of yuri series. Yuuki Yuuna is often labelled as dark magical series and whilst there are some dark elements it is not as big as other shows of this genre. It is dark-lite. In that regard if you are sensitive to dark series then do not worry about that because the depressive moments never last long and this series always manages a way to remain upbeat. The biggest disclaimer in that regard is there is a scene were a girl attempts suicide so if you are really averse to watching such things then either skip the scene or drop Yuuki Yuuna. It is a strong started that can easily get you hooked.The following episodes take a more measured approach in pacing as we delve more into how the girls manage their new reality. Bit by bit we learn more about these vertexes and what is required from our magical girls to save the world. Naturally it is hard for the girls to accept these revelations and it not long before various girls have their own doubts and misgivings about the new powers thrust upon them.These issues and the way they resolved is effectively done and we get significant growth not just in the individual characters themselves but the chemistry between the girls. In these episodes it becomes clear that the relationships between Yuuna Yuuki/Mimori Tougou and the Inubouzaki sisters are particularly strong. For people who are fans of drama or even yuri there is much to be had here about these two key relationships. More important though is that these relationships will have greater relevance later in the anime’s plotline.Nestled in these plot and character developments is a lot of light hearted slice-of-life content. In that regard we get a lot of classic scenes that we often associate with slice-of-life anime. If you are not into that then the early episodes may seem draggy. This slice-of-life action coupled with the magical girl fights being resolved in a fairly quick fashion means that the first half of Yuuki Yuuna carries a light-hearted tone which could be easily described as a standard magical girl series.It is in the second half when Yuuki Yuuna shifts gears and the tone of the series becomes darker. A major revelation is made in regards to the true nature of the magical girl’s power. It is this new found power and the consequences it entails that causes a great deal suffering for our girls. How they cope with these problems form a key source of drama. This drama is elevated further by the strain it causes for the key relationships described earlier. This drama and sense of hopelessness only grow stronger in the subsequent episodes when more truths about the origins of the magical girl hero is laid bare to the audience.This drama naturally reaches a crescendo in the season finale where the girls are confronted with their final opponent and it is here where I felt the series stumbled somewhat. The biggest issue I saw was the ending was simply rushed. If more time was devoted to exposition and explanations the impact of these climatic scenes would have carried more weight. In addition to the rushed nature of the ending the other problem I saw was the direction of the ending itself. Now what constituents a good ending is always going to be subjective but the issue I had is while the ending is not an asspull (there is foreshadowing to the events that occurred) it did seem very convenient. Neverland convenient if you get my drift… Despite my misgivings though you may like it I just think the ending is a point that will prove decisive among anime fans.Animation/musicThe animation in Yuuki Yuuna remains solid throughout the show and this high standard is maintained with only minor declines in animation here and there. The fight scenes in the battleground are always enjoyable to watch and the transformations cute. Speaking of cute all the main cast are moe so if you are into that thing this will be another plus point. In terms of music, I felt indifferent to it and the accompanying opening animation. This was doubly so for the ending theme animation. The opening song is 1: ""Hoshi to Hana"" by Sanshuu Chuugaku. The series has seven (yes seven) ending songs. One is the opening whilst another four are various mixes of ""Aurora Days"". The final two endings are mixes of “Inori no Uta”.Summary:If you are a fan of magical girls/drama or slice-of-life then it is likely you will dig Yuuki Yuuna. For much of this shows running it is largely a light-hearted character driven show that deals with many everyday events. The ante does go up in the second half of the show where a major revelation is discovered that turns the girl’s life’s upside down. This turmoil naturally brings its drama and angst but what is most notable here is the strain it puts on the key relationships of Yuuna and Mimori plus the Inubouzaki relationship. This is perhaps the strongest part of the show and will be enjoyed by all. Drama lovers will particularly like this segment.The ending will prove to be a more decisive point so it is hard to judge how you will like it. This could go either way but on the plus side there is closure and there are no loose ends so you need not concern yourself over those kinds of problems. The issue mainly stems in the direction of the ending which to me was rather questionable. If you like magical girls series that is filled with good relationship drama you are likely to have positive feelings for Yuuki Yuuna that will likely stick regardless of how you perceive the ending. Moreover, with the prequels and subsequent seasons adding fuller explanations to what happened at this shows final moments you can always pursue those seasons if you are keen on getting more complete answers.Story 6.5 – Yuuki Yuuna starts with a bang with an opener that has it all. Things do slow down in the subsequent episodes as the focus largely shifts on the characters. The series does kick on from the midpoint as we are faced a major twist. It is here where Yuuki Yuuna reaches its high point in plot development and things do look promising but this high is stifled with an ending that I found somewhat unsatisfactory.[B]Characters 8 –[/B] Strongest part of the series. While there is not a great deal of depth to be had all the girls are likeable. They all have their quirks and weaknesses and although they are not the complicated characters you’ll ever see they all have a nuance behind them.

These relationships are not only good but they do an effective job in elevating the plot in the latter parts of the series.Animation 7.5 – Solid and consistent throughout.

I really wanted to like this anime but it was very much slice of life up to about episode 8. The girls spent a lot of time going about their daily lives and binging on sweets without gaining weight. If you dislike chirpy or bickering girls it\'s hard, boring, and despite their cute appearances, irritating to get through. I did shed some tears for Fu in episode 9, so I\'ll admit, it did give me some feels. It\'s great that the show included...a disabled girl named Togo, but the ""bondage"" fanservice with her magical girl transformation made me cringe. The last few episodes intrigued me but I felt like I wasted my time overall. a disabled girl named Togo, but the ""bondage"" fanservice with her magical girl transformation made me cringe. The last few episodes intrigued me but I felt like I wasted my time overall.', 'Yuki Yuna is a Hero is another entry in the magical girl ""genre"" (I quote genre because I don\'t believe MAL has it as a genre on its own) and this was a very pleasant surprise to me because it pushes against a lot of the common tropes that I\'m used to seeing.Story: Yuki Yuna is a Hero starts us out with four middle schoolers, Yuna, Mimori, Itsuki and Fuu, who are part of their school\'s ""Hero Club"".  They have five provisions that act as their club mantra and together, they perform duties that bring a smile to, not only those within the school,...but around their general community.  Their school worships the Taisha, which is the fictional deity that is said to watch over them all.  One day, the Taisha enlists these four girls, as well as Karin who joins their club later, to fight the Vertexes, mythical monsters that seek to threaten their world.  These five girls gain magical abilities that allow them to fight those monsters and when one approaches, they fight them in, what I\'ll call, a parallel magical world.  This means that anything that happens there is not seen by any other human in the real world.At first, we have a pretty stereotypical setting where its magical girls vs monster and it plays out just about as you\'d expect.  However, what surprised me was how the story was told from roughly the halfway point, on.  Gone are the light topics of being a hero and having fun, and suddenly, we\'re talking about debilitating consequences and suicide attempts.  This all starts at the end of one of the episodes when the girls are shown what can happen if they push their limits too much, then they start to realize what happens around them is becoming their own reality.  It very much surprised me, but in a good way, because the dialogue, pacing and clarity all stood up for themselves.  What started out as an okay watch, grew into much more than I expected, with an ending that made me think it was over until I realized there\'s not only one, but two more seasons to come.  (8/10)Characters: What always knocks me off of watching this genre is that we end up dealing with young, immature characters who end up being too annoying for me to continue.  This is not the case here.  While our main cast are young, teenage girls, they are anything but problematic.  Yuuna is one who is basically the personal embodiment of what the hero club wants to be - a symbol of hope who follows up on her words.  Her and Mimori are best friends and it shows throughout the length of this series.  Mimori is extremely smart and is \'the\' character that pushes the pace on the back half of this season.  Itsuki and Fuu are sisters who were forced to live on their own after their parents passed away before the events of this season.  Fuu, in particular acts as a motherly figure, who you can\'t help but cheer for.  Karin doesn\'t have quite as much depth to her, but she\'s still a solid character in what she says and eventually can grow on some audiences.My minor gripe is that the Taisha that this world and its characters seem to warship has a direct role in what is happening to these girls, but a lot of the details about them feel like they\'re left out.  I want to know more ""whys"" and while there are various things that happen as a result of them, and while many are touched on, outside of the event in the middle that changes the look of the series, I feel like we don\'t get quite enough.  This might be expanded on in later seasons, but this did bug me, just enough.Our main cast is a strong group who sticks together, especially between Yuuna and Mimori, as Itsuki and Fuu.  There aren\'t really many side characters to speak of, but based on what we have to work with, I was very happy with our characters that we see here.  (8/10)Art: The art here is honestly really nothing special, but still serves it ultimate purpose in making you feel for our characters, especially in the back half.  Scenes that are meant to be light and represent hope are just that, and the scenes in the back half are dark and horrifying at times.  However, I really like the designs of the main cast\'s magical transformations.  They aren\'t plain at all, especially in the latter half.  The action sequences aren\'t anything special, as fights don\'t tend to last very long, but there\'s enough there that you can see some of the moves our characters can pull off.  (7/10)Sound: The OST does its job, with the final fight having a solid driving sound to it.  The OP matches the light feel like the beginning half has very well.  The VO cast, however, was extremely strong.  I will never get tired of marveling how good of a VO Erika Harlacher (Mimori) is.  She puts so much raw emotion into her roles and this is very close to her performance heard in Violet Evergarden.  Xanthe Huynh (Yuuna), Erica Mendez (Fuu), Brianna Knickenbocker (Itsuki) and Sarah Williams (Karin) all perform their roles really well.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: Yuki Yuna is a Hero surprised me with how strong it was.  They definitely don\'t follow the typical magical girl storyline, but instead, moves it into a darker path with strong characters and superb VOs.  I\'m a little disappointed that the second season hasn\'t been dubbed yet - as far as I can tell anyway - but will be on the lookout.

(8/10)', ""I've never felt compelled to write a review until now, because even though I didn't particularly enjoy this anime, I still want you to watch it. If you're like me, someone somewhere recommended this anime because you're a fan of Mahou Shojou Madoka Magica. As a huge fan of that franchise, I found this series to be the poor man's Madoka, and pretty underwhelmed with the recommendation. While I think they were trying for a balance of darker storylines and lighthearted character moments, I feel that they way overcompensated with too much of a slice of life element too often. The majority of the series...felt like a boring chore I had to get through just to reach the last two episodes. And while those episodes were very well done IMO, the pay off didn't exactly add up. All of that being said, the prequel and sequel to this show are exceptional, and if you're looking for your Madoka fix, it's in those seasons, not this one. Enjoy this series for what it is, keep your expectations low, and immediately follow it up with the prequel/sequel.Also Fu x Karin 4Ever. felt like a boring chore I had to get through just to reach the last two episodes.

I won't spoil any of the plot twists, but I assume my readers know the gist of what this show is about.It's no coincidence that the most recommended anime for this show is Madoka Magica; they are very similar. In my opinion it also shares similarities to the 2007's anime Bokurano, in which children are also made to fight without their consent. Although not an original idea I do still think this particular show has merit in its existence.By the time of writing this review I have yet to have seen any sequels or prequels.STORY:The story is what is...the problem here: it's a diet madoka. I don't necessarily think that's the worst thing ever, but it's not going to win any originality awards. However, the pacing is decent enough (which in my eye is one of the most important things in anime,) and it doesn't try to baffle you with it's plot twists, even though it has one or two up it's sleeve. If you pay attention to the opening lyrics it already kind of tells you what is waiting for the girls.Even still it has good conflict and and a satisfying ending.ART:I am quite a fan of the designs in this show. It feels very fresh and sleek. The transformed outfits are cute, without being overly overbearingly so and they fit the theme of flowers nicely without it being just a literal flower dress. It also looks a bit mech inspired. The transformations themselves are okay, but not amazing.Animation is okay.One thing I do dislike about this show is it's random and occasional placement of fanservice. Regardless of me being not a fan of fanservice in general, random boob jiggles and ass shots really don't fit with the vibes of this show. It's really not that often however, so it's not the worst.SOUND:I really like this soundtrack, i'm not a musical person so I usually don't have much to say on this part, but the soundtrack in this show really fits the sleek and fresh aura of the show, even fitting in with the flower theme. The voice acting is also really good, they're all cute but not annoyingCHARACTER:Possibly the best thing about this show. They all have good dynamic and individual goals and troubles. They're not the most complex, but they don't need to be. They are really memorable, and I still remembered them years later now that I rewatched this show. Especially near the end there's some good character development.One of the most important reason to me for people to watch this show is the representation of disability: it's not perfect, and I really think this show could've distinguished itself more if it had leaned into this aspect, but there still is a main character in a wheelchair and they show her living her daily life and fighting alongside her friends. There really aren't that many magical girls like her, so I highly recommend this show if you want more diversity in your magical girls.ENJOYMENT & OVERALL:Good short anime to watch if you're in the mood for a magical girl show for an older crowd. I really can't give it an 8, because of the drawbacks, but it's a very strong 7 for me overall. the problem here: it's a diet madoka.

The real question is if it manages to move out of that shadow and if so, how.  Personally, I think it does manage to at least find a niche, even if it never truly stands on its own, but I suspect that other viewers will have differing opinions on the matter.StoryThe story of YuYuYu is fairly simple; it has two movements to it, basically held together by some admittedly good slice of life.  While the show...does hesitatingly approach some complex issues, it never quite owns up to the difficult questions it raises and takes a stand, or even requests the viewer to do so.  Watchmen, ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"", and YuYuYu all ask a similar core question, but while Alan Moore and Ursula LeGuin do leave it to interpretation what is the right course of action, YuYuYu decides to cast the idea aside and not force anyone to choose.  It takes a safe route throughout its story, approaching topics that could be great if addressed well and then waving at those themes as they pass by.What we do get is pleasant and dramatic in the right places, but it never quite reaches greatness; in the end, it\'s average and bestArtYuYuYu looks nice, I grant it that, but it\'s never really ambitious or creative.  The character designs seem fairly standard, and while the Shinju-sama\'s barrier is a fairly gorgeous battleground with a distinctive style, it\'s also very static.  This is a show that invites constant comparisons to Madoka, and... here it really doesn\'t live up.  Every Witch and Labyrinth had its own style, a unique phantasmagorical wonderland teeming with symbolism and weirdly surreal and abstract artistry.  The Shinju-sama provides a floral world of twining roots in pastel watercolor, that has a strong theme for wide shots but isn\'t quite as great with closeups.The enemies, the Vertex, are a little more creative, but they rely heavily on very angular, geometric designs with just a few organic elements.  There wasn\'t no effort put into them, but they don\'t move a whole lot nor do they, despite having unique appearances, really have much character to them.  Again, I have to compare YuYuYu to Madoka, and YuYuYu falls short: while neither Witches nor Vertex really communicate nor function as characters rather than monsters, the Witches had looks and themes that reflected something, and their movements (or lack thereof) supported them being independently memorable.That said, the art is solid on its own, and if I\'m not comparing it to anything it\'s not without flaws, but it\'s good.  The \'real world\' environments are especially nice, and I do like how the show keeps a warm, pale palette for its entire world.SoundThis is where YuYuYu actually trips up.  The music is good, and the opening (for me at least) weirdly catchy, but the voice acting is... OK.  And that\'s about all I can say about it.  The show is at its strongest when the characters are just talking, potentially in an emotionally charged manner, and weakest when they\'re screaming, shouting, or crying.  The problem with that is they scream, shout, or cry a lot.  I don\'t exactly blame the voice actresses for this; as much as I actually enjoyed the fairly cheesy scenes where a character shouts some (or all) of the Hero Club Five Tenets in battle, it can\'t be easy to deliver those lines with conviction.  And like I said, I liked the theme, I just wish that we had more moments at a 7-8/10 intensity rather than jumping so quickly to 10/10 where things start to break down a little.  On another minor note, some of the sound effects get a little repetitive.  Again, it\'s got to be hard to do the mixing here, because there are only so many ""slash"" and ""shine"" effects in your library, but I feel like they could have been a little stronger if they were a little more dynamic.CharacterOne of the places where YuYuYu shines is the character  To be clear, it doesn\'t shine that brightly, but it does work out.  Fuu, and to a lesser extent Togo, are very dimensional characters with strong goals who we get to see both at their high points and their low points, letting us get a solid feel for their range.  Togo\'s arc could have been handled a little better if more time was devoted to it, but I actually think I enjoyed the slice of life more than I enjoyed the Vertex battles so I can\'t really begrudge what the time was spent on instead.  Karin is alright, but we only really get to see her reach the culmination of her personal story at the very end; she comes in late and peaks after Fuu and Togo so I\'m not sure she gets the focus she needs.  Yuuna and Itsuki, by contrast, are fairly flat and static characters.  Yuuna is a the one for whom this really could have been addressed.  Now, there is something nice about the fact that she\'s a static character.  I feel like the degree to which she\'s unchanged from the very beginning of episode 1 to the very beginning of episode 12 is a deliberate choice: she refuses to be moved in the face of the journey she goes on, and acts as an anchor for the other characters.  Still, she could have had more depth while still being the stable beacon of hope she needs to be.Like I said, I actually liked the characters; Fu and Togo have good arcs, Yuuna and Itsuki are really pleasant to have around and make for good positive scenes, and Karin does a little bit of both, having development and being a very watchable character (not that Fuu and Togo aren\'t).  There are just times I really wish I was watching ""Fuu Inubouzaki is a Hero"", because I was more interested in her as a character.EnjoymentThis is where I find YuYuYu actually comes out from under Madoka\'s shadow, because in the end it\'s not trying to be the same show as Madoka.  Madoka hooks you and pulls you along by being dark, twisted, and sometimes profound.  It\'s a vast, bleak shadow in which there is a single guiding light, and you have to fight through twelve episodes of that dark to reach for it.  It\'s moving and powerful.  In YuYuYu... that shadow is a passing thing.  Even the darkness must always pass.  I appreciate that we get episodes like 7 (the beach episode) where these characters can laugh and smile, and come to terms with the hardships they\'ve faced and continue to face, that they get a chance to breathe between the battles and psychological blows that try to beat them down.  It\'s not as powerful as Madoka, but I don\'t think it wants to be.  It\'s inviting, and I feel that\'s exactly what\'s wanted out of the show\'s structure.  The fact that you weave a post-Madoka Magical Girl show in with Slice of Life, or Cute Girls doing Cute Things, has a charm to it that\'s hard to deny and earns the fact that there is so much more light in this story.  In fact, I think my favorite episodes overall are the ones where the characters don\'t transform at all, but instead live their lives against the backdrop of the action that has happened and the action that is still to come.  And that\'s something unique, and different, and worth having.  That\'s why YuYuYu is worth watching, even if you\'ve already seen Madoka; it\'s not the same story, and as much as it does share themes, it has a fundamentally different take on those themes compared to its predecessor.Story: 6Art: 7Sound: 5Character: 7Enjoyment: 8Overall Total Score: 7 (6.8) does hesitatingly approach some complex issues, it never quite owns up to the difficult questions it raises and takes a stand, or even requests the viewer to do so.  Watchmen, ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"", and YuYuYu all ask a similar core question, but while Alan Moore and Ursula LeGuin do leave it to interpretation what is the right course of action, YuYuYu decides to cast the idea aside and not force anyone to choose.  It takes a safe route throughout its story, approaching topics that could be great if addressed well and then waving at those themes as they pass by.What we do get is pleasant and dramatic in the right places, but it never quite reaches greatness; in the end, it\'s average and bestArtYuYuYu looks nice, I grant it that, but it\'s never really ambitious or creative.  The character designs seem fairly standard, and while the Shinju-sama\'s barrier is a fairly gorgeous battleground with a distinctive style, it\'s also very static.  This is a show that invites constant comparisons to Madoka, and... here it really doesn\'t live up.  Every Witch and Labyrinth had its own style, a unique phantasmagorical wonderland teeming with symbolism and weirdly surreal and abstract artistry.  The Shinju-sama provides a floral world of twining roots in pastel watercolor, that has a strong theme for wide shots but isn\'t quite as great with closeups.The enemies, the Vertex, are a little more creative, but they rely heavily on very angular, geometric designs with just a few organic elements.  There wasn\'t no effort put into them, but they don\'t move a whole lot nor do they, despite having unique appearances, really have much character to them.  Again, I have to compare YuYuYu to Madoka, and YuYuYu falls short: while neither Witches nor Vertex really communicate nor function as characters rather than monsters, the Witches had looks and themes that reflected something, and their movements (or lack thereof) supported them being independently memorable.That said, the art is solid on its own, and if I\'m not comparing it to anything it\'s not without flaws, but it\'s good.  The \'real world\' environments are especially nice, and I do like how the show keeps a warm, pale palette for its entire world.SoundThis is where YuYuYu actually trips up.  The music is good, and the opening (for me at least) weirdly catchy, but the voice acting is... OK.  And that\'s about all I can say about it.  The show is at its strongest when the characters are just talking, potentially in an emotionally charged manner, and weakest when they\'re screaming, shouting, or crying.  The problem with that is they scream, shout, or cry a lot.  I don\'t exactly blame the voice actresses for this; as much as I actually enjoyed the fairly cheesy scenes where a character shouts some (or all) of the Hero Club Five Tenets in battle, it can\'t be easy to deliver those lines with conviction.  And like I said, I liked the theme, I just wish that we had more moments at a 7-8/10 intensity rather than jumping so quickly to 10/10 where things start to break down a little.  On another minor note, some of the sound effects get a little repetitive.  Again, it\'s got to be hard to do the mixing here, because there are only so many ""slash"" and ""shine"" effects in your library, but I feel like they could have been a little stronger if they were a little more dynamic.CharacterOne of the places where YuYuYu shines is the character  To be clear, it doesn\'t shine that brightly, but it does work out.  Fuu, and to a lesser extent Togo, are very dimensional characters with strong goals who we get to see both at their high points and their low points, letting us get a solid feel for their range.  Togo\'s arc could have been handled a little better if more time was devoted to it, but I actually think I enjoyed the slice of life more than I enjoyed the Vertex battles so I can\'t really begrudge what the time was spent on instead.  Karin is alright, but we only really get to see her reach the culmination of her personal story at the very end; she comes in late and peaks after Fuu and Togo so I\'m not sure she gets the focus she needs.  Yuuna and Itsuki, by contrast, are fairly flat and static characters.  Yuuna is a the one for whom this really could have been addressed.  Now, there is something nice about the fact that she\'s a static character.  I feel like the degree to which she\'s unchanged from the very beginning of episode 1 to the very beginning of episode 12 is a deliberate choice: she refuses to be moved in the face of the journey she goes on, and acts as an anchor for the other characters.  Still, she could have had more depth while still being the stable beacon of hope she needs to be.Like I said, I actually liked the characters; Fu and Togo have good arcs, Yuuna and Itsuki are really pleasant to have around and make for good positive scenes, and Karin does a little bit of both, having development and being a very watchable character (not that Fuu and Togo aren\'t).  There are just times I really wish I was watching ""Fuu Inubouzaki is a Hero"", because I was more interested in her as a character.EnjoymentThis is where I find YuYuYu actually comes out from under Madoka\'s shadow, because in the end it\'s not trying to be the same show as Madoka.

Some shows looked at Madoka Magica's success and learnt all the wrong lessons, turning out grimdark murder-fests that feel like a mockery of the magical girl genre.  While there's some clear post-Madoka influence to Yuki Yuna, it thankfully isn't that.  Heart, drama, and tragedy have always been part of the genre, going back as far as Minky Momo and Sailor Moon (assuming you're not watching the censored US TV version of the latter), and Yuki Yuna feels as much in that vein as anything more...recent.There's a bit of a speed bump in getting into the show, however.  The girls' smartphones are heavily integrated into the story, to the extent that there's literally an app to activate their transformations.  Consequently it's easy to mistake the first episode for something more child-oriented like PreCure, but the story gets stronger as it goes along, being quite patient in playing its cards.  It takes its time letting you get attached to the girls before really putting them through the wringer.  The world-building is especially interesting, dropping in foreshadowing early on that pays off in epic fashion later.  It all builds to an emotional and satisfying conclusion, which would have been a great ending even if the show hadn't continued. recent.There's a bit of a speed bump in getting into the show, however.

Set in a vaguely post-apocalyptic future, the story involves a quartet of middle school girls (leader Fuu, her sister Itsuki, computer nerd/history buff Togo and the title character, the ever-cheerful Yuna Yuki) who\'ve formed a ""Hero Club\'\' to carry out community service and volunteer activities. There\'s a hidden purpose to their club, though; Fuu informs them that they\'ve been selected by the Taisha, the New World\'s high priests, to protect their city from reality-warping aliens called Vertexes. After being joined by a fifth Hero, Karin,...the team pulls off a hard-fought but seemingly final victory. Since this occurs halfway through the series, though, viewers won\'t be surprised when this isn\'t actually the end. Because being a Hero comes with an unexpected cost, leading the group to question their purpose, and whether it\'s worth being sacrificed for a nebulous Greater Good.It\'s unfair to call Yuki Yuna a Madoka Magica clone as some have, because it has plenty of distinct features. At the same time, it\'s hard to ignore how Yuki uses Madoka as a template. This shows most clearly in the protagonists, most of them clearly modeled on Madoka\'s heroines: Fuu is Mami, the seemingly-strong but inwardly-crippled by self-doubt leader who\'s also an orphan; Togo is Homura in a wheelchair, possessing her looks, (pre-timeloop) awkward personality, tragic backstory, attachment to Yuki and gun fetish; and haughty outsider Karin is a watered-down Kyoko. (The English dub doesn\'t discourage the comparison, using many of the same VAs as Madoka.) The show also shares many plot elements with Madoka, with the Vertexes a stand-in for that show\'s Witches; the unexpected price of becoming a Magical Girl; the deceitful higher power that tricks the heroes into becoming Heroes; the shocking twists and the reveal of Togo\'s backstory. I\'ve even read that Togo\'s actions in the final arc were the creators\' rebuke to Homura in Rebellion, which may or may not be true but it\'s hard not to compare them.Unlike some viewers, I found Yuki Yuna\'s slice of life episodes to be a high point. If nothing else, they ground the characters so that they’re more than just a photocopy of their Madoka equivalents. Fuu in particular benefits from these episodes, dealing with her burdens of leadership and her guilt over deceiving her friends, while still trying to be a normal teenager. There\'s an early, lighthearted episode focusing on Itsuki\'s dreams of becoming a singer that sets up an emotional payoff later in the series. While Karin shares many of Kyoko\'s character beats, she\'s mostly comic relief with little of that redhead\'s tragic backstory. Yuna is the flattest character but her relentless optimism makes her endearing, if one-note. Togo is sweet, loyal and personable, although she has some eccentricities - a weird hypernationalism complete with little Japanese flags adds some odd notes, though it does explain why she’s so gung-ho about sacrificing herself for a “Greater Good.” I appreciated that her disability is never commented upon, either by the show or the other characters - it\'s just accepted. So if nothing else, most viewers will like Yuna and friends enough to feel invested in them.The problem is that Yuki Yuna wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be both the dark Magical Girl series expected by 2010s anime fans and the traditional Mahou Shoujo with all that entails: lighthearted girl adventures, moe character designs, fan-service (for some odd reason, Togo is the target of most of this) and musings on the Power of Friendship. While individual episodes work, the show’s structure is deeply strange, alternating between dark, plot-and-action heavy episodes and ones where the Heroes hang out in karaoke bars or go to the beach. I understand wanting to give audiences a breather, but this approach also dissipates tension or momentum as the show builds to its big reveal. In a twelve episode series, it means that by the time we finally learn the dread secret of the Taisha, there\'s not enough time to fully deal with the fallout. This series either needed more episodes to flesh out its world-building, or a more focused plot. (Presumably the sequel series builds upon what’s explored here, though I haven’t watched them yet.)On a technical level Yuki Yuna is competent. The animation and character designs are fine but unimaginative; the Vertexes seem a bit repetitive, the action scenes CGI-heavy and the battle barriers not nearly as creative as Madoka\'s Witch Labyrinths. I enjoyed the music well-enough, with a low key but emotional OP (Hoshi to Hana) stressing the Heroes\' battles and the mellower end credits (Aurora Days) that focuses on their friendship. Voice acting is good in both English and Japanese (I really enjoyed Erica Mendez as Fuu in the dub, up there with Ryuko and Tsubaki among her best performances). Not much to complain about but nothing remarkable, either.In its final three episodes, Yuki Yuna tries frantically to tie together its thematic and story strands. There are big battles, shocking secrets and heart-rending character moments, particularly Fuu\'s breakdown and Karin\'s unexpected sacrifice in the penultimate episode. But ultimately, the show waves away consequences with an affirmation that Love and Friendship Conquers All. I can\'t say I felt disappointed that Yuna and Friends lived to Hero another day; I liked spending time with them, after all. But it didn\'t feel like the show truly earned its happy ending, either. Yuki Yuna is a Hero ultimately registers as a watchable, but frustrating show that feels like it could (should) be a lot better. the team pulls off a hard-fought but seemingly final victory.

I wrote a very horrible review here first because I was not satisfied with the ending XDSo the anime is very good. Very entertaining and you can see that it takes its inspiration from the dark Mahou shoujo trope but still manages to stay in the slice-of-life genre. And that is a very difficult thing to do. So well done on that.I find the ending satisfying in terms of the entire series but if you look at this season as the only season that happened in the whole Yuki Yuuna series (plus the washio Sumi chapter} then it's pretty good! It's an anime...to watch with friends because it's very entertaining and the ending can actually be explained. But if you look at the entire Yuuki Yuuna series, then it makes no sense lolSo folks, if you wanna watch this anime watch only the first two seasons, please. to watch with friends because it's very entertaining and the ending can actually be explained. But if you look at the entire Yuuki Yuuna series, then it makes no sense lolSo folks, if you wanna watch this anime watch only the first two seasons, please."", 'Blatant Madoka rip, like 1 to 1 comparisons all over, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing! If you like Madoka, you\'ll probably get *something* out of this, but don\'t expect it to be as fleshed out. The concept of  young girls ""catching the eye of the gods in any age"" and being chosen to be vessels for the power of the world tree (god) feels similar to Norse mythology (ex: unicorns only showing themselves to young girls). The music is pretty good and really adds to that ambiance. *Kind of* reminiscent of the NieR music.However, I feel like the concept is really...under delivered on and could be way more of a focus in the story/themes. The Washio Chapter gives a lot more subtle world building with that stuff which I really liked, but there\'s not a ton in this season. I think the best of this concept comes with the girls being treated like high priestesses by the Taisha (again, WAY more in Washio) with extravagant meals, getting places rented out just for them, the total enshrinement of Sonoko after she couldn\'t move anymore was actually really cool.Designs: 11/10Honestly really good, I really liked all the designs for the magical girls outfits AND the powered up bloom designs AND even all the regular everyday outfits, hair, school uniforms, everything lol. This show is really pretty and it hits a lot of great outfits!Transformations: 6.5/10Pretty good, I think they only show the whole transformations for everybody like once or twice then do group transformations with cuts to the best parts of each every other time. They\'re not particularly interesting or unique, they\'re pretty standard but the excellent outfit designs really carry it.Characters: 4/10Everybody is very mid and I honestly couldn\'t say more than a sentence or two describing any of them. I feel like the characters in Washio get a lot more development (probably due to the character death) and for that reason, Togo/Washi is probably the strongest character in this. I def didn\'t help that all story consequences got completely reverted at the end, but whatever. Like... Yuna is a hero... and that\'s kind of her one trait.Gay Factor: meh, not really thereEverybody always says every magical girl show is super gay (me included), this one honestly feels more like a friendship story. I could see Karin/Fu the most probably and obviously Yuna/Togo, but the show never really feels like its trying to be romantic or anything other than friends finding and supporting each other. That\'s just fine! One note tho, Togo is def autist coded lmao. Even more so in Washio\'s Chapter lol.Sad stuff: 3/10I really liked the idea that the world tree\'s chosen warriors were used as vessels for a god\'s power, so much so that they were forced to sacrifice body parts/ senses to wield it. It felt like the power was so much that their human bodies were being burned up as a conduit for this awesome, godly power that could basically one shot any enemy. This is where I feel like the writers could have leaned more into the mythology aspect, but def didn\'t. It gets revealed later that the whole bloom system was implemented by the Taisha tweaking the app that lets them transform and shit which honestly feels like kind of cheap to me. Like yeah, humans bad only care about power oh noooo... but I feel like that story has already been told a million times and I would prefer if they leaned more into the Taisha being a religious org around the world tree than a FBI type thing exploiting it for power? Like, they\'re still following what the tree wants (keeping the vectors at bay) but it feels more human than what I wanted out of the story concept.I was kinda down for everyone getting permanently disabled by blooming and it felt like real consequences they were going to have to deal with as a result of channeling a god\'s power, but the damn twist at the end after the big final battle where hoes were blooming left and right totally took that out. The whole season was a build up for ""oh man look what this power does to us!!! The Taisha knew the whole time and look and this other girl who\'s totally paralyzed and on life support from fighting!!"" and everybody just got fully healed at the end with no explanation. Like... seriously? Felt like they didn\'t wanna commit to their own system all the way because they wanted to keep using the same characters for another story (The Hero Chapter). Pretty lame smh.Action/Fights: 6/10The fight choreography wasn\'t that crazy, but (again) all the designs and weapons were pretty cool to look at moving around and getting sad and whatever. The world tree barrier is SUPER pretty watercolor looking shit and the vector designs are unique if nothing else. The vectors don\'t really do that much honestly... Like, they move forward very slowly and shoot stuff sometimes. Most of the spectacle here is from the sick ass magical girl designs and seeing their cool powers in motion. I liked that the action escalated SO quickly lmao, literally one of the first big fights everyone but Karrin blooms and uses insane, huge god tier powers in space and shit. But really, the fights are about looking at the girls first and foremost. The actual fighting and enemies are pretty secondary.End of the day, Washio is a cooler show with more world building stuff, but less cool flights IMO. under delivered on and could be way more of a focus in the story/themes.

The first half is something like Evangelion: ""The world is on the brink of destruction and we need to kill 12 unknown beings that trying to end it"". Then the second part is just a sad and cheap cop-out with a lot of screaming and a diabetes-level sweet ending. There is no...conclusion to anything, really.It is also interesting to see how japanese author portray heathen gods as just pieces of shit who casually take human sacrifices and act as some kind of natural force that people blindly follow to their deaths.

There are invaders, there is a Holy Tree that protects the world, there is religion called Taisha. Taisha has somehow Tree knowledge to empower the Tree to keep protecting world.The “calm” of the franchise. And the “storm” of the franchise.Lets talk about the “calm”. Essentially we get amazing slice of life of cute girls doing cute stuff. Mostly playing heroes of daily commute activities. Helping neighborhood. With moeblob era of remind me of K-on times. Very cute interactions and progression. Although what is done well, whilst at times (well, only for the movies at least felt so) feels too much of slow burner was the whole “calm” part being for too long. Plenty of slow presentation of girls living daily life , doing various activities.Now to the “storm”. Oh boy, and I’m not talking about the action here as of yet. I mean the drama, the “Taisha/religion goup” reveals, twists being unveiled and messed around throughout the franchise is a trainwreck. And I mean not in a sense “it’s absolute garbage” but I mean in sense of “why the hell they have to toss so much hell on those girls”. After the whole moeblob episodes when the damn shit starts to get real, it hits hard. Things get dark fast and powerful.The only issues I had would be season specific which I will shortly mention next. But as finishing touch for the whole franchise story aspect I will mention that much. Overall the story had great dark premise that was interesting, tragic, dramatic and powerful. There is no doubt in that. Regardless of it’s flaws in story downsides and questionable choices it was still a rather good storytelling when it comes to “tragic magical girls” type of story.Season 1, the main squad shenanigans.To put it simply the main issue I had here without spoiling anything. I think “price” value lost somewhat it’s point with how they decided to go with the story.Which yes, is nice and all and required later on. But when I watched it my honest reaction was “but….eh…..why?”Season 2, the prequelMan….. I watched the movie versions. And my main complaint for this movie was the slower burner part of the first two movies I think? The slice-of-life part felt especially slow in these movies. That’s my only complaint here. Other than that…. ;_;Season 3, the sequelProbably was the strongest season for me, didn’t really have much of complaint or than the fact of getting over of season 1 finale self question. Couldn’t accept it still for few episodes. Then I didn’t have the emotional capacity to worry about that anymore.Season 4, the sequel different point of view and the finale.Okay…. that was a bloody weird to watch especially since I was binge watching everything In a row. So suddenly I’m re-watching season 3 just from a different characters viewpoint. Obviously new characters, new plot gets revealed new activities. But it was simply such a weird thing to experience. Overall what was revealed were interesting plot points that did explain few extra bits but more than anything it generated few more questions and more hatred towards Taisha and the Tree.The finale itself, without spoiling. It’s not much. It’s aftermath of everything for a bit. That gives a glimpse into future. I personally think it was fitting enough, but would have liked a bit longer section of that part.#CharacterFirst of all, great stereotypes. Lot of cute characters with amazing quirks. Character interactions are LOT OF FUN and lovable. Dialogues, them messing with each other is entertaining and funny. Character drama, theatrics is POWERFUL, kept me quite most of the time on the edge, stressed and quite depressed and furious about the damn Tree and Taisha. Felt bad for the girls. The character growth themselves is somewhat debatable, they had their moments of realization, but mostly it was the magical girl emotions route. By that I mean girls thinking something alongside of “gotta get over it, hold that pain inside me, get stronger, not time to worry, not to hurt them” etc…. whilst did their characters actually ever grow in the series? I’d say somewhat, but mostly I’d say rather not, most of the character changes came from plot changes after seasons changes that simply changed their roles on what each character does, whilst personality’wise they remained the same. Only thing changed is their position in “society” I guess. Even in the whole grand finale.That I think applies for the both main girls and the prequel story girls. As for the 4th season alternate point of view girls. Honestly, they felt too much of a side-characters to either grow into them or care about them. Although as characters they were okay, I personally found that didn’t have as much weight nor charm in their character as main story characters or prequel story characters.#Art & SoundSimple moeblob design with amazing magical girl battle sequences. Whilst the animation isn’t the most impressive it was still great enough. The soundtrack I loved, lot of great OST that I even listened separate on youtube.#Enjoyment & OverallWell, Madoka styled magical girls Anime, where animation style and visual design is less stylish and unique but honestly. The content was better for me. Also let me get this out. Fuck that Tree and fuck Taisha. Heroes are creatures who are obviously also mentally deranged, self-gratification from “serving the world-every living creature” without bias, entertaining to watch, but this story was prime example where just, just don’t do it. It’s not worth it. Let the world burn. Just enjoy your time with your close friends instead.Gut wrenching franchise with amazing music and intriguing world and story. But yeah, poor girls. Probably would have something more to write and mention about, rant about. But that should sum it up as spoiler free as I can.#Total Score 7/10 #PROS+Pretty interesting story concept+Grandiose magical girl fights+Epic soundtrack+Cute girls doing cute stuff is very cute.+Very likeable characters with solid variation of stereotypes+Quite satisfying way to close things up for the change of the usual#CONS-Story points, where you ask “but why even that was done, if that was conclusion?”-A bit weird timeline flex with presentation-Very strong tearjerker factor just for sakes of it-Yo, where is Yuuki X Tougou yuri end?#Review (comments/longer ver):#StoryThe story…hmm to put it shortly the good is that the world setting and the concept of story is amazing and cruel.

Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37597/Dakaretai_Otoko_1-i_ni_Odosarete_Imasu,"['Appalling. Yes, that is the word. This is coming from someone who has read the manga few years earlier, when I was young and my tastes different than right now; I thought the manga was great at the time. Back then I called myself a ""fujoshi"" so that is why I might have enjoyed it. But now I don\'t consider myself anything like that. I\'m just a lgbt person interested in media that has gay characters. So when I saw that it got an anime adaptation I got curious because: why would this specific yaoi manga get an adaptation?Yes, why? The story could be...passable, but the characters are generic and the plot revolves around sex. This anime has no businness getting a 13 episodes adaptation. I think an OVA would have been more appropriate. The pacing is slow, since they\'re trying not to show the sex scenes, which are literally 90% of the manga. So the anime feels empty, has a weird pacing, some stranges cuts... In brief, it is really awkward to watch. I felt strong second-hand embarassement during the first episode.How are you going to animate a manga that resolves around sex and just delete all the sex scenes? Something doesn\'t add up and I\'m serious here.Also, the fact that the plot actually resolves around dubious consent and a rape scene at the begining (like in so many yaoi, unfortunately) just shows that this is just another garbage adaptation of a yaoi manga that for some unknown reason was popular. I mean, I can understand why but I won\'t dwell on this issue.Honestly, this is really sad. I wish there were more animes with romances focused on f/f or m/m couples that were not fetishized. But Alas.If you\'re looking for quality. I would not recommend. If you enjoy the typical yaoi scenarios and stereotypes well, this is for you. I guess. At least, the animation was decent. passable, but the characters are generic and the plot revolves around sex. This anime has no businness getting a 13 episodes adaptation.

At least, the animation was decent.', 'When I first started this show I had no idea I would like it as much as I did. It\'s nothing new, nothing that sets it apart from other shows like this, but it\'s really fun and fun to watch. Now before I write anything else firstly one thing I have seen from people who don\'t like this show are, ""Do people think gay relationships are like this?"" Firstly no, not everyone does, it\'s just something to excite the mind.Story: Pretty fun I would say. You can pretty much guess what gonna happen with each knew trial the main characters face and how it...plays out but some things did take me by surprise. With that being said I do think it is still interesting and I was really engaged with everything that was going on. Never a dull moment to me. As a heterosexual male I wasn\'t so into the sex scenes and such but I said no homo before watching it so wasn\'t that big of a deal.Art/sound: Actually not that bad. It did have some bad moments but mostly It was fine. As cloverworks did Bunny girl senpai and fairy tail this season I do think this had the better Art and animation out of the 3. The OP and ED are catchy as hell and nice to listen to. The OST isn\'t something to excite to much but I love the OP and ED.Characters: The characters are fun. Takato being the level headed cool person he tries to put on but also being very cute and bashful isn\'t something new but still enjoyable as well as Junta looking innocent and sweet but really being a monster underneath his sweet angel exterior is funny and a lot of the comedy which I loved came from their interactions and mainly Juntas actions.Overall: Really good show to watch. Enjoyable to watch would re-watch every now and then. Would recommend to watch. 9/10. plays out but some things did take me by surprise.

English is not my native, but I don\'t need much words to said many reviews about this wonderful BL anime are UNFAIR.The main characters are SUPER fun, I specially love Saijou Takato (main), he is so funny and badass and Azumaya Junta (second main) is so wanko, BUT I have to said ""Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu"" manga, discarding his eroticism and funny mains, is a pretty common BL. In the manga Junta rape Takato. I really hate that scene… Oh God, I was so afraid when the poor...Takato have to run for his live to escape to the bathroom, sadly, that beast catch him and rape him (I totally hate Junta manga for that reason) and later, Takato seems be to-ta-lly ok whit that, even, both have more sex, this time consensual. WTF. You have to be kidding me… We already passed 2010, defenilly you can´t use Trap Card ""Rape to Love"". So why? Well… Whats really happens here is, Takato (the victim), is HIGHLY attracted by Junta since a long time (like the attracted to the magical energies of the moon, lol). That’s why, the rape, for bad its sounds, was no-hate by Takato. This is difficult to understand in the manga, not to say probably was later add by the author. For this reason and the argument no entirely linear, the manga ""Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu""  is a STANDARD YAOI BOOK (*skull voice)Many BL aim to make readers fall in love their main characters, just that. Rest of elements are pretty secondary. If you have a 10/10 main characters you definitely have a 10/10 BL. In my case, I just dislike the manga because I CAN NOT FORGIVE JUNTA FOR THE VIOLATION.""What? But you put 9 on this""Yeah yeah, let me finish... Now is when the magic is coming...CloverWorks studio take out the rape (I mean the rape literally dont happen), rearranged the story and, as if that was not enough, they also added many scenes and details in relation to the profession of the protagonists, like advertising art, scenes from recording drama, their practices and their stage plays performances, etc. Oh-my-God. I was very impressed how this typical ""yaoi"" become on a healthy story very well presented, with a healthy relationship where the interaction of main characters makes each one mature as an individual.""Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu."" anime is, defenelly, a GREAT addition for this problematic anime genre, ussually bad adapted.

However, I decided complete the whole show before sharing my thoughts so this can be a fair review, so here it goes!*SPOILERS MAY APPEAR*STORY (6/10):I believe that the story was okay. Even though it wasn't anything that hasn't been done before, the way it was told was pretty interesting to an extent. However, I wasn't exactly keen on how the love story between Junta and Takato began, again, it was so damn typical like most yaoi shows. I'm kinda glad when it came to...the bedroom scene in the first episode, it was toned down because in the manga, Junta just assaults Takato, and then Takato falls in love with him. I'm pretty tired of seeing shit like this. This is kinda how the first few episodes were like but it was toned down and became quite better as the show progressed. The last two episodes were cute and I really enjoyed them. Overall, the story was okay like I said, but because of the first few episodes, I have to give it a 6. From a realistic point, the whole love story wasn't that amazing.ART (9/10):I pretty much loved the art, it was great, so no complaints there. In terms of animation, some animation was good and bad, but I didn't really care that much about it.SOUND (8/10):I liked the intro and and especially the outro songs, it was lovely. As for the music during episodes, it was good, I didn't mind them at all.CHARACTER (6/10):The character's personalities and traits wasn't anything we haven't seen before. Junta (a top) being forceful and manipulative towards Takato (a bottom) who takes it anyway despite saying no and falls in love anyway. Like I said, I'm really tired that sexual assault and manipulative behavior has to be included in a BL story. This anime was made in 2018 (now 2019), surely we can make a good yaoi love story without this, with occasional loving making WITH CONSENT. Even though consent towards Takato was eventually made as the show progressed, my point still stands. As for the other characters, a lot didn't really have a lot of personality or were just there for the sake of it, or appeared out of nowhere, so I didn't really care for most of them. Ayagi did get some attention but he's a creep and basically took advantage of Takato during the first few episodes. UGHENJOYMENT (6/10):It was okay, but I didn't exactly enjoy it as much as I wanted to. The last two episodes were the ones I felt like I could enjoy the most, and there was some nice moments and some funny humor.OVERALL:In general, it was okay but it wasn't the best. It could have better if it wasn't  so typical and the love story between Takato and Junta was executed better. If you want a more realistic love story, I wouldn't recommend this. To be honest, there's better BL/Yaoi out there than this. the bedroom scene in the first episode, it was toned down because in the manga, Junta just assaults Takato, and then Takato falls in love with him.

You know an anime is gonna be something when it romanticizes sexual abuse in the first episode. in every accounter, a no is being said. Its horrific, to think people actually like this.Why is it that rape is bad when its a woman and a man, but not when its a man and a man? shows like this further push the false narrative that gay men and hypersexual abusers. Its amazing to think that this was even able to be a manga, let alone get the budget to be an anime....And the worst part is tat the 11 and 12 year ""fujoshis"" watching this will think rape is okay and normal! Stories like love stage dont help, being so forgiving of its sexual harrasment nature. And the worst part is tat the 11 and 12 year ""fujoshis"" watching this will think rape is okay and normal! Stories like love stage dont help, being so forgiving of its sexual harrasment nature.', ""Okay, so I didn't totally hate watching this anime, which is probably why it got a 6 instead of a 4 or 5.The story isn't all that great. I will say that the overall storyline of overcoming the strangeness of a first love was nice to watch, but other than that, it was kind of a flop. For one, it was way too rushed. I've read the manga as well, and the anime basically just shoves pieces of a handful of chapters together without focusing on any of them. You'll get episodes without a theme or plot points that don't get enough elaboration. The...technical side of this anime's storytelling was terrible. The actual story, ignoring the near-rape trope, wasn't too bad. Had it been expanded on and given more depth and realism, it could've been a pretty good story.I did still enjoy it well enough, though. The art, actually, is the element that I would give the highest marks to. The lighting effects especially were very beautiful. A lot of the time, the environments were very bland, but when the anime wanted to nail a luminescent landscape, it did.The characters were your average, stock characters that you'll see in any yaoi: the one who initiates the romance with way too much force and the one who isn't exactly into it at first. That being said, the characters also weren't awful. The voice acting, while cringy at times, was still very entertaining and funny to listen to. I think the humor that the characters brought to the table hit the mark more often than not.Overall, the quality of this anime isn't very present, however, it's still a decent anime to watch if you want to watch something cute and funny. Don't come to this anime for a top notch yaoi. Just come for something to zone out with. technical side of this anime's storytelling was terrible.

The art, actually, is the element that I would give the highest marks to. The lighting effects especially were very beautiful. A lot of the time, the environments were very bland, but when the anime wanted to nail a luminescent landscape, it did.The characters were your average, stock characters that you'll see in any yaoi: the one who initiates the romance with way too much force and the one who isn't exactly into it at first. That being said, the characters also weren't awful. The voice acting, while cringy at times, was still very entertaining and funny to listen to. I think the humor that the characters brought to the table hit the mark more often than not.Overall, the quality of this anime isn't very present, however, it's still a decent anime to watch if you want to watch something cute and funny. Don't come to this anime for a top notch yaoi. Just come for something to zone out with."", '2019 UPDATE: im not a fujoshi no more lol.I\'m a normal fujoshi, i like BL with or without a little lewd in it, but this one seems to be  just another hardcore fujoshi\'s BL fantasy,DAKAICHI follows the story of Saijou Takato and Azumaya Junta two actors who become more of lovers as the story progresses, now, is it good? is it a good BL anime with decent characters and a good story? well...no not reallyStory:Saijou Takato won 5 years in a row as the \'Most Huggable Man\' or \'The Most Sexiest Man Of The Year\' but this time he came in number 2, going...at number 1 is Azumaya Junta a new actor that came to work with Takato, so at the office Junta is being introduced to everyone and when they finished Junta runs up to Takato to tell him how thrilled he is to be working with him since he started to idolized Takato when they worked on a drama together last year, the whole gang decides to go to the bar as Junta asks Takato for some advice on being an actor then the next scene we see Takato in Junta\'s Apartment fully nude, we than descover that takato became drunk and Junta carried him here, (he also paied Takato 1,000 yen so he can say he\'s first name) Junta showed him clips that he record of him being drunk and Takato gets worried that he may use that on him, so Takato asks Junta what he wants and he\'ll do anything Junta says for him to delete the footage, Junta than sexual assaults Takato, Takato tries to run away, Junta catches him, Takato backs him off, barricades him in the bathroom and sits on the couch with a blanket on him...and thats the first 10 mins of the frist episode, from then every episode goes like this: acting/talking scene -> sexual assault scene -> acting/talking scene -> sexual assault scene -> acting/talking scene -> ending credits, thats mostly how each episode seems to go,Characters:Saijou Takato - A veteran actor with 20 years of experience in the entertainment industry, he\'s basically the shy guy in the anime who kinda wants to have sex but doesn\'t admit to it becuz its a yaoi there\'s at least one character like that in each yaoi.Azumaya Junta - Up and coming actor with 3 years experience in the entertainment industry, so basically he sexually assaults Takato every episode, he started doing this all becuz Takato didn\'t want the clips Jutan record of him in the bar to go to the public so he said he\'ll do anything he wants, but i guess aside from that he\'s a nice guy whos trying his best.Chihiro Ayagi - Chihiro gets introduced in the beginning of episode 5, from then we see a women named Reiko bring him coffee in bed she\'s the Venus Inc., Owner, and Chihiro doesn\'t seem to care much about her, so later in episode 5 Takato gets drunk and knocks out, and Chihiro takes him back to he\'s place, strips him and gets on top of him annnndddd you know where this is going.Art:ngl the art is really nice to look like, the character designs look really nice and the background art is really beautiful, not much i can say here, art is nice moving on.Sound:The Opening and Ending songs are catchy, and the voice actors did a good job voicing the characters, the background music is decent and that\'s all i gotta say about this.Overall, DAKAICHI is not really a good anime, i mean the title in English is literally ""DAKAICHI -I\'m being harassed by the sexiest man of the year-"" so you already know what you\'re getting yourself into by watching it,would i recommend?

I\'m not a fudanshi or anything like that, although I\'m aware that many BL anime tend to be written by cis women to appeal to fujoshis, who often have fetishes for homoerotic relationships. But that doesn\'t mean that every BL anime needs to rely on that, living off fanservice and cheap clichés.This anime is nothing more than that: fanservice and cheap clichés. The animation is decent, and the story is somewhat interesting, but it\'s filled with fillers, and the plot is constantly interrupted by moments of sexual tension without much...context, or worse, by scenes designed for you to think, ""Look at all these cute guys together, how adorable,"" even though nothing there really makes much sense...TL;DR This is one of these anime written for horny fujoshis.

Hopefully whoever reads it may find it useful when deciding whether to watch Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu. Note that it is totally spoiler free ^^~STORY~Firstly, I would like to talk about the story.Saijou Takato is a well known actor who has held the first place as the most wanted celebrity aka desirable man for five consecutive years. All of this changes when a newly rising actor, Azumaya Junta manages to steal his place....While the plot isn\'t something out of the ordinary, the way it is executed makes the story interesting. One of the things I enjoyed the most while watching it is that there aren\'t any major conflicts that drag along for several episodes. Light-hearted, with bits of comical scenes, I would often find myself smiling at the screen.~ART~The art is nothing too fancy, still, I think it suits the story and I don\'t have any important complain about it. If I had to be picky, I would say the way the characters necks were shaded bothered me a bit since you could clearly see the shading lines, but again, seeing past that it\'s nothing too atrocious. I liked the characters designs overall, specially the feathers/wings detail they added to Junta to emphasize Takato\'s nickname on him ""Perverted Angel""~SOUND~I was taken a little aback by the opening, I was expecting a more catchy song, this one didn\'t stand out for me. I can\'t say the same about the ending which I found to be way more enjoyable, I specially liked seeing the characters dancing to the song. Although the ost wasn\'t that memorable as other anime, it fulfilled it\'s function.~CHARACTER~Ahh, were should I start? I already talked about the characters design, so I will focus more on their interactions and psychological aspects. Overall they felt to fit well in the story. Their actions weren\'t something out of the blue or none sense. I could understand why some acted the way they did, and they all seem to flow with the plot accordingly.There were some characters which were more memorable than others. For example I found the manager to be very funny, and some of the comments extras made on Junta and Takato relationship were hilarious.But the icing of the cake is totally Junta and Takato relationship; and here is what I think makes \'Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu\' different from other yaoi anime. It is common in this genre that rape is used as a plot device to develop a relationship between the main protagonists. In this anime, while their first encounter may have seemed like that, analyzing their previous scenes together, you can clearly see there was some kind of interest in Takato\'s part, and Junta has always admired and esteemed him grately so he wouldn\'t do anything to hurt his favorite person in any way. As the episodes progressed, so did their relationship; Takato and Junta moments were so wholesome, I would often find myself smiling at how cute their interactions were.And let\'s not forget the steamy scenes, while they were toned down to make the anime more appropriate for airing on tv, I would say there was somehow some kind of erotism in the way they were portrayed. I was quite happy with how they chose to censor it; cutting in the right angles, showing but not showing at al, the result was interesting, thanks god no awkward pink smoke, flashlight or impossible positions just for the sake of it.~OVERALL~In conclusion, if you are looking for a light-hearted anime that portrays a fluffy-hot relationship between male characters, that it doesn\'t feel forced and you can actually see it progress through the episodes, then I think you will grately come to enjoy this anime!On the other hand, if you came looking for a complicated, drama filled, forced relationship where the uke\'s feelings aren\'t taken into consideration at all, then this may not be your cup of coffee.

As an anime, the series isn't very enjoyable because it can't follow the formula of the manga. The manga is almost entirely sex ...each chapter has gratuitous sex scenes that make up the majority of the plot. Takato and Junta aren't particularly compelling characters but when they were boning their brains out in the manga, you didn't care.

I'm not looking for a porno, the manga was enough LOL but there's absolutely no substance to this series. The implied sex/fade to black is strange because the actual sex scenes in the manga take up so much space and so much of the characterization takes place there that the anime counterpart is hollow and at times nonsensical.There's no room for character development because this plot revolves around sex that actually isn't happening on screen in the anime. Here's the formula: Takato goes to work, Junta behaves strangely, Takato gets insecure about Junta's oddness, Junta reveals he's been holding back and or forces Takato to sleep with him, they sleep together and that's it. If the series actually does follow the manga's actual story, they have a bit to work with but I think it'll still feel out of place.Each episode is so painfully slow, boring and badly paced...I'll probably keep watching but it's a huge waste of time. Find a better BL series or read the manga. The one thing I'll give 'Dakaichi'' is that it's art style is pretty clean, the shading of their jaws are interesting and the main characters don't have massive hands and exaggerated features.

The reason i\'m bringing this up is because all of the uwu yaoi fangirls think anything is okay as long as it\'s mlm.

This is a perfect example of it, the title is literally ""I\'m being harassed by the sexiest  man of the year""honestly, if you actually enjoy this please see a therapist, bcs u are probably a yaoi fangirl that fetishizes mlm relationships, so do everyone a favor and see a therapist because no one cares. just get help. fetishize mlm.

Dreadful. A mistake. A waste of animation time.***May contain minor spoiler about 4th epsiode. Nothing major.The story follows a Stockholm syndrome esque development between the two main characters.Characters are bland and unlikable. Takato is our main boy, the number 1 huggable man. His stage personality is sweet and caring but behind the scenes, he’s foul mouthed and incredibly conscious of his position as the best. He’s also a tsundere. Junta, or “Chunta”, nicknamed by Takato, is a fan who admires and loves Takato to the brim. He’s seen by others as an innocent angel but he is forceful and horny in...front of Takato.

Tell me exactly what sort of healthy happy relationship start physically and with blackmail to boot? Can you call it mutual love when one person is clearly out of the power balance?This anime overall is the trope of all yaoi, a sub genre of BL. Basically it’s “gets forced, falls in love”. From my observation as a BL fan, most yaoi fans gobble up this sort of trope without question because they don’t know what a good story is. As long as it’s “gay”, amirite?Anyways, it seems the 3rd episode is the end of the intro arc, the 4th episode continues with a new arc with them busy with their own schedules, and although we get to see their different lives, it's the same repetitive tsundere Takato annd clingy desperate Junta.

Because it heavily romanticizes r*pe and sexual assault. Even if this anime was top tier(which it was not), that isn't something I can overlook.Story: Each episode within the series has a pattern. Some sort of drama -> sex -> missing each other/being horny -> more drama -> resolution/sex. The plot mostly revolves around their relationship and them going at each other like rabbits. The rest of it largely feels like an afterthought.Art, Sound, etc: I don't really have anything negative...to say about the art or sound.

Fun.Communicating during sex is difficult, and it can, of course, be difficult to depict consent sexily... but damn.

And the black-haired lead is easily manhandled and manipulated.Not worth your time, it's your average rape/SA-filled yaoi.If you want to know how the rest of the show goes, read the other reviews, I suppose. "", 'This is unexpectedly quite a nice light-hearted series focusing on actors with some amazing animation and music.The theme of this series in that it deals with loss of status and feeling replaced. Very apt resonating themes for people who are no longer getting a million likes on their social media, or are no longer the best thing in a highly critical, media glare always on you, high pressure areas like being an actor in the public eye like in this case.A great strength of the series is realistic bodies for people. There’s no balloon cleavage for ladies, no eight pact hench, frankly absurdly unrealistic...looks. Without sounding rude, it’s fantastic that the two leads have bodies the way they do but they’re still both considered very attractive, voted most huggable, and have remarkable acting careers based on their looks. They’re people, it’s who they are and that’s what they look like, it’s a great message that they can look like themselves and can be loved for that, exactly the way it should be.The series fully embraces the dive straight into it scenes. Context counts for a lot here, in Looney Toons or Tom and Jerry, yes technically it is awful when something like an anvil falls on a character, but it’s over the top to the point of being ridiculous: Looney Toons extreme violence = funny. Same lens applies here, supposedly the rough nature = fine to some people, some series are watched with this in mind expecting this fantasy type thing (key word fantasy). No it is definitely not right when acts are forced in the manga, but neither is it right to fire a giant rocket at a cartoon animal. In both scenarios there are different rules and these extreme acts are brushed off like nothing. They don’t roll with the punches, the punches don’t affect them at all, their constitutions are made of different qualities.If people are put off by the forceful nature of some incidents between the two guys here in this series, then they might find themselves disliking Looney Toons for ‘condoning’ extreme animal violence, in which case the point has clearly been missed. The lens looked through, what the purpose is here, and how they react to it is the focus.Bear in mind this could be a deconstruction of parts of the genre, the forced attempts, and people in the anime saying “oh look how close they are, isn’t it cute”, it isn’t in that sense. This series systematically embraces it but also offers a reflection of this fantasy aspect that is quite clever really.On one hand mature scenes should have been shown, other series explore human acts, though here the focus can be on other areas so people can see and enjoy everything that the anime is delivering.In any case, love that we get to get to see what makes both guys special, what their thoughts are and how they regard things, and that they know what they want and how to get it. Overall, they are good for one another in terms of emotion, that is what also should be focused on. They’re comfortable around one each other, they have dinner together, Junta waits for Takoto to memorize his acting lines. That they support one another and let them be themselves is what counts. The whole rough physical acts is just rough = ‘hot’, same as explosion on the Looney Toons character = ‘funny’. Most importantly, both guys are in control in that they’re not subdued by one another, each are and remain bosses in their overall conduct. They are not robbed of any power, indeed they help each other to greater heights such as in their interview cases, and those are just a few of the strengths of this relationship.Aside from the theme and people, the other best aspects are the music and animation especially. Considering the background, for some reason there was a preconception that this anime wouldn’t receive a heavy budget so was actually pleasantly surprised to see the stunning animation. The music as well, both are used very effectively for the comical moments in particular, these scenes are a very welcome foundation, the comedy perspective is better to have in response to losing prestige, which can initiate sheer dread for some people. Dakaichi offers that ultimately a perceived loss is no a big deal at all, just because someone’s better doesn’t stop you being great, being near the top is just as good. Of course with their relationship, some things matter more than others plain and simple. Sure the pinnacle and being at your zenith is nice and all, but who cares if it fades, so long as you have love it’s all good, eh.Honestly was thinking it’s excellent that this is being adapted, but was caught off guard by how spectacular it is which was rather lovely. In terms of animation, music and people, have to love that one of the best anime of the Fall 2018 season is this gem of a series, how brilliant is that? looks. Without sounding rude, it’s fantastic that the two leads have bodies the way they do but they’re still both considered very attractive, voted most huggable, and have remarkable acting careers based on their looks.

No it is definitely not right when acts are forced in the manga, but neither is it right to fire a giant rocket at a cartoon animal. In both scenarios there are different rules and these extreme acts are brushed off like nothing. They don’t roll with the punches, the punches don’t affect them at all, their constitutions are made of different qualities.If people are put off by the forceful nature of some incidents between the two guys here in this series, then they might find themselves disliking Looney Toons for ‘condoning’ extreme animal violence, in which case the point has clearly been missed. The lens looked through, what the purpose is here, and how they react to it is the focus.Bear in mind this could be a deconstruction of parts of the genre, the forced attempts, and people in the anime saying “oh look how close they are, isn’t it cute”, it isn’t in that sense. This series systematically embraces it but also offers a reflection of this fantasy aspect that is quite clever really.On one hand mature scenes should have been shown, other series explore human acts, though here the focus can be on other areas so people can see and enjoy everything that the anime is delivering.In any case, love that we get to get to see what makes both guys special, what their thoughts are and how they regard things, and that they know what they want and how to get it. Overall, they are good for one another in terms of emotion, that is what also should be focused on. They’re comfortable around one each other, they have dinner together, Junta waits for Takoto to memorize his acting lines. That they support one another and let them be themselves is what counts. The whole rough physical acts is just rough = ‘hot’, same as explosion on the Looney Toons character = ‘funny’. Most importantly, both guys are in control in that they’re not subdued by one another, each are and remain bosses in their overall conduct. They are not robbed of any power, indeed they help each other to greater heights such as in their interview cases, and those are just a few of the strengths of this relationship.Aside from the theme and people, the other best aspects are the music and animation especially. Considering the background, for some reason there was a preconception that this anime wouldn’t receive a heavy budget so was actually pleasantly surprised to see the stunning animation. The music as well, both are used very effectively for the comical moments in particular, these scenes are a very welcome foundation, the comedy perspective is better to have in response to losing prestige, which can initiate sheer dread for some people. Dakaichi offers that ultimately a perceived loss is no a big deal at all, just because someone’s better doesn’t stop you being great, being near the top is just as good. Of course with their relationship, some things matter more than others plain and simple. Sure the pinnacle and being at your zenith is nice and all, but who cares if it fades, so long as you have love it’s all good, eh.Honestly was thinking it’s excellent that this is being adapted, but was caught off guard by how spectacular it is which was rather lovely. In terms of animation, music and people, have to love that one of the best anime of the Fall 2018 season is this gem of a series, how brilliant is that?', ""Finally, now that I've seen enough of the anime I think this is a pretty good show. If you don't like BL or smut, don't bother with this anime as it's not for everyone.Story - 8So far the story focuses on these two actors in love with each other, at first it was pretty unrealistic but as you get further into the story they face real-life problems. And by real-life ones, I mean problems that idols will usually face in modern day Japan if they are involved in scandals. I find it interesting to see how it deals with certain situations, it seemed cliche...as heck at first but now I think I know why this got adapted. Anyway most BL doesn't focus on the reality, it's almost always fantasy and there's no consequences. I have to admit it was cringey at first and then I got used to the story.Art - 7The animation is actually decent for this anime, but sometimes the proportions of the characters bother me a bit and I feel that they could choose more unique character designs. I know they might have chosen this look because they wanted it to look like normal actors in Japan maybe. Either way it's still pretty good and I don't think it really impacted my enjoyment of the anime, and they did really well to express the mood of the story.Sound - 7The music is pretty good, I like the ED. Not a big fan of the OP but I think the music pretty much fits in with the story, just not that memorable for me. I actually kinda skipped the OP every time because I couldn't get past it without cringing, sorry to the fans of the OP...Character - 8I like both of the main characters. At first I didn't though because they seemed kinda shallow, but then as they got through more episodes I felt like Saijo actually had some more depth in his character.Enjoyment/Overall - 8Kinda combined this section since my overall would be based off enjoyment as well. I liked this series and it had more smut than most BL but I think that not everyone is fine with that, and that's ok. It really is aimed toward a specific audience so if you like BL then maybe you would like this, and I believe this anime is pretty consensual though I have heard the opposite about the manga. as heck at first but now I think I know why this got adapted.

I believe that this anime doesn\'t deserve to be call ""garbage"" or an ""stereotype"" I don\'t know what kind of anime of yaoi genre the people who writed the reviews saw, but I am certanly sure that this anime it\'s not that bad.Firts, this is not the typical story of every  yaoi OVA  where you can see just sex scenes without a real love story or romance, I think that dispite the fact that in the manga there is a lot of sex scenes the producers made a really good job...to present a different, enjoyable and for moments a funny boys love history.Second, the characters fits a lot with the personality of a real person and the storyline is not like the usual yaoi animes  without counting the fact that it shows you yhe real feelings of the two and from my side I could feel their true feelings trascending the screen, I could feel the love between this different persons (in a lot of senses) and thats its too much  for  a "" real fujoshi"".Third, the yaoi genre its coming out at the world of the Japan animation since a few years ago, so its very important if we want more animes like this or even better support this kind of storys with the sex scenes censured even if we don\'t like to do  it, due to if you enjoy the BL storys and you want it more in the future you have to be thankful to the fact that they produced it and they took the hard chance. Because of if all the fujoshis admit it: these is not the most rentable genre to produce.Finally, the story mantein you atrapp and there are enjoyable the pieces of comedy including the cute scenes, you can see a lot of kisses and for me it was enough even if they cut the sex scenes you can figure it out, we are not kids. The opening song at the begining doesn\'t liked me at all,  but for the four episode I found myself singing it and the same with the ending song I was following the dance of the characters with an a smile on my face.If you like the cute storys BL and you look this anime with a good predisposition you are gonna love it, just give it the chance!

I feel like the story brings something a little more fresh to the table. Though there are scenes that are very, interesting, I personally, do not mind them and it just makes me love the protags all the more. The backstory was also very sweet though I feel like there could be some more work used on it. Something I deffinetly enjoyed was the representation in episode 7. It's great that they don't make it all fan service, and that our main characters will have to overcome...struggles. struggles."", ""I have never finished any yaoi anime before because once things started getting rapey, I would immediately drop it. Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu, therefore, is the first yaoi anime that passed my preliminary evaluations.STORY:The first episode has that typically rapey vibe in yaoi, but thankfully, the anime didn't make it as explicit as in the source manga, which I checked out after finishing the series. In fact, for a yaoi anime, it doesn't focus on the sex that much. There's a lot of implied sex for sure, but the fact that it's only implied and not fully animated gives more emphasis to...the beautiful romance story underneath, which I really appreciate. Yaoi tend to have shallow plots, rushed storylines, and paper-thin characters, but not this one.Although Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu has a rather problematic fujoshi bait for the first episode, the rest of the story is really nice. So if you can get past episode 1, you definitely won't regret it. It's also really hilarious! Seeing Saijou put up with the insufferable Azumaya had me laughing a lot.Furthermore, there's care in how the two main characters are fleshed out. I especially like learning about Azumaya's backstory and the reason behind his attachment to Saijou.MUSIC: Definitely an A+++ on the background music.VOICE ACTING: Takato's voice actor is really good. How he could easily switch from Takato's cool and calm side to his cute and shy side made me wonder if he was one famous mainstream seiyuu.ANIMATION: If you plan to watch this for only the sex, then you'll be disappointed because the sex is never animated. There are, however, plenty of erotic kisses and foreplay. If you want to see the characters fuck, then go read the manga afterwards. the beautiful romance story underneath, which I really appreciate.

If yaoi/BL/shounen-ai isn\'t your normal thing, stick around-- this review is aimed at you.I\'ve seem my fair share of this genre, but I\'ve yet to figure out what makes it so addicting. Throughout this show, (mostly in the first couple episodes) I was very much concerned about the rapey vibes. If you can take it for a few episodes thought, the rest of the story does get considerably better despite the beginning being questionable. And before you ask, yes, there is a hell lot of implied (or nearly explicitly shown) sex in this series. It\'s not even...meant to further the plot in any way, it\'s just fan service for the fujioshis and fudanshis. Was it still entertaining? Hell yah. Overall, not a strong storyline, but enough that it\'s not just a softcore porno compilation. The ending really makes up for it!I\'ve seen a lot of complaints about the animation, and I do agree, in some places, it does seem undone, but I think that\'s a fault of the budget. There are more than a couple stills and some awkward movements here and there, but overall, I was very pleased with the consistency and realisticness of the body proportions and sizes, as well as how attractive they made sure to make the characters always look. Some scenes there was clearly more money spent on (Takato\'s play, the Christmas episode) which looked amazing overall.The opening and closing scores honestly weren\'t my fave. I can see the appeal, but they bored me overall. The background music was honestly forgettable, especially since there were little to no scenes with silence where you could just hear the music. The voice actors did an outstanding job though.I\'m going to be honest, Junta was a little terrifying throughout the series. He was a little crazy, a stalker, forceful, pretty rapey-- you name it. However, he\'s obviously not the one who kept me here. I came and stayed for Takato, who\'s such a sweetheart. I loved seeing him grow throughout the show which still retaining the underlying principles of his character. Also, for being the \'uke\' I\'m SO glad that he didn\'t spend his time being helpless and crying. He was a strong character with resolve and a certain aspect of badassery to him that I adored. What a cutie too <3Overall, I\'m almost ashamed to say that I enjoyed this as much as I did. It was fun to binge, made me fangirl despite my moral compass, and I laughed a lot (1000 yen anyone?) and died a lot. There were many times that I just plain out yelled ""FUCK NO"" at the screen and died inside. So yeah, there\'s that.I would recommend this if you: like the traditional seme/uke dynamic, like forcefulish couples, like repetitive/frequent sex scenes, like love triangles, like love drama, like the idea of secret celebrity relationshipsI would NOT recommend this if you: are expecting a realistic portrayal of gay men or celebrities, are looking for a pure romance (starts off rapey, I\'m warning you, even though it gets shippable later on), are annoyed by love triangles, hate harems/everyone being in love with the main characters, don\'t like \'showbiz\' anime, don\'t like heteronormative stereotypes in your romancesHave a great day everyone! meant to further the plot in any way, it\'s just fan service for the fujioshis and fudanshis.

The glorification of rape in this anime is beyond appalling, and I know that BL is traditionally not supposed to reflect real gay people, but unfortunately it does when this is the exposure that people get. Normal gay people have normal loving relationships and it's offensive that this paints gay people as literal rapists and its fine because the victim falls in love with the abuser in the end. Not for me. I would give this a zero if I could. "", ""I've only watched 4 episodes and I feel like I can't watch anymore bc almost every moment of this anime is painful to watch.Ok so the the anime is pretty much about sex, which is understandable bc the manga is about sex, but what I don't get is why would you make an anime about sex in the first place when you can't even show any of it?? Not saying that you can't make a good anime about sex but this is definitely not the way to do it. This would probably work much better as an OVA or a god damn hentai.I'm all...about that cute fluff and I don't really have a problem with smut if it's accompanied by good characters and a good plot. But like 90% of the time it was about sex with really shitty drama and characters, so there's almost nothing enjoyable left for me.The only things I liked was the animation and music.This anime really isn't my cup of tea but if you like hot boys doing hot (kinda messed up) stuff it might be yours??

And we didn't even see them fuck lol (coz it's censored, y'all)”–and that was my first ever comment about this anime when I decided to give up after 4 episodes and gave it 3 stars last year.I wrote nasty things about this anime under the comment section of my personal anime list, such as “bad characters who are good for nothing but as wank materials” or that the relationship development is “partially rape” and that “the plot sucks so bad. Nothing special. No bigger plot for the both of them”.A year...later, I went through my dropped list and decided to finish all series that has only 12 or so episodes–and that includes Dakaretai Otoko. I mean, I already went a third of the way, so why not torture myself and finish it all? So I did.I rewatched episode 1-4 and they are STILL bad. My initial reaction stands: insta-love, (almost) non-con sex, cardboard cutout characters... and everything bad that made me remember why I dropped it in the first place.Episode 5 & 6, albeit better, didn't turn me into a supporter. But episode 7... now this is where my perspective of this anime changed slightly. What I was hoping so badly in the first few episodes (character depth, strong reasoning & plot, as well as feelings), the production team decided to reveal them on episode 7 instead. Mind you, it wasn’t ground breaking per se–but it is what the anime desperately lacks in previous episodes. Without spoiling anything, I also really love the stylistic choice of achromatic look in the episode and how it changed to signify a big turning point in the characters’ life.The plot got better and it ended in a (quite) delightful, witty end that justifies the horrible means that have been presented to the viewers throughout earlier episodes… and that’s why I changed my rating of this anime from 3 to 6.People might critique me that if a good plot is what I’m looking for, I shouldn’t be looking at yaoi animes. But damn, if some hot scenes are the only thing you’re looking for, you shouldn’t be watching Dakaretai Otoko either because, as I said in the very beginning, they don’t even show the sex. This is why I think they could’ve done better in the plot department since they omit the hot scenes.That being said, I got curious with the source material and wanted to know if this problem actually persists from the source or is it exclusive to the adaptation. Well, thank God I started with the anime and not the manga because just 1 chapter in, it’s all RED FLAGS. And yup, apparently the problem was rooted from the source, where they emphasized the hot actions more than the plot. So when the anime adapted it and decided to omit the explicit scenes… they’re only left with the mediocre plot and not much else.All in all, how does Dakaretai Otoko the anime compared to other yaoi animes? I’d say it’s just the same. It suffers from the typical problem that others have and did not bring anything new to the table. But with how scarce the table is, being average can still be considered a compliment. later, I went through my dropped list and decided to finish all series that has only 12 or so episodes–and that includes Dakaretai Otoko.

However, the mixes are too predictable, and the characters just too shallow for that to succeed in making them interesting. The story is practically non-existent in four episodes, which would be forgiveable if at least we got something else instead of that. The problem is: we don\'t. The fanservice/ship scenes sometimes smell of the sweat of effort they must have made...to fill up the time allotted for an episode - and that\'s despite the fact that they\'re also painful clichés. And the sex scenes... Well, they are like the story. Personally, I never like censorship, if something wants to go there, let it go there, that\'s why we have ratings; but fine, laws and regulations. So I should be happy it\'s not a thing here... And yet I\'m not, since the reason for that is the complete omission of actual sex scenes. Something\'s shown to start, something\'s hinted at, but we never actually get to see anything more than a kiss. Which, for something that\'s supposed to be porn, makes no sense.And so we\'re left with shiny bubbles that burst all too easily and then there\'s nothing left. It\'s unfortunate, because all these bubbles bursting only serves to make the banal clichés and stereotypes all the more painful in their raw bareness: not only the character traits, but also the situations and interactions between them. Takato calling Junta a ""horny angel"" would perhaps be funny, if it wasn\'t so damn literal: angel wings actually pop out from his back and feathers float across the screen in every appropriate scene, and then the next minute he\'s a hormonal teenager huffing through his nose as he attacks Takato like a predator does its prey. And Takato is the average tsundere: acting all annoyed and ""professional"" in public, and ""failing to resist"" Junta the moment they\'re in private and actually being annoyed at him when Junta ignores him. In between these scenes, Takato\'s inner monologoues and observations are, more often than not, very meta, and as such they\'re also very painful: lines such as ""what terrible acting"" and ""what kind of cheap porno is this?"" are simply too heavy here, considering the generic shallowness, instead of working as funny through-the-4th-wall quips as they might be intended.On the positive side: the sceneries and cityscapes are pretty enough, the characters as well as the environments are nicely drawn and styled; the voice acting is also decent at least, I suppose. But then again, both of these are rather defaults than anything we\'re usually surprised by in anime, and sadly it\'s just not enough to redeem DakaIchi. The third episode ended on such an appropriate note and in such an appropriate way for it to be the actual end of the anime - it would have been acceptable. It wasn\'t, though, and while I managed to suffer through ep4, having started ep5 I couldn\'t go on after the first scene change. It felt too much like wasting time basically just to be bored at best and annoyed at worst.It is a shame: there\'s a definite lack of yaoi/bl/shounenai/gay/whateveryouwannacallit anime out there, which is extremely baffling, and gets even more baffling the more one dives into the ""straight"" side and sees the immense amount of everything it has. So everything that happens on this side of the fence should be a reason to party, so to say, but DakaIchi proves that being yaoi just for the sake of being yaoi simply does not cut it. to fill up the time allotted for an episode - and that\'s despite the fact that they\'re also painful clichés.

It felt too much like wasting time basically just to be bored at best and annoyed at worst.It is a shame: there\'s a definite lack of yaoi/bl/shounenai/gay/whateveryouwannacallit anime out there, which is extremely baffling, and gets even more baffling the more one dives into the ""straight"" side and sees the immense amount of everything it has. So everything that happens on this side of the fence should be a reason to party, so to say, but DakaIchi proves that being yaoi just for the sake of being yaoi simply does not cut it.', ""While I could go on about BL tropes and how they play out in this anime, I'll put it aside as there's already plenty of reviews out there about this topic.Instead, I want to focus on the main reason why the score went so low for me, despite looking forward to watching the movie afterwards. The animation was all over the place, sometimes it was beautiful and polished, others it looked even worse than the later seasons of 7 Deadly Sins (especially the weird shadow under their chins and the even weirder proportions in some scenes). I'm not sure if the studio was cutting corners...or if they didn't have enough time to finish everything with the same polish, but it really pulled you out of whatever was going on since the art itself was that bad.I really hope the movie will get better treatment and that the animation/art style will be more concise this time around, if it had been more consistent for this anime I would have given it a 7 instead of a 6.Also a small side note that personally annoyed me but might not annoy all, they always shyed away from the sex scenes which I don't personally mind. However they always started the scenes as if they were going to fully comit to them and cutting off in weird sections leading to pacing issues. I'd rather they either faded to black at the right time or just comited to showing the full scene. Stopping somewhere in the middle didn't really leave anyone satisfied, I don't think. or if they didn't have enough time to finish everything with the same polish, but it really pulled you out of whatever was going on since the art itself was that bad.I really hope the movie will get better treatment and that the animation/art style will be more concise this time around, if it had been more consistent for this anime I would have given it a 7 instead of a 6.Also a small side note that personally annoyed me but might not annoy all, they always shyed away from the sex scenes which I don't personally mind.

In the manga, Junta...straight up r*pes Takato, but they did soften it a bit for the anime.

It would have had more impact had the middle couple of episodes, where we learn why Junta had his slightly creepy obsession with Takato, was at the beginning, so we had a firmer grasp of these characters and why they acted the way they did. It was just jarring to start off the series with Junta begging Takato to have sex with him, with no idea as to why or where it was coming from.

These types of...series\' are not meant to be enjoyed because of their intricate plots or their ability to provoke mental stimulation, therefore it wouldn\'t be fair to judge the series on those merits.

Takato goes from being mildly traumatized and makes efforts to escape Junta\'s efforts, but then is actually just in love with him? None of it made any logical sense.

I\'m not an anime reviewer, I barely even watch anime anymore, but here\'s my two cents.Many people say that the story is mediocre, and I don\'t deny that it\'s not groundbreaking in any way, shape, or form. It has a typical shounen ai story, in the same way that slice of life shows have their own type...of typical story. However, what sets the story apart in this show for me is that the storylines don\'t drag on. In a usual yaoi show, there\'s always a million misunderstandings that lead to the dramatic situations, but usually they\'re dragged on for several episodes until you\'re sick of them. In this show, everything is solved within the 20 minute timeslot.I adore the characters in this show. Again, nothing groundbreaking. The uke wants to be fucked by everyone that meets him, but that actually makes sense in the context of the shows story. He\'s not a plain guy, he\'s a well known actor and ""most huggable"" five years running. The side characters are few and far between, which I appreciate, because 13 episode shows with a large cast are just confusing. Every character in this show had their own personality quirks, and I found myself really enjoying watching them all interact. (I\'m hoping for a season two so I can find out who the fuck that red haired boy was, though.)The show\'s really good. For a shounen ai, it\'s superb. It\'s definitely on par with Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi, if that means anything to you. If you don\'t enjoy this show after three episodes, though, you won\'t enjoy the rest. So just implement that rule and you\'ll be golden. of typical story. However, what sets the story apart in this show for me is that the storylines don\'t drag on.

It's actually decent for a BL anime, as most of them are cringey AF.The protagonist is quite likeable because he's portrayed as self-assured, capable, and pretty much solid. He's got talent, works hard and receives acknowledgement and respect from his peers. He's just new to the whole dating/sexing thing, but he's not naive either.There's more of a storyline and character development as you go further down the line, which makes it more interesting. I mean none of it is groundbreaking of course, but it's more than I'd expect from BL as a genre.All...in all, it's an ok watch and I'm enjoying it more than I'd like to admit. in all, it's an ok watch and I'm enjoying it more than I'd like to admit."", ""Ok, this was my first BL anime that I had ever watched. To sum it up, it was bad. The characters weren't bad, I guess. I couldn't grasp Takato's personality very well, but the others were quite distinct. The absolutely disgusting thing about them is the blatant sexual assault in the first few episodes. It is very clearly non-consensual but it's just played off?? Like, I understand that it won't be super progressive cuz anime or whatever, but seriously? Also, it started getting boring so I had to skip a few episodes. The only actual good thing about this was the editing. It was very...cute. cute."", ""It is initially problematic, I have to admit.This culture of harassment =are wrongly common to most anime and manga of Boys Love. It is prevalent to the extent that it is normalized and a pre-requirement content to capture a larger demographics of audience, or else, your product will flop. Dakaichi is not an exception to this strange phenomenon.I cannot overlook with the fact that they started at a wrong phase. Junta aggressively pushed his lust towards Takato as he has been long admiring him, and now he had the opportunity. Yes, it's an anime, so basically there are points that it romanticized the moral errors,...and it could be a tendency where some audience would find it 'cute', somehow. Imagine, replacing the main characters with other ordinary people out there, it would surely be a backlash. Every thing that is produced in silver screens or televisions, they uphold certain ideologies that influence our mental mechanisms of viewing the world. So in this case, if the audience sees the harassment as an avenue of capturing romance to a person, well, that would be complicated.Well, the industry is always after the capitalization of people's interests. As long as it gives great number of sales, then it would be the subject of their selling. I hope we can evolve from this petty fetish and weird patronization. We can do better than this.Nonetheless, it is just the exposition of the story, but other else have fluttered my heart to its cuteness and enjoyability.  The chemistry of the Takato and Junta is a great complementary, the prideful and composed former most handsome man matched with the new title holder who is sex-hungered driven from his admiration, it's an interesting characterization.Unlike other BL contents that I have read and watched, although it has several enthralling and stimulating smut scenes with good animation and a quality-arousing sound arrangement and dubbing (oh thank you for the ASMR!), but still it did not overlook the true essence of romance. The main couple's love progressed smoothly and is given with good story writing that is not rushed and not sounding pushed for a season with 13 episodes.To sum it all, it is adequately romantic, heart-warmingly fluffy, and with a charismatic characters that foster great chemistry as they jive together. Despite of the initial problem, the anime was still able to embody the core of Boys Love with quality and great merits.This anime is best enjoyed if you are not too critical with the introduced issue, and also for those who are looking for something to explore in the world of Boys Love. and it could be a tendency where some audience would find it 'cute', somehow.

Like ow Chunta thought Takato cheated on him when they really werent even dating- Also they storyline wasnt to bad the character design was okay as well. Another thing that makes this anime a meh for me is the sex of course. If you have read the manga, which if you dont like it that much like me I can understand, lol that manga ha so many sex scenes. Like bro I feel bad for Takato. But overall like i said everything else was okay In my opinion...I just think they should have narrowed down so many fucking sex scenes you know? I just think they should have narrowed down so many fucking sex scenes you know?', ""I got hooked in the first episode itself and finished this one in just about 4 hours and re-watched it again from the start because i just couldn't resist myself.Takato for me is the most relatable character i have ever met in my life. i just get him and his reasonings to the point that i now understand why i acted the way i did in my life. the way he struggles to express his feelings, his natural instinct to act indifferent in situations to avoid being vulnerable. and just how he much he is willing to give up just so u can protect the...person you care about the most and how he just plays tough even tho everyone around him knows that he is struggling..... i can go on like this forever. im so grateful for cloveworks for this piece of art.This is much more than your regular bl anime. its not just about two men and the chemistry between them, but about their career and the decisions you make in life and your passion and the importance if it all in being happy and well. person you care about the most and how he just plays tough even tho everyone around him knows that he is struggling..... i can go on like this forever. im so grateful for cloveworks for this piece of art.This is much more than your regular bl anime. its not just about two men and the chemistry between them, but about their career and the decisions you make in life and your passion and the importance if it all in being happy and well."", 'This anime was horrible. This anime revolves around this guy being a rapist. It’s too normalized in this show. The characters are unlikeable, the character design is just so weird. I hate our main character who doesn’t figure that the man is a psychopath. I don’t care about the sex scenes, their is zero romance, just a guy nearly getting raped by this stalker. I’m glad this anime did not run for too long because the rape and stalking is just romanticized and i find that to be gross. Do not watch if you are looking for real romance, good story, smooth and enjoyable animation...this isn’t it. this isn’t it.', 'As a lot of shounen ai is, the story was shallow and unpredictable. I went into this hoping for a cute love story between two actors probably having to hide their relationship and deal with temporary societal homophobia before enduring and persevering together, seeing as male love in anime is often like that, sadly.But really I was just uncomfortable with the amount of times Azumaya, the seme, just forced himself on the uke, Takato despite how much he refused and even tried to push him away.The borderline rape? In this anime really just put me off and had me waiting for the scene to...move on.Sure, there may have been some cute “doki doki~” type scenes but that was quickly pushed aside because of how horny Azumaya was. Like, I get that that was kind of his character but damn.Anyway, I guess I just want to see a shounen ai with real emotion and proper consent?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ move on.Sure, there may have been some cute “doki doki~” type scenes but that was quickly pushed aside because of how horny Azumaya was.

You don\'t have to make just one.""Stealing a line from another review here to sum up something straight off the bat: "" ""Do people think gay relationships are like this?"" Firstly no, not everyone does, it\'s just something to excite the mind.""It\'s just something to excite the mind. And I think that covers this anime perfectly.Obviously, in real life, we can look objectively at this show. It\'s not healthy. Junta almost rapes Takato in the first episode (They do have sex, yes, but it\'s with Takato\'s consent /in the anime at least, the manga is another story/). And in...a later episode, another character pretends he does rape Takato because of ""plot"". But this isn\'t real life. And those who are old enough to watch this show should understand the difference between a form of media and a real experience.It takes a show business setting, which I enjoy, and a tsundere uke and a borderline yandere seme. He never crosses that bridge because Takato is firm with him, but you can see Junta\'s desire just bubbling below the surface the whole time, barely repressed with fresh mints.There\'s no explicit scenes in this, and I think the show benefits from it. It obviously doesn\'t shy away from intimacy between the characters, and I believe the two episodes (7 and 9) which show the perspectives of how they both met and their feelings are by far the best in the series because they really delve into their love without being being overtly sexual or queer-baiting.That being said, it isn\'t anything new. The show business setting is the reason this show stays afloat. The drama happening because they\'re actors and ""will they get caught"" is the driving force behind my interest in this show. They relationship was nothing impressive. It was just the Uke yelling at the Seme to stop touching him and that he *definitely* wasn\'t in love with him, despite the fact we all knew he was.But it was a fun romp. It was like Love Stage, with better animation and without the annoying Lala Lulu character. It had serious moments and there were moments I seriously felt like crying for the uke Takato. So the show did something right in order to make me empathise with that.***THIS ENTIRE REIVEW BEING SAID*** - My opinion could very harshly change about this show and their relationship based on the soon-to-be-released Spain Arc movie. For those of you who know the scene in chapter 25, you know what I mean. I hope they change it from the manga accordingly like they did in the first episode. And if they don\'t, I *really* hope there\'s a damn good reason and character development behind it. Because this whole show could fall apart if they handle that scene as indelicately as the manga. a later episode, another character pretends he does rape Takato because of ""plot"".

From what I saw, it actually looked like a good show to watch...yet it dissapointed me.It starts with quite an easy setting: A handsome man of the month found out that his position has been taken and now he is numer 2 in some sort of a magazine. It turnes out that he has to share his role in a new movie with his 'rival' he gets drunk and unwillingly dragged into man's apartment, wher he gets f***ed.

As a fan myself, this title only piqued my interest after I\'d seen the Shounen-Ai tag, that and the fact that I\'d read the manga a year before.As I\'ve already highlighted, Dakaichi is a Shounen-Ai anime, and so the plot, the main characters are all quite uninspired, not because of the tag, no, but because of the way most authors of the genre go about writing them. There\'s nothing wrong with creating a BL adaptation of any sort, I\'d watch all the ones out there (trying), but...isn\'t there a time when you get absolutely sick of the same ideas being recycled till there\'s nothing left but more garbage and less authenticism (not a word, I know). Observe; Junta ""snatches away the No. 1 most huggable position"", yes, we hear plenty of Takato\'s jealousy and outrage, but what does the man himself say on the matter? No, Junta\'s fate is doomed. Because he is the seme, his one track mind has fastened on its target, and he is NOT letting go. So, you can imagine, his love for Takato know no bounds and whatnot, and that immediately rules him out as an interesting character. His antics are predictable, save for the chilly moment he turns away from his love and sets him free.. only to have him running back. that was out of character, but about the only time so far.Now, that leaves us Takato, our MC. He also settles into the role ""typical uke"" lewd but protests too much, afraid to succumb to his sexuality (I will admit, he would have been straight if the ML didn\'t come along) and also has a knack for repeating the same reactions in the different interactions he and Junta have.Bland would be a very accurate term to describe the characters- and story.The art and sound are very well done, quite undeserving compared to the plot, with the op theme song being quite catchy, but I have to say, the art does lag at times, what with this one scene where one character exclaims, ""Junta\'s an angel!"" but then you see that right behind him theres another character of similar design. Not it\'s fault for following the manga, but still.As a whole, it makes for one cringey mess, though the fact that it doesn\'t try to be more might be charming in and of it\'s self, for me, well, it might have been, but I\'m more into seke, doesn\'t stop me form still watching though. isn\'t there a time when you get absolutely sick of the same ideas being recycled till there\'s nothing left but more garbage and less authenticism (not a word, I know).

And they claim its love?Story is nothing special either, its as ordinary as it gets for a show tbhThe music isnt bad either but like I skip through it most of the timeHowever, props to the anime for the animation as I felt the characters were...really pretty lol, the visuals and the setting werent bad eitherI have watched about half and Im not sure if I should continue really pretty lol, the visuals and the setting werent bad eitherI have watched about half and Im not sure if I should continue', 'It\'s not the most horrendous anime, but it\'s just bad and boring-- and not the ""turn your brain off"" kind of stupid, but like actually dumb. There\'s just literally nothing of value here. So many red flags were ignored and even played as something normal and \'cute\'; almost every sexual encounter the two characters have, the black haired one (i don\'t remember his name) usually said ""no"" and tried to push the other one off of him, and while something like that can be a kink, it needs to be done between two people who both clearly want it and have discussed about it, and...yet it seems like the blond haired man just pushes until the other agrees.

I had to spare myself the trouble of finishing this and just drop it because I don\'t want to waste my time with something like this.If you like relationships where the other one basically r*pes the other; where the whole relationship is just one pushing for sex while the other tries to decline yet isn\'t listened to, then I guess you\'ll enjoy this.

This is where I have usually dropped/lost interest in the show but luckily this show is not one of those. The Drama Arc happened basically at the finale of the show (with the last episode feeling like a OVA) the Drama Arc did a great job of making sure the audience had no doubts about this romance, and really showed how serious and how devoted our characters are.Story- Super generic romance, except a little extreme on the fanservice. At first the relationship seems pretty rapey and that kinda got to me during the first few episodes but it feels alot more genuine after this and ends up being a super heartwarming relationship.Character design/Art-Fine, the characters look good and I never felt that the art took away from anything.Sound- The music and sound effects were standard, a few moments I was taken out of it due to the sound quality (but I am also streaming it on certain sites so who knows how much of that was the shows fault).Enjoyment- This was one of those shows that was just insanely enjoyable, I just watched every episode and enjoyed it alot.

This came up a few times in recommendations so I thought I would give it a go.It's a bit of a mixed bag to be honest.I enjoyed it. Kind of. The good bits were fun and I really liked Takato from the main pairing. BUT!It falls into the usual BL/Yaoi traps that are just icky. The relationship starts off bad. Improves. Goes terrible. Improves and ends up rather cute. But the bad makes a major impact on my final score. It could have been done so much better. It certainly had...enough episodes to do it but a couple of times it went way too deep into dubcon territory. The first sexual encounter with Takato and Junta was awful. Straight up molestation. And not the first time either. When it was consenting, despite the censoring it was pretty hot. It worked out in the end, but left a slightly sour taste to the relationship. If you can get past the dub con parts, there are funny scenes and enjoyable characters. Just don't expect it to change the wheel in terms of Yaoi expectations.Story: 6Points mostly for the world building. It's standard yaoi romance with a nice bit of detail on the business the characters were involved it. Nothing stand out though.Characters: 6Most of that score is for Takato and some of the minor characters. Takato is a complex character. Tough on the outside, adorable when his guard is down. But a bit of a push over. If it wasn't for him I would have dropped this in all honesty.Junta is more of a miss then a hit. He can be adorable and I love the little animation details with the feathers. BUT and it is a massive BUT he crosses the line way too many times for my liking. He has practically zero concept of boundaries.There are plenty of minor characters with varying success.Animation: 6Clean and nice little details here and there. A touch ropey in places like in one scene it was clearly a missed step in the animation. But it's servicable.Additional Spoilers:The dubcon is pretty obvious and not just one character but at least three are guilty of it. Chihiro's entire introduction episode was creepy and cruel and almost caused me to drop the show. Worse still was the victim blaming in the episode by Junta towards Takato. Basically blaming him for the assault then essentially assaulting Takato himself. And the anime just shrugs it off and makes out Chihiro isn't that bad of a guy through the remainder. Then another character makes a random assault that adds NOTHING to the story or the characters. It's just there because apparently dubcon is sexy. enough episodes to do it but a couple of times it went way too deep into dubcon territory.

Nothing stand out though.Characters: 6Most of that score is for Takato and some of the minor characters. Takato is a complex character. Tough on the outside, adorable when his guard is down. But a bit of a push over. If it wasn't for him I would have dropped this in all honesty.Junta is more of a miss then a hit. He can be adorable and I love the little animation details with the feathers. BUT and it is a massive BUT he crosses the line way too many times for my liking. He has practically zero concept of boundaries.There are plenty of minor characters with varying success.Animation: 6Clean and nice little details here and there. A touch ropey in places like in one scene it was clearly a missed step in the animation. But it's servicable.Additional Spoilers:The dubcon is pretty obvious and not just one character but at least three are guilty of it. Chihiro's entire introduction episode was creepy and cruel and almost caused me to drop the show. Worse still was the victim blaming in the episode by Junta towards Takato. Basically blaming him for the assault then essentially assaulting Takato himself. And the anime just shrugs it off and makes out Chihiro isn't that bad of a guy through the remainder. Then another character makes a random assault that adds NOTHING to the story or the characters. It's just there because apparently dubcon is sexy."", '****************Spoiler free review*******************-Awesome if you like this genre (if not, don\'t waste your time)-Happiness-Writing this because the anime is really good in my opinion.-I rewatched this once or twice every year that\'s just how good this is.Story(8)This is about an actor named Takato Saijou who met a fellow actor Azumaya Junta while filming. They fell in love due to some things which make the story very real and interesting. Definitely, a must-watch therefore i will not spoil anything!!Art(9)The art is really well done the background are nicely done as well. They did not brush them off or just put blank faces on people in the...background. The colours are nice too.The sets (hospital)The backgroundThe roomThe streetsAll the places, the details are there, it\'s really admirable.Sound(8)For the voice acting i do think it is very good. Like when they are arguing or when they are kissing. Those soft whispers it just makes you go ""KYAAA"" because the tone is low it\'s just very good. I don\'t want to say too much my cheeks hurt from thinking about it.I can\'t remember much about this meaning there is nothing good enough for me to remember anything haha. But I do want to say the ending song is pretty cringy because 2 of them were shown dancing it makes me cringed so hard. But that is just a personal thing.Character(9)Takato SaijouThis guy is really cute. At first glance, he may seem cold but as the show goes on, you will come to know why is he so cute. He\'s a tsundere in short but not those annoying kind. He also loves junta a lot. The development for him is really nice. To see how he would slowly fall into the hands of Junta.Azumaya JuntaHe may seem very angelic but haha. He has a very nice body and looks handsome HAHA anyway he is very possessive when it comes to his lover. And can be very terrifying when he is angry. He loves Takato and is very possessive of him which makes the plot very good. You will also come to realize how sweet and genuine he is as a person as the plot goes on.Side charactersOkay, the side characters are good too! Because they are the ones who create troubles and hurdles for the 2 main characters. But without these sides, the plot would not be interesting so they are important too.Enjoyment(10)Oh god! I thought i was gonna die from happiness! I was grinning the whole time because i love the characters so much. Okay, so in the anime there is gonna be some hurdles for the main characters they were so realistic. It is as if I was inside the anime it is very engaging. In one particular episode, the argument was huge I was almost crying because i could feel the emotions the characters were having. Also, this anime is not very cringy compared to other anime of the same genre. You might be like me if you watch this hahaha.Overall(9)I would like to say this anime is really well done, from the art to the characters and the plot is also not cringy. I love this anime as it is very engaging it feels as if you were inside the anime. But well if you want to see the intimate scenes you can always go read the manga so i don\'t find it a problem at all because i am not watching a R21 anime hahaha. I did not give a 10 despite i enjoyed it so much because there is only one ""10"" for me haha. That being said, this anime really deserves a ""9"" or ""10"" IF you like this genre. background.

I think the music and the sound design were good along with the art. I do think that the Story is a bit lacking though. It\'s okay for what it is considering you\'re not really there for an intense story when watching yaoi,  You\'re there for the lemon and the fluff. The characters we\'re alright as well, nothing special but alright. You have Takato Saijo: a Narcissist, Competetive, Power bottom. While he isn\'t my favorite, I do appreciate the power bottom role in this anime.. they make the role of his character in the relationship...interesting enough to keep it engaging I\'d say. Then you have Junta Azumaya: A soft, kind, submissive top. While I do think this anime is quite ""non-consensual"" like a lot of other yaois, this one does it in a way to where I\'m not too uncomfortable by it. I think Junta Azumaya\'s role could be changed to be different. He doesn\'t really put Takato Saijo\'s feelings into consideration too often but at the same time does. Overall I think the character arcs and personalities could be changed to be a little more interesting.My final rating? 7/10. I think it\'s worth a watch if you\'re looking for a quick easy yaoi to get through. I would say you should watch this one not for the story, but for the lemon and the fluff that\'s in it. If you\'re looking for yaoi with a more interesting storyline you should check out junjo romantica. interesting enough to keep it engaging I\'d say.

I don\'t have to much to say, so let\'s get right into the anime basics.Story; ""The sexiest man of the year"", a title that Takato Saijou has held for five long years and is proud to do so. With his fantastic acting, charismatic personality and gorgeous face how could you not love the title? Then in comes a fresh face, Junta Azumaya who is coined the horny angel (only for Takato anyway). They begin to get a ""little"" close to each other while working with each other, and take a...friendly relationship to the next level. Watch their love develop, Takato\'s adorable expressions and an unrealistic view on what it\'s like to be a celebrity in Japan... Ahhhh, everything I love about a good Yaoi. Quirkly story, hot guys and awkward love. I haven\'t experienced many Yaoi adaptions (Given, Love Stage, Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi, Dramatical Murder, etc.) and I\'ve begun to understand that if the manga is JUICY then the adaption will usually end up being dry (Given is an exception, and the movie Doukyusei is on another WORLDLY level). Art; Always appreciate/love CloverWorks, but It felt stiff to me. Sound; The OST was pretty good. Characters; no complaints about the cast, just the stiff execution.Overall, I really enjoyed the story/theme (two guys falling in love while is show-biz, woot woot) but ultimately didn\'t enjoy myself because whenever the JUICY parts should\'ve happened they... didn\'t? At least, didn\'t do it well.Highly suggest this as an introductory to BL/Yaoi, and if you want something a little sweeter (less intense) then Given is your way to go! friendly relationship to the next level.

It was cute and funny, I planned on watching it because I also loved the art and it attracted me. Hmmm we have different reviews, and it was weird at first that Junta tried to rape Takato and was rushed at that part lol. If the confession was a bit more normal or romantic it would have been a lot more nicer, but I\'m not saying it\'s bad though. I saw some reviews and they said it was horrible, but it\'s not that bad but I\'m also not...saying that Takato getting raped is good, anyways he liked it that way the more the episodes continued and he even said ""I want him to touch me again!"" lol so it\'s not that horrible and I absolutely think some reviews was exaggerating. The way Junta treated Takato is sooo cute <3 Like he really treated Takato that he is everthing to him <3 and also like he spoils Takato <3 I love it but I kinda agree with the other reviews, it was a bit rushed. I also really love the personality of Junta and Takato, opposite personalities which makes it more fun to watch! I really enjoyed watching the series because it was funny and the more I watch it the more I want to have a boyfriend, some lines of Junta really got me there....when he says something sweet to Takato it also makes my heart flutter...like those lines also affect the person watching and that\'s what attracted me more to finish watching it. It may be a rushed or a common yaoi series, but there\'s something unique about it that will never make me forget this series.

My biggest grievance was the art: it\'s hard to get into. I spent way too long analyzing the lines on their necks, wondering it was there, and waiting to grow accustomed to it, but once I did, I loved it.The sound is beautiful. I literally scoured the internet looking for the soundtrack after the show, and now I use it to study. There are some hauntingly gorgeous violin pieces...in this show that gave me chills. For a simple short show, they went all out on the music.The story was definitely cute, but also really realistic. I genuinely loved the main character because I felt like he did and said reasonable things. Their relationship didn\'t have a crazy age gap and they actually made sense. Their obstacles were also related to ""Hollywood"" and social media, so I think you\'ll find their problems refreshingly different than the stereotypical yaoi drama.I was annoyed with the side characters for sure.. they felt pretty non-existent. I would say they should have developed them better or just tossed them entirely.Overall, I give this a 9.

The first episode is a yikes fest but that was to be expected considering the manga its based off of, but then it starts to get really interesting?? The story about the rivaling actors having a secret relationship is actually very intriguing, and their dynamic is pretty convincing. The animation is great, the dialogue is funny. I especially find Takato is a really funny character, he's tsundere done right. The overall pacing in the show is quick but very refreshing/unique.

Takato Saijou had practically been raped by three people, in the second time he'd been passed out but his reaction when he woke up...was very realistic. my actual problem was with how he didn't fight Azumaya -who *actually* raped him- and Usaka. he didn't try fighting and acting almost as if it was alright. that conveys a wrong message, especially to the younger audience.though i have to admit i do appreciate the anime showing that men can also get raped not only women. its a subtle fight against toxic masculinity and that's very good.the way they handled stalking was admittedly better. they wrote a warning. it may be a small thing but it shows they do not support it in any way and that stalking is wrong.overall i really enjoyed watching Dakaretai Otoko. both times. its a splendid anime recommended to all BL lovers who are up to a good laugh. was very realistic. my actual problem was with how he didn't fight Azumaya -who *actually* raped him- and Usaka. he didn't try fighting and acting almost as if it was alright. that conveys a wrong message, especially to the younger audience.though i have to admit i do appreciate the anime showing that men can also get raped not only women. its a subtle fight against toxic masculinity and that's very good.the way they handled stalking was admittedly better. they wrote a warning. it may be a small thing but it shows they do not support it in any way and that stalking is wrong.overall i really enjoyed watching Dakaretai Otoko. both times. its a splendid anime recommended to all BL lovers who are up to a good laugh."", '9//10It suited my taste pretty good, but I wanted someting more, there was just something missing for me to love it copletly.

In fact, I think Takataos' character is one of the reasons why this anime was so enjoyable. I don't really have an opinion on Junta, however, but his character was okay? At first, when Junta corned Takato in the bathroom I really thought this relationship was not going to be healthy, but over time it...was? It was interesting to watch their relationship play out, I don't really watch any sexual anime in general and for me at least I had to skip a lot of scenes because I felt uncomfortable by it. was?

I'm sorry for my English, it's not my native language, but let's defend the fujoshi again.

I happened to be browsing the Yaoi section of a website and decided to watch it, I was still very young in the BL universe so I also have a special affection for it.Unlike classic Yaois like Sekaiichi Hatsukoi (which I also love), I think Dakaretai otoko is a little more explicit, which made me like this...universe even more.Characters (8): the characters are fun and full of personality. Of course, they have the points that every classic BL character has but throughout the  history two faces of each person's personality are shown, making the audience identify more with them, in my opinion at least. I personally think that Takato mainly has a very good development.Art and OST (3): I believe it is a soundtrack that doesn't stand out much, I don't particularly like the opening or ending.Story (8): Despite being a good and direct story, I believe it has its ups and downs. One problem, for example, is that with each episode the story develops very little and in the final episodes it escapes a little from the main story. However, the character development, although slow, is good in the end, raising another bad point, if the anime had more episodes it would be really wonderful.Summary: If you're new to BLs and don't know what to watch first, Dakaretai Otoko is very good at it.

Objectively speaking, this is a really really bad show actually. Now. Did I enjoy it? Yes.Hear me out.There is a serious shortage of BL anime adaptations. And the ones that get adapted usually only get OVAs or 5 episode seasons. That’s why a 13 episode full length BL is an absolute rarity and it feels difficult to try and rate it, considering how few others there are to compare to it. Which might be why I am absolutely biased rating this a 6.Story wise the characters are generic, have zero personality and their ethics are uhhhh....questionable at best....Consent is an alien concept to everyone in it and the mc gets sexually assaulted by at least 3 men (one of which being the love interest - yuck) and yes, I know that is an unfortunate staple of the genre, but in dakaretai it’s made infinitely worse by the fact that they frame it so creepily. I swear, they start playing horror music and create this threatening shadow when the mains first sleep together. It’s VERY uncomfortable.The animation is poor and since they cut all the sex scenes (which make up more than half of the story) it also ends up feeling incomplete.However - I did enjoy it. It’s mindless BL smut and sometimes that’s exactly what you need, so. If you enjoy problematic BL for what it is, honestly go for it. Who cares.TLDR; as a wise man once said: anything becomes fun, if your standards are low enough. And tbh my standards are on the floor. Terrible show, 10/10 would recommend.

Yes, Yaoi or shonen ai is followed by some gay men but often it\'s problematic. Japanese have such a fetish for ""No! No! No!...yes"" That seems to be true straight romance or gay but it seems especially so with gay material. There\'s one you probably all know that the two characters live together for three years and still every time his boyfriend touches him he jumps! It\'s depressing sometimes... but I watched all three seasons. Obviously you know what I\'m going to say...about the first half of this series. What do you want to call it? Date rape? Harassment seems an understatement. I began to think I really should be offended by this. But I kept watching. Something happened about the halfway point.

If it hadn\'t been this aggressor/wilting violet thing this wouldn\'t have been such a disaster but it was and they have to scramble to hold it together. They do.

Not because it was bad, but simply because it wasn't to my tastes.That in mind, I wanted to take a moment to talk about why this anime gets a 9/10 from me.One of my biggest complaints in most anime is the lack of attention to detail, and this series definitely handled such details well.

Each character is well developed and interesting, and even side characters contribute a great deal to the 'feeling' of each scene with little quips and such.I decided to put this one down after 3 episodes because I felt that with each episode I enjoyed it less and less as the plot became more and more predictable and I wanted to remember it for being as good as it was.My recommendation here is that you watch just one episode - that will tell you everything you need to know about the series and whether or not this is a series you would enjoy.I could draw some parallels with Love Stage here or there, but Love Stage managed to keep me hooked until the end, whereas this one failed to do so.Hmm. Think I'll go rewatch Love Stage now. silence during a conversation actually feeling like an awkward silence instead of just another camera pan over the expressionless faces of those present... this series handles those kinds of situations with great respect and attention to detail.That having been said, I absolutely abhor the art style on display here, and the overall story presentation did not make it any better.Another thing I really didn't like was how aggressive the romance aspects were, but ultimately that one definitely comes down to personal taste.The saving grace here comes down to the characters.

Neither should should be watched without playing the first two games in the series, but with Despair's final episode over with I can in good conscience say that they shouldn't be watched at all.Side Despair's problem is that it's boring, safe, predictable, and pointless. As a companion piece to Side Future it does its job fairly well, but in every other regard it's an absolute failure. Danganronpa and Super Danganronpa 2 left several...questions unanswered, mysteries left up to one's interpretation. DR3 Side Despair aims to solve these riddles and provide answers to what exactly happened to Class 77 before SDR2's events.This was a terrible idea.Class 77's backstory is largely shoved to the background in favour of crossovers with Side Future and an insider's view of series antagonist Junko Enoshima's infernal machinations. When the time finally comes for their big defining moment, none of them have had the development to warrant it. Instead, aside from outliers Nagito Komaeda, Chiaki Nanami, Ryota Mitarai and the Ultimate Impostor, all of them are mushed into one entity. Class 77 is no longer a cast of different characters, but one singular plot device the series has been chained to. Most of the Class 77 segments is spent building up to the demise of the one student missing in SDR2, and when it finally hits it's neither impactful nor entertaining.Junko Enoshima herself has also lost all of her charm. In the games, she appeared only at the very end of DR1 and SDR2. Now she's a main character in Side Despair, and it really hammers home the point that she's best used sparingly. In short, she's just not a very interesting character when you get down to it. She's evil because she's evil, and every single one of her evil plans always goes off without a hitch. What she ends up doing to plunge the world into despair is also incredibly stupid and hokey. The charismatic supervillain who capped off both games on their victory laps is now an omnipresent, transparently evil mwahahaer with little to do or say except ensure that all of SDR2's major backstory beats are hit. The one shining beacon of hope is one of the new anime-original guys, Juzo Sakakura, an excellently written character with a compelling and tragic arc. However, most of his big moments happen in Side Future, though vital setup occurs in Side Despair. Juzo is one of the best additions to the series yet, and his presence alone saves the show from being scored even lower.In the end, I liked SDR2 better when I didn't actually know what happened before it. Every answer we get in Side Despair is far lamer than what I'd envisioned, and just about every character is cheapened by the Persona 4-esque herd treatment. Just about the only character who escaped mostly unscathed was Komaeda, and even he, who was THE defining driving force of SDR2, ended up underutilised and mostly there to provide context for Side Future's events. This show not only fails on its own, but it serves to also make SDR2 a much weaker story once you know just how uninteresting its backstory is.Side Despair is woefully written and dreadfully directed. The animation is also clearly low budget, with the excellent music and voice work, as usual for the franchise, being its only saving graces. You probably already watched this if you're a hardcore fan of the series, but I recommend everyone else give this a skip. Side Future is undoubtedly the stronger show of the two, though even then it'd hard to recommend that one either. questions unanswered, mysteries left up to one's interpretation. DR3 Side Despair aims to solve these riddles and provide answers to what exactly happened to Class 77 before SDR2's events.This was a terrible idea.Class 77's backstory is largely shoved to the background in favour of crossovers with Side Future and an insider's view of series antagonist Junko Enoshima's infernal machinations.

The selling point of this work...is, as shown in their PV, the evolution of the 77th class into despair. They're barely present in the series. Barely. And they were the selling point.The development about the characters we all knew and love is null, there's nothing to add into what the games already showed us and at points it contradicts what you have done in the games.The pace of the writing is wonky at best, with jumps in time that aren't explained of make sense in the huge timeline of the franchise, there's fanservice just to cover up the huge plotholes this anime leaves and it doesn't feel like it's a gift for the fans who have played this game for more than 4 years.Just as an example: The final scene from this anime in the credits contradicts the very five minutes you play into SDR2. And that isn't supposed to happen if you're going for a ground-breaking project like this and expect to make people who are already more than familiar with the story be angry or nitpicky because of the poor attention to detail.The few things that save this anime is the music, which is very nice in both Op/End and their OST, the voice acting which is top notch and the appearance of the Despair Twins and their dynamics and also the dynamics between the Future Foundation main Trio.The protagonist and focus of this arc is weak, the introduction of a fan favourite to turn her into the mere shadow she was in the games for a plot device is simply insulting and her classmates are barely in there. Other than Impostor and Health Committee member, no one else gets development in a refreshing way or have any weight in the plot.As an advice I recommend to not be hype about this anime if you're a die hard fan of the series or do it as me: Play the three games in a row, then sit to watch this; because you'll notice all the plotholes and contradictions and you'll be more focused into that than the entire story they poorly presented. is, as shown in their PV, the evolution of the 77th class into despair.

A tale about the bright and talented students of Hopes Peak Academy\'s 77th Class. This entry explains what happened to SDR2\'s cast and everything about the Biggest, Most Atrocious Despair-Inducing Incident in Human History. A great prequel to the Danganronpa series.If you\'re interested in watching this, you have to go back to the start of this series as this is the third entry from this series and watching this without knowledge of prior entries will confuse you and you wont get the...full enjoyment out of this entry, not to mention it will also spoil the events of SDR1 and 2. If you have knowledge then the watch order would be episode 1 of Side:Future, then episode 1 of Side:Despair and continue that pattern with the finale being Side:Hope. Remember, this review will contain minor and major spoilers of SDR1 and 2, you have been warned.The story starts off with the 77th Class of Hopes Peak Academy and re-introduces them to us, it starts off fairly light and there\'s lots of comedic moments you can enjoy with your favorite characters from SDR2 while it foreshadows future events that you already know of. The story elegantly ties in with Side:Future as it gives us backstories of the cast from Side:Future as well. I thought every detail was explained well and even if certain things weren\'t explained at all, it still happened without visual presentation. I wont call it a plot hole as this is not the case. Unfortunately the show loves to go either with a slow pace or a very fast pace which is a minor setback. There were lots of controversies on how the 77th Class (and reserve course) fell into despair but I found it was the only reasonable explanation. So in conclusion I thought it explained the Biggest, Most Atrocious Despair-Inducing Incident in Human History quite well and we saw how everything happened, the first killing game was handled brilliantly, the events leading up to the major ones was done great. All in all the story tied in every entry in this series.---------------------------------------------Story - 9---------------------------------------------From the first episode we are introduced to a certain likable character from SDR2 and many were surprised about it because of the events of SDR2. This character is Chiaki Nanami and she\'s a bit different from SDR2, certain traits were kept but a few things were different about this character which makes sense if you know the whole story about her. Here this character is more perfect than the game version, but more human than in the game which is ironic since she was an AI. All the other characters are the same but the designs are slightly different, but they are all still excellent. We also get to see how Junko plays with Hopes Peak Academy and how she did everything, it\'s quite nice to see her in action as it really gives me more feeling to her character. Mukuro and Izuru are also present and you can see the love the former has for Junko and despair while the latter is a great written character who is quite tragic in my eyes. I will cover Side:Future\'s characters in Side:Future\'s review.---------------------------------------------Characters: 8---------------------------------------------The art isn\'t anything amazing or mind-blowing nor is the animation, it\'s well done, but nothing overly bad or overly good, there were some scenes which were really well done in the animation and art department but other than that it wasn\'t anything special.---------------------------------------------Art & Animation: 6---------------------------------------------The sound is simply amazing, as per usual in the Danganronpa franchise, they played the right tracks at the right time and it was just amazing.

You need the play the two DR games (DR 1, SDR2) to fully understand and enjoy the two DR3 anime. If you were a fan of the first installment of the Danganronpa anime, you\'ll love the games, so please, if you haven\'t so already, turn around and play those two games (or watch a walkthrough) for the best viewing possible. DR: Another Episode is also mandatory especially for Future arc. Also be sure to watch both Future and Despair arc in broadcast order (i.e. watch future arc ep 1 then watch despair arc ep 1, and so on). There are parts where...the story and characters might overlap, so be sure to watch it like that for better understanding.DR3: Despair arc is essentially a prologue to the DR story. It centers around the 77th class of the Hope\'s Peak acadmey, who btw are the main cast of the 2nd game: SDR2. The setting, once so happy and carefree, turns into one of the darkest points in their history: a prologue to the Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic event in human history. As the title and premise says, don\'t expect a happy ending to this. Although it starts off like your typical slice of life school anime, there is a brooding tone that constantly evolves as the episodes contiunously progress, awaiting to become a monster that destroys the students daily lives with despair. This tone starts as lighthearted then transitions into a darker mood, eventually becoming something outright disturbing. Suddenly, the happy, slice of life school setting is no more, instead it becomes violent, bloody and despair-inducing.One thing I liked is that they didn\'t linger or focus too much into the events the game already touched to an extent, like the Twilight Syndrome case. Just showing things in Hajime\'s point of view, and that was the better thing to do for the series.One thing I would\'ve liked was to see the 78th class just a bit more than a cameo, like their original interactions with Junko, but with the anime being just 1 cour, it\'s understandable that they had to leave that out.A disappointing isssue was that he pacing is a noticeably off. I feel like 11 episodes for the 77th class wasn\'t enough in the end. If it could have gotten a little bit more time, and cut a little bit more of the fanservice, I think the whole tragedy and the aftermaths could have been done better.(SPOILERS: For example, the scene of ""her"" death and the 77 class turning into despair could have used an in-between scene. Maybe one that goes more in-depth of how the class fully submitted to Junko. The skip between the death scene and the finale was too sudden, considering the two were a couple months apart.)The animation of the characters are really fun to watch as a fan. Just seeing all those characters I loved so much from the 2nd game animated is just so exciting. I felt that one good touch was that as episodes progress and tends to get darker, the art itself progresses to a more darker mood along with the story. Even the opening changes during the middle, to a much more darker color. It was a very nice touch to have, considering what was coming.The OP/ED is pretty good, and the soundtracks were decent, although it could\'ve been better. One thing I did like is how they used some game soundtracks for good nostalgia. The voice acting is fantastic as usual though, just like the games. The voices fit so well with the characters, which always helps the experience.The most important part of the despair arc (and the rest of the danganronpa series in general) are without a doubt the characters. If I didn\'t care for the characters, I would never have felt anything for them and thus I probably wouldn\'t have cared what happened to them. Now, since the most of the cast were fleshed out pretty well in SDR2, it wasn\'t that hard to make me like them from the get go. However, one thing I would\'ve liked to see is just making the cast even stronger. I know that Chiaki, Hinata, and Nagito are indeed the important characters, but I also would\'ve liked those without too much game time from SDR2 to get a bit more exposure and development, like Teruteru and Mahiru to an extent. What I\'m glad though, is the screen time the Ultimate Imposter got. Anyways, even if some characters are not getting the desirable screen time, they are still enjoyable to watch. This is also an important reason to play the games before watching this. You just get to know the characters better and smile as they are finally interacting cheerfully without being forced to kill each other. And of course, feel a lot more sadness when they are forced to go through ""that process"". However, one thing that I am really glad Despair arc managed was Mukuro and Junko getting a bit more depth, as well as Mitarai.One thing I didn\'t really like though, was how it put focus on the future arc characters for a couple of episodes, halting potential DR0 scenes and even halting the depth of the characters and their downfall. It\'s a shame that the despair process did not go as I imagined thanks to this, as I would\'ve preferred the ""despairification"" process to be on a more personal level. Having more than 11 episodes would have helped.As a huge fan of the danganronpa series, I feel both love and disappointment with the DR 3. On one hand, I loved seeing the characters I loved so much animated, interacting with each other. Even the first two episodes which were basically fan service was enjoyable to watch. Although honestly, they could have made the slice-of-life moments shorter just so we could\'ve had more plot development earlier on. And on the other hand there were pacing issues, like I\'ve mentioned. Also, the despair arc is also a big \'what could have been\'. What if they would have personalized the despairification process? I think that would have been a better way to showcase and further the depth of both the characters and how they became ""despair"". Nonetheless, I had this huge smile while watching the first couple of episodes, only for it to turn to sadness and eventually into complete anxiousness as I knew what would eventually happen to the cast. It could have been much better, in fact, after rewatchign the series a couple of times, I just feel disappointed in how the revelation of how the 77th class turned into despair. It\'s still a fine watch.Give the entire series (games + anime) a try!

It\'s definitely worth your time.', ""As Danganronpa fans, we only get to hear stories about the high-school life of the characters and how “The Tragedy” happened, but we never actually get to see that. But with Danganronpa 3 – Zetsubou-hen, we get just that. Zetsubou-hen takes place prior to the events of the first Danganronpa game, primarily focusing on 77th class of the main course and their story about how they became the “Remnants of Despair”. Labeled as a story that begins with hope but ends in despair, it definitely won’t have a happy end. But this is a treat for Danganronpa fans as they get the happy moments of...their favorite character, until all hell breaks loose.~{Story}~Despite being titled as Danganronpa 3, it is actually a prequel to the first game. However, it is meant to be watched after playing the second game as it spoils the plot twists of Danganronpa 2. Being a prequel however, you will already what will happen and how it’ll end. But the sole purpose of this anime is to show you how it happened. The story focuses on the 77th class (the main cast of Danganronpa 2) and their life at Hope's Peak Academy. But the story focuses on our Danganronpa 2 protagonist, Hinata Hajime, and how he tries to find himself a talent. The story also focuses on the new characters that were introduced in Mirai-hen and give more background for them. And as you’ve probably predicted, it doesn’t take too long for Despair to appear with Enoshima creating the “Remnant of Despair” and “Kamukura Izuru Project” taking place. Overall, the story is handle very well and it remain “almost” consistent with what we’ve heard before about “The Tragedy”. The reason why I say “almost” is because there are some things Monokuma/Enoshima told us before that don’t quite happen in Zetsubou-hen. But then again, they were Enoshima’s words… you can’t really trust that, can you?Story: 9/10~{Presentation}~Zetsubou-hen is the Danganronpa you know and love. It starts off in a happy tone, similar to the fun moments for the second game. But then despair kicks in, which is to be expected from anything Danganronpa related. One thing that is well-done in Zetsubou-hen is how the writers manage to remember so many tiny details mentioned in the second game and apply them to this anime. Remember Tanaka saying something about defeating a giant Pomeranian in his. If you don’t remember, don’t worry… the writers haven’t forgotten. And they also applied Saionji’s height change later in the series too. The first couple of episodes of the series is basically fanservice for the fan base. We get to see the Danganronpa 2 characters we know with their unique personalities being shown. We get to see the happy moments of the 77th class before “things” happened. But the rest of the series is what fans expect from this prequel story; despair. The series has the same wacky and zany, yet dark and disturbing tone of its predecessors. The pacing can be a bit too fast as times, but that was to be expected with the amount of plot points that needed to be covered.Presentation: 9.5/10~{Character}~Zetsubou-hen primarily focuses on the 77th Class and Hinata Hajime prior to becoming the “Remnant of Despair”. The characterization for these characters are very similar to their characterization in the second game. Hinata’s still kind of cynical, Nanami’s still adorable, Komaeda’s still kibou-sexual, Tanaka’s still a chuunibyou, Souda’s still pathetic, Mioda’s still loud, Nidai still needs to take a dump, Saionji’s still a b*tch, and so on. Zetsubou-hen is very loyal with its characters and keeps them as how they’re supposed to be. But out of these characters, Hinata, Nanami and Komaeda are the ones that play a bigger role, while the rest are mostly there as comic relief or just for the sake of the plot. Hinata’s inferiority complex kicks in right when we get introduced to him and his accepting the Kamukura Project plays a big role in the series. His complexity is well handled when he’s Hinata. When he’s Kamukura, his more of a flat character, but that’s how his character ends up being. Nanami, who’s appearance was quite surprising since she was known to be simply an A.I. in the second game, plays a big role in this series too. And she ends up being the most unpredictable character since you actually don’t know how things will end up for her. Komaeda is here quite a lot, though it may not always be for the sake of moving the plot, but because we get to see more of his ultimate ability, Ultimate Asspuller… I mean Ultimate Lucky Student. But Enoshima Junko’s also a major character in the series, but that is too be expected since she is the conflict of the series. Zetsubou-hen also builds up on its Mirai-hen characters, like Yukizome and Munakata, and it’s done pretty effectively. For that sole reason, it is meant to watch together with Mirai-hen.Character: 9.5/10~{Art}~,The art in Zetsubou-hen is pretty good, but it’s the art style that succeeds more. The art is fairly well detailed and the backgrounds are fairly well done. But the character designs are the most impressive. The characters in Danganronpa 2 all had quite unique character desings, and that same uniqueness can be found here. Some characters look slightly different, like how Tanaka’s hair style is different. But the most notable thing is that the art style is very vivid, especially when compared to the franchise. This creates a contrast to Mirai-hen’s darker-than-normal art style. This vivid art style might have been used to represent the hopefulness the series initially started with and this art style might’ve been used as a contrast for the darker despair moments that comes later in the series. Overall, it was a pretty smart choice to go with an art style that contrast with Mirai-henArt: 9/10~{Animation}~The animations are fairly good in the series, but it isn’t anything extraordinary. However, that is to say that the animation quality is fairly consistent throughout. Generally speaking, the animation is fluid enough and there aren’t any noticeable animation quality drops. Backgrounds feel a little static though. However, the lighting helps in adding more volume to the visuals. Though if we compare the animation quality to Mirai-hen’s it is a little weaker. But unlike Mirai-hen (which is more action-heavy), Zetsubou-hen doesn’t have any demanding moments that needs high-quality animations. Lerche did a good job in animating two seasons during the same time, which they aren’t used too.Animation: 7.5/10~{Voice Acting}~The seiyuu cast is the same as the games and Mirai-hen. All the well-known seiyuu are back to represent their character. Takayama Minami does the Danganronpa 2 protagonist, Hinata Hajime, and does him and his alternate personality, Kamukura Izuru, perfectly well. Ogata Megumi (the same seiyuu as Naegi Makoto), does Komaeda Nagito again, and she does his voice amazingly well. Just like Danganronpa 2, Ogata has time to shine and show her talent as a character like Komaeda. Hanazawa Kana reprises her role as Nanami Chiaki and does her character very well. Unlike her A.I. personality in Danganronpa 2, Nanami sounds a little less listless, but it matches her character more. Toyoguchi Megumi does both the Despair sisters, Enoshima Junko and Ikusaba Mukuro, and she does a great job with both, but her talent shines with Junko more. Nakahara Mai does a very good job as Yukizome Chisa. Her character didn’t play a big role in Mirai-hen, but in Zetsubou-hen, she’s one of the main characters. And other seiyuu such as Sugita Tomokazu, Kayano Ai, and Fukuyama Jun all do a great job with their characters.Voice Acting: 9.5/10~{Music}~One of Danganronpa’s strong point is its music and Zetsubou-hen is no different. The OP, “Kami-iro Awase”, didn’t take too long to become one of my favorite anime openings. The music, the vocals, and the lyrics are amazing for the song. And there’s a lot of symbolism in the song too. The ED, “Zettai Kibou Birthday”, is sung by Komaeda’s seiyuu and it’s very good. The vocals and music are nice and it matches the tone of the hope in the series. The lyrics is quite weird… but so is Komaeda! Most of the background music consists of music used in the first two games, which is a good thing since the two games had some amazing music. The background music creates a sense of nostalgia due to its familiarity. Till this day, the closing argument theme is my favorite OST and every time I hear it, I always get a sense of joy from it!Music: 9.5/10~{Enjoyment}~As a Danganronpa fan, this is exactly what I wanted out of Zetsubou-hen. It felt really nice to see the Danganronpa 2 characters again and see how their past was. As someone who always wanted to see how everything turned out the way it ended up to be, I was really satisfied that we were able to see that with this anime adaptation. This anime covers “The Kamukura Izuru Project”, “Twilight Syndrome Murder Case” (albeit a little rushed), “Student Council Massacre”, how the “Remnant of Despair” were created, and “The Tragedy”. Though my rating for enjoyment is high, it’s really hard to enjoy a series like this. You’ll mostly just get despair from this series and a whole lot of tragedies. But Zetsubou-hen manages to keep my attention all of the time. Zetsubou-hen and Mirai-hen are easily one of the most enjoyable things I have watched this year.Enjoyment: 9.5/10In the end, Zetsubou-hen is definitely worth watching if you’re a Danganronpa fan (though you probably already have).  Due remember though that Zetsubou-hen, despite it being a prequel chronologically wise, is meant to be watched after playing the first two game. Due note that you must play the second game in order to fully appreciate both Zetsubou-hen and Mirai-hen. Danganronpa’s first game or its lackluster adaptation isn’t enough. But with great handling of its characters, and satisfying adaptations of stories we were only told about in the previous games, Zetsubou-hen manages to be the perfect treat for fans. It may not be an easy watch due to depressing moments, but it manages to keep your attention. But that is to be expected since the it’s a story that begins in hope and ends in despair.+ Great prequel anime for the Danganronpa series, that adapts many key plot-points that were mentioned in the games.+ Danganronpa 2 characters are handled well and loyal to the second game.+ Great OPs and EDs and the background music is the same as the games.+ Not only develops its Danganronpa 2 characters, but also the characters from Mirai-hen too.+ Lots of fun and satisfying moments for fans of the franchise.- Pacing can get a tad bit too fast at times.Overall: 9.0/10 their favorite character, until all hell breaks loose.~{Story}~Despite being titled as Danganronpa 3, it is actually a prequel to the first game. However, it is meant to be watched after playing the second game as it spoils the plot twists of Danganronpa 2. Being a prequel however, you will already what will happen and how it’ll end. But the sole purpose of this anime is to show you how it happened. The story focuses on the 77th class (the main cast of Danganronpa 2) and their life at Hope's Peak Academy. But the story focuses on our Danganronpa 2 protagonist, Hinata Hajime, and how he tries to find himself a talent. The story also focuses on the new characters that were introduced in Mirai-hen and give more background for them. And as you’ve probably predicted, it doesn’t take too long for Despair to appear with Enoshima creating the “Remnant of Despair” and “Kamukura Izuru Project” taking place. Overall, the story is handle very well and it remain “almost” consistent with what we’ve heard before about “The Tragedy”. The reason why I say “almost” is because there are some things Monokuma/Enoshima told us before that don’t quite happen in Zetsubou-hen. But then again, they were Enoshima’s words… you can’t really trust that, can you?Story: 9/10~{Presentation}~Zetsubou-hen is the Danganronpa you know and love. It starts off in a happy tone, similar to the fun moments for the second game. But then despair kicks in, which is to be expected from anything Danganronpa related. One thing that is well-done in Zetsubou-hen is how the writers manage to remember so many tiny details mentioned in the second game and apply them to this anime. Remember Tanaka saying something about defeating a giant Pomeranian in his. If you don’t remember, don’t worry… the writers haven’t forgotten. And they also applied Saionji’s height change later in the series too. The first couple of episodes of the series is basically fanservice for the fan base. We get to see the Danganronpa 2 characters we know with their unique personalities being shown. We get to see the happy moments of the 77th class before “things” happened. But the rest of the series is what fans expect from this prequel story; despair. The series has the same wacky and zany, yet dark and disturbing tone of its predecessors. The pacing can be a bit too fast as times, but that was to be expected with the amount of plot points that needed to be covered.Presentation: 9.5/10~{Character}~Zetsubou-hen primarily focuses on the 77th Class and Hinata Hajime prior to becoming the “Remnant of Despair”. The characterization for these characters are very similar to their characterization in the second game. Hinata’s still kind of cynical, Nanami’s still adorable, Komaeda’s still kibou-sexual, Tanaka’s still a chuunibyou, Souda’s still pathetic, Mioda’s still loud, Nidai still needs to take a dump, Saionji’s still a b*tch, and so on. Zetsubou-hen is very loyal with its characters and keeps them as how they’re supposed to be. But out of these characters, Hinata, Nanami and Komaeda are the ones that play a bigger role, while the rest are mostly there as comic relief or just for the sake of the plot. Hinata’s inferiority complex kicks in right when we get introduced to him and his accepting the Kamukura Project plays a big role in the series. His complexity is well handled when he’s Hinata. When he’s Kamukura, his more of a flat character, but that’s how his character ends up being. Nanami, who’s appearance was quite surprising since she was known to be simply an A.I. in the second game, plays a big role in this series too. And she ends up being the most unpredictable character since you actually don’t know how things will end up for her.

How should i put it... This is by far one of the worst anime i\'ve ever watched. certainly in my top 10 worst list. The only things it has going for it is how it reveals a few very minor details, how well it worked along with the other arc, and that the visuals aren\'t too bad (They aren\'t even close to being good though).Now let\'s go through what makes this (and every other anime), and then sum up what we have.1-The plot. It is horrendous. I understand that it was set and there wasn\'t much room to work with...it, but it still doesn\'t change the fact its bad. The internal logic falls apart quite often. Plot holes are absolutely everywhere. Plot convenience tools are used left and right. There was a story to tell somewhere in there, and it could have been interesting, but instead, it was just a rush job with only the final outcome in mind, and it ended up developing in the most boring, predictable and cliche way as possible.First, we\'ve got an introduction to our class of gifted individuals, yet it was extremely rushed and thus completely redundant - the fans of the game already know the characters well, and a new audience wouldn\'t have gotten much from such a tiny introduction. Another reason it was redundant is because... Well, its nothing new is it? I mean every second school anime has that in abundance, and that\'s not the point of the anime as well, so why waste time on it?Now for the character and their interaction with the story. The story IS the interaction of the characters with it. Yet, in this story, most of the characters where completely isolated from the story (You could say only Junko had a role in the whole anime), and everyone who did have a chance to do something or interact in any other way, was either a bystander, or had such a level of incompetence, that even a sock puppet would seem like a rich character next to him. You could pretty much replace every line of dialogue in the anime except Junko\'s with ""it can\'t be helped"" and not much would change. The saddest thing about it, is how the anime is trying to keep the story seem important, dark, and meaningful, by constantly jamming in death, and rubbing it in the viewer\'s face.The art. Its ok, BUT, the level of detalization of characters was greatly diminished compared to the game, in some cases leaving characters almost unrecognizable. The sound is ok too, bot bad but nothing special as well.So, what do we have left? Well, nothing really. While i don\'t really believe in spoilers in the first place, the end of this one was spoiled to begin with, so while nothing else, i expected that to lower the score this anime gets further. I was rather surprised to see it got such a high rating instead.Well, now that you know my analysis of this.. Thing... And my opinion on it, feel free to agree or disagree, but please, don\'t give me baseless arguments and claims such as ""you\'re wrong cuz that\'s your opinion only"", or ""You\'re just hating"". I always analyze anime objectively by comparing it to others as well as consulting my knowledge of movie making and story writing that i got from filming school. Such accusations will simply be ignored due to their illogical nature - i found the other arc ok, and the adaptation of DR1 pretty decent after all. it, but it still doesn\'t change the fact its bad.

Such accusations will simply be ignored due to their illogical nature - i found the other arc ok, and the adaptation of DR1 pretty decent after all.', 'Danganronpa 3 Despair has become divisive among the fanbase.  From expectations not being fulfilled to false advertising, a good portion of fans we\'re not satisfied with how the anime was handled.  On the other side of the spectrum, others believe it to be a great work that holds the franchise well.  Lastly, there are those in the middle that still enjoyed it but recognize it\'s flaws.  I\'m also in the middle.  While I did enjoy this series, I also had many issues with it.First off, knowledge of both DR: Trigger Happy Havoc and Super DR2:  Goodbye Island of Despair...are necessary.  Even going into this prequel, spoilers are abound right off the bat due to revelations as early as episode 1 spoil critical mysteries you won\'t find answers to until near the end of the game.  Also, Despair arc runs alongside Future arc, and episode order is one Future arc episode then Despair arc, watching both series simultaneously.  This issue should be brought up as soon as possible, as all the criticism of the anime stems from this format.The false advertising I mentioned earlier is that while Despair arc\'s premise is about the 77th class of Hope\'s Peak Academy.  The POV starts and gives plenty of focus on a character from the Future arc, Chisa Yukizome.  While she first appears to bring the class together and bonding with them, the story shifts to her investigation about the hidden secrets of the school to the point it takes away time from the 77th class.  That\'s not all.  Other characters from the Future arc appear later, and get an amount of focus in relation to what\'s going on in the Future arc at the time.  The fact that no characters from Future arc were even hinted before in promotion materials to be in Despair arc led to the accusations of false advertisement and how Despair arc was used to provide more characterization to the characters from the Future arc that itself couldn\'t provide.  Two one cour series with each having many characters to focus on rarely gives consistent and equal characterization, and a good number of them will get be sidelined.  And while the attempt is creative, was it worth all the cutting corners in the narrative to fit these plotlines together.In the end, the main characters, the 77th class, get relegated to being side characters in what was supposed to be their own story and get treated more as a collective than individuals.  Some exceptions are Hajime, Chiaki, Nagito and the Super High School Level Imposter, though very slightly, and for specific plot reasons.  Hajime has a adequate amount of characterization because a good deal of focus is on him in the beginning, but it only lasts a few episodes.  Those who played the game know the inevitable change that will befall him, and how he will be erased to make another character take his place for the rest of the series Izuru Kamukura.  This had fans hyped because of who this character was and that we would finally see him in action, but then grew dissatisfied as episodes passed and he rarely did anything.  Hajime who was an interesting character is replaced by Izuru who fans were hyped about, hoping he would play a big role, yet he merely serves as a walking plot device with no character.Chiaki plays a key role that ultimately leads to one of the most divisive episodes of the anime.  The premise of the show is about the 77th class, and how they would later become a group Super High School Level Despair that destroy the world.  There were expectations built up from the second game on how the main antagonist Junko Enoshima managed to turn these beacons of hope into envoys of despair.  The way it was executed left much to be desired, and it\'s in part due to the existence of another character from the Future arc,  Ryota Mitarai.   This one character is so deeply entrenched in both storylines that many of the decisions for DR3 as a whole was based around him, making him a divisive character.  Chiaki was meant to play the role of the hope of the 77th class, and in order to turn the rest of the 77th class to despair, she was doomed to die.  Ryota was to provide the means to help the transformation, a brainwashing anime.  The characterization of the Super High School Level Imposter is also mainly dependent on this character as well, forming a give and take relationship with him that later becomes friendship.77th class as a whole already got relegated to being side characters in their own series that their characters as individuals were already diminished, but now the way they\'re converted, what\'s supposed to be the focal point of the series, is the same lazy way as a group like some kind of hive mind.   Those who played the games know they aren\'t just a class of students.  We know they have their own backstories, characteristics (not just the ones used for comedy), and ambitions that made them each who they are.  To have that all tossed aside and have them be treated as a single entity is disappointing.Again, the format is a huge factor, but also, the way it was executed and how it fits in the narrative have problems.  I mentioned before that viewers need to know the storylines of both games before watching.  That could not be anymore true.  You could not hope to understand even half of what goes on in this series without that knowledge, and even then you have to stretch your imagination on how things progress and how it connects to the games.Important events are also condensed to one episode, incidents with enough material that could have been made each into their own series.  One example is one of the most brutal events in the series, the first killing game.  If the purpose was to freak the audience out, it succeeded.   However, once you calm down and start evaluating what happened,  you realize that what happened didn\'t make any sense.  The 16 students weren\'t captured; they were summoned.  Even when threatened that if they didn\'t play they would die, the threat diminishes when the ones doing the threatening leave the room.  Junko gives them all sorts of weapons, and only one of the students suggest using them against their coercers, and he promptly gets killed soon after by another of his fellow classmates.  After that, mostly everyone just degrades and start becoming sadistic killers for no reason other than to hammer in the nightmare fuel.  They weren\'t locked in, had options outside of killing each other, and were left with means that could have just as easily been used to defend themselves and escape rather than turn on each other, but because this must end in tragedy and in such a short time span, the characters have to move the story along no matter what.  In the same vein, afterwards, the school just covers it up, because the board of directors are generic one-dimensional scumbags and Junko can\'t be caught yet.The same line of thought goes into Junko\'s motivations.  Why did she particular choose the 77th class to begin with?  You never get an answer other then her just being fickle about it.  How did she notice Ryota provided the means for her agenda?  She just had a feeling.  You always get a half-baked answer or no answer at all.  Being a prequel means the main plot points are all foregone conclusions.  However, this point is taken to nauseously exploitative handling.For example, Mikan goes missing after being captured by Mukuro and has been brainwashed.  The other classmates split up and go search for her even with riots going on outside.  Nagito and Chiaki find the secret room Junko had Ryota held up in by Nagito using his luck, in which has them meeting Izuru and Junko as well, Ryota escaping and running into Chisa, Nagito getting injured and Chisa intervening.  Mukuro was being kept occupied by Peko who Nagito requested she distract her.  How he knows about Mukuro or anything that\'s been going on with Junko is left unanswered.  Chisa volunteers to stay behind for no good reason, and that leads to Chiaki to carry Nagito back to their classroom where everyone else is, excluding Peko.Next, Chiaki comes up with the brilliant idea of everyone going together to save Chisa to which they all inevitably agree.  During which Mikan who was missing suddenly returns with Peko who got injured.  You expect since she was the reason everyone was searching for initially, they would ask where she\'s been and why she\'s been absent.  No, they don\'t inquire anything about that. They head towards Chisa who has now been captured and brainwashed.On the way, they encounter rioters just outside the gate that is now open for some reason, and there is no security around.  It takes a very special kind of lazy to have this, because in previous scenes, the gates were closed, guards were struggling keeping them out, and you get atleast two scenes of that.  Now, no one is there except the rioters and not only that, they immediately resort to cold-blooded murder.  They were angry before, but here, they are calm, quiet and slowly walk up to Chiaki and everyone.  Nekomaru and Gundham stay behind to deal with them.  Chiaki takes them to the secret passageway, where Mikan manages to separate her from everyone else through convenient trap doors and when the others wonder why she\'s missing, they accept Mikan\'s excuse that she\'s wasn\'t ""feeling well and rested in a room they previously passed"".  Nevermind, she was well just a moment ago, also how that contrasted with her determination shown earlier, and you know, the fact this is enemy territory! Nekomaru and Gundham catch up at this time, getting the location from Mikan.  Chiaki wakes up to find Chisa who lies that Izuru helped her escape, and they decide to meet up with the rest of the class.  From then on, well, it goes as well as you\'d expect...Chiaki\'s death made me sad but it wasn\'t as tearjerking as it could have been.   All of her exploits of keeping the class together were just told to us and mostly off screen.  The build up to her execution was poor by having everyone passing around the idiot ball to have plot happen.  Also throughout it all, I couldn\'t hold back my disbelief on how Junko managed to configure all those traps and build the trial room all in the span of at least days, and none of the authoritative figures in the school or the board of directors noticed, either because they will either ignore it anyway or are grossly incompetent.I mean I liked all the continuity nods and fanservice provided, but that\'s not enough to hold the story together.  When it came to the Despair arc, the fanservice and establishing ties to the Future arc were more important than telling a coherent story.What I also liked was the portrayal of Junko and the resulting disillusionment for a good portion of the fanbase.  Another aspect I believe this series intended to do was really hammer home how Junko is a irredeemable character.  Mukuro was also disillusioned to many.Despair arc has fanservice and hit-or-miss humor going for it.  Many things happen because they need to and not if it makes any sense.  The format really limited the series as there was simply not enough time to expand on all the plot points, resulting in too much going on at once and not enough focus on the main characters, the ones the story should mainly be about. are necessary.  Even going into this prequel, spoilers are abound right off the bat due to revelations as early as episode 1 spoil critical mysteries you won\'t find answers to until near the end of the game.  Also, Despair arc runs alongside Future arc, and episode order is one Future arc episode then Despair arc, watching both series simultaneously.  This issue should be brought up as soon as possible, as all the criticism of the anime stems from this format.The false advertising I mentioned earlier is that while Despair arc\'s premise is about the 77th class of Hope\'s Peak Academy.  The POV starts and gives plenty of focus on a character from the Future arc, Chisa Yukizome.  While she first appears to bring the class together and bonding with them, the story shifts to her investigation about the hidden secrets of the school to the point it takes away time from the 77th class.  That\'s not all.  Other characters from the Future arc appear later, and get an amount of focus in relation to what\'s going on in the Future arc at the time.  The fact that no characters from Future arc were even hinted before in promotion materials to be in Despair arc led to the accusations of false advertisement and how Despair arc was used to provide more characterization to the characters from the Future arc that itself couldn\'t provide.  Two one cour series with each having many characters to focus on rarely gives consistent and equal characterization, and a good number of them will get be sidelined.  And while the attempt is creative, was it worth all the cutting corners in the narrative to fit these plotlines together.In the end, the main characters, the 77th class, get relegated to being side characters in what was supposed to be their own story and get treated more as a collective than individuals.  Some exceptions are Hajime, Chiaki, Nagito and the Super High School Level Imposter, though very slightly, and for specific plot reasons.  Hajime has a adequate amount of characterization because a good deal of focus is on him in the beginning, but it only lasts a few episodes.  Those who played the game know the inevitable change that will befall him, and how he will be erased to make another character take his place for the rest of the series Izuru Kamukura.  This had fans hyped because of who this character was and that we would finally see him in action, but then grew dissatisfied as episodes passed and he rarely did anything.  Hajime who was an interesting character is replaced by Izuru who fans were hyped about, hoping he would play a big role, yet he merely serves as a walking plot device with no character.Chiaki plays a key role that ultimately leads to one of the most divisive episodes of the anime.  The premise of the show is about the 77th class, and how they would later become a group Super High School Level Despair that destroy the world.  There were expectations built up from the second game on how the main antagonist Junko Enoshima managed to turn these beacons of hope into envoys of despair.  The way it was executed left much to be desired, and it\'s in part due to the existence of another character from the Future arc,  Ryota Mitarai.   This one character is so deeply entrenched in both storylines that many of the decisions for DR3 as a whole was based around him, making him a divisive character.  Chiaki was meant to play the role of the hope of the 77th class, and in order to turn the rest of the 77th class to despair, she was doomed to die.  Ryota was to provide the means to help the transformation, a brainwashing anime.  The characterization of the Super High School Level Imposter is also mainly dependent on this character as well, forming a give and take relationship with him that later becomes friendship.77th class as a whole already got relegated to being side characters in their own series that their characters as individuals were already diminished, but now the way they\'re converted, what\'s supposed to be the focal point of the series, is the same lazy way as a group like some kind of hive mind.   Those who played the games know they aren\'t just a class of students.  We know they have their own backstories, characteristics (not just the ones used for comedy), and ambitions that made them each who they are.  To have that all tossed aside and have them be treated as a single entity is disappointing.Again, the format is a huge factor, but also, the way it was executed and how it fits in the narrative have problems.  I mentioned before that viewers need to know the storylines of both games before watching.  That could not be anymore true.  You could not hope to understand even half of what goes on in this series without that knowledge, and even then you have to stretch your imagination on how things progress and how it connects to the games.Important events are also condensed to one episode, incidents with enough material that could have been made each into their own series.  One example is one of the most brutal events in the series, the first killing game.  If the purpose was to freak the audience out, it succeeded.   However, once you calm down and start evaluating what happened,  you realize that what happened didn\'t make any sense.  The 16 students weren\'t captured; they were summoned.  Even when threatened that if they didn\'t play they would die, the threat diminishes when the ones doing the threatening leave the room.  Junko gives them all sorts of weapons, and only one of the students suggest using them against their coercers, and he promptly gets killed soon after by another of his fellow classmates.  After that, mostly everyone just degrades and start becoming sadistic killers for no reason other than to hammer in the nightmare fuel.  They weren\'t locked in, had options outside of killing each other, and were left with means that could have just as easily been used to defend themselves and escape rather than turn on each other, but because this must end in tragedy and in such a short time span, the characters have to move the story along no matter what.  In the same vein, afterwards, the school just covers it up, because the board of directors are generic one-dimensional scumbags and Junko can\'t be caught yet.The same line of thought goes into Junko\'s motivations.  Why did she particular choose the 77th class to begin with?  You never get an answer other then her just being fickle about it.  How did she notice Ryota provided the means for her agenda?  She just had a feeling.  You always get a half-baked answer or no answer at all.  Being a prequel means the main plot points are all foregone conclusions.  However, this point is taken to nauseously exploitative handling.For example, Mikan goes missing after being captured by Mukuro and has been brainwashed.  The other classmates split up and go search for her even with riots going on outside.  Nagito and Chiaki find the secret room Junko had Ryota held up in by Nagito using his luck, in which has them meeting Izuru and Junko as well, Ryota escaping and running into Chisa, Nagito getting injured and Chisa intervening.  Mukuro was being kept occupied by Peko who Nagito requested she distract her.  How he knows about Mukuro or anything that\'s been going on with Junko is left unanswered.  Chisa volunteers to stay behind for no good reason, and that leads to Chiaki to carry Nagito back to their classroom where everyone else is, excluding Peko.Next, Chiaki comes up with the brilliant idea of everyone going together to save Chisa to which they all inevitably agree.  During which Mikan who was missing suddenly returns with Peko who got injured.  You expect since she was the reason everyone was searching for initially, they would ask where she\'s been and why she\'s been absent.  No, they don\'t inquire anything about that. They head towards Chisa who has now been captured and brainwashed.On the way, they encounter rioters just outside the gate that is now open for some reason, and there is no security around.  It takes a very special kind of lazy to have this, because in previous scenes, the gates were closed, guards were struggling keeping them out, and you get atleast two scenes of that.  Now, no one is there except the rioters and not only that, they immediately resort to cold-blooded murder.  They were angry before, but here, they are calm, quiet and slowly walk up to Chiaki and everyone.  Nekomaru and Gundham stay behind to deal with them.  Chiaki takes them to the secret passageway, where Mikan manages to separate her from everyone else through convenient trap doors and when the others wonder why she\'s missing, they accept Mikan\'s excuse that she\'s wasn\'t ""feeling well and rested in a room they previously passed"".  Nevermind, she was well just a moment ago, also how that contrasted with her determination shown earlier, and you know, the fact this is enemy territory! Nekomaru and Gundham catch up at this time, getting the location from Mikan.  Chiaki wakes up to find Chisa who lies that Izuru helped her escape, and they decide to meet up with the rest of the class.  From then on, well, it goes as well as you\'d expect...Chiaki\'s death made me sad but it wasn\'t as tearjerking as it could have been.   All of her exploits of keeping the class together were just told to us and mostly off screen.  The build up to her execution was poor by having everyone passing around the idiot ball to have plot happen.  Also throughout it all, I couldn\'t hold back my disbelief on how Junko managed to configure all those traps and build the trial room all in the span of at least days, and none of the authoritative figures in the school or the board of directors noticed, either because they will either ignore it anyway or are grossly incompetent.I mean I liked all the continuity nods and fanservice provided, but that\'s not enough to hold the story together.  When it came to the Despair arc, the fanservice and establishing ties to the Future arc were more important than telling a coherent story.What I also liked was the portrayal of Junko and the resulting disillusionment for a good portion of the fanbase.  Another aspect I believe this series intended to do was really hammer home how Junko is a irredeemable character.  Mukuro was also disillusioned to many.Despair arc has fanservice and hit-or-miss humor going for it.  Many things happen because they need to and not if it makes any sense.  The format really limited the series as there was simply not enough time to expand on all the plot points, resulting in too much going on at once and not enough focus on the main characters, the ones the story should mainly be about.', ""Welcome to the last week of this year's horror anime month. In order to wrap things up, let's look at the other instalment of Danganronpa 3, Zetsubou-hen. Is it an improvement over the other half of Danganronpa 3, just as weak or worse? I suppose the only way to find out is to watch and determine for ourselves. So, let's take a look.Story:Zetsubou-hen opens with Yukizome taking a teacher's role at Hope's Peak Academy as part of an investigation into the Academy's more shady pursuits. She's assigned to the 77th class and begins her work in earnest, both as a teacher and an investigator. All...while events are moving towards the great world-changing event of ultimate despair.Therein lies the biggest flaw with the series. If you saw the first Danganronpa, you know how it's going to end. Even if you haven't, the series itself calls it a tale of hope that ends in despair. Which could work, if they built up some tension in another way. But the series never bothers. About half of it is spent on vaguely slice of life school life with very minor references to Yukizome's investigation. Then we get a bunch of episodes setting up Junko's machinations. Most of the series is just build up to a pretty disappointing climax. To make matters worse, if you happen to have watched Mirai-hen first, like I did, then you'll know the exact plot points to expect. The series also shares Mirai-hen's weakness of having a lot of bad, over-blown speeches. The only difference is that the ones in Zetsubou-hen are mostly about despair instead of hope.That being said, I do appreciate what the series was trying to do. When it comes right down to it, it's trying to humanise the group that Naegi got called a traitor for protecting. It's trying to get you to connect with and understand them. There's just one problem with that. Let's talk about the characters.Characters:The Danganronpa series in general isn't good at providing compelling characters. The first anime got around that by providing good mysteries. The Mirai-hen part of Danganronpa 3 tried to do the same, but ended up spending too much time with strangely absurd action sequences and puerile hope speeches. This series doesn't even have that to fall back on. We know that Junko's the villain as soon as she shows up. We see what Hope's Peak is up to before there's much investigation into it. We know that things are going to end in despair. So, what we're left with are shallow archetypical characters who spend the bulk of the series doing nothing interesting.Art:The character designs continue to be a weakness. Although this may be the part of the series that's least effected by it since a good half of it is about the students just being students. The series does have a strange habit of making the non-important characters just look like blue humanoid blobs. Maybe they didn't want normal looking people and they didn't want to bother coming up with stupid looking designs for background characters. I will credit this series for having bloody sequences that are fairly competent. Although they do use bizarre neon colouring for it. Maybe they were on a time slot where they couldn't show much blood so they worked around it by making the blood not look like blood.Sound:This is one area where I have to give every instalment of this franchise credit. They are good at casting. Ogata Megumi, Hanazawa Kana, Toyoguchi Megumi, Takayama Minami & Nakahara Mai are all good in this. In spite of their characters lacking any real complexity. Really, none of the actors do a bad job. They're all basically competent. The music is also decent enough.Ho-yay:There's a bit. Junko's sister seems to have a thing for her. I have no idea why they included that, but it's there. The photographer has a girl that she seems to have a thing with. The chef is openly bisexual and it's revealed that a certain gent is in love with another man. That being said, this stuff barely comes up and is, mostly, not important to the plot.Final Thoughts:And that's Danganronpa 3: Zetsubou-hen. Ultimately, its big failing is that its whole raison d'etre is to get you invested in bland characters. In the interest of doing so, it lacks mystery and has very little that could be charitably called horror. If you're a big fan of the franchise and you really want to see the events that built up to the grand hyper worst despair-inducing situation, you might find it interesting. Maybe. For myself, I'm going to give it a 3/10. While it is pretty bad, there's nothing truly terrible about it. Next week I'll open November with a review of 91 Days. Have a happy Halloween and retain your fabulousity. while events are moving towards the great world-changing event of ultimate despair.Therein lies the biggest flaw with the series.

Have a happy Halloween and retain your fabulousity."", 'LA is gonna change up the format for this review as well as Mirai-hen by making it a sorta of 3-parter due to the nature of how Danganronpa 3\'s animes were presented so if you wanted to see LA\'s take on Mirai-hen and Kibou-hen then this review won\'t be in it.Before LA talks about Zetsubou-hen, LA will say that both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen anime are something of a companion piece with each other giving off clues or events that transpired that lead it to how or when it happened. The obvious companion piece both these anime have is ""trying to find the traitor"" and why...some of the founders are butting heads with each other in Mirai-hen and ""how Danganronpa\'s franchise started"" as well as some backstory on some of the newer characters in Mirai-hen for Zetsubou-hen and both arcs gives and feeds information to each other. For anime-episode order, you should/MUST watch by starting with Mirai-hen\'s episode then Zetsubou-hen episode then back and forth after that for ""clarity"". Once both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen have finished finishing with Mirai-hen\'s final episode go to Kibou-hen for the finale. Ohh and MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!...don\'t say LA didn\'t warn you!With that out of the wayZetsubou-hen is at first vastly different from Mirai-hen being a bit more of a slice of life comedy highschool anime with all the eccentric characters and the daily lives of the Ultimates in Hope Peak High, but considering the obvious that this season is called ""Despair arc""...you know that the atmosphere will drastically change.In terms of characters, well if remembering the characters in Danganronpa 2, then the entire cast of 77B is back and this and more or less the first half of this anime is pure fanservice. But from this, Chiaki Nanami voiced by Kana Hanazawa, Chisa Yukizome, Hajime Hinata voiced by Minami Takayama, Nagito Komaeda voiced by Megumi Ogata as well as many of the more important newer characters from Mirai-hen do get their character development/backstory given to them in this arc, mostly because this is a prequel to the game, it\'s to be expected that there would be some form of development to the characters that mattered and caused what occurred in the game. Even saying it\'s a prequel really doesn\'t harm Zetsubou-hen though as LA said earlier it\'s fanservice to even see the characters in Danganronpa 2 animated. But one little problem comes in which is although we get mostly comedic fanservice from most of the main cast of Zetsoubou-hen mainly 77B, the focus to Zetsubou-hen goes more to the ""more important and plot forward"" characters (Hajime, Izuru Kamukura, Nagito, The Enoshima Twins, Juzo, Munakata, Chisa and Ryota to be precise) as well as giving us clarity with little subtle nods to Mirai-hen\'s ordeal with their newer characters as a bit of bonus (and more clue finding for Mirai-hen\'s part) like Seiko, Izayoi and Ruruka\'s own ""episodes"" and Juzo, Munakata and Chisa in detail MUCH later on. But if there was a flaw with Zetsubou-hen being a prequel is that if you\'ve played Danganronpa 2...the prequel will ultimately leave them to their doom...*ahem* despair, the plot pre-ordianed them to this and the flaw can massively hurt as you just know they will end up like they were in the game, Class of 77B were effectively comedic fanservice until the plot told them ""they were important to move the plot forward and destined to how they become in the game"". If there was a favorite character in Zetsubou-hen it goes to Junko Enoshima, but as for the Ultimates...LA was always fond of Sonia Nevermind voiced by Miho Arakawa and Akane Owari voiced by Romi Park in the game and Chiaki Nanami voiced by Kana Hanazawa deserves top billing in the Ultimates however and it obviously was transferred into the anime.In terms of animation, well in contrast to Mirai-hen\'s bleaker animation palette, Zetsoubou-hen\'s color palette is definitely brighter and vibrant as a disguise as to what kind of despair is gonna happen sooner or later, from gaming homages and little 8-Bit vers. of the Zetsubou-hen cast to just the vibrant character designs to turn it into the dull, bleaker blood-red tinge of Mirai-hen. Ohh and the pink blood is back in Zetsubou-hen in all it\'s gory ahh LA means glory and it does get GORY. The animation may be ""ok"" but Zetsubou-hen can sure bring in it\'s aesthetic value and GORY detail when it really starts getting intense, sure the animation is slightly inconsistent but it\'s aesthetic detail to the later episodes makes up for that IMMENSELY.Essentially Zetsubou-hen is Danganronpa fanservice as well as backstory for nearly every single thing that happened in the series (as well as from Mirai-hen\'s characters) as a well defined prequel, which means yes, we get to see the The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History as well as how Hope Peak\'s Academy actually functioned before AND AFTER Junko Enoshima came in. There are ALOT of Danganronpa homage fanservice here and there which HELPS SOOO MUCH and for *ahem* ecchi fanservice, well if you like it of not Episode 2 and 7 is there if you want it. *cough* aphrodisiac curry *cough* Nagito *cough*AAAAND on speaking of Junko Enoshima, if there was anything LA could say about this eccentrically schizophrenic villain in the series is that she is most probably one of the greatest villains in anime, not only for her personality and pure nihilist tendencies but for what lengths she will go to for what she wants, she is one of the thee smartest, calculating, bizarrely cold hearted and eccentric villains in anime LA has seen and Zetsubou-hen shows it as raw as possible...why does LA utterly praised Junko?...well not only does she take LA\'s favourite character in Zetsubou-hen (Or LA is an Ultimate Despair...LA really does love the pure insane eccentric villains, why do you think LA put Nui Harime in LA\'s favourite characters list?) but Junko\'s craving for nihilism/despair as all the rest a la order is boring is a best if LA could say this as an analogy...like the Joker from the Dark Knight Trilogy. Why?...well sure you could easily say that it\'s quite obvious as both Junko and Joker have the same belief system. Nihilism. But even their methods are the same!. (Sorry for the tangent but this was bottled in LA and LA might as well say it now). Let\'s see Junko essentially toppled a hierarchy of Hope Peaks Academy by finding out all the funds from the Reserve Course was used essentially to fund human experimentation, thus breaking the order of Hope......Peak Academy, then using Izuru Kamakura the ""Ultimate Hope"" into ""despair"" by blaming the The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History on Izuru and by the end of it Izuru will see which one is harder to predict, hope or despair?. The Joker?...tried to cause chaos ultimately destroying the foundation of Gotham City and using Harvey Dent as the pinnacle of hope in Gotham and make Harvey believe that the order of Gotham needs to change...like adopt the Joker\'s anarchy thus becoming Two-Face. Junko Enoshima is to the Joker, as Izuru Kamakura is to Harvey Dent. <LA sighs>...Juuko Enoshima is a great villain ain\'t she???...aaand LA watched the Dark Knight too much.Ok ok back on topic...what was next ohhh right! In terms of voice acting, just like Mirai-hen, we\'ve got an excellent voice cast with reprisals from the Danganronpa 2 game at that and even though LA only watched a Let\'s Play of Danganronpa 2 in English on Youtube, still the Japanese voice cast is AMAZING from Kana Hanazawa to Yuu Koyabashi to Romi Park and Ai Kayano to heck even Kotono Mitsuishi. But quite eaisly, best voice actor in Zetsubou-hen goes to Megumi Toyoguchi as Junko Enoshima AND Mukuro Ikusaba as the Despair Twins.The ending brought up some plot holes that just wasn\'t told which was a problem and really MANY things in Zetsubou-hen was retconned but considering many of the other Dangaronpa materials LA hasn\'t consumed yet (Danganronpa Zero etc.) so LA can take a few liberties towards it due to Zetsubou-hen bringing in some of the other material into homages to itself, but the ONLY plot hole LA really couldn\'t oversee is with Chiaki *MAJOR SPOILERS* and for those who have watched it, it\'s obvious what LA is gonna talk about, it is if Chiaki died by Junko\'s execution plans, Zetsubou-hen NEVER tells us how a ""real-flesh character"" like Chaiki gets turned into AI and goes into the Neo World Program, like did Chiaki plan something before it, did one of the Mirai-hen characters upload her or created her...it was NEVER explained. Nonetheless Zetsubou-hen being a prequel and bringing in a per-determined ending and with that one major plot hole, LA was still ok with this, a bit annoyed but ok.Zetsubou-hen may have had a slow but fanservicey start, but by the end, LA thinks that Zetsoubou-hen trumped Mirai-hen if LA goes by what happens in near the finale of it fully showing the events that transpired the original and it\'s sequel games but where (true?) hope is in sight for Mirai-hen, Zetsubou-hen by it\'s title alone, you\'ll know it\'ll sink into despair as it being a prequel deemed it to happen. A prequel in ANY kind of media has it\'s huge problems, but LA is safe to say that Zetsubou-hen is quite safe from the deluge of problems prequels in the media have and it helps that Mirai-hen was a great companion piece anime to Zetsubou-hen to make it a unique prequel anime on it\'s own right and an even more complex set of animes together. Even if many things from Zetsubou-hen\'s timeline to the games are retconned and really for what LA ""researched"" (Only being Danganronpa 2 and Ultra Despair Girls through Youtube) for an ""anime only"" timeline following the prequel to really the launching pad for the entire franchise, LA was overall satisfied by it, retcon and plot holes and all, be it LA trying to find clues to Mirai-hen or wanting to find out how this really ALL started and that in itself was enough for LA to overlook it\'s flaws...but still realize it HAS these flaws. some of the founders are butting heads with each other in Mirai-hen and ""how Danganronpa\'s franchise started"" as well as some backstory on some of the newer characters in Mirai-hen for Zetsubou-hen and both arcs gives and feeds information to each other. For anime-episode order, you should/MUST watch by starting with Mirai-hen\'s episode then Zetsubou-hen episode then back and forth after that for ""clarity"". Once both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen have finished finishing with Mirai-hen\'s final episode go to Kibou-hen for the finale. Ohh and MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!...don\'t say LA didn\'t warn you!With that out of the wayZetsubou-hen is at first vastly different from Mirai-hen being a bit more of a slice of life comedy highschool anime with all the eccentric characters and the daily lives of the Ultimates in Hope Peak High, but considering the obvious that this season is called ""Despair arc""...you know that the atmosphere will drastically change.In terms of characters, well if remembering the characters in Danganronpa 2, then the entire cast of 77B is back and this and more or less the first half of this anime is pure fanservice.

There are ALOT of Danganronpa homage fanservice here and there which HELPS SOOO MUCH and for *ahem* ecchi fanservice, well if you like it of not Episode 2 and 7 is there if you want it. *cough* aphrodisiac curry *cough* Nagito *cough*AAAAND on speaking of Junko Enoshima, if there was anything LA could say about this eccentrically schizophrenic villain in the series is that she is most probably one of the greatest villains in anime, not only for her personality and pure nihilist tendencies but for what lengths she will go to for what she wants, she is one of the thee smartest, calculating, bizarrely cold hearted and eccentric villains in anime LA has seen and Zetsubou-hen shows it as raw as possible...why does LA utterly praised Junko?...well not only does she take LA\'s favourite character in Zetsubou-hen (Or LA is an Ultimate Despair...LA really does love the pure insane eccentric villains, why do you think LA put Nui Harime in LA\'s favourite characters list?) but Junko\'s craving for nihilism/despair as all the rest a la order is boring is a best if LA could say this as an analogy...like the Joker from the Dark Knight Trilogy. Why?...well sure you could easily say that it\'s quite obvious as both Junko and Joker have the same belief system. Nihilism. But even their methods are the same!. (Sorry for the tangent but this was bottled in LA and LA might as well say it now). Let\'s see Junko essentially toppled a hierarchy of Hope Peaks Academy by finding out all the funds from the Reserve Course was used essentially to fund human experimentation, thus breaking the order of Hope......Peak Academy, then using Izuru Kamakura the ""Ultimate Hope"" into ""despair"" by blaming the The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History on Izuru and by the end of it Izuru will see which one is harder to predict, hope or despair?. The Joker?...tried to cause chaos ultimately destroying the foundation of Gotham City and using Harvey Dent as the pinnacle of hope in Gotham and make Harvey believe that the order of Gotham needs to change...like adopt the Joker\'s anarchy thus becoming Two-Face. Junko Enoshima is to the Joker, as Izuru Kamakura is to Harvey Dent. <LA sighs>...Juuko Enoshima is a great villain ain\'t she???...aaand LA watched the Dark Knight too much.Ok ok back on topic...what was next ohhh right! In terms of voice acting, just like Mirai-hen, we\'ve got an excellent voice cast with reprisals from the Danganronpa 2 game at that and even though LA only watched a Let\'s Play of Danganronpa 2 in English on Youtube, still the Japanese voice cast is AMAZING from Kana Hanazawa to Yuu Koyabashi to Romi Park and Ai Kayano to heck even Kotono Mitsuishi. But quite eaisly, best voice actor in Zetsubou-hen goes to Megumi Toyoguchi as Junko Enoshima AND Mukuro Ikusaba as the Despair Twins.The ending brought up some plot holes that just wasn\'t told which was a problem and really MANY things in Zetsubou-hen was retconned but considering many of the other Dangaronpa materials LA hasn\'t consumed yet (Danganronpa Zero etc.) so LA can take a few liberties towards it due to Zetsubou-hen bringing in some of the other material into homages to itself, but the ONLY plot hole LA really couldn\'t oversee is with Chiaki *MAJOR SPOILERS* and for those who have watched it, it\'s obvious what LA is gonna talk about, it is if Chiaki died by Junko\'s execution plans, Zetsubou-hen NEVER tells us how a ""real-flesh character"" like Chaiki gets turned into AI and goes into the Neo World Program, like did Chiaki plan something before it, did one of the Mirai-hen characters upload her or created her...it was NEVER explained. Nonetheless Zetsubou-hen being a prequel and bringing in a per-determined ending and with that one major plot hole, LA was still ok with this, a bit annoyed but ok.Zetsubou-hen may have had a slow but fanservicey start, but by the end, LA thinks that Zetsoubou-hen trumped Mirai-hen if LA goes by what happens in near the finale of it fully showing the events that transpired the original and it\'s sequel games but where (true?) hope is in sight for Mirai-hen, Zetsubou-hen by it\'s title alone, you\'ll know it\'ll sink into despair as it being a prequel deemed it to happen. A prequel in ANY kind of media has it\'s huge problems, but LA is safe to say that Zetsubou-hen is quite safe from the deluge of problems prequels in the media have and it helps that Mirai-hen was a great companion piece anime to Zetsubou-hen to make it a unique prequel anime on it\'s own right and an even more complex set of animes together. Even if many things from Zetsubou-hen\'s timeline to the games are retconned and really for what LA ""researched"" (Only being Danganronpa 2 and Ultra Despair Girls through Youtube) for an ""anime only"" timeline following the prequel to really the launching pad for the entire franchise, LA was overall satisfied by it, retcon and plot holes and all, be it LA trying to find clues to Mirai-hen or wanting to find out how this really ALL started and that in itself was enough for LA to overlook it\'s flaws...but still realize it HAS these flaws.', ""As a fan of the Danganronpa games, specially the second one, I was quite looking forward to this anime. I wanted to see more about the main cast of SDR2 and learn about how they fell to despair.[This review may contain spoilers]In my honest opinion, if it weren't for the simultaneous weekly release along with Future Arc, I think this anime would've felt way weaker. That was the purpose, after all. While it still felt a bit weak to me, I did enjoy it. I do think this anime greatly surpassed the first installment in the anime adaptations for the series.As for the...story, we mostly knew the basics. We knew how it would go down. Starting from a slice of life, sliding into a despairful mess of chaos. What I definitely mostly enjoyed was the change into the actual title of the series - DESPAIR. However, it escalated rather quickly which made it feel less realistic, but since they had to tuck in a lot of content in such a small amount of episodes, I won't pay that much attention to that detail.In the end, the strong point from Danganronpa are its characters. It managed to get me attatched to the new characters. The introduction of the trio investigating (Munakata, Sakakura, Chisa - being her the narrator) Hope's Academy was a good thing and created a refreshing contrast between their point of view and the students'. Also, it painted the academy in a whole new light. However this also was the cause of how apart and plain the main cast from SDR2 felt. They barely got focused (with some exceptions) on and almost felt like supporting characters.About the characters, what mostly bugged me was how Nanami was created as a real person for the anime. While at the start it was well handled, it all went down and became a bit disappointing when she just literally became a tool for Junko. Coming from SDR2, I was expecting Junko to act like Junko and destroy every characters individually, or at least more slowly than how it went down on the anime. This both made Junko's and Nanami's character feel more lazy than they actually are.The music was okay and I specially enjoyed the remakes of the original tracks from the games. It made it feel more like Danganronpa. Both OP&ED were really great and really well handled in the smallest details. The original tracks from the anime weren't specially outstanding or memorable, so I wouldn't say the music was one of the strongest points of the anime.As for the animation: I am really picky and critical about this point. While they did a good job with the colors (contrasting with the dark palette of Future Arc) - something that gradually changed along with the tone of the anime-, the animation could've been way better. The movement was really not fluid and most of the time it felt kind of awkward. This is completely a biased opinion but I feel that the animes never really imitated Rui Komatsuzaki's art that well.Anyways, as a whole I really enjoyed the anime. I'm still a fan and did get emotional with my favorite characters and even the new characters. It's better than the first anime and even if it has some weak points it's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the games. story, we mostly knew the basics. We knew how it would go down.

Guys I am a BIIIIIIG Danganronpa fan ...I mean look at my name and picture.When I finished the First game I was shocked of how AWESOME that shit was.I thought there will be no way Danganrona 2 be better than the first....but i was wrong...........oh boy I was ......and thats when I have fell into ETERNAL ZETSUBOU!!!!!Ok I apologize for the long intro, what I am trying to say is that every entry in the series sets the bar so high for the next entry to overcome. When Danganronpa 3 was announced , I just couldn\'t wait to see it ...and...i honestly I was anticipating the despair arc more than the future one and I gotta say...........I am quite dissapointed :(Art 8/10Despair arc keeps the hyperbolic vibrant colors from the past entries and WOW it is GORGEOUS.....The abundance of cheerful colors in this anime really makes you feel the hope atmosphere,it is really beautiful.However the character drawings in some instance are really horrible compared to the game designs...I felt like the details for the characters were decreased and that honestly made it feel as if an amateur was drawing the character ...kind of reminds of higurashi. Overall the art is really beautiful...it takes the danganronpa aesthetics and applies them into a hope world where you can literally feel the solace in the scenes but I honestly preferred the future arc art which I would be reviewing laterSound 7/10The soundtrack is actually shared between future and despair arc but each anime recycles certain past soundtracks that fits its themes. In this anime I am not gonna say I was wowed....I felt it was pretty lazy.The new tracks were honestly not as good as the ones before...But I am always a sucker for any of the past danganronpa soundtracks which i really loved hearing them again here.Last but not least....I loved the opening....DAMN I would they really made a nice choice with kami iro awasi, the song\'s has the feel of serenity and nostalgia,Definitely something that fits the anime perfectly.Story 3/10ok lets stop with the small things and get down to buisness. The thing about the 1st danganronpa adaption is that it fails to adapt the narrative style of the game. Danganronpa 1 and 2 were pretty slow but the narration was perfect...you really feel the moment of every scene but the anime adaption fail because of restricted number of episodes and as result it ended up being to fast and not as good as the game. Now they did the same risk here and I gotta say....HOLY SHIT...The narration style of this anime is GARBAGE!!!Like seriously you don`t feel as if the anime is telling a story, you feel like the anime is just a series of flashback and  and events that are transitioned sooooooooooo SHITly if such a word exist. Let\'s take a closer look. Honestly the first 2 episodes were PERFECT..Literally what I wanted from a prequel. It  starts of really upbeat and hopeful. You even get see how the new characters introduced in danganronpa 3 future had influence in the past events. Not to mention how you get say the times spent between Hinata and Nanami which was SOOOOOO SWEEEEET..But then everything gets broken....you see the anime goes at an EXTREMELY FAST PACE....I am not kidding, this is the worst story pacing i\'ve ever seen in an anime. You have that episode that is entirely covering the twilight syndrome events..I honestly had goosebumps when I knew that it\'s finally gonna happen..but that episode had everything wrong with danganronpa 3 despair arc....It was so brief and summarized and there are certain things that I was longing to learn about from this episode wasn\'t there!!!!! It was awful. From this episode the anime starts to just link side stories and skim through events...and that\'s a big problem. Another example, there is this episode that is dedicated entirely to further build up few characters from the future arc. I do appreciate that  to some extent...but when you look at the bigger picture you will realize that it was awkwardly placed there...it is the most boring episode in the anime....and then a HUUUUUUUUUGE TIME SKIP!!!!!!!!!! The last thing that really disappointed me in this anime is the ""Master plan"" leading to the tragedy..I will not talk  in details here to avoid spoilers...But I really found it underwhelming, it wasn\'t as despairing as i thought it would be and...wait *SNIFF* *SNIFF*...what is this smell???.....OMG......it\'s PLOT HOLES????????Ok now there were some parts that were good in the story i wont lie...there were themes at least....but i still can\'t believe that spike chunsoft made a BROKEN and HALF-ASSED story....I am shocked seriously...Really wouldn\'t have lost any part of the experience had i just read the story through the wiki pages...it\'s the same thing....BLAND AS HELLCharacter 5/10Ok i wouldn\'t say the characters are bad but it definitely was mediocre. First of all, The ENTIRE Danganronpa 2 cast were USELESS in this anime WITH few exceptions: Nanami and Hinata. I felt sometimes that those characters with the hollow figures were more interesting. I mean literally they have verrryyy little to do here...they just goof around the entire series. Although I mentioned exceptions but even those exceptions were not that good. At the beginning there were really nice relationship scenes between Nanami and Hinata, but The anime just decides to minimize it at the end in favor of including more SHIT. I even felt that Enoshima Junko was...well just Enoshima Junko..nothing new. There wasn\'t alot of moments were I really felt disturbed from her. Infact, she started to feel annoying. However What really saved this anime for me at least are the new characters ESPECIALLY Ryota Mitarai. I felt the anime build them up really . Actually you cant tell that there was more focus on them due to their screen time and they did a good job , but sacrificing some parts to improve others is not what a great anime doesEnjoyment 6/10The only thing that pushed far to complete this arc is my danganronpa fetish. Honestly there are some parts that i really enjoyed from my heart but there are other parts that I forced myself to enjoy. Honestly, There are ALOOT of plot points in this anime that would\'ve been more awesome given that would\'ve been great had the the direction was better. I found myself thinking about the anime several times and realize...well actually that was pretty good but yeah it wasn\'t effective. usually Danganronpa is the type of story that will grip your heart untill the very end. but that\'s not the case here. The anime really failed to deliver some interesting plot points in an interesting wayOverall 6/10Ok maybe it\'s not that bad as I have made it sound..there were some redeeming qualities..add that to your despair addiction and you will find yourself enjoying this anime at few parts. But let\'s be honest here...Kodaka can make PERFECT GAMES!!!but anime...there are  restriction when it comes to anime and one of them is time...We all know that danganronpa is a story that likes to take its time building a great story..but in anime this is hard. IN my personal opinion with this type of quality it would\'ve been acceptable if despair arc was just a 2 hour movie without adding alot of shit...that way future arc would\'ve been given more episodes and time to build itself.Future arc is WAAAY better than despair arc but it still have some issues...I will make a conclusion on the entire Danganronpa 3 series when the hope arc comes out.In the end, Dangonronpa 3 is a fair anime with a broken story elements and missed opportunities that had some enjoyment in it i honestly I was anticipating the despair arc more than the future one and I gotta say...........I am quite dissapointed :(Art 8/10Despair arc keeps the hyperbolic vibrant colors from the past entries and WOW it is GORGEOUS.....The abundance of cheerful colors in this anime really makes you feel the hope atmosphere,it is really beautiful.However the character drawings in some instance are really horrible compared to the game designs...I felt like the details for the characters were decreased and that honestly made it feel as if an amateur was drawing the character ...kind of reminds of higurashi.

(Possible very minor spoilers)The story is about how the characters from the game Danganronpa 2 became Despairs. So the story is about what happened before Danganronpa 2 took place and how they came to be Despairs, which is obvious cause it\'s called the despair arc. Which I think they have did a good job of trying to accomplish this, but I have a few minor disappointments. Besides that the story is very interesting. But in my opinion it felt a bit rushed.The art is good and is it very true to the series....But with a few disappoints such as, Gundham Tanaka and Hiyoko Saionji\'s hair is different. Besides those few minor details, they did a great job. Chiaki Nanami is THE Ultimate Waifu, enough with this ""Ultimate Gamer"". (she didn\'t deserve what happened to her in episode 10)I really like the opening for this animei and its pretty catchy in my opinion. I didn\'t hear much background music throughout the anime, so there\'s nothing really I can say there.The characters personalities have stayed the same as in the game, so no disappointments there. They kept Peko and Fuyuhiko\'s relationship between them secretive as they did in the game. They did a lot of these things, such as, Hiyoko\'s loathful attitude towards Mikan. Akane and Nekomaru\'s rivalry between each other and Kazuichis one-sided love for Sonia, etc.I really enjoyed watching this series this season, definitely something worth checking out. I really recommend you watch a playthrough of the game or play it yourself before you watch this anime, it will make a little more sense if you do.

I got the VITA for the sole purpose of playing the games, when SDR2 was only getting translated by some random people on the internet and the first game had just gotten localized. I\'ve spent a lot of my time on Danganronpa, analyzing it, doing fanarts, discussing theories with other people, reading the fan-translated novels, playing Ultra Despair Girls, and although it had some flaws, I really the Danganronpa series overall.But when I knew that they announced an anime, I just...had this bad feeling. Danganronpa: The Animation wasn\'t really good, as the quantity of episodes was just not enough for the hole plot and it tried to fit like 20+ hours of gameplay in 13 episodes of approximately 25 minutes. 20+ of gameplay, details, plot, characters, into less than 6 hours approximately of an animation. And obviously, the adaptation wasn\'t really the best. But I thought, ""Hey, they won\'t make the same mistake twice. Besides, two arcs? That\'s a total of 24 episodes, so maybe it will be different!""Oh, how wrong I was.Both despair and future side just tried to throw in a bowl and mix a lot of characters, random plot ideas, deaths with no meaning, and terrible death flags that screamed ""hey lol i\'m gonna die now"". One of the major things about Danganronpa that I liked was how ridiculous, yet interesting the plot twists were. Even if you expected some of them, it was interesting to see how the dots connected, the contradictions, the solutions, and the characters going through that trip to the truth. And sometimes the twist would make you go ""holy shit"", because you didn\'t really get to see them coming.Danganronpa 3 didn\'t include any of those. Instead, the supposedly ""plot twists"" were so predictable, they basically screamed to your face ""enjoy this characters because we are going to kill it"". All the raising of death flags was painful to see, it felt like watching a Blue\'s Clues episode of how obvious everything was. A lot of cheap and mediocre tactics to get the ratings up, including unnecessary weird fanservice (although I kind of can let that pass because almost all animes do that), fake deaths of loved characters to keep the ""cliffhanger up"", and most of the ""cliffhangers"" were basically thrown out to hell next episodes as they killed the hype.Supposedly, Despair side was about the class of SDR2 (which I\'m not getting into as it may spoil, but if you plan on watching it, at least watch a playthrough of the game if you want to understand). It started fine, as most of the watchers are at familiar with the cast, with the typical cliche unnecessary fanservice, including a small ecchi scene, but not that terrible to throw it all to hell. But around the fourth episode, they started skipping stuff. Important stuff. Weird, unclear time skips that just didn\'t make a lot of sense. At first, I personally believed it was just for the sake of time, as they had other characters from the class to dig in. But I was wrong. Instead, the time was mostly spent on other characters that I won\'t give names, because again, it would spoil a little bit.There was almost no development on the SDR2 class, and they were mostly joke characters filling the background for some minutes.A lot of stuff contradicted the canon, the novels were not considered, Nanami Chiaki went basically to a whiny Mary Sue depending on Hinata Hajime despite knowing him little, looking like on of those over exaggerated cliche shoujo protagonists. Komaeda Nagito was only a ""hope boner"" instead of an interesting character with different views that were interesting to analyze. And others character didn\'t get the stage for more than 5 minutes. Knowing the characters from SDR2 was totally pointless, as they were made into cliche, badly ""developed"" characters, if you can call that ""development.The anime just killed the essence of Danganronpa itself. No surprises, no cliffhangers, no plot twists, no character development. Just a terrible ripoff of Dora the Explorer with murder and some crappy hope vs despair plot. had this bad feeling.

Instead, the time was mostly spent on other characters that I won\'t give names, because again, it would spoil a little bit.There was almost no development on the SDR2 class, and they were mostly joke characters filling the background for some minutes.A lot of stuff contradicted the canon, the novels were not considered, Nanami Chiaki went basically to a whiny Mary Sue depending on Hinata Hajime despite knowing him little, looking like on of those over exaggerated cliche shoujo protagonists. Komaeda Nagito was only a ""hope boner"" instead of an interesting character with different views that were interesting to analyze. And others character didn\'t get the stage for more than 5 minutes. Knowing the characters from SDR2 was totally pointless, as they were made into cliche, badly ""developed"" characters, if you can call that ""development.The anime just killed the essence of Danganronpa itself. No surprises, no cliffhangers, no plot twists, no character development. Just a terrible ripoff of Dora the Explorer with murder and some crappy hope vs despair plot.', 'This review will be split, first half my review for it, and second half (W/ spoilers) Will explain this whole thing to people who are confused about this chapter.Alright, lets start :3To begin with, I know this anime is based in the past before this whole Despair thing came into play, but I see no Asahina, or Naegi (I ship them both, damnit kirigiri\'s death.)But this chapter is complete crap, this was an unnecessary chapter, the killing didn\'t come in until like episode 9, I was so bored I had to skip around 8 minutes after episode 7, I was getting to bored, but the...characters were hard to get into because 1. Asahina, Naegi, had a past, they were in Danganronpa 1, (It was the best) and this one was.. very hard to feel for the characters, Kirigiri\'s death had me emotional (sorry if it was a spoi- wait, if you haven\'t watched chapter one then shoo. But heres my ratings;Story: 4Art: 8Sound: 4Character: 1Enjoyment: 3Overall: 4Worst Chapter yet.Okay, heres explaining time, filled with spoilers, you\'ve been warned.Mk- so this chapter was set before the whole killing with Junko thing, like how you see it in the first chapter, you see, the first chapter was based on the new killing game, in the big freakin\' building and such, while this is set before that, you remember when --Ohh whats his name, ahh you know him, big, skinny, short white hair dude who tried to kill Naegi, yeah,him. he was explaining Yomizona or whatever her name was, her death, and how Despair was her fault, ahh I forgot most of it but bare with me, the reason the blood is pink is because Junko is still alive, and her theme is art, poppy, flashy stuff, also it\'s taken place before the new killing game, chapter one, with red blood, as Junko isn\'t in charge. But shit I am disappointed in this chapter, I wanted main characters, :( Everytime I want a ship going these amazing people sit there like ""Dhuuur letz kill dem guyz mk?"" Not well done on their side. :/ characters were hard to get into because 1. Asahina, Naegi, had a past, they were in Danganronpa 1, (It was the best) and this one was.. very hard to feel for the characters, Kirigiri\'s death had me emotional (sorry if it was a spoi- wait, if you haven\'t watched chapter one then shoo.

Not well done on their side. :/', 'I N T R O D U C T I O NI\'ve been a fan of the Danganronpa game series since 2012. In 2013, Danganronpa: The Animation came out, and honestly, it was crap. The animation and art was pitiful, the characters were barely grazed and hardly as deep as the corresponding game had it, and it was just rushed. But that\'s the thing with animating an entire game in 13 episodes-- it\'s not possible to fit every scenario, so the anime had to condense it for only the main plot points to appear.Now, why do I mention the first animation when I should be...talking about the 3rd Despair Arc? You need to be aware of my disappointment for that, so that you can understand I was overall impressed with the effort put into Danganronpa 3, both sides. The Despair Arc cannot be seen without knowing the plots of the 1st and 2nd Danganronpa games, so unless you\'ve seen it, you\'ll likely be thoroughly confused. But anyways, Despair Arc explains the events before the 1st game, which had me interested to see. It\'s like more puzzle pieces were given to the viewer, to try to fathom all of this ""hope"" and ""despair"" madness. I wasn\'t very disappointed with what I got, thankfully enough.S H O R T C O M I N G SI was introduced with the students of SD2 (Super Danganronpa 2) and some characters from the Future Arc, such as the homeroom teacher, Yukizome Chisa, the leader of the later Future Foundation, Munakata Kyosuke, etc. Getting to see them animated, along with new characters that I welcomed fairly enough, was exciting. However, I only get glimpses of their personalities, it seems? My personal expectations in an anime this short isn\'t very high on character, but again, I felt like I got only a taste of what the students were truly like (I won\'t spoil anything from SD2). I honestly wish I\'d gotten more.For the first two episodes, you feel like you\'re watching a slice-of-life, ridiculous comedy with friendships and rainbows and idealistic school life (also with that one perverted cook and that fanservice of pantsus). Then, well I love this, but it all just goes downhill and you know it. However, it felt like the beginning could\'ve been more blended to the more despairing episodes that come after. It felt a bit more sudden than what it could\'ve. It\'s somewhat predictable too as a whole, but I\'ve already known the aftermath of these events, so I suppose it can\'t really be helped.This kind of goes back to the characters, and maybe I\'m not so forgiving for unrealistic scenarios, but these characters don\'t make sense. When you see someone you care about get killed, you won\'t follow the killer and do what she wishes, right? You\'d either plot revenge or try to move on, almost ignoring what had happened. Or something else. Just not follow the one who murdered someone you care about. Also, some of these character\'s motives, their passion, are somewhat strange. One character is so passionate about making an anime to the point of sleepless nights, skipping school entirely, and acting like a high-strung, insane, desperate person. It seems like none of these characters are normal, which is kind of the thing Danganronpa has, but IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR A SANE PERSON? And no, I don\'t want just the principal, that old man, and that drunk guy! And Junko, control yourself! (I was joking, don\'t stone me)When I watched this, I was starting to expect two things: more explanation for Enoshima Junko\'s motives, and more story to Kamukura Izuru. I honestly didn\'t get much from either, at least, things I didn\'t already know. Kamukura was okay, but Junko felt so stupid to me. Like, is she just evil because she\'s just evil? She looks like a fool, honestly. I liked her in the 1st and 2nd games because she wasn\'t that big of a character, sort of, but now that she\'s a more appearing character, with her actions open like a book, it feels like she just does ridiculous things just because. And it feels stupid! No backstory, just because. And she has everything her way.But then again, WWII happened, and this might be somewhat the same deal.P R O SI could go on for a while regarding the good points. Again, seeing SD2\'s characters animated was real fun to watch. I was especially curious about Komaeda Nagito, Hajime Hinata and Nanami Chiaki. And, in case you haven\'t noticed, I watched this first before Future Arc, and finished it first too.What I got from this was pleasantly some Ikusaba Mukuro, which for some reason I didn\'t expect that much of. Even though her character was somewhat dissed off, I got to see her devotion to her sister and sides of her I otherwise wouldn\'t have seen. I also found more importance in Chiaki. Not that she wasn\'t important to the second game, but I always thought she was a little strange and off. Seeing her hope throughout this anime, in the midst of despair, was impressive. I also enjoyed most of the characters, as they kept this anime light, mostly.As for the little tidbits, I think I see most of the characters in Despair Arc in Future Arc. Since they aired around the same time, I could switch back and forth if I wanted, and I found that doing so will explain things in the Future Arc. It\'ll explain some bad and good relationships between characters there. I also appreciated the cameos of the characters in Danganronpa 1.And the art, along with the music. I was majorly impressed. The animation was well done, and the art was consistent, and effort is shown in that department. It seemed like the games\' tone was split in half, creating the tones of the Despair and Future arcs. The signature pink blood remained, but the colors were much brighter and lighter. As the story progressed, the colors did change, and oh my gosh the opening changes as you watch, I loved that. It just got darker and darker, and I was warned in the beginning that the story will end in despair, but still-- it\'s so enticing! And hearing Komaeda\'s VA sing the ED was heavenly.At first, I didn\'t really like the OP and ED, and that was because it didn\'t feel Danganronpa-like. It didn\'t have that jazz-pop feel that I adored. But it started to grow on me, and it made me realize that the despairing events occur midway of this anime, so it was appropriate. Midway, the soundtrack does switch a bit more to the familiar tunes you often get with Monokuma, so I\'m satisfied.C L O S U R EThis is probably the longest review I\'ve written, but I literally just finished this anime and it\'s Saturday. I\'ve yet to finish the Future Arc, and I know I probably spoiled some things without realizing it, but it\'s nothing explicit and in fact, you should expect the above things already? It\'s Danganronpa, wake up.I think this animation was amazingly done, compared to the first season. This isn\'t based off of any game, just shows events outside of the games. I\'m glad the creators made that choice, though, as these events aren\'t exactly game-material and more for something like this. As I learn more and more about Danganronpa\'s story like how Once Upon A Time shows it (present to past, to present, to past), it\'s like more puzzle pieces are coming and eventually, will show a masterpiece.I can\'t wait for that day, when I know all of it. Hope will triumph over despair, you guys. ;)Story: 7Art: 9Sound: 8Character: 6Enjoyment: 8Overall: 38/50 ~ 76% ~ 8/10 talking about the 3rd Despair Arc?

Also quick disclaimer, you should have absolutely played the first two games before watching these.In the despair arc the anime follows the characters of the 2nd game taking place when they first join Hope\'s Peak Academy before the events of either game. The show starts off fairly slow and laid back but don\'t be...fooled because the show only gets darker and darker as it progresses, you may think you\'ve hit the peak of despair in one episode then BAM the despair hits even harder later on until we eventually hit ""The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History"".Coming into this season I was really wondering how well they would portray the characters because I absolutely loved the cast from the 2nd game and let me say they did a spot on job capturing the unique quirkiness of all of them, right down to Mikans incredible clumsiness, Akanes never ending hunger, Hiyokos total bitchiness towards Mikan, TeruTerus pervertedness and etc. The show also does a great job throwing in nice little tidbits of information/back story at you through out, stuff like Hiyokos random growth spurt, where the Ultimate Imposter comes from and the relationship between Junko & Mukuro. Overall they do a great job with the characters and the character development, they are absolutely the shining point of this show.Now like I said the show starts off slow but very quickly changes into a never ending ride on the despair train with no brakes. But with that being said it never stops being entertaining to watch, whether it was watching the shenanigans of the 2nd games cast, the interactions between Junko and basically everyone else whether she be in a playful mode with her sister Mukuro or being in total despair mode and ruining the lives of everyone else. Now I will say there was one point in the show that was so dark it actually left me feeling pretty upset, since most of you should have played the 2nd game before watching this you should have known that a certain event will take place and let me just say this, prepare yourselves because I certainly was not but I do give the show props because they must be doing something right if they can make me feel this deeply about it.In the end the show does a good job rapping this prequel story up and sets things up nicely to roll into the 1st games plot. Now while it did end things off nicely, that\'s not quite it for the story, for those who\'ve been paying attention to the news you should already know but a new ""Hope"" arc has been announced and is said to be the end all of the story. Now that I am done with this I am definitely pretty hyped for the end of the story, although perhaps a little sad too having this big story come to an end that had me so captivated through out but all in all I do have high \'hope\' for a great ending.Overall, I really enjoyed the show, my fairly high expectations coming into this season were not let down. I guess I should also take quick note that the art is nothing special but certainly nothing bad and the music is great (aslong as you liked the soundtrack to the 2nd game that is). To anyone who enjoys the games even a little I highly recommend you watch this anime! fooled because the show only gets darker and darker as it progresses, you may think you\'ve hit the peak of despair in one episode then BAM the despair hits even harder later on until we eventually hit ""The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History"".Coming into this season I was really wondering how well they would portray the characters because I absolutely loved the cast from the 2nd game and let me say they did a spot on job capturing the unique quirkiness of all of them, right down to Mikans incredible clumsiness, Akanes never ending hunger, Hiyokos total bitchiness towards Mikan, TeruTerus pervertedness and etc. The show also does a great job throwing in nice little tidbits of information/back story at you through out, stuff like Hiyokos random growth spurt, where the Ultimate Imposter comes from and the relationship between Junko & Mukuro.

To anyone who enjoys the games even a little I highly recommend you watch this anime!', 'Of you come because you wanna know what was before Danganronpa 1st story...If you think that the Despair was great an Danganronpa, well this anime it\'s like the factorial, Despair gets exponentially augmented by the past...Before start, I really recommend you play at least Super Danganronpa 2, because this anime, although it was created to explain why Kiboumine Gakuen end like it is in the future, at the same time it could explain all more in detail connecting points that Danganronpa and Super Danganronpa 2 left behind, the most important, the class relations and situations.First things first, the characters that you will see here principally...are the protagonist of Super Danganronpa 2, the Psycho Tropical squad at their start, each one resembles of course the students at the first anime, but each one has his own abilities and together have a new path so, you gonna feel a fresh class with the help of some another students and persons of interest that would be necessary for some information in the Mirai-Hen.The scenarios are truly more of a more polished Kiboumine Gakuen, but all conserve the air of the past stories, in essence, more like the first story.The sound and BGMs are from the 2nd game in almost all the cases, so if you played the game, you gonna feel a great environment and super nostalgic feel that gonna boost all the story and situations.Connect and explain, those 2 points maybe are this review conclusion but the anime is the idea that give you since the beginning, so if you follow the steps of see 1 Mirai-hen chapter and 1 Zetsubou-Hen chapter, you gonna be full prepared for Kibou-Hen end and of course to say: ""At last, all have sense!"".This is all I think, playing the games is not mandatory but recommended, you can\'t miss those hours on enjoyment, to enjoy this to the 100%, if you feel this review with hope or maybe despair, anyway thank you to reach this point, and happy anime (and maybe gaming) and may the hope light your way to the Happy End! are the protagonist of Super Danganronpa 2, the Psycho Tropical squad at their start, each one resembles of course the students at the first anime, but each one has his own abilities and together have a new path so, you gonna feel a fresh class with the help of some another students and persons of interest that would be necessary for some information in the Mirai-Hen.The scenarios are truly more of a more polished Kiboumine Gakuen, but all conserve the air of the past stories, in essence, more like the first story.The sound and BGMs are from the 2nd game in almost all the cases, so if you played the game, you gonna feel a great environment and super nostalgic feel that gonna boost all the story and situations.Connect and explain, those 2 points maybe are this review conclusion but the anime is the idea that give you since the beginning, so if you follow the steps of see 1 Mirai-hen chapter and 1 Zetsubou-Hen chapter, you gonna be full prepared for Kibou-Hen end and of course to say: ""At last, all have sense!"".This is all I think, playing the games is not mandatory but recommended, you can\'t miss those hours on enjoyment, to enjoy this to the 100%, if you feel this review with hope or maybe despair, anyway thank you to reach this point, and happy anime (and maybe gaming) and may the hope light your way to the Happy End!', 'Starting my first review, I want to make some things clear. First of all, this isn\'t a good anime. It\'s not even decent, despite my score. Danganronpa 3 is just bad. If you didn\'t play the game, you probably won\'t understand anything. And if you did play it, you will probably end up disappointed, just like me. Secondly, it\'s this type of anime that is just poorly arranged. It has plot holes and doesn\'t offer anything that haven\'t been in this universe before. Also there will be spoilers from the rest of the series. Okay, let\'s start the proper review.Danganronpa 3 was supposed to...be supplement for both Danganronpa 1 and 2. Yet it failed miserably. Well, maybe not exactly, since you do get the reasons why some characters went bad, and you do get to see Twilight Syndrome Murder Case, student council massacre and the rise of Izuru Kamukura. But it\'s neither well-written nor interesting. Everyone expected that anime adaptation of Twilight Syndrome Murder Case will be something with a huge impact on the characters, something tragic, something that could lead to despair. In the anime this major problem was solved in one episode, which presents almost nothing that we wouldn\'t know from game. It also doesn\'t seem like anyone remembered it for more than two weeks.So how about main plot? Do we get to see an interesting manipulation that leads class 77 to despair side? Yes, we do get to see what leaded to despair. And it\'s probably the biggest flaw in this anime. It\'s just so disappointing and became objects of many memes. Seriously, I\'d never thought that main flaw in Danganropa would be plot. But how about other things? Maybe we get something interesting like interactions between DR1 characters and DR2 characters? Or maybe DR/Zero characters appear? Maybe even a Hope Peak\'s Elementary? No, no, no, don\'t count on it. The whole DR/Zero is completely ignor- oh no, I forgot that they\'ve shown two characters for like 5 seconds and that\'s it. Only the first two episodes were about characters, and they were honestly the best ones.Class 77, despite being main characters, is mostly absent, aside for fan favourites like Komaeda or Chiaki, but I didn\'t care about them. Why would I? Chiaki became perfect waifu that only plays games and is good-looking. And obviously every character likes her. Nagito on the other hand, while being an overally interesting character, has ""power of luck"" and talks about hope non-stop. He didn\'t change at all. Sometimes Mikan or Ultimate Impostor appear, but only UI gets development. Mikan only serves a cheap fanservice purpose here, which made me hate her even more. In the second half there also appears Junko Enoshima and her sister Mukuro Ikusaba, the 16th student, lying somewhere hidden in the school, the one that\'s called the ultimate despair. It\'s nice to see our main antagonist back, but instead of making her intelligent and ruthless manipulant, like she was in the game, she became an unoriginal and boring Joker-like villian. She just lost her charm.The rest of the ""main characters"" almost don\'t appear in show, which is another reason why I don\'t like this anime. Why not include more of Ibuki, another fan favourite? Why not explain Hiyoko\'s or Mikan\'s background? Why does Mahiru act like a completely different person? Seriously, it\'s just wasted potential. So what about new characters? In Zetsubou-hen most important new characters are Chisa Yukizome - teacher in Hope Peak - Juzo Sakakura (former ultimate boxer) and Ryouta Mitarai, another ultimate student. The first one is a typical, energetic teacher that could appear in any other anime. Frankly, I didn\'t quite care about her. I won\'t write anything about Juzo, because he\'s probably the best character in this anime and his story is alright. The last one, Mitarai is a whinny, weak person, whose biggest passion is anime. He\'s also one of the reason why the plot is so bad. There are also a few others like Munakata, but I\'ll write about him in my Mirai-hen review. I appreciate the fact that they tried to create new characters, but I still prefer the old cast.I really don\'t care about graphic, but for me it\'s decent. There are some flaws in animation but I didn\'t notice them while watching or I just simply ignored them. The music is really nice to listen to. There are some familiar tracks that every fan will recognize. Opening is also really pleasant to the ear. As for ending - sung by Megumi Ogata - it\'s not bad, but it\'s not my favourite either. Like every adaptation should, this one does include the original VAs. They are as good as always, despite being on screen for a short time.So did I enjoyed this? While it was airing, yes. But only because of threads on 4chan or other websites and that I hoped it will have something that I mentioned earlier. Well, maybe hype ruined it, but I don\'t think so. It was supposed to be about class 77, relationship between them, their backstory and how they ended up as the bad guys. They tried, but failed. And now, after the year has passed, I can say that I didn\'t enjoyed it. be supplement for both Danganronpa 1 and 2. Yet it failed miserably.

It also doesn\'t seem like anyone remembered it for more than two weeks.So how about main plot? Do we get to see an interesting manipulation that leads class 77 to despair side? Yes, we do get to see what leaded to despair. And it\'s probably the biggest flaw in this anime. It\'s just so disappointing and became objects of many memes. Seriously, I\'d never thought that main flaw in Danganropa would be plot. But how about other things? Maybe we get something interesting like interactions between DR1 characters and DR2 characters? Or maybe DR/Zero characters appear? Maybe even a Hope Peak\'s Elementary? No, no, no, don\'t count on it. The whole DR/Zero is completely ignor- oh no, I forgot that they\'ve shown two characters for like 5 seconds and that\'s it. Only the first two episodes were about characters, and they were honestly the best ones.Class 77, despite being main characters, is mostly absent, aside for fan favourites like Komaeda or Chiaki, but I didn\'t care about them. Why would I? Chiaki became perfect waifu that only plays games and is good-looking. And obviously every character likes her. Nagito on the other hand, while being an overally interesting character, has ""power of luck"" and talks about hope non-stop. He didn\'t change at all. Sometimes Mikan or Ultimate Impostor appear, but only UI gets development. Mikan only serves a cheap fanservice purpose here, which made me hate her even more. In the second half there also appears Junko Enoshima and her sister Mukuro Ikusaba, the 16th student, lying somewhere hidden in the school, the one that\'s called the ultimate despair. It\'s nice to see our main antagonist back, but instead of making her intelligent and ruthless manipulant, like she was in the game, she became an unoriginal and boring Joker-like villian. She just lost her charm.The rest of the ""main characters"" almost don\'t appear in show, which is another reason why I don\'t like this anime. Why not include more of Ibuki, another fan favourite? Why not explain Hiyoko\'s or Mikan\'s background? Why does Mahiru act like a completely different person? Seriously, it\'s just wasted potential. So what about new characters? In Zetsubou-hen most important new characters are Chisa Yukizome - teacher in Hope Peak - Juzo Sakakura (former ultimate boxer) and Ryouta Mitarai, another ultimate student. The first one is a typical, energetic teacher that could appear in any other anime. Frankly, I didn\'t quite care about her. I won\'t write anything about Juzo, because he\'s probably the best character in this anime and his story is alright. The last one, Mitarai is a whinny, weak person, whose biggest passion is anime. He\'s also one of the reason why the plot is so bad. There are also a few others like Munakata, but I\'ll write about him in my Mirai-hen review. I appreciate the fact that they tried to create new characters, but I still prefer the old cast.I really don\'t care about graphic, but for me it\'s decent. There are some flaws in animation but I didn\'t notice them while watching or I just simply ignored them. The music is really nice to listen to. There are some familiar tracks that every fan will recognize. Opening is also really pleasant to the ear. As for ending - sung by Megumi Ogata - it\'s not bad, but it\'s not my favourite either. Like every adaptation should, this one does include the original VAs. They are as good as always, despite being on screen for a short time.So did I enjoyed this? While it was airing, yes. But only because of threads on 4chan or other websites and that I hoped it will have something that I mentioned earlier. Well, maybe hype ruined it, but I don\'t think so. It was supposed to be about class 77, relationship between them, their backstory and how they ended up as the bad guys. They tried, but failed. And now, after the year has passed, I can say that I didn\'t enjoyed it.', 'The prequel has ended, and as the the anime franchise ends, it was a bit of a disappointment when, this anime ends with some plot hole at it\'s Kibou-hen arc.So, let\'s get down to my review business of this prequel:Storywise, I give it a 7 over 10, though this prequel did performed as what the synopsis said it was, thought there were still some plot holes in this prequel, like how can such video created by Mitarai cause some Hysteria among the students of the reserve course, and how was Junko able to know who to go for her master plan. Also, scene like how...Peko killed Sato wasn\'t added that would have give some spice to this anime\'s story line. Let\'s not forget as to how exaggerated the character\'s were, like why would a school like Hope Peak dabble in human experiments like cearting someone like Izuru Kamukura, when it would be better off if they make a super computer that is an advance form of AI.Art, If I were to choose who\'s the coolest among the characters in terms of illustration , I\'d say, Junko would be one of them, followed by Chisa, MUnakata, Hajime and Sonia, the rest were just too plain or too dorky likeSouda,Gundam, Ibuki, Seiko, Andou, Peko, Yuuto, Hanamaru, Izayoi and Mikan  who were the dorksters. Others like Nidai and Owari were a league of their own which was just too rugged, btw the only fanservice one would see is Owari at the anime\'s opening. The rest were just too plain and having said that this category is a 7 over 10.Sound, ok, some of the character\'s here weren\'t suppose to sound like adults, like Gundam, Owari, Sonia and Seiko, they all sounded very much like grown ups, but I still like some of the seiyuus who did their voices, some of the character\'s sounded too girlish, like with Mikan,Hanamaru, Andou and Miharu. of course there are thsoe who sounded just right given the character\'s characteristics, like Nidai, Chisa, Sato andIbuki. Though, generally speaking the seiyuus who did the character\'s voice were ok, I\'m still gonna go for a 7 over 10.Characters, I were a Mensa member( organization of people with high IQ), I would be giving this anime/manga/game original creator, Kodaka, Kazutaka a piece of my mind, let\'s face it the characters were very much overly done that the concept of them being this Super High School Level thingkinda makes them more of an oxymoron, I mean how can such talented people be given the superlative of either Super level or Ultimate, also since when does being a House keeper have such title, when the character\'s occupation itself was more of a vocation than a skill or a talent, in fact such superlatives contradicts the character\'s themselves, let\'s go over them:Junko Enoshima the Super High School Level Fashion Diva, Super High School Level Despair / Super High School Level Analyst and her lackey Mukuro Ikusaba a so called Super High School Level Soldier. one is nothing more than a megalomaniac psychopath,  her character is one big plot-hole, since we never got to know as to why she became like that, while the other is more of a henchman than a soldier, I meant she only has a knife , but no guns,we also never get to know her past, since in the first Danganronpa, she was killed off instantly.....( I don\'t know if she has any background info about her from the manga).Nagito ""The Servant"" Komaeda, the  Super High School-Level Luck, Really, luck is a talent? Man, his character was just sooo lame, should he even be in this thing? gosh, if he\'s that lucky maybe they should have made him as this Super Level Gambler, wtf was the original creator thinking?Hajime Hinata the reserve course student,a.k.a Izuru Kamukura, tsk, tsk, tsk, he should be this super level envious guy, since he just entered into something that he already has, being the protagonist.Chiaki Nanami the Super High-school Level Gamer, the 1st of 77th class to die. Yuuto Kamishiro the Super High School Level Secret Agent a fat guy who for a while pretended to be Mitarai.  Ibuki Mioda a Super High-school Level Light Music Club a girl masochistic tendency after becoming one of the remnants of despair. Sonia Nevermind the Super High-school Level Princess, ok so where is her title , bodyguards and crown? some princess she was, she hardly does anything, super level primadona is what she should be.HA! Should all be classified as super level lazy bones or loiterers, since what they do was very much what a lazy bone would do, waste their time for nothing.Ryouta Mitarai, the Ultimate Animator, the chicken shit who created the despair video for Junko and Mikan Tsumiki, the weak link and a so called Super High-school Level Nurse, should both be classified as super level pussies, cu\'z their both pussies, except one is a smart pussy, and the other is a stupid pussy.Kazuichi Souda the  Super High-school Level Mechanic, Gundam ""Forbidden One"" Tanaka a so called  Super High-school Level Animal Breeder with an  eccentric and rather dark personality and Teruteru Hanamura the fat guy, with a masochistic tendency,. who happens to be this Super High-school Level Cookshould all be classified as the ultimate oddball trio, who probably should all see  a shrink.Nekomaru ""Mechamaru"" Nidai the Super High-school Level Coach and big eater ,  Akane Owari a Super High-school Level Gymnast and Nidai\'s sparring partner also big eater, should be in a relationship and have the title the super level fighting duo, in fact they should be duking out with Peko and Makuro, too bad, creator, Kodaka, Kazutaka did thought of it.Hiyoko Saionji the Super High-school Level Classical Dancer, how the fuck did she grew up fast after 6 months?  Mahiru Koizumi the Super High-school Level Photographer, both should be called the ultimate wall flowers, since they\'re just for display without any function at all.Let\'s not forget the Ultimate kick-out trio:Ruruka Andou the Ultimate Confectioner who got got kicked out of Hope peak, along with Seiko Kimura the Ultimate Pharmacist and Sounosuke Izayoi the Ultimate Blacksmith, who is also Andou\'s man bitch. Whose skills and talents should not be in a high school but in college, spoiler, since they got kick out before Junko\'s Despair scheme , they never become part of the Remnants of Despair , never the less in Mirai-hen they\'re no different at all from the Remnants of Despair. But I kinda like them, since in the end they turn against each other, but it\'s a pity that Sieko live as a sucker and she died as a sucker, all because she can\'t say no to Andou, so she should have the title as the super level high school sucker, as for Andou, she should also have the title ultimate manipulator since in the most part all she does is manipulate everyone most specially Seiko and her man bitch Izayoi. Izayoi n the other hand should be this ultimate sacrificial lamb, since he\'s just too stupid to let himself be manipulated by Andou.Peko Pekoyama the Super High-school Level Swords-woman, Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu\'s bodyguard/ hit-woman and Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu the Super High-school Level Gangster, both belong to the category of super level crminals in prison, since that\'s where the two should belong and not in Hope Peak Academy.And lastly:Chisa Yukizome the teacher of 77th class of Hope Peak Academy and the Ultimate Housekeeper, HOUSEKEEPER?! is someone who can be classified as the Ultimate WTF. Her role as a plain teacher would have been enough, but giving her such superlatives is crazy.Kyousuke Munakata the vice-leader of Future Foundation and the head of the 2nd Division, who once held the title of  Ultimate Student Council President when he was a student at Hope Peak, was pretty much a well suited antihero and so as his gay admirer, Juuzou Sakakura the Ultimate Boxer,  leader of the 6th Division and in control of the Special Crime Investigation Unit. In this prequel I kinda hate that they failed to anticipate such mayhem that has ravage the school and the world, where one would have wish that they should have deal with Junko in the first palce if it weren\'t for Juuzo\'s chicken shit secret that Junko has over him.So, for this category I give it a 3 over 10, since in this prequel nobody is the protagonist, every character here are an antagonist , and such oxymoronic concept of them is something I really hate.Enjoyment, I give it an 8 over 10, despite of the character\'s oxymoronic concept , this is one episode that one would enjoy from the start to the end, also the them about despair vs hope would really get to you, But.............Overall, it may have an pen ending given that this is a prequel, but , not getting Junko in the first place by Juuzo, is a disappointment, so this prequel is good  but not that good, so it\'s a 7 over 10. then again the Kibou-hen makes up for this prequel\'s short coming, but that\'s another review.FU,FU,FU,FUUU!!!!! Peko killed Sato wasn\'t added that would have give some spice to this anime\'s story line.

However, I was completely let down with the story line. I felt that the story was completely rushed. Also that certain aspects of the plot jut didn\'t make sense. For example most of the characters are in high school and all of these ""awful & tragic"" things were happening. I started to think were are these kids parent or guardian. (Even though...anime is not restricted, if an anime decides to use a certain genre in the story there are certain aspect and expectations that are group with that).Art & Sound-  The art was modern, however at some points video game visuals appeared. Sound was also good.Character- Their was a character for ever type of personality. I liked how some of the characters were relatable. Their personalities really compliments each other. However no one character stood put from the pack and made a personal impression on me. Nonetheless, they all have a role to play.Enjoyment- I didn\'t enjoy this anime because I felt that it was so bland and didn\'t make sense. I found myself watching it not because I wanted too but because I had nothing else to do.Overall- I only watched this anime due to the fact that I have seen the first Danganronpa. I essentially just wanted clarification on certain aspects of that anime. Even though this anime did give an explanation, I felt that they just pulled it out of thin air.

Complete let down.', ""This anime should NOT be watched before playing DR1 and DR2.This anime SHOULD be watched alongside Mirai-hen one episode at a time.DR3 appeals to quite a niche audience and they'll watch it regardless of how good it is. I know I did. Let's face it, as an anime, Zetsubou-hen is pretty mediocre and decent at best, but the story it set out to tell is still as interesting as a Danganronpa story should be. Unfortunately though, I have to review this as an anime.Zetsubou-hen is equipped with fully realized characters and a good outline of a story, but its execution is...pretty poor. A lot of...it is just exposition with meager attempts to convey emotion via mundane dialogues, lacking in any sense of stakes or scale and full of cliches. The characters are treated as plot device and less as actual human beings, those of class 77 especially. The anime spends most of its time holding our hands through every bit of detail in the story, expecting us to not be able to pick them up ourselves. Frankly, I had this issue with the games as well, but it wasn't nearly as apparent then.The anime appears to be a show of a turn-of-events and just that; history. Scenes are drawn out past their relevance and feel pointless where they could've been used to build characters past what we already know about them. The story rises with mostly slow pacing to a dissatisfying payoff, and most of the enjoyment was makeshift inside my head by analyzing the story and characters way past what the anime could've possibly intended.Expect cheap animations, sub-par screenplay, nice but underused characters, and some classic DR fanservice. If you're not into DR, why bother. If you've played or read DR material before, treat this as a 12-episode cutscene instead. It'll give you some closure to questions and loose ends you probably have, but that's the only incentive I can think of.Loved the opening song though.

Also <3 Junko xoxo"", 'I was jumping for joy upon the reveal of Danganronpa 3. I had fallen deeply in love with the murder mystery novel series. Then when Despair Arc was revealed I was even more ecstatic since Danganronpa 2 was my favorite. So watching this series completely and utterly broke my heart. It\'d be one thing if it was a pointless and mediocre addition to the franchise but this anime actually brings down the quality of other entries into this series. I plan to review the other two ""Arcs"" of this anime as well but I\'m gonna start with my most hated one. Also if you haven\'t...played the games of Danganronpa I would recommend turning back since I\'m operating under the assumption that you\'ve played them. So with that said time to startStory 1/10The story of Danganronpa 3 Despair Arc is of the 77th class falling into despair. At least that\'s what it says on the tin. While that is detailed in a way that... I\'ll get to later, the story is focused more on the tragedy in general. Although the start to that doesn\'t begin until halfway in. The first half is focused more on plot points that go nowhere, big moments from the games that are forgotten and one of the stupidest possible reasons for Hinata taking the Kamukura project. I won\'t spoil it but... It\'s bad. But ok that\'s only the first half so how\'s the second half? Worse. The more the story goes, the more huge holes are formed and very few are addressed, in ways that feel half-hearted. Not to mention there is one plot point in particular which is probably one of the most enraging. I won\'t get into it now, because it contains spoilers for the anime, and it\'s a long rant but I\'ve decided to give it a whole paragraph to itself later on, so look forward to that.Characters 4/10Of the characters shown in Danganronpa 3 the strongest performance comes from previously unestablished characters. For the most part they are  likeable and fun, my favorites being the ultimate mom friend Chisa, the sweet cinnamon roll Seiko, the suave Kizakura and Juzo Sakakura a canonically LGBT character. Good on you guys. But the returning characters... Well, let\'s just say I have THOUGHTS on them. First of all let\'s start with the DR2 characters this was advertised as being the story of. They are made into side characters at best and plot devices at worst, and their interesting personalities and backstories were stripped away and instead their characters all consist of a single personality trait. But none have it as bad as Chiaki Nanami. Chiaki for poorly explained reasons that serve to take a massive dump on Chihiro and negate a lot of her own development is a human now, and other than design and name she is nothing like her AI counterpart. She\'s so devoid of personality or development, and is even acts like less of a good person than the AI. The only reason we are given to like her is the connection to her AI. This also applies to her scenes with Hajime and GOOD LORD do they mess this up. Unlike the game, Hajime and Chiaki share zero chemistry, and we\'re supposed to buy it, like ""yeah, this is believable."" As Hajime is reduced to a whiny angst machine, and have his entire motivation and character rewritten to revolve around her, a lot like the rest of the cast. Mukuro Ikusaba is now incestuous even though she was never like that, Izuru Kamukura had a good run up until the end where they utterly fucked it up, rewriting his motives for the sake of his waifu, and then there\'s Junko. Oh Junko. Once a charismatic, manipulative, and utterly horrifying demon, is now just a sadistic valley girl who ran into someone at the right place and time. They say she ended the world stealthily and quietly, but this girl is about as subtle as a trainwreck marching around with her plans in broad daylight, and building elaborate torture dungeons under the school that somehow nobody found. Even some of the new characters are poorly handled. Ryota Mitarai is written with such a lack of personality, and is only a plot device. I did not care about him or want to see him overcome hardship. In fact considering his contribution to the plot I would gladly punch him in the face.Art 6/10Although it\'s not as gorgeous to look at as the Future Arc, and it has errors far too often, I enjoyed the animation and art direction. Plus bonus points for keeping the pink blood that Future Arc tossed away. I wouldn\'t call it amazing but it\'s certainly a likeable art style, and special points to the opening which looks amazing to start and then changes its coloring halfway through to a darker and more forbidding style. I love that.Sound 9/10The catchy opening, the lovely ambient music or Mukuros cover of Tsubasa wo Kudasai, is all pure ear candy and I love it. And the seiyuus for the Japanese cast do a lovely job (Although I haven\'t watched the full English dub so I can\'t speak for them.) I can\'t think of many complaints in this regardEnjoyment 2/10This show is honestly hard to watch. Due to everything being in Junkos point of view from the second half forward all plot twists are told to us before they happen, and there were times I had to legitimately shut off an episode because oh my god, the games weren\'t exactly free of gruesome moments but they NEVER took it this far. It goes too far, and many of these scenes can be done without. There\'s also the pure anger that was felt watching something I love reduced to this god awful writing. There were episodes that were completely pointless, and the entire thing is so clearly written with such a lack of soul, it\'s hard to feel yourself getting to invested eitherOk, so this is that paragraph dedicated to that one plot point I was talking about. If you don\'t want to spoil yourself just scroll down to my overall. If not then... Here goes.So apparently Junko Enoshima did not make the Super Danganronpa 2 characters fall into despair one by one using her wit, charm, and power to lead anybody to Despair. She made them watch a brainwashing video! Haha... Hahaha (flips table) this isn\'t just lazy writing. This is something that utterly destroys so much of what the series has created. No longer do the struggles of the Danganronpa 2 characters to come to grips with their past selves, or the shock ""oh my god, they have done awful things."" matter because they were brainwashed. No longer does the message of being able to change yourself even if you\'ve done wrong, a story of redemption and growth, an amazing moral matter because the only way to do wrong is through brainwashing. No longer is Junko a powerful and fearful woman who charmed people to her side to do her bidding, an absolute menace able to drive anyone into Despairful madness enough to drag the world down. She brainwashed a bunch of kids to cause destruction without putting effort in, even though Despair is the one thing she WOULD put effort in. She loved proving that anyone can and will fall into despair, that hope is fleeting but I guess she doesn\'t care now and is just a splatter villain. This whole plot point is a mess and destroys so much of what the series stands for.Overall 3/10This anime is an insult to the franichise I hold dearly, and a terrible send off to the Hopes Peak Saga. An amazing story suddenly turned into a terrible mess with one fell sweep. I could try saying something myself but I think Chisa Yukizome summarized the experience the best ""This is a tale of hope, that ends in Despair."" played the games of Danganronpa I would recommend turning back since I\'m operating under the assumption that you\'ve played them. So with that said time to startStory 1/10The story of Danganronpa 3 Despair Arc is of the 77th class falling into despair. At least that\'s what it says on the tin. While that is detailed in a way that... I\'ll get to later, the story is focused more on the tragedy in general. Although the start to that doesn\'t begin until halfway in. The first half is focused more on plot points that go nowhere, big moments from the games that are forgotten and one of the stupidest possible reasons for Hinata taking the Kamukura project. I won\'t spoil it but... It\'s bad. But ok that\'s only the first half so how\'s the second half? Worse. The more the story goes, the more huge holes are formed and very few are addressed, in ways that feel half-hearted. Not to mention there is one plot point in particular which is probably one of the most enraging. I won\'t get into it now, because it contains spoilers for the anime, and it\'s a long rant but I\'ve decided to give it a whole paragraph to itself later on, so look forward to that.Characters 4/10Of the characters shown in Danganronpa 3 the strongest performance comes from previously unestablished characters. For the most part they are  likeable and fun, my favorites being the ultimate mom friend Chisa, the sweet cinnamon roll Seiko, the suave Kizakura and Juzo Sakakura a canonically LGBT character. Good on you guys. But the returning characters... Well, let\'s just say I have THOUGHTS on them. First of all let\'s start with the DR2 characters this was advertised as being the story of. They are made into side characters at best and plot devices at worst, and their interesting personalities and backstories were stripped away and instead their characters all consist of a single personality trait. But none have it as bad as Chiaki Nanami. Chiaki for poorly explained reasons that serve to take a massive dump on Chihiro and negate a lot of her own development is a human now, and other than design and name she is nothing like her AI counterpart. She\'s so devoid of personality or development, and is even acts like less of a good person than the AI. The only reason we are given to like her is the connection to her AI. This also applies to her scenes with Hajime and GOOD LORD do they mess this up. Unlike the game, Hajime and Chiaki share zero chemistry, and we\'re supposed to buy it, like ""yeah, this is believable."" As Hajime is reduced to a whiny angst machine, and have his entire motivation and character rewritten to revolve around her, a lot like the rest of the cast. Mukuro Ikusaba is now incestuous even though she was never like that, Izuru Kamukura had a good run up until the end where they utterly fucked it up, rewriting his motives for the sake of his waifu, and then there\'s Junko. Oh Junko. Once a charismatic, manipulative, and utterly horrifying demon, is now just a sadistic valley girl who ran into someone at the right place and time. They say she ended the world stealthily and quietly, but this girl is about as subtle as a trainwreck marching around with her plans in broad daylight, and building elaborate torture dungeons under the school that somehow nobody found. Even some of the new characters are poorly handled. Ryota Mitarai is written with such a lack of personality, and is only a plot device. I did not care about him or want to see him overcome hardship. In fact considering his contribution to the plot I would gladly punch him in the face.Art 6/10Although it\'s not as gorgeous to look at as the Future Arc, and it has errors far too often, I enjoyed the animation and art direction. Plus bonus points for keeping the pink blood that Future Arc tossed away. I wouldn\'t call it amazing but it\'s certainly a likeable art style, and special points to the opening which looks amazing to start and then changes its coloring halfway through to a darker and more forbidding style. I love that.Sound 9/10The catchy opening, the lovely ambient music or Mukuros cover of Tsubasa wo Kudasai, is all pure ear candy and I love it. And the seiyuus for the Japanese cast do a lovely job (Although I haven\'t watched the full English dub so I can\'t speak for them.) I can\'t think of many complaints in this regardEnjoyment 2/10This show is honestly hard to watch. Due to everything being in Junkos point of view from the second half forward all plot twists are told to us before they happen, and there were times I had to legitimately shut off an episode because oh my god, the games weren\'t exactly free of gruesome moments but they NEVER took it this far. It goes too far, and many of these scenes can be done without. There\'s also the pure anger that was felt watching something I love reduced to this god awful writing. There were episodes that were completely pointless, and the entire thing is so clearly written with such a lack of soul, it\'s hard to feel yourself getting to invested eitherOk, so this is that paragraph dedicated to that one plot point I was talking about. If you don\'t want to spoil yourself just scroll down to my overall. If not then... Here goes.So apparently Junko Enoshima did not make the Super Danganronpa 2 characters fall into despair one by one using her wit, charm, and power to lead anybody to Despair. She made them watch a brainwashing video! Haha... Hahaha (flips table) this isn\'t just lazy writing. This is something that utterly destroys so much of what the series has created. No longer do the struggles of the Danganronpa 2 characters to come to grips with their past selves, or the shock ""oh my god, they have done awful things."" matter because they were brainwashed. No longer does the message of being able to change yourself even if you\'ve done wrong, a story of redemption and growth, an amazing moral matter because the only way to do wrong is through brainwashing. No longer is Junko a powerful and fearful woman who charmed people to her side to do her bidding, an absolute menace able to drive anyone into Despairful madness enough to drag the world down. She brainwashed a bunch of kids to cause destruction without putting effort in, even though Despair is the one thing she WOULD put effort in. She loved proving that anyone can and will fall into despair, that hope is fleeting but I guess she doesn\'t care now and is just a splatter villain. This whole plot point is a mess and destroys so much of what the series stands for.Overall 3/10This anime is an insult to the franichise I hold dearly, and a terrible send off to the Hopes Peak Saga. An amazing story suddenly turned into a terrible mess with one fell sweep. I could try saying something myself but I think Chisa Yukizome summarized the experience the best ""This is a tale of hope, that ends in Despair.""', ""I don't I love Danganronpa its an amazing fun game, something I never played before. The second game is my favorite and I am hoping the third is amazing to. I just love the characters these characters are amazing, its just amazing with the reveals of them being the villians, its pretty interesting..... then theres this anime.I watched the first bit 3 episodes. Now thats it finished I was to lazy to watch all 11 because I don't want these characters ruined for me. I heard a lot of bad things about this seen a lot of cool and dumb scenes. I don't know its...just dropped instantly for me.The story is so screwed up beacuse they force in the future side to. So the whole thing of having A LOT of stuff in despair and future side. Is a problem. Like theres just to much. I just skipped right to the end nothing special. I don't know, Danganronpa they could of done a great story then a back story before the third game comes out. It would of made more money and even the spin off game if that got an anime. Its really not that hard, but of course they add in EVEN THE SPIN OFFS are in the future side. Its just a mess.Its sad to see a good game genre (not perfect) go down the drain because of the animes. If you are reading this and you haven't played the games. Please do they are way better then this. just dropped instantly for me.The story is so screwed up beacuse they force in the future side to.

I have not finished watching the Future arc yet, but really needed to share my thoughts on this absolutely tragic disaster of an anime.Before I start the review, I\'ll say I\'ve played Danganronpa 1+2. I liked the first game for what it was, but I did not like the second game very much, honestly, because I found the ending rather stupid. I\'ve also seen the Danganronpa anime, which I thought was an utterly average adaptation of the first game.This is not going to be like my other reviews, in which I talk about things I liked...and disliked, because I cannot reasonably do that with this anime. There were so many instances of this anime being absolutely unjustifiably ridiculous that I\'m going to talk about the entire story and point out when something I dislike happens. Which will be a lot.~*~*~*With that being said, spoilers start here and continue throughout~*~*~*This anime arc functioned as a prequel to Danganronpa 2, explaining how the ultimate despairs came to be. It started out with a bunch of fluff to get to know the characters, a lot of which I found cringeworthy at best and difficult to watch at worst. Teruteru and Kazuichi are two characters I could not stand in the game as they were creepy and stalkerish, and this anime only exemplifies that. Regardless, this only lasted a short amount of time and it commenced with the story after a couple of episodes setting the scene.So it starts with their class of 15 students, and Hajime is in the reserve course, paying high fees to attend the world class Hope\'s Peak Academy. To begin with, the anime focuses a lot on Chiaki, who to begin with is very shy and somewhat aloof, until their teacher, Chisa, tells Chiaki that it\'s more fun to play with friends. This is how she befriends Hajime.Meanwhile, Hajime, despite his friendship with Chiaki, decides he\'s not happy with the fact that he lacks talent like the Super High School Levels in the main course, and volunteers himself to secret Project Kamakura - a biomedical project to create a superhuman with all talents - the Ultimate Hope, who would be named after Kamakura Izuru, the founder of Hope\'s Peak, and could potentially save the school from all the terrible things that had been happening (THAT COULDN\'T POSSIBLY GO WRONG). Terrible things, such as TWO STUDENTS BEING MURDERED, which whilst was talked about in Danganronpa 2, the game, I expected more of an explanation of in the anime. Needless to say, I didn\'t get said explanation.In the meantime, Komaeda Nagito gets himself suspended, as well as 3 other students expelled, which other than to set a scene for the conflict in Future arc, seemed pretty irrelevant to the story, and honestly felt like an after-thought.It was at this point where I felt the story just got really silly and I just couldn\'t take it seriously anymore. I kind of lost all hope (no pun intended) in this anime being any good whatsoever.The first year at Hope\'s Peak was over, and a new group of students had entered the school - the cast of Danganronpa 1 - including Despair Sisters. Almost immediately upon being introduced, Enoshima Junko is painted as truly, irrationally evil, and her sister just kind of watches in awe. It\'s very clear Makuro is a masochist, but I find the dynamic of these two honestly uncomfortable, especially given that in DR1 she was willing to be sassy and fight back with Monokuma, who she very clearly would\'ve known was Junko. One could argue she was perfectly okay with being killed by her sister and agreed to it, but Junko said at the end of that game that it was a spur of the moment decision and she only decided to kill Makuro as she was getting in her way. Maybe it\'s a minor thing to be so nitpicky about, but her characterisation seemed way off.Junko goes to meet with Izuru, who despite the inhumane experimentation Hajime was put through to create Izuru, was in a room by himself under no monitoring or supervision. Makes sense, right? Junko speaks to him, tries to convince him that hope is boring and despair is exciting, so he should switch to the dark side, obviously wanting to use him, as someone with as much talent as Izuru could be absolutely devastating and wreak all kinds of despair on mankind.Izuru decides to meet with her, and they lock the 13 student council members (don\'t ask how they all agreed to meet up in that room with Enoshima, because that\'s never explained) and Junko & Makuro basically say ""Kill each other or we\'ll reveal all of your darkest secrets and everything you don\'t want anyone to know"". No clue how she set this up, how no one in the school noticed, and why they decided to listen to her when if they just stayed put, everyone could\'ve been saved by teachers and Junko would\'ve been caught, meaning the tragedy never even had to happen, but we\'ll roll with it for now.Junko somehow just happens to run into Mitarai, the Super High School Level Animator, who for the record, had not been attending Hope\'s Peak, with the Imposter taking his place instead. The one time he does leave the house, he bumps into Junko, who asks him who he is, and she insults anime. So Mitarai goes ""WELL I\'LL SHOW YOU, MY ANIME IS GREAT"" to literally a stranger who he\'s never spoken to in his life. He takes this girl he\'s known for 5 minutes back to HIS HOUSE and lets her watch this anime he\'s been making, meant to make the world a better place. His style of animation changes people\'s brain signals to make watchers feel any way the animator wants them to. Of course, this leads Junko to threatening him into making an anime she wants, that will invoke despair onto those who watch it. When I say anime, it\'s an edited video of the classroom killing between the student council members.Junko takes Mitarai to her lair underneath the school, which again, for some reason exists and no one in the school knows about. How it was built? When? God knows. I don\'t think they thought that far ahead.Mikan is the first subject of the despair inducing video, and it works on her. How Mikan got wrapped up into this is something I didn\'t bother to explain before and certainly won\'t now. Anyway, Nagito, Chiaki and their teacher Chisa go to find her, and discover Junko\'s lair. Nagito gets shot and lives (because Nagito), and Chisa tells Chiaki to run away with Nagito and go back to their classmates.Chisa begins to interrogate Junko about what\'s going on, who shows her she has the power to brainwash people, and proceeds to a very unnecessarily uncomfortable scene of a student trying to saw off his own head with a hacksaw.She proceeds to brainwash Chisa using the video, with another uncomfortable awkward scene, where despite the fact that she\'s clearly being tortured and you can hear her screams, the anime thinks it\'s somehow appropriate timing to show close up shots of her breasts and legs. This is a huge complaint I had about Danganronpa 2, as well. Inappropriately timed jokes and fanservice. But this scene really took the cake....Chisa\'s class decide it\'s a good idea to go back to the lair to save their teacher. Chiaki gets separated from the bunch and meets with Chisa who she assumes is trying to help her. In actual fact, Chisa leads her to her execution, which is used to invoke despair into the minds of Chisa\'s class, making them all Ultimate Despairs.Junko went on to brainwash all the reserve students into suicide too.Meanwhile, Izuru stuck around Junko, watching, sometimes commenting, but not really doing anything, which made it really hard for me to think of him as a bad guy or as if any of this was his fault at all.Those who Junko didn\'t brainwash, she manipulated into not speaking up, which is frankly stupid. How much power do they really think a high school girl and her masochist sister have? Not just that, but she WAS suspected, and in spite of that, they still went along with locking her in Hope\'s Peak, setting the scene for Danganronpa 1. I personally don\'t understand why, if they had the slightest bit of suspicion that Junko could\'ve caused the Tragedy, they would lock her in the school.Last of all, I\'d like to add that all of this ""reserve student"" talk retcons the beginning of the first game. The whole idea was that it was purely by luck that Makoto got into Hope\'s Peak despite his lack of talent, when you could all along. It was very thoroughly stated in the first game that only talented individuals got into Hope\'s Peak. They kept insisting Makoto\'s talent is luck, completely retconning why his talent was luck in the first place.Basically, this anime is an absolute disaster because it retcons bits of canon, has absolutely illogical plot points (Junko\'s lair underneath the school? Basically anything Junko does?) and overall is a very lazy way to explain why Danganronpa 2 ended the way it did. ""They were all brainwashed by anime"" is honestly one of the most ridiculous things I\'ve ever heard.This anime has cemented to me that Junko is somehow a Mary-Sue VILLAIN. She\'s perfect in every conceivable way and manages to make things happen which frankly she shouldn\'t have the power to, and it\'s utterly mind-boggling to me.If you want to watch an anime where the world goes into dystopia because of an actual reasonable threat to mankind, either watch Death Note or Devilman Crybaby. A haughty high school girl making anime does not justify the world\'s downfall to despair, frankly.But hey, it still hasn\'t beat Citrus as the worst anime I\'ve ever seen. and disliked, because I cannot reasonably do that with this anime.

Personally I didn't and it didn't hinder my experience, but if you want the full experience you should do that....God damn it, what are these, tears? Other than maybe a few minor problems, DR3-D is brilliant in showing that the (obvious) villain Junko Enoshima is the worst person alive. I can't say much about what she does because of immense spoilers, but know that she is evil going in. Not knowing any better, though, you could walk right in completely unaware of the nature of DR and think it's...a boring slice of life anime. It's not.

There's nothing else I can say about it.Again, as to be expected, the sound is brilliant. Kami-iro Awase, the opening song, is my favorite anime OP of all time. It's ambient and calm, but has an air to it within the lyrics that fits the classic DR theme of the ultimate hope vs. the ultimate despair. Zettai Kibou Birthday may pale in comparison, but is still incredibly enjoyable. The overall sound design is incredibly varied in tone and overall is very good.DR3-D technically goes in with the expectation that you know the characters, but you can still learn about them solely through the anime. Considering the size of the class, it does a fairly good job at introducing them all, and you'd know any one of them just by looking at them. Their designs are all unique and their personalities clash in interesting ways, making them entertaining to watch. Allow me to reiterate that Junko Enoshima is the worst human being to ever walk this earth.Maybe I'm biased, but I love the shit out of this anime.

I have not played any of the games, and don’t plan to since I’ve given up gaming a long time ago, therefore I’m not going to make any parallels.Both shows are dark, while Despair progressively becomes darker with each episode, Future is dark from the very first minute of the first episode. The art style is similar, pink blood in some scenes, red blood in others, you get used to the pink blood and...becomes as gory as the red version. Character designs are nice and unique, sometimes confusing as to which is which especially in the Despair arc. There are a lot of characters so that’s why.The future arc is interesting and ties really well with the despair arc especially in the end, it does have a few plot twists which are interesting, from a psychological point of view it does tackle large organizations and corruption within them if you want.The despair arc is what I enjoyed the most, especially with the symbolism presented in there. If you watch closely and analyze some Junko Enoshima tactics, you will start to see them in real life (TV brainwashing, manipulating groups, idols that people listen to, etc). For me Junko Enoshima has become one of the best villains In anime, and if you look closely there is a bit of Junko Enoishima close to you every day. I also liked very much how the best guys suffer the most, it usually happens in our societies, they don’t get impaled, hacked of course, but they do get cast aside by the bad guys. I like the symbolism behind despair, it’s brilliant, you can extrapolate it into real life (weather it’s a villainous political entity that wins or a certain event that happens that turns the world upside down, like war, etc). The ending of the Future arc is interesting, makes you think a bit about hope (good), despair (evil) and what is best. Sadly as in real life there is no good over evil or evil vs good winners here, we all kind of loose in some way.Music is fitting for this kind of show and does set the atmosphere for certain scenes. The art is interesting, quite dark in the Future arc, does give you the horror feel.Plot is well developed for the Despair arc, I really loved it, the Future arc’s plot however left me with a bitter taste, it was a bit predictable towards the end, and I didn’t quite like part of the ending. I won’t be going into details so as not to spoil it, but I think the decision to bring back a certain character was driven by fear of fans reactions. I did like the character a lot but I would have liked the show more if I would have been depressed by the ending though.Junko Enoshima-chan, is the best villain. Now go despair and watch the series! becomes as gory as the red version. Character designs are nice and unique, sometimes confusing as to which is which especially in the Despair arc. There are a lot of characters so that’s why.The future arc is interesting and ties really well with the despair arc especially in the end, it does have a few plot twists which are interesting, from a psychological point of view it does tackle large organizations and corruption within them if you want.The despair arc is what I enjoyed the most, especially with the symbolism presented in there. If you watch closely and analyze some Junko Enoshima tactics, you will start to see them in real life (TV brainwashing, manipulating groups, idols that people listen to, etc). For me Junko Enoshima has become one of the best villains In anime, and if you look closely there is a bit of Junko Enoishima close to you every day. I also liked very much how the best guys suffer the most, it usually happens in our societies, they don’t get impaled, hacked of course, but they do get cast aside by the bad guys. I like the symbolism behind despair, it’s brilliant, you can extrapolate it into real life (weather it’s a villainous political entity that wins or a certain event that happens that turns the world upside down, like war, etc). The ending of the Future arc is interesting, makes you think a bit about hope (good), despair (evil) and what is best. Sadly as in real life there is no good over evil or evil vs good winners here, we all kind of loose in some way.Music is fitting for this kind of show and does set the atmosphere for certain scenes.

Now go despair and watch the series!', ""Shortly put, I wish I hadn't watched Danganronpa 3 anime. In addition to being absolutely idiotic on its own, it pretty much ruins DR2, which I loved to pieces. I can't bring myself to rate any DR stuff lower than 4 even though I would want to... well, there were some good moments, too, I guess. Anyway, Monokuma claimed repeatedly that all the info he's providing in ch6 of DR2 is true, but... guess what, it wasn't. And forget all about Junko being some great mastermind who can charm anyone to her side. Nah. That's not how it went. Other reviews surely go into greater...detail so I won't say more here. Either read them or watch it yourself, but be warned, this anime is truly plunging me into despair. detail so I won't say more here. Either read them or watch it yourself, but be warned, this anime is truly plunging me into despair."", 'I usually don\'t write reviews, but I feel that this anime gets a lot of undeserved hate, for not being something that it doesn\'t need to be in the first place.  /*contains spoilers from DR 2 */Story and Plot:In chronological order, this is the first part of of the whole series. It follows the cast of DR 2 in their last happy months and it shows the event of the Tragedy. I think this is a part that many people don\'t like, as some details of it contradict what was said in the games about it. However, in my opinion, this is actually better...than what it was supposed to be.For example, in the games, they just say that Junko was Ultimate Despair, and that\'s it. I just couldn\'t fully think that just one person was able to end the world and, even more importantly, corrupt a whole class of Ultimates and Izuru Kamukura, the Ultimate Hope. This way, even if it\'s different, it makes sense and, in a way, is much better ( I will talk about that later ).Art and Sound:I put those two together because I really don\'t know what to say about either. In particular, I enjoyed every moment of Izuru; he just has some sort of casual badassery, and I also liked his internal questioning of what he should do.Now, about the soundtrack, it is ok in general. What I really want to talk about is the ending theme of the song. At the beginning, I just enjoyed it normally but, after THE death at the end of ep 10, the ending just pushed the acceleration of the feels truck to the max.Characters:I can\'t talk too much about the characters without getting into spoilers, but I can say that I really enjoyed all of them. We find out a bit of new stuff about Junko and there\'s also another major new character from class 77.Of course, Junko is as brilliant and hopeless as always, earning a well-deserved nr.1 spot on my ""top villains of all-time"" list.Enjoyment:I think that by this point it is clear that I love this anime, but there is one more very important thing about it that I haven\'t said.First of all, this part of the series doesn\'t have any major plot twists, and what this story is about has been spoken from the beginning of it.So, instead of having the usual tone of the series, this anime emphasizes on the slow coming of the tragedy. Seeing the members of class 77 playing around brings me both a smile and a tear, thinking of what is to come.Also, what I enjoyed the most is the way that everyone\'s good intentions are manipulated and used against them. In several cases, if the characters didn\'t care about each other and just remained still, Junko\'s plan would have failed (in general, she always allows her victims a way to escape). However, exactly because they care and act, trying to bring happiness to themselves and others, the characters end up being manipulated by Junko and they fall.Overall, while I understand that some people might not enjoy this series, I personally think it\'s one of the best parts of the franchise and give it a personal ""Why won\'t the tears stop""/11   ( 11/11 ) than what it was supposed to be.For example, in the games, they just say that Junko was Ultimate Despair, and that\'s it.

So keep in mind that since I can't spoil here but I'll do my best to make this a good review in my capabilities, if that makes any sense. So if you haven't played the 2nd game, go do so before watching this since just watching Danganronpa the Animation isn't going to help you here.Story: The premise is on the anime's page so you can go there for that. Anyways, this is the prequel to everything that has happened...to the series starting with class 77's road to hope up to the end of where they fall into despair. What I like about the story is that they may have it at an open ending but isn't that what a prequel is supposed to do? They nailed that aspect pretty well, I'm getting a little ahead of myself so I'll go back a little.The series starts with like a typical high school anime then it slowly becomes darker the more that you watch. The execution itself was a bit rushed but also brilliant as the Danganronpa franchise perfectly handles despair as well as hope itself, the two being the main themes of this series.Score: 9/10 for the storyThe art uses its character designs from the series overall which is something that I never had a problem with in all honestly. Lerche does a good job with matching the atmosphere with the tone of the show, which is something that studio does very well with some of the shows they worked on the past (ie Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace). The animation isn't nothing too special but it works well for the series as it doesn't need that. The backgrounds look very nice, but nothing too special.Score for the art: 8/10The OST is a bit hard to tell since I was a bit distracted of what was going on but the tracks were very good and they sound nice on their own which is a plus in my book. The OP theme is very good with not only having different versions as the show progresses, which helps fit the tone of the story and the vocals are perfect for it too. The ED theme on the other hand....is nice with the visuals showing the various good times that class 77 have together although Nagito isn't the best singer (his seiyu sings the ED).The voice acting was very well done as the seiyu gives out the best performances they have for the characters and not once have they failed at it, haven't seen the dub for this yet so I can't compare the two at the present time.Score for the sound: 9/10The characters are the same ones from Danganronpa 2, so it’s about them, somewhat. A few characters that took their debut in this entry as well as in the future arc (ie Chisa Yukizome according to the Danganronpa wiki) did well to serve their purposes although only one of them being Yukizome got more screentime compared to the other two characters, this will be the last time I mention the future arc in this review, so I highly apologize if you were annoyed by that. What I meant by somewhat well, only Hinata, Nagito and Chiaki Nanami mainly got the focus. I liked how the characters kept their original personalities and vice versa so that’s a plus, otherwise it would be very awkward for me to watch. Part of what the light hearted tone was due to how humorous the characters interacted with each other. The more you grew attached to the characters in Class 77, the harder it’ll be when it comes towards the end of the anime when a certain event happens that I obviously won’t spoil.The three that get the most focus on do impact on the story in a large amount of ways without them realizing it for example of how Nanami gets her class to play some video games with her (that scene is one of my favorite scenes from the first half of this entry), which affects in how closer she gets with Hinata in their friendship as they talk more as they play video games. In a way this represents hope in the atmosphere in class 77 as the less time they interact with each other due to how things end up later, which ends up making the time of the despair even closer if that makes any sense. As for Nagito, well he is just Nagito doing his best to help his class which somewhat ends up backfiring, as he does hold an impact of how events go so I’ll give him credit for that. Am I allowed to mention that Junko is part of this, otherwise why else would the title be called the “Despair arc” anyways, and she is not only entertaining but she also did a good job at going even further as an antagonist, I’ll leave it at that before this gets ugly….I liked the character cast, as I didn’t dislike anybody, although I do have a love-hate relationship with a certain character that doesn’t appear much in this arc but it’s good to mention that here.Overall the characters get a score of a 9, as well...no cast can be perfect after all, when it comes to the Danganronpa franchiseEnjoyment:This may be written a bit differently compared to the other sections as well, I’m not used to writing my enjoyment on something but rather than reading on my rambling I’ll just be honest here. I really loved it. Now to be a bit more specific so this won’t be as vague. For instance, I really liked the humor in the chances they got, I recall laughing a lot in the first two episodes due to the situations they got in. When the show became true to its name, I wasn’t prepared for it as it gave me tears, I had to take a short break while watching episode 9 to calm myself down a bit before I continued.I did find a lot of enjoyment from this series, but I think it’s a bit hard to describe why I like this entry other than the fact that it’s something you’re going to have to try for yourself, it’s best I got to say, I guess….Score for enjoyment: a perfect 10/10Overall, I did like this entry into the Danganronpa franchise. Sure it isn’t perfect but that I think that’s what it was trying to be as it was supposed to help fill in the holes that people would have after finishing a playthrough of Danganronpa 2. Simply put, if you want some questions answered, give this a shot just remember to play Danganronpa 2 first before giving this a watch. At the time of this review, the dub for this arc isn’t finished.Final score: a solid 9/10 to the series starting with class 77's road to hope up to the end of where they fall into despair.

', 'Note 1: MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE DR2 GAME AND DESPAIR ARC ANIME! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU\'VE CHECKED THEM OUT!Note 2: This review is going to be an in depth evaluation about the Dangan Ronpa 2 game AND the Despair arc anime. It will be divided into the two sections. Skip to Section 2 (Despair arc) if you\'re only interested in that.Note 3: This is a continuation of my previous review. DON\'T READ THIS UNTIL YOU AT LEAST KNOW THE STRUCTURE OF MY DANGAN RONPA REVIEWS.https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=232992----------------------Heya. It\'s me, Tim. If you\'ve read my Dr1 review, you\'re in for another fucking ride. That\'s right, people....Dangan Ronpa 2 is PRECISELY why Dr1 doesn\'t have a perfect score. The sequel features a much more developed cast, coupled with several characters that have rather eccentric personalities.Again, this review will be dedicated in bashing the seiyu while praising the English voice acting to no end, much like my Dr1 review.----------Section 1: Dangan Ronpa 2 review------------------Story: 10/10Dangan Ronpa 2 is the BEST DR game to date. Smarter killers make it more difficult to pinpoint the blackened in the class trials, which also explain why the average duration of each trial is now increased to 2.5 hours (as opposed to Dr1 trials, which are 1.5 hours on average)... if you know what you\'re doing, and given that none of the voice acting is skipped. On the contrary, if you\'re playing this game blind, chances are that you\'ll take more than 3 hours to complete a trial.Art: 10/10Detailed in previous review.Sound: 10/10View my Dr1 review regarding the OST. Dr2 has several new tracks combined with Dr1 tracks, and they all blend in well perfectly.Now, onto our FAVORITE SECTION of the entire review... let\'s thrash and diss the seiyu\'s performances!Japanese voice acting: 1/10In Dangan Ronpa 2, instead of Makoto, we now have Hajime Hinata as the protagonist. Unlike his classmates, Hajime\'s talent was not revealed at the very beginning. As a matter of fact, Hajime does NOT have a talent, as revealed in Chapter 4 by Nagito Komaeda. Hajime has been cited many times as a ""typical, ordinary and talentless"" reserve course student (ie. Students that had to pay a HIGH tuition fee to attend regular school courses as opposed to the Ultimates\' schoolife). Due to Hajime\'s characterization (and personality), I have every single reason to believe that his seiyu is seriously and motherfuckingly miscast. BIG TIME. Arguably the hugest miscast in the ENTIRE Dangan Ronpa series. Let\'s identify the identity of Hajime\'s seiyu, shall we? Her name is Minami Takayama, best known as the voice of Conan from Case Closed. Like with Megumi (oh boy, you\'re about to find out about her too later on), I\'m going to detail EVERY SINGLE GROWN/ADOLESCENT MALE ROLE THAT SHE BUTCHERED.1) Mikey Kudo (Digimon Fusion - Nicolas Roye in dub)2) Dilandou Albatou (Escaflowne - Joel McDonald in Funimation dub)3) Pit (Kid Icarus - Antony Del Rio in dub)4) Luke (Pokemon - Billy Bob Thompson in dub)5) Yong Hwa (Pretty Rhythm: Dear my Future - Eric Christopher Chow in Chinese dub)6) Hao Asakura (Shaman King - Sebastian Arcelus in dub)7) Nataku (Tsubasa - Chris Burnett in dub)8) Hijiri Minase (Descendants of Darkness - Sam Riegel in dub)------------Ok, though Minami butchered less roles than Megumi, she still fucked up a couple of them, and that\'s no good. I\'m pretty damn sure that Hajime is the worst performance out of all of them. Think about it for a sec - Hajime is supposed to represent ordinarity, plainness, normalcy and typicality. The fact that Minami was cast as Hajime is setting up a very, very bad precedent - it means that even women are deemed suitable to voice as typical, (keyword: TYPICAL; not whiners, not effeminate guys nor crossdressers) and I mean TYPICAL MALE TEENS. The aforementioned are also suited to be voiced by grown males though, given if those are male tenors. Way to fucking go, Japan. Are you trying to make male VAs lose their jobs by letting women do a way inferior job at pretending to be a male teen, and epically failing at it, above all else?LUCKILY, we have Johnny Yong Bosch (Lelouch, Ichigo and Renton, etc.) as the English voice of Hajime. Besides the three roles that I\'ve just mentioned, he\'s also known as several other main characters. Look him up and watch any show he\'s in. You\'re bound to be impressed with his performances. In any case, although Hajime is talentless, his strong grasp of hope and bluntness are precisely what saved the surviving Dr2 cast from despair; they were all able to log out of the game with their in game personalities retained thanks to Hajime. Dr2 proves that you don\'t need talent to succeed; if you have enough hope, you too could turn into a Super Saiyan and banish despair once and for all; Johnny really nailed that aspect of Hajime, along with all his other attributes.-------------Next on the shitlist is.... a middle aged woman that is nearly applicable for elderly welfare, she\'s none other than Megumi Ogata! Yes, people. You guessed right - I can\'t believe that she got yet another role in the Dangan Ronpa series, and butchering it even more than she did with Makoto. Megumi played as Nagito Komaeda. To be honest, she barely sounded like a guy most of the time. All I hear is a grandma-esque voice trying too hard to go low to sound male. Uggggh. Just... view my previous review if you wanna know how much I hate Megumi, and my lack of respect for this constantly miscast woman.On the other hand, Bryce Papenbrook, whom previously voiced as Makoto, pulled off the resident hope obsessed psychopath exactly how he\'s meant to be. Those brilliant crazy ass laughs are very, and I mean very astonishing. Bryce was also able to portray a soft spoken Nagito before the character took a psychopathic spin. Given that Nagito is a complicated character, Bryce also managed to nail Nagito\'s aggressive side when he found out that he\'s one of the Remnants of Despair. Bryce\'s performance as Nagito as a whole is just more than merely impressive. He completely got Nagito right for exactly what he is - a crazy, boisterous (soft spoken in facade), sarcastic and hope obsessed freak.Character: 10/10There is a major step up in characterization in Dr2. Several characters have way more interesting personalities, notably (besides the characters I\'ve mentioned above):-Gundam: Very hammy, eccentric and dramatic-Hiyoko: Local bitch alongside being extremely insulting; overall a trashy person-Mikan: Severe lack of self esteem, and due to being bullied too much, finally freaking snapped in Trial 3 when contracted with the Despair Disease-Ibuki: ADHD-Sonia: Royalty-Chiaki: Derpy Kyoko-Fuyuhiko: Yakuza with anger management issues-Nekomaru: SHIT!-Mahiru: Feminist-Peko: Cold assassin and JUSTICE!---Oh boy, did I just say that more than half of the Dr2 cast is notably good? That\'s precisely the point, though - Dr2\'s cast is way more intriguing and developed than its predecessor.-------------Enjoyment: 10/10Nuff said. You can\'t go wrong with so many memorable characters. New features added to this sequel makes it so much more enjoyable as well - Logic Dive and Rebuttal Showdown are fun minigames.-------------------Overall: 10/10Dr2 is constantly shown to be the best Dr2 game ever known to mankind, and for a very damn good reason too. Play it yourself and you\'ll get what I mean.------------------Section 2: Dangan Ronpa - Despair arc review----------------Note: In this section, I\'ll also be comparing English voices in the character category.Story: Despair arc serves to answer many of the questions left unanswered in the games. It details the lives of the Dr2 cast before they were plunged into despair by Junko; they were all forced to witness real life Chiaki dying right in front of them. It also explains and elaborates how one exactly falls into despair - either through witnessing gruesome massacres or excessive brainwashing; using the target\'s darkest memories against them. We all know that Junko Enoshima is the mastermind behind all the events that occur in the Dangan Ronpa series, but Despair arc clarifies how exactly she goes about succeeding her goals until they were thwarted by Makoto in Dr1.Score: 10/10Despair arc is a brilliant tie up to unanswered questions. Its occasional comedy is excellently executed as well.Art: 10/10Need I say more?Sound: 10/10A couple of tracks were recycled from the games, which is a good decision because the Dr3 anime as a whole is meant to be watched by Dangan Ronpa fans. Either way, the soundtrack is marvellous.Character: 7/10Would have given it a perfect score if the Funimation stand ins were nearly as good as their game counterparts. Besides that, the lack of consistency with game precedents and English terminology are also things to be upset about. What I mean by that is the Eng dub of Despair arc using last names instead of first, and SHSL as opposed to Ultimate. Geez, I hate inconsistency among everything else. The acting is good though, I\'ll give Funimation\'s dub that.Natsumi Kuzuryu, whom is Fuyuhiko\'s sister is further expanded in the Despair arc. We finally find out WHY she was killed rather than just HOW she was killed. Think about it: If you repeatedly torment others and threatening to inflict harm to them, someone\'s bound to get pissed. In which case, Sato got pissed big time and ended Natsumi\'s life with a swimsuit wrapped with gravel (this was revealed in Dr2). Serves Natsumi right, to be honest - she really shouldn\'t have tried to threaten Mahiru, given the latter\'s friendship with Sato. And we all know what happened to Sato later on - Fuyuhiko murdered her in vengeance.Additionally, Mukuro also makes an appearance, and we finally get to see her in her true personality (and appearance), rather than her pretending to be Junko. In the Despair arc, Mukuro infiltrates Hope\'s Peak with Junko as the Ultimate Soldier. Mukuro is shown to be a very submissive twin sister, whom does exactly as Junko commands her to; she is shown to exhibit great pleasure in following Junko\'s orders, even going as far as to masochistically indulge in Junko\'s attempts in injuring or killing her. Other than that, Mukuro\'s behavior is what you\'d expect from a model soldier - she is the no-nonsense Despair Sister whom follows Junko\'s demands to the letter.In any case, let\'s begin the voice compare, along with some differences I\'ve noticed in the reprisals.-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu-Game voice: Derek Stephen PrinceAnime voice: Aaron DismukeDerek is known for several roles, mostly witty characters such as Vexen (Kingdom Hearts), Uryu (Bleach) and Ken (Digimon 02). Fuyuhiko is a very foul mouthed rotten apple, and clearly, that kind of characterization is playing against type. Not that it\'s a problem, to be honest. Derek is a VERY good actor, and he nailed Fuyuhiko to an effing T. The constant aggression that the character commonly exhibits and desperation before Peko was sent off for execution are attributes that are constantly praised, even by those that commonly prefer subs. As a result, Aaron had VERY BIG SHOES TO FILL IN, and sad to say, he falls short. Sure, Aaron may have been a good Alphonse, but guess what? He wasn\'t that great of a Fuyuhiko. Aaron\'s portrayal wasn\'t nearly as aggressive as that of Derek\'s, and that isn\'t a good thing at all. Sad to say, Aaron barely did the character justice. I vote Derek as best Fuyuhiko voice.-Akane Owari-Game voice: Wendee LeeAnime voice: Morgan GarrettAkane is a brawny big chested girl who is very impulsive, and prefers to resort to violence than peacefully sorting out situations with words. Wendee nailed those aspects of Akane, along with giving her a very suiting voice. I\'m kinda disappointed with Morgan\'s portrayal - I don\'t like how Akane sounded lower pitched, along with lacking the energy that could be heard in Wendee\'s portrayal. I mean, I know Akane isn\'t supposed to be a moe girl or anything, but seriously, Morgan just gave Akane an overly low voice, and I found it to be unfitting.-Teruteru Hanamura-Eng voice: Todd HaberkornAlthough Todd reprised the role, he gave Teru a country accent even when he\'s speaking normally. As far as I\'m concerned, Teru intentionally HIDES his accent to make it seem like that he\'s from a high class suburb. Shame on you Funimation - for not doing your homework.-Peko Pekoyama-Game voice: Janice KawayeAnime voice: Clarine HarpAlright, no more favoring Californians this time around. This time, I\'ll choose the Texan Clarine. Clarine gave Peko more character (even though she\'s generally distant and calm) and a much more fitting deeper voice. Although I prefer Clarine\'s portrayal, I do have to give props to Janice for pulling off her Sparkling Justice persona - now that was simply just amazing!-Ibuki Mioda-Game voice: Julie Ann TaylorAnime voice: Brina PalenciaJulie. Nuff said. Ibuki, as far as I\'m concerned, is hyperactive and eccentric. Julie got those attributes down, but sadly, I\'m afraid I can\'t quite say the same for Brina. Brina\'s portrayal was... bland. There just simply wasn\'t enough energy compared to Julie\'s take.-Gundam Tanaka-Game voice: Chris TergliaferaAnime voice: Scott FrerichsI choose Chris. Scott\'s take was around the same pitch as Chris\'s portrayal, but the entire composure of Gundam is his eccentricity and hamminess. I\'m sorry, but Scott wasn\'t nearly as dramatic as Chris. Chris also had better shouts and generally gave a much more believable performance than Scott.-Usami-Game voice: Rebecca ForstadtAnime voice: Anastasia MunozRebecca, because her voice for Usami was much more tolerable. Usami is a majorly annoying character either way, but a more soothing voice just makes the character less intolerable, you get what I mean? Anastasia is by no means a bad actress, but her Usami voice is just so awful that I was tempted to mute my tablet whenever she spoke. Seriously, Ana\'s other roles are much better than this.----------------Enjoyment: 7/10Should be pretty obvious by now. Flaws are listed above on what\'s keeping this dub from getting a perfect score.-------------------Overall: 7/10I would have probably given this dub a 10/10 if there weren\'t any inconsistencies. Dangan Ronpa 2 is PRECISELY why Dr1 doesn\'t have a perfect score. The sequel features a much more developed cast, coupled with several characters that have rather eccentric personalities.Again, this review will be dedicated in bashing the seiyu while praising the English voice acting to no end, much like my Dr1 review.----------Section 1: Dangan Ronpa 2 review------------------Story: 10/10Dangan Ronpa 2 is the BEST DR game to date. Smarter killers make it more difficult to pinpoint the blackened in the class trials, which also explain why the average duration of each trial is now increased to 2.5 hours (as opposed to Dr1 trials, which are 1.5 hours on average)... if you know what you\'re doing, and given that none of the voice acting is skipped. On the contrary, if you\'re playing this game blind, chances are that you\'ll take more than 3 hours to complete a trial.Art: 10/10Detailed in previous review.Sound: 10/10View my Dr1 review regarding the OST. Dr2 has several new tracks combined with Dr1 tracks, and they all blend in well perfectly.Now, onto our FAVORITE SECTION of the entire review... let\'s thrash and diss the seiyu\'s performances!Japanese voice acting: 1/10In Dangan Ronpa 2, instead of Makoto, we now have Hajime Hinata as the protagonist. Unlike his classmates, Hajime\'s talent was not revealed at the very beginning. As a matter of fact, Hajime does NOT have a talent, as revealed in Chapter 4 by Nagito Komaeda. Hajime has been cited many times as a ""typical, ordinary and talentless"" reserve course student (ie. Students that had to pay a HIGH tuition fee to attend regular school courses as opposed to the Ultimates\' schoolife). Due to Hajime\'s characterization (and personality), I have every single reason to believe that his seiyu is seriously and motherfuckingly miscast. BIG TIME. Arguably the hugest miscast in the ENTIRE Dangan Ronpa series. Let\'s identify the identity of Hajime\'s seiyu, shall we? Her name is Minami Takayama, best known as the voice of Conan from Case Closed. Like with Megumi (oh boy, you\'re about to find out about her too later on), I\'m going to detail EVERY SINGLE GROWN/ADOLESCENT MALE ROLE THAT SHE BUTCHERED.1) Mikey Kudo (Digimon Fusion - Nicolas Roye in dub)2) Dilandou Albatou (Escaflowne - Joel McDonald in Funimation dub)3) Pit (Kid Icarus - Antony Del Rio in dub)4) Luke (Pokemon - Billy Bob Thompson in dub)5) Yong Hwa (Pretty Rhythm: Dear my Future - Eric Christopher Chow in Chinese dub)6) Hao Asakura (Shaman King - Sebastian Arcelus in dub)7) Nataku (Tsubasa - Chris Burnett in dub)8) Hijiri Minase (Descendants of Darkness - Sam Riegel in dub)------------Ok, though Minami butchered less roles than Megumi, she still fucked up a couple of them, and that\'s no good. I\'m pretty damn sure that Hajime is the worst performance out of all of them. Think about it for a sec - Hajime is supposed to represent ordinarity, plainness, normalcy and typicality. The fact that Minami was cast as Hajime is setting up a very, very bad precedent - it means that even women are deemed suitable to voice as typical, (keyword: TYPICAL; not whiners, not effeminate guys nor crossdressers) and I mean TYPICAL MALE TEENS. The aforementioned are also suited to be voiced by grown males though, given if those are male tenors. Way to fucking go, Japan. Are you trying to make male VAs lose their jobs by letting women do a way inferior job at pretending to be a male teen, and epically failing at it, above all else?LUCKILY, we have Johnny Yong Bosch (Lelouch, Ichigo and Renton, etc.) as the English voice of Hajime. Besides the three roles that I\'ve just mentioned, he\'s also known as several other main characters. Look him up and watch any show he\'s in. You\'re bound to be impressed with his performances. In any case, although Hajime is talentless, his strong grasp of hope and bluntness are precisely what saved the surviving Dr2 cast from despair; they were all able to log out of the game with their in game personalities retained thanks to Hajime. Dr2 proves that you don\'t need talent to succeed; if you have enough hope, you too could turn into a Super Saiyan and banish despair once and for all; Johnny really nailed that aspect of Hajime, along with all his other attributes.-------------Next on the shitlist is.... a middle aged woman that is nearly applicable for elderly welfare, she\'s none other than Megumi Ogata! Yes, people. You guessed right - I can\'t believe that she got yet another role in the Dangan Ronpa series, and butchering it even more than she did with Makoto. Megumi played as Nagito Komaeda. To be honest, she barely sounded like a guy most of the time. All I hear is a grandma-esque voice trying too hard to go low to sound male. Uggggh. Just... view my previous review if you wanna know how much I hate Megumi, and my lack of respect for this constantly miscast woman.On the other hand, Bryce Papenbrook, whom previously voiced as Makoto, pulled off the resident hope obsessed psychopath exactly how he\'s meant to be. Those brilliant crazy ass laughs are very, and I mean very astonishing. Bryce was also able to portray a soft spoken Nagito before the character took a psychopathic spin. Given that Nagito is a complicated character, Bryce also managed to nail Nagito\'s aggressive side when he found out that he\'s one of the Remnants of Despair. Bryce\'s performance as Nagito as a whole is just more than merely impressive. He completely got Nagito right for exactly what he is - a crazy, boisterous (soft spoken in facade), sarcastic and hope obsessed freak.Character: 10/10There is a major step up in characterization in Dr2. Several characters have way more interesting personalities, notably (besides the characters I\'ve mentioned above):-Gundam: Very hammy, eccentric and dramatic-Hiyoko: Local bitch alongside being extremely insulting; overall a trashy person-Mikan: Severe lack of self esteem, and due to being bullied too much, finally freaking snapped in Trial 3 when contracted with the Despair Disease-Ibuki: ADHD-Sonia: Royalty-Chiaki: Derpy Kyoko-Fuyuhiko: Yakuza with anger management issues-Nekomaru: SHIT!-Mahiru: Feminist-Peko: Cold assassin and JUSTICE!---Oh boy, did I just say that more than half of the Dr2 cast is notably good? That\'s precisely the point, though - Dr2\'s cast is way more intriguing and developed than its predecessor.-------------Enjoyment: 10/10Nuff said. You can\'t go wrong with so many memorable characters. New features added to this sequel makes it so much more enjoyable as well - Logic Dive and Rebuttal Showdown are fun minigames.-------------------Overall: 10/10Dr2 is constantly shown to be the best Dr2 game ever known to mankind, and for a very damn good reason too. Play it yourself and you\'ll get what I mean.------------------Section 2: Dangan Ronpa - Despair arc review----------------Note: In this section, I\'ll also be comparing English voices in the character category.Story: Despair arc serves to answer many of the questions left unanswered in the games. It details the lives of the Dr2 cast before they were plunged into despair by Junko; they were all forced to witness real life Chiaki dying right in front of them. It also explains and elaborates how one exactly falls into despair - either through witnessing gruesome massacres or excessive brainwashing; using the target\'s darkest memories against them. We all know that Junko Enoshima is the mastermind behind all the events that occur in the Dangan Ronpa series, but Despair arc clarifies how exactly she goes about succeeding her goals until they were thwarted by Makoto in Dr1.Score: 10/10Despair arc is a brilliant tie up to unanswered questions. Its occasional comedy is excellently executed as well.Art: 10/10Need I say more?Sound: 10/10A couple of tracks were recycled from the games, which is a good decision because the Dr3 anime as a whole is meant to be watched by Dangan Ronpa fans. Either way, the soundtrack is marvellous.Character: 7/10Would have given it a perfect score if the Funimation stand ins were nearly as good as their game counterparts. Besides that, the lack of consistency with game precedents and English terminology are also things to be upset about. What I mean by that is the Eng dub of Despair arc using last names instead of first, and SHSL as opposed to Ultimate. Geez, I hate inconsistency among everything else. The acting is good though, I\'ll give Funimation\'s dub that.Natsumi Kuzuryu, whom is Fuyuhiko\'s sister is further expanded in the Despair arc. We finally find out WHY she was killed rather than just HOW she was killed. Think about it: If you repeatedly torment others and threatening to inflict harm to them, someone\'s bound to get pissed. In which case, Sato got pissed big time and ended Natsumi\'s life with a swimsuit wrapped with gravel (this was revealed in Dr2). Serves Natsumi right, to be honest - she really shouldn\'t have tried to threaten Mahiru, given the latter\'s friendship with Sato. And we all know what happened to Sato later on - Fuyuhiko murdered her in vengeance.Additionally, Mukuro also makes an appearance, and we finally get to see her in her true personality (and appearance), rather than her pretending to be Junko. In the Despair arc, Mukuro infiltrates Hope\'s Peak with Junko as the Ultimate Soldier. Mukuro is shown to be a very submissive twin sister, whom does exactly as Junko commands her to; she is shown to exhibit great pleasure in following Junko\'s orders, even going as far as to masochistically indulge in Junko\'s attempts in injuring or killing her. Other than that, Mukuro\'s behavior is what you\'d expect from a model soldier - she is the no-nonsense Despair Sister whom follows Junko\'s demands to the letter.In any case, let\'s begin the voice compare, along with some differences I\'ve noticed in the reprisals.-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu-Game voice: Derek Stephen PrinceAnime voice: Aaron DismukeDerek is known for several roles, mostly witty characters such as Vexen (Kingdom Hearts), Uryu (Bleach) and Ken (Digimon 02). Fuyuhiko is a very foul mouthed rotten apple, and clearly, that kind of characterization is playing against type. Not that it\'s a problem, to be honest. Derek is a VERY good actor, and he nailed Fuyuhiko to an effing T. The constant aggression that the character commonly exhibits and desperation before Peko was sent off for execution are attributes that are constantly praised, even by those that commonly prefer subs. As a result, Aaron had VERY BIG SHOES TO FILL IN, and sad to say, he falls short. Sure, Aaron may have been a good Alphonse, but guess what? He wasn\'t that great of a Fuyuhiko. Aaron\'s portrayal wasn\'t nearly as aggressive as that of Derek\'s, and that isn\'t a good thing at all. Sad to say, Aaron barely did the character justice. I vote Derek as best Fuyuhiko voice.-Akane Owari-Game voice: Wendee LeeAnime voice: Morgan GarrettAkane is a brawny big chested girl who is very impulsive, and prefers to resort to violence than peacefully sorting out situations with words. Wendee nailed those aspects of Akane, along with giving her a very suiting voice. I\'m kinda disappointed with Morgan\'s portrayal - I don\'t like how Akane sounded lower pitched, along with lacking the energy that could be heard in Wendee\'s portrayal. I mean, I know Akane isn\'t supposed to be a moe girl or anything, but seriously, Morgan just gave Akane an overly low voice, and I found it to be unfitting.-Teruteru Hanamura-Eng voice: Todd HaberkornAlthough Todd reprised the role, he gave Teru a country accent even when he\'s speaking normally.

Flaws are listed above on what\'s keeping this dub from getting a perfect score.-------------------Overall: 7/10I would have probably given this dub a 10/10 if there weren\'t any inconsistencies.', ""ok so background here I've played DR1 and SDR2, and have only read synopses for the future arc LOL, but...... I really liked this anime. I see a lot of hate, but I think this is everything Danganronpa is supposed to be. it's over the top, it's ridiculous, it's incomprehensible. it's everything I love about the characters. it's like a fun addition to what I enjoyed about the games. idk who would go into a Danganronpa anime by Lerche expecting an all-out masterpiece, but I really enjoy it for what it is. of course, there's fan service, it's......Danganronpa. whatever, it's a fun ride is the...point. don't go in expecting to have your mind blown or anything and, if you enjoyed the games, you'll probably have a good time point. don't go in expecting to have your mind blown or anything and, if you enjoyed the games, you'll probably have a good time"", 'So... I’ve been thinking a lot about whether or not to do this review, but I feel I should give my opinion on this... Thing ???English is not my first language and I have never played Danganronpa, so I don’t know how much it has in common with the video game.Where do I start? I have so many negative things to say. I think this is one of the ugliest and most disturbing (I don’t even know if it’s the correct term) anime I’ve ever seen. It started off so well, but it ruined itself so quickly in, like, two episodes.Let’s start with the worst...thing: the characters. Holy God, the characters are the most useless and stupid thing I’ve ever seen. In twelve episodes there are many characters and NOBODY has a deepening. There are some attempts, perhaps, but they failed badly. I arrive at the last episode and I don’t know ANYTHING about the characters except small hints. Yeah, maybe I should look at the sequel to figure them out, but seeing how small they are, I doubt they’ll have an in-depth look.And you can say ""It’s only 12 episodes, what do you expect?"" And I say that I really appreciated the first season. They were just a few episodes, but all the characters had some specific features that made me remember them and appreciate them all.Here there is NOTHING of this. There’s a presentation of them, and then they’re literally left there, ruined, destroyed, and to be honest, I remember, like, five characters? And usually just for their looks. For example, I know for sure that there is a pink-haired character (sorry, I love pink-haired characters), but I do not remember the name, I do not know what use he has, I do not even know whether he appears until the end or not. I don’t even remember one of his scenes.And this is for a character I remember, imagine the ones I forgot...I search her name because I couldn’t remember, but I’d like to talk about Mikan. I hated the way they made her, I felt so much anger and hatred towards anyone who sexualized her that I had to avoid many of her scenes for fear they exaggerated (they did it).It’s literally a continual sexualization of this minor, no matter what she does or says. I felt so bad about the way they made her character.Then, you know, I’m a bisexual girl, so imagine what it was like to see her bisexuality get fetishized like that. Brainwashing is fine, but you can’t make me believe that certain scenes weren’t just used to fetishize her.It was really disturbing to see, where did the atmosphere and writing that the characters of the first season had?I’m not even going to talk about incest between the two sisters, it’s so embarrassing to see the way women have been portrayed in this anime, it was horrendous to watch.Then, going back to talking about how bisexuality is treated in this anime, we can also talk about the chef. A character who’s probably bisexual, making perverted comments about both sexes. It’s horrible, the most utter crap, I don’t know what anyone who’s done this has in mind, but it’s definitely very biphobic.Let’s close the character’s speech, I have more to say, but maybe it’s better to keep quiet.Let’s move on to another problem: the plot.Seriously speaking, I found it just very confusing and meaningless, it’s as if the initial plot did not like and then they made something extremely devastating happen.I don’t know if it could have come out something more beautiful, I have no idea, to me this plot sucked, because it lacks meaningful explanations, I found it very fast, very little explained and very causal.Probably not dependent on who created it, but sincerely 12 episodes for this plot seem to me very few. Don’t get me wrong, I know there’s a sequel, but I’m talking about what’s in between these 12 episodes, not what comes after or before.I’m talking about more in-depth explanations, better written characters, better explained situations that NEEDED to be explained in these 12 episodes.The only thing I can say for her is the way Nanami died. Yeah, I’m telling you, it impressed me and made me feel uncomfortable, but that’s my problem, not the animation.I found it stupid the way the others were handled during his death, but I also found that it’s a different death than the video game, so I don’t know what to say, I’ll limit myself to his scenes during his death, They raised my vow that it would be a one.Stop, I got bored of this review, I could say more, but I think I will stop. I will not watch the sequel and I doubt I will ever play this game. thing: the characters. Holy God, the characters are the most useless and stupid thing I’ve ever seen.

I will not watch the sequel and I doubt I will ever play this game.', 'This review most likely contains a million spoilers from the Danganronpa series so here\'s a preemptive spoiler-less TL;DR : If you love the games and expect all your questions to be answered with solid, sensical information, the mystery left by the games is probably better than what you\'re going to get from this anime.##SPOILERS AHEAD MAYBE?##After playing the Danganronpa games, specially the first one, i was full of questions. I was excited, i had a ton of questions and i had huge expectation for the rest of the story. It was only natural, those games are pretty good and they even have decent endings so...you\'re left with great expectations after you beat them. Specially considering they feed you with little details about what happened in the past and why the hell the games are happening. They make you want more.Needless to say, when i got into this Despair anime i was stoked about it. I was finally going to get all the juicy details the games refused to give me. My expectations were probably a little too high but i couldn\'t really help it. I probably spent 50 or 60 hours playing the first two games and those games kept telling me about this mysterious, brutal, super interesting backstory that would finally explain it all, make it all clear. The whole picture.Sadly, reality rarely meets expectations when it comes to anime.By the time the Despair part of the anime ended i was feeling quite disappointed. I felt like i was cheated into watching just the kind of show that i don\'t enjoy watching. It felt like the amazing thing the games had going for them somehow turned into some average, lazy, edgy seasonal anime show. Nothing wrong with those kinds of shows really, they\'re just not the kind of thing i enjoy watching or what i consider ""good anime"". And that\'s just how this anime felt to me; edgy stuff happening for reasons because what did you expect? Explanations? Sensical developments? Look somewhere else.Again, i was probably expecting a little too much from the backstory but at the very least i wanted some sensical explanations and some legit, organic character development for the despairs, specially for Junko. I mean, by the end of the second game you know a lot about Monokuma but you barely know Junko, even though they\'re pretty much the same character. I know a lot of fans of the series love the character and come up with explanations for everything she does and doesn\'t but to me it\'s all just the same old bull; anime fans trying to find obscure meanings and explanations where there\'s only cheapness and laziness from the writers.Junko\'s ultimate title might as well be ""The Ultimate Plot Armor"". She\'s basically Felix Felicis incarnate. They tell you her talent is being analytical but there\'s tons of things they never explain how she does and why she\'s capable of doing. At times it just seems like she can see the future and know things there\'s no way she could\'ve known. She seems to know about medicine and apparently can also learn stuff really fast and replicate it. She seems to have better detective skills than the Ultimate Detective and better luck than the Ultimate Luck. Up until the very end of the first game (could be argued being defeated and killed was also part of her perfect plans all along though) everything she does goes perfectly right even though people around her had tons of chances to ruin her plans or even stop her. She always has boxes of stuff to blackmail people (don\'t even get me started on the blackmail materials, they\'re the stupidest things ever), people that makes no sense that she even knew existed to begin with so it makes even less sense that she has intimate details about their lives and even their families lives. Who or when takes all these photos, videos, audios, collect the data, etc? Who knows? Who cares? Clearly not the writers. It\'s just another super convenient part of the Junko character. Like many of the things she does, it just happens and you shouldn\'t think about it because that\'s rude.She brainwashes people by showing them videos and apparently introducing some metal things into their brains. Just like that, no infections, no bleeding, no operating room, it\'s alright, it\'s not rocket science people, she doesn\'t even need to do it herself, the one doing this is the Ultimate Soldier who should not know anything about introducing stuff into someone\'s brain, she reads some instructions and just does it. Easy. The whole brainwashing thing isn\'t consistent either. Sometimes she uses the video of the student council massacre and sometimes she uses the monokuma theater. She brainwashed the despairs by showing them a live stream of the Ultimate Gamer dying. How did she manage to use the brainwashing animation techniques in a live stream is never explained though. Add it to the list of things that Junko should\'t be able to do but still manages to do in the end because of reasons.And of course Junko couldn\'t be the character she is without this whole story happening in one of these stereotypical anime iterations of Japan where there\'s no government, no police and teenagers have easy access to weapons and can kill people without consequences, hell, at one point Junko leaves a bomb in a taxi and makes it explode and nobody gives a flying flock about it. Stuff like this happens in Japan all the time i guess.Honestly, if i\'d known this anime was going to ruin the concept i had of the games, i would\'ve avoided watching it. I wish someone had told me so at least i was prepared for the suckotash.Overall, it\'s bad specially if you\'re a fan of the games and expected the same kind of quality. I guess people who love edgy anime that makes no sense and offers little explanations for anything that happens could like it though. you\'re left with great expectations after you beat them. Specially considering they feed you with little details about what happened in the past and why the hell the games are happening. They make you want more.Needless to say, when i got into this Despair anime i was stoked about it. I was finally going to get all the juicy details the games refused to give me.

She always has boxes of stuff to blackmail people (don\'t even get me started on the blackmail materials, they\'re the stupidest things ever), people that makes no sense that she even knew existed to begin with so it makes even less sense that she has intimate details about their lives and even their families lives. Who or when takes all these photos, videos, audios, collect the data, etc? Who knows? Who cares? Clearly not the writers. It\'s just another super convenient part of the Junko character. Like many of the things she does, it just happens and you shouldn\'t think about it because that\'s rude.She brainwashes people by showing them videos and apparently introducing some metal things into their brains. Just like that, no infections, no bleeding, no operating room, it\'s alright, it\'s not rocket science people, she doesn\'t even need to do it herself, the one doing this is the Ultimate Soldier who should not know anything about introducing stuff into someone\'s brain, she reads some instructions and just does it. Easy. The whole brainwashing thing isn\'t consistent either. Sometimes she uses the video of the student council massacre and sometimes she uses the monokuma theater. She brainwashed the despairs by showing them a live stream of the Ultimate Gamer dying. How did she manage to use the brainwashing animation techniques in a live stream is never explained though. Add it to the list of things that Junko should\'t be able to do but still manages to do in the end because of reasons.And of course Junko couldn\'t be the character she is without this whole story happening in one of these stereotypical anime iterations of Japan where there\'s no government, no police and teenagers have easy access to weapons and can kill people without consequences, hell, at one point Junko leaves a bomb in a taxi and makes it explode and nobody gives a flying flock about it. Stuff like this happens in Japan all the time i guess.Honestly, if i\'d known this anime was going to ruin the concept i had of the games, i would\'ve avoided watching it. I wish someone had told me so at least i was prepared for the suckotash.Overall, it\'s bad specially if you\'re a fan of the games and expected the same kind of quality. I guess people who love edgy anime that makes no sense and offers little explanations for anything that happens could like it though.', ""Out of the 3 Danganronpa adaptations, I'll say that the Despair Arc is 100% the strongest out of them. However, considering its competition, I don't think that really says much. It's pretty safe, but I think it told its story well enough to be passable. I love most of the Goodbye Despair cast and I enjoyed seeing their interactions with each other in a cute slice of life anime. However, there's a point where it switches from being a cute slice of life anime into being a super fucked up and sadistic story about the end of the world. Considering that this is a prequel...to Trigger Happy Havoc, it didn't feel too jarring to me, but I can see how that would be an issue to some people. My main problem with this anime is that Junko Enoshima's plan is executed way too easily. I know Junko is the Super High School Level Analyst as well as Fashionista (or Despair), but she could not possibly have planned the entire scheme. Some things just happen to her by chance and she immediately fits them into her plan immediately. Also this isn't really a valid critique but I don't like how she abuses best girl Mukuro. Mukuro deserved better.Anyway this anime is a 6/10 in my opinion. Worth a watch if you're a Danganronpa fan that's played the first two games, otherwise you might not like it as much. to Trigger Happy Havoc, it didn't feel too jarring to me, but I can see how that would be an issue to some people.

You should watch episode one of Zetsubou-hen after the first episode of Mirai-hen, and follow the first episode of Zetsubou-hen by watching the  second episode of Mirai-hen.  Continue watching the shows in this order, since both series spoil each other.  You should also make sure you've played (or watched) Danganronpa, Danganronpa 2, and Ultra Despair Girls.  Otherwise you'll be...very confused.The story of Zetsubou-hen is both it's strongest and weakest aspect.  This is partly due to it being a prequel.  As a fan of the Danganronpa series I'm excited to see the things that have only been mentioned in the games play out in the show.  However, this creates some issues.I already know what's going to happen, and a lot of the time the way the show portrays events they end up not meeting my expectations.  Is this entirely the shows fault?  Not exactly, but it's still something I experienced, and I imagine many others will as well.  The show tries to remedy this somewhat by adding new characters, however since these are the same characters that appear in Mirai-hen (which isn't a prequel) we know what happens.Now, there's one character that we don't already know what happens to, and the end of her story makes for the most powerful moment in the show.  But that's only one positive example in a sea of negative ones.  If the story had been better executed I wouldn't have minded as much.  But it wasn't.I don't have much to say about the art, it's decent.  Some of the characters look rather strange compared to how they do in the games.  But I understand that art style would be difficult to replicate in animated form.  The backgrounds look fine, a little bland but they serve their purpose.  The art in the opening and ending is probably the best this show has to offer.  Overall I think the art in Mirai-hen is noticeably better.I watched this subbed and the voice acting was fine.  Some of the side characters had very over-the-top voices, but thankfully they weren't in the show much.Now, what really serves as the glue connecting everything in the Danganronpa series together is the characters.  And I'm sad to say that the characters are the most consistently bad aspect of the show.  While the story is sometimes bad and sometimes good, at least it was utilized.  The same can't be said for the characters.First off there're way too many of them!  In the games you can spend hours interacting with the characters and getting to know them.  That can't be done in a tv show.  The first episode of the show is used to introduce a bunch of characters that have very little to do in the story.  So I'm only going to talk about some of them.There're several characters from Mirai-hen that are important, their character arcs are really good.  (Except for Munakata, he does nothing.)Chiaki Nanami is the real wild card for this series, since the audience doesn't know what's going to happen to her.  And the conclusion to her arc is the best moment in this show.  However, she's an incredibly simple and bland character, so she doesn't contribute much to the show until the end.Hajime Hinata... is boring as all hell.  He's just there because the pre-existing lore mandates he be there.  He has some cool moments, but overall he does very little.Nagito Komeada is one crazy bastard, shame he's gone for most of the show.Junko Enoshima... is the worst character in this show.  She feels completely out of place (just like in the games).  But unlike the games, she shows up constantly!  Yet she has to be there since she's the big bad.Despite all my whining I enjoyed this show.  It's fun seeing more of the Danganronpa characters and world, it's just a shame it wasn't done better.  Subjectivly I'd give this show a seven out of ten, but it's probably worse from an objective standpoint.  6.5/10Overall I'd reccomend this series if your a Danganronpa fan, but make sure you temper your expectations. very confused.The story of Zetsubou-hen is both it's strongest and weakest aspect.

I watched this crap expecting absolute trash and as it turns out YES IT IS. Yeah the animation and OST in particular are nice, but I can't believe how many asspulls this series had to do to get to desired conclusion. Moreover I liked the first few episodes (sadly like in every danganronpa, the plot consistency flies out of the window). But still the story of those games is just as bad and I'm way too invested in the overall plot, so I'll have to...sit through the final season.PS: If you're doing danganronpa marathon watch this show.

The only really interesting parts are those created especially for anime, but those who came from the second game has lost their essence completely. that I devised as a genius of manipulation.Chiaki's presence in the anime was just a fan service and destroyed the essence of the character in the game.When this anime is analyzed individually (regardless of the game), it gets even worse.

People told me to watch it alternating with future arc in order for things to make...sense, but since I have read danganronpa zero and if plus played the first two games this second part made a lot more sense for me to consume first, and I was expecting a dislocation or confusion from my side because of the way that  I watched the arcs based on my own personal order, but that confusion didn't happen to me.The danganronpa franchise is definetely convuluted, but I have read and played a lot more confusing franchises that are a lot more worse compared to it.  I went into both despair and future arc with really low expectations since danganronpa the animation was  absolute  horseshit and  it was super boring at the same time that I had to drop it, I loved the first game more than the second one despite it's flaws, since I liked the characters more, plus class 77 really didn't click with me, surprisingly the anime somehow made me like these characters a little bit more, now granted I still can't stand some of them like Akane, Hiyoko, Teruteru and Nagito but the anime portrayed them a little bit better than the second game in my opinion.

This is a show you should watch simultaneously with the Future arc, switching between an episode of future and despair in that order. This is a clever way to develop characters present in both arcs and is absolutely worth your effort. You need to play all the games (except V3) in order to understand what is going on, as it is, while a chronological prequel to all...games, relies heavily on your knowledge of the universe and future events. I prefer this arc to Future\'s, mostly as it focuses on characters of the 2nd Visual Novel.I\'ll start with praising the Opening, as I usually do. While the song itself didn\'t capture me as much as Future arc\'s, the colours and overall visuals are very accurately picked and have plenty of references both to future and present of characters (Like Nagito and the revolver barrel on the background). It has enough obvious spoilers, but it is a given, as the show expects of viewer to already know how where the story leads. That being said, there is plenty of unexpected turns along the way. The song is rather calm, only picking up the pace in the middle, with visuals of our heroes falling into despair. And frankly, the song itself is not filling you with hope either. Overall, a very good choice for an opening.Lets talk about characters. We see all of main cast from the 2nd game, as well as some characters we just saw in the first episode of the Future arc. If you wanted more of the friendly shenanigans between the group that were present in the game, then you\'ll be very happy with those, especially first couple of episodes. There is not that much depth added to them compared to VN, and we only really see Chiaki\'s and Hajime\'s development, but, strangely, the focus of the anime is not as much on them as on Junko Enoshima. Yes, the queen is back, and we finally get to see how she caused the most tragic, despair inducing yada yada you get the idea. Her personality is perhaps the most interesting in the whole series, and it is always nice to see more of her. I can\'t say I fully agree with how her plan was handled, but I\'ll speak more about it in spoilers. The only major complaint I have to characters, is that there may be a bit too much sexualisation. The game had a lot of it, sure, but it just seems out of place here at times.The Art is on par with Future arc, perfectly presenting an atmosphere of the school life as well as some really despair™ moments. I\'ll talk more about this specific moment in the spoiler section, but this is one of the few animes that made want to turn it off from how horrible the situation unfolding was, it was really hard to look at. It is all thanks to great animation and sound design.Story is... complicated to talk about without spoilers. All I can say, is that it gives you a lot of somewhat satisfying answers you may had, will you be happy with those answers is another question. I rather was, but there are still some things I wish were different. The story focuses heavily on Junko and her gang, and we see how remnants of despair were turned from hope.Overall, its a good prequel to games, with some parts being worse than others, while still being very enjoyable to watch and fall into despair because of. Its an objective 8 and subjective 9, so I\'ll round it up to 9. In the next section I\'ll discuss some plot elements and ending.Okay, BIG SPOILERS BELOW (for Future Arc included) time.This arc does not have a happy ending, it even says so explicitly. I really enjoy being hurt by a show. Which is why I liked ReZero so much, for example. This show is really good at giving you despair even though you already know it will do something like that, and it is really subjective, but that might be a reason why I loved watching this so much. The way it gets to the point of utter despair is a bit questionable though. To address the elephant in the room. Brainwashing. That is not the best plot device and I wish Junko would just went full charisma on the class and turned them that way. But, I don\'t think there was a way for her to realistically do that. And that she brainwashed them, doesn\'t mean her character is invalid now, as she clearly turned the Monaka gang (from Ultra Despair Girls) by that charisma before. Brainwashing gave us A) an unexpected motive for murders in Future arc, B) a logical explanation to the events of the series, C) one of the most horrifying scenes I\'ve seen, that being Chisa\'s brainwashing. The specific scene from ReZero had the same effect on me, and that scene was far more brutal. In this case, the sound and visuals vibrate with despair and horror and I loved that. But, even though the plot mostly makes sense it has a lot to be desired, as with all of the series, some things make 0 sense and should be accepted as facts (Like, why are student council members so stupid and didn\'t try shooting Junko from the start, resorting to going insane right off the bat, why is Kamukara so bland and goes along with everything, why Mitarai didn\'t at least try to do something, etc) The Ultimate Animator Mitarai is good as a character, but is lacking as a device Junko used to brainwash everyone. Talking about his brainwashing, I suspect that the reason why Opening has such a colour palette, is exactly because of how big of a role colours play in this story, which I honestly loved, but anyway. The ending to the arc is horrifying, with an army of brainwashed people storming the school they were once a part of (similar to Future arc\'s ending, don\'t you think?), and Chiaki\'s death was truly a heartbreaking moment. It is an ending that leads us straight to the events of the first game, with us even being showed how Junko\'s classmates helped her barricade the building they will be soon trapped in themselves. It is a nice ending, filled with despair, exactly what was needed from this story.Also, the ED is very heartwarming, with all of class\'s good memories together linking to Chiaki. Its just a good ED which makes sense from the future lore perspective, and I didn\'t want to skip it that often. games, relies heavily on your knowledge of the universe and future events.

The concept is incredible and the swift pacing and structure of each episode really made me love it. Plus, the characters were incredible.Wanting to see more, I ended up getting a Funimation subscription just to watch Danganronpa 3, and so far I'm not disappointed. It's not as good as the first, but its characters were just as likable and it was muuuuch darker. Plus, we got to learn a lot more about Enoshima and her sister, and they're a blast to watch. My one complaint is that I...wish we got to see more of Naegi and company, but I'm sure they'll come up more in the Hope and Future arcs. wish we got to see more of Naegi and company, but I'm sure they'll come up more in the Hope and Future arcs."", ""Just so you know where my review is coming from, I've never actually played any of the games myself, but I have watched all of CinamonToastKen's playthroughts of all of the Danganronpa games by the time I finally got around to watch the anime, so I was pretty up to speed on all of the events. Also, although I didn't really fell in love with the first game or its characters (although I did enjoy it a lot), it was the second Danganronpa that really did it for me. The story was amazing and the characters themselves were fantastic, to the point where I was...too emotionally invested in all of them and wanted to know more than the game told us about them (though part of me thinks it's because the second game has a lot of underlying ships than the first one, to be honest). And that's when I stumbled upon this anime, so my review is biased, without a doubt.Although I know you're supposed to watch both this arc and the future arc alternated (which I did, mind you), I'm only going to focus my review on this arc because it was my favourite. If you love the characters from the second game and you also wanted to know more about the actual story (you don't learn anything major, but you do get more details that polish up the entire Danganronpa universe), then you're going to love this. Even if the cast isn't your favourite of the two, I think it's worth watching if you're a fan of the whole concept of Despair in this universe, to be honest.One warning though, especially towards the last few episodes, you get into some seriously messed up scenes. It is really not for the faint of heart and they're both extremely graphic and not at all at the same time, since everything happens sort of off screen so you don't get the full picture, but you know exactly what's going on. This arc, more so than the future one, is heavier on both the gore and the psychological side of Danganronpa's special kind of horror, which I really enjoyed.So if you're looking to delve even further into this universe, you have to watch this. Even though we all know how it's going to end, considering this is a prequel of the whole universe the games showed us, it's still full of twists and heartache and it's one of the best times I had within the Danganronpa universe. too emotionally invested in all of them and wanted to know more than the game told us about them (though part of me thinks it's because the second game has a lot of underlying ships than the first one, to be honest).

It would have been perfect if it only got more explanation so it could've been the greatest prequel of the final trilogy of Danganronpa.The story is, well to sum it up is pretty laking, we only got a few explanation about the tragedy and that's kinda it. You might say that it's a slice of life anime that ends up very badly. Kinda reminded me of some other anime in a way.The characters are of course still enjoyable and funny as always. We actually know a little bit more about Chisa since...her umm... yea. She's still my favorite character in DR3 though.Overall, it's an average anime for the people who want to know more about the tragedy but won't get any added explanation about the previous games. her umm... yea.

Other than a few fanservice moments, there is nothing interesting or good about this anime. Story is incredibly uninteresting and full of plot holes. Also tries super hard to be edgy (like episode 9) but just comes off as ridiculous. The artstyle does not fit the Danganronpa world and it looks cheap. The worst are the reserve course students, who don\'t even look human, and look more like blue jello for some...reason. Sound is fair, voice acting is on point as usual for Danganronpa, though I don\'t remember the OP or ED and found them forgettable. As for the characters they\'re mostly fine except for the main antagonists. The students from Class 77-B act mostly the same; Mikan is still timid, Hiyoko is still a bully, Teruteru is still a pervert, Nagito is still hilarious, etc. The new characters, Chisa Yukizome and Juzo Sakakura especially are pretty good for anime original characters. Chiaki Nanami\'s character and relationship with Hajime was done rather well, one of the few aspects I actually liked. Junko Enoshima and Mukuro Ikusaba however have been butchered. Mukuro has been reduced from a badass soldier into a joke that squeals and blushes whenever Junko abuses her, it\'s pathetic. Mukuro\'s character is such a far cry from how she was depicted in DR1 and DR0 that it\'s honestly pitiful to watch. Junko is annoying and doesn\'t have any of the charisma she had in DR1 or DR2. Also lessens her character because we always hear how Junko was a charismatic person that was capable of talking thousands into suicide with words and manipulation alone, but in this anime she is only ever shown to actually manipulate someone successfully twice - With Ryota Mitarai and Juzo Sakakura. Every other showcase is literally just her brainwashing/lobotomizing. Kinda lessens that charismatic aspect when most of her feats is just mind haxxing everyone into oblivion. Izuru looks cool but doesn\'t do anything other than say ""How boring"" for the billionth time.Overall a major disappointment and quite obvious that Kazutaka Kodaka didn\'t do any of the writing. The implications of what Class 77-B did and how they became like that was haunting and disturbing to imagine in DR2 but now that we actually see it, it\'s just so lame. This anime has certain enjoyable parts - Class 77-B\'s interactions with each other, Chiaki and Hajime\'s relationship and Izuru bitch-slapping Mukuro into the shadow realm were all fun to watch, but everything else sucked. reason.

Like...for what it is, it's not as bad as I think others make it out to be BUUUUT...never mind let's just get into this:Story: 4/10Ok sooo...this story is ALL OVER the place. It's connects in some ways to the Danganronpa games and other ways it just...doesn't. They tried to shoehorn in some the stuff from Danganronpa 1 & 2, but all of it just feels like it's kind of out of a place and towards the very end...I was completely...lost. This story really just...isn't great. Granted, the parts where the show is just being itself and not trying to latch itself onto the games themselves, it's fine for what it is...maybe could've focused more on the class rather than the characters that look like Deviantart Danganronpa OCs. The characters act...sort of like they do in the games, certain things are changed though *cough* Hiyo *cough*, but they're still themselves mostly.Visuals: 7/10Ok, now for the stuff I DID like. The art itself looks alright for what it is, basically just the cutscenes from Ultra Despair Girls but it's 23 minutes(ish) instead of like...3-5 minutes. The characters are well animated and nothing really looks...bad. Like I said with in the story section though, most of the original characters are more or less bland or just...OCs.Sound: 8/10Sound is just fine. The characters (at least in the sub) all sound like they did in the game and the original characters have alright voices too. There's some good music here and there (especially the opening, seriously a bop.) Other than that, there's some songs from the soundtracks used along with some good original pieces...I think.Overall: 7/10This was...not as terrible as some people are making it out to be like I said before but this is DEFINITELY for Danganronpa fans only. In fact, the only reason I've been watching this show was because it's canon to the overall story of the franchise...wish me luck on V3.

Sit with the information you received from the games and that’s it. The games are mystery. Not everything should be answered for you. YOU, the player, are given answers that are vague sometimes. But that’s the magic - you get to create your own interpretation of how everything starts and ends. And although *lots* of major points are told in the game, the anime completely soils it by just SHOWING YOU EVERYTHING. It’s predictable...and POINTLESS. The Despair and Hope anime fill in the gaps of what the games didn’t tell you, which is a huge mistake.Another reason why I despise the anime is because it’s a big fat contradiction to everything said in the games as if the countless hours you spent on them don’t matter. It’s infuriating when the games tell you something and then the anime is like “lol no”. There were so many times I facepalmed and was so confused as to why they did this. The writing feels so LAZY too. The scene that made me feel the most despair (mainly because of how HORRIBLE the writing is), was when a... ahem, *certain* character dies (you know, you know). It is was such a poor plot choice.The anime tries too hard. They try way too hard to make you feel despair. It feels juvenile as if an edgy tween wrote it. The ending is also rushed and so underwhelming. If you are a die-hard danganronpa fan... I guess you could give the anime a shot, but I really recommend avoiding it. I sometimes wish I never watched it because now the franchise doesn’t feel the same. The games had atmosphere and plot twists. You’ll get none of that in the anime.I’m writing this at 4 am so yea I can’t comprehend my thoughts well. Overall: avoid like the plague, unless you really can’t help but watch it. and POINTLESS.

It is another thing entirely to completely mire oneself in them.The one interesting part that this anime promised was the exploration of the idea of a despair-based ideology. The end of the world is brought...about by the world becoming collectively frustrated and nihilistic to the point of creating an ideology around it, and destroying the world out of that spite. It also centers around a fashionista who facilitates the destruction, which almost seemed to be some commentary on celebrity worship.Instead, we are informed that hypnosis was all it took, implanted in the media. Any commentary or speculation on what the philosophy could have been is just replaced with basic ""looking at screens made them do it"" and the last episode informs us that philosophy, memes, and whatever else will come later. The fashionista herself has multiple personalities comprised of anime stereotypes, and at no point appears to embody despair enough to convincingly trick the globe into following her. Because it\'s a stereotypical anime too, all action takes place in a high school that somehow affects the entire planet.Not a single redeeming quality can be found in this show, which swaps from strange slice-of-life episodes to a strange bomb/murder subplot to a secret experiment to disappointing resolution. about by the world becoming collectively frustrated and nihilistic to the point of creating an ideology around it, and destroying the world out of that spite.

It is set two years before the first game, even more before the second game, and probably the same amount of time before Ultra Despair Girls. Although it was nice to know the full story of what exactly happened to plunge the world into despair, what we got was rather ridiculous, nonsensical, and downright hard to believe; yet I still found this to be an enjoyable experience nonetheless.Firstly, let me start with...some aspects that I liked. As with the Future Arc, the music was amazing, although I didn’t find the OP and ED as memorable as Future Arc’s. There are so many catchy, stand-out tracks such as Junko’s Theme that you’ll be remembering for a while. Some scenes use music incredibly well to their advantage, such as contrasting bloody tragedies and extreme violence with a beautiful, happy melody sung by a light voice; this serves to freak out the watcher a bit more than they would be normally. The art-style and animation of the show are also pretty good. The character designs change the designs from Danganronpa 2 just enough to fit with Danganronpa 3 but not detract from their distinct features.The voice acting in the English dub was not too terrible save for a Junko here and there. I understand that her whole valley girl shtick really fits with the type of character she is, but it gets obnoxious with “Kamakura, Kamakura, yaas queen!” If you’ve played the previous games in dub, just know that none of the characters keep their game voices except Chiaki, Hajime/Kamakura, Nekomaru, Nagito, Sonia, Kazuichi, Teruteru, Mikan, and a few others, meaning that some voices will take a while getting used to. However, I’d say that, overall, the voice acting in dub really fit the characters, even if they weren’t using the voices I was used to.The story takes place before any of the Danganronpa games in order to tell the story of how Class 77-B (the cast of DR2) all met and enjoyed their school life, the various happenings surrounding Hajime Hinata, as well as how the world ultimately fell into despair at the hands of Junko Enoshima. The only one of these focuses I take an issue with is the latter; not because of the mere idea of it, but rather how it was executed. Let us pretend, for a moment, that it is not impossible for a single edgy high-school girl to cause a disaster so great that humanity falls to its knees: are you seriously telling me she managed this through the power of anime? Fucking anime was enough to bring despair worldwide? Also, why would Izuru ever agree to cooperate with Junko? He’s literally the Ultimate Hope. There are just so many details that are ridiculous or make zero sense that it is hard to ignore, and these can culminate into the smallest things that seem to be the causes of The Tragedy. If one guy just stayed at home, there wouldn’t be a despair. If one guy just came out of the closet, there wouldn’t be a despair. So much rubbish to unpack. Nevertheless, I will admit that it was nice to see how it began regardless.I found the characters to be all right for the most part with a few exceptions. The characters from outside of Class 77-B and the Reserve Department—that is to say, the anime-only characters—are in this weird situation where they rely on Despair Arc to make sense in Future Arc. For this reason, I would say that Despair Arc is like the answer arcs in Higurashi, making sense of why something happens in Future Arc. Only watching one of these arcs, however, will make these characters far less compelling than they would be normally. Then again, I found Ruruka, Izayoi, and Kimura dumb even when watching both arcs. Shifting away from these characters, Junko, Mukuro, and Mitarai were all really annoying throughout the whole show. Junko never becomes any deeper than just “DESPAIR!” Mukuro blindly follows whatever Junko says for reasons unknown even though she treats her like trash, and Ryota Mitarai was such a pussy that it got infuriating. If he had the tiniest balls, The Tragedy wouldn’t have happened. Aside from those characters, I mostly enjoyed what everyone had to offer, even if development was exclusively focused on Chisa, Chiaki, Hajime, and a few others.Danganronpa 3 – Despair Arc was a nice addition to the series that provided a fitting answer as to how Junko Enoshima plunged the world into despair before Makoto and the remaining members of Class 78-B defeated her. I feel as though the mere fact that it is a prequel made me slightly more forgiving of serious faults in the plot, which are not fully remedied even when watching Future Arc simultaneously.

Although it may be because the Danganronpa 2 cast was my favourite among all of the games. My full review of Danganronpa as a whole will be on the Danganronpa: The Animation page but I just wanted to say that this arc was my favourite since I got to see my favourite characters.All the Dr2 characters were written so perfectly. First lets talk about Hajime Hinata, our main protagonist of this arc (kind of). His character represents how people would act just to reach their goals through unstopping...determination, to the point of losing himself.Nagito is another character that plays an important role in the story. If you played Dr2, it probably felt like Nagito was the smartest character in the entire Danganronpa franchise. His brain was so big that even the other characters had a hard time comprehending him because of the way his character was written. In the anime, he plots some stuff and somehow gets away with it. Why? Because he\'s the Ultimate Lucky Student and he manages to keep that title till the very end.Chiaki Nanami probably had the most ""realistic"" character development in this show. It showed us that just because you are entitled to your own Ultimate talent, doesn\'t mean you can\'t do other things as well. She was like the breakthrough of Danganronpa (as well as Makoto, ig) and I came to really appreciate her by the end of the show. She went from being an introverted gamer head to a class prez who lead the class well all because she kept an open-mind and caring heart.More Danganronpa reviews will be on other pages. determination, to the point of losing himself.Nagito is another character that plays an important role in the story.

Although the show introduces an anticlimactic conclusion, I was able to follow, enjoy, and leave this show with content.Character(6/10)-- Most of the cast isn\'t developed properly and is shoved to the side for the plot, and only a few of them stand out.Hajime Hinata: His character was well-written, reasonable, and understandable. He wasn\'t overly polite, he stood up for what he believed in, and had motives. He was solemn and dejected because he didn\'t have a talent. He strove to get a talent so that he could feel worthy. His character is immensely relatable because many people in life feel like they are not good enough and that they have to strive to be better. I\'ve had this feeling multiple times. He willingly signed up for a human experiment so that he could feel worthy of himself, and his new friend Chiaki. So that he could hang around the talented people without feeling any shame of not belonging. I applaud whoever wrote Hajime in the anime.Junko Enoshima: I like her character the least, and it\'s not because of some surface-level bias towards her being a villain. It\'s because she is not entertaining at all and does her job horribly as a villain. She is reckless and yet her plans go off seamlessly. She does all of this out in the open with cameras and alarms, yet Future Foundation, which has the highest technology, can\'t find out whether she is the villain or not. You can\'t find evidence? Her fingerprints and cloth fibers are all over the scene. The writers try to make her manipulative and cunning by making the other characters slow-witted. I can\'t see how a simpleminded girl like her can throw the whole world into despair. Her motives are generic. When she was born, she felt bored, and started to throw the whole world in despair just because. Her motives aren\'t interesting and her character isn\'t interesting. (she\'s evil just to be evil. That is one of the many worst tropes you should not include in your writing)Chiaki Nanami: Her character is heavily relatable. An introvert who is absorbed in games and can\'t talk to others because most of the time they wouldn\'t have the same interests as her. I\'ve felt like this before. Most of my friends aren\'t into anime as I am, and I don\'t know/watched enough anime to talk about it with other weebs. I like her character development when she became more open towards others and made new friends.Natsumi Kuzuryu: She was also like Hajime. She felt dejected because she didn\'t live up to the family image by not having a talent. That\'s where the similarities stop. She hides behind this cruel persona and belittles others to make her herself seem better. She gives herself the fake title of ""Super High School Level Sister."" She will do anything in her power to get a talent. But it\'s impossible. No matter how much money you give. She knows this, but she is persistent. Despite her attitude, I love the stubborn side of her character. She was even planning to remove one of the talented students from the class. This made her character very interesting.The other characters are secondary and we don\'t really interact with them, so I won\'t make a paragraph about them.Story(7/10): The story was zany, then naturally started to get more dark over the span of the arc. The only reason it\'s not rated a ten is because it failed to serve as a good backstory for the mainline games.Premise--I had liked what they tried with the show. Hajime gets into human experiment and the information about this experiment gets leaked towards the public. The public starts a riot because instead of their money helping the Reserve Course, it was helping the experiment. The class has to sit there as their once-perfect school is turning into mayhem. The setting is so realistic and interesting. But this is supposed to serve as the backstory before the students became Remnants of Despair. And they needed to come up with something somehow. So they introduced this: brainwashing. That\'s it. No interesting motives. No moral dilemmas. This arc went from the best to being subpar.The art is a 9/10. The characters and the setting looked aesthetically pleasing.The sound was outstanding, 10/10. Although I am not fluent in Japanese, I was singing gleefully with the opening song. The intro is a bop.You should watch the series if you\'re looking for a fun time. I enjoyed the story and characters despite it\'s flaws. I liked watching this anime. Although the show introduces an anticlimactic conclusion, I was able to follow, enjoy, and leave this show with content.Character(6/10)-- Most of the cast isn\'t developed properly and is shoved to the side for the plot, and only a few of them stand out.Hajime Hinata: His character was well-written, reasonable, and understandable. He wasn\'t overly polite, he stood up for what he believed in, and had motives. He was solemn and dejected because he didn\'t have a talent. He strove to get a talent so that he could feel worthy. His character is immensely relatable because many people in life feel like they are not good enough and that they have to strive to be better. I\'ve had this feeling multiple times. He willingly signed up for a human experiment so that he could feel worthy of himself, and his new friend Chiaki. So that he could hang around the talented people without feeling any shame of not belonging. I applaud whoever wrote Hajime in the anime.Junko Enoshima: I like her character the least, and it\'s not because of some surface-level bias towards her being a villain. It\'s because she is not entertaining at all and does her job horribly as a villain. She is reckless and yet her plans go off seamlessly. She does all of this out in the open with cameras and alarms, yet Future Foundation, which has the highest technology, can\'t find out whether she is the villain or not. You can\'t find evidence? Her fingerprints and cloth fibers are all over the scene. The writers try to make her manipulative and cunning by making the other characters slow-witted. I can\'t see how a simpleminded girl like her can throw the whole world into despair. Her motives are generic. When she was born, she felt bored, and started to throw the whole world in despair just because. Her motives aren\'t interesting and her character isn\'t interesting. (she\'s evil just to be evil. That is one of the many worst tropes you should not include in your writing)Chiaki Nanami: Her character is heavily relatable. An introvert who is absorbed in games and can\'t talk to others because most of the time they wouldn\'t have the same interests as her. I\'ve felt like this before. Most of my friends aren\'t into anime as I am, and I don\'t know/watched enough anime to talk about it with other weebs. I like her character development when she became more open towards others and made new friends.Natsumi Kuzuryu: She was also like Hajime. She felt dejected because she didn\'t live up to the family image by not having a talent. That\'s where the similarities stop. She hides behind this cruel persona and belittles others to make her herself seem better. She gives herself the fake title of ""Super High School Level Sister."" She will do anything in her power to get a talent. But it\'s impossible. No matter how much money you give. She knows this, but she is persistent. Despite her attitude, I love the stubborn side of her character. She was even planning to remove one of the talented students from the class. This made her character very interesting.The other characters are secondary and we don\'t really interact with them, so I won\'t make a paragraph about them.Story(7/10): The story was zany, then naturally started to get more dark over the span of the arc. The only reason it\'s not rated a ten is because it failed to serve as a good backstory for the mainline games.Premise--I had liked what they tried with the show. Hajime gets into human experiment and the information about this experiment gets leaked towards the public. The public starts a riot because instead of their money helping the Reserve Course, it was helping the experiment. The class has to sit there as their once-perfect school is turning into mayhem. The setting is so realistic and interesting. But this is supposed to serve as the backstory before the students became Remnants of Despair. And they needed to come up with something somehow. So they introduced this: brainwashing. That\'s it. No interesting motives. No moral dilemmas. This arc went from the best to being subpar.The art is a 9/10. The characters and the setting looked aesthetically pleasing.The sound was outstanding, 10/10. Although I am not fluent in Japanese, I was singing gleefully with the opening song. The intro is a bop.You should watch the series if you\'re looking for a fun time. I enjoyed the story and characters despite it\'s flaws.', ""I was worried about this going in as anyone who knows the games knows that this arc is going to be lacking sunshine and rainbows. I mean it's called the despair arc and it isn't kidding. The way Crunchyroll presents the two arcs takes the pressure off this, however. Splitting the episodes up really helps take the edge off while not breaking the flow. If you're a fan of the games, watch this. If not, skip it. The rest will be written assuming knowledge of at least the mainline games.This addresses the gaps in the timeline so far, while also feeding into the Future arc....You know these characters by now, and even the new ones aren't that new if you've already watched Ep1 of the future arc. It fully expects you to know and remember these people from the games, so those with a vaguer memory better have Google at the ready.The writing here is peak Danganronpa, people doing things in the way no human would, characters randomly appearing/having access to stuff that makes no sense. Rationale, tone and logic are completely foreign concepts here. As usual though, it works, it all ties together and actually works as an anime rather well.One major caveat, neither arc features the courtroom stuff that is the main feature of the games. It wouldn't have worked anyway, but if you love that stuff you'll be disappointed. Other than that, this arc really surprised me. It even backloads the plot so basically everything happens in the last couple of episodes in a true assault on your senses. True Danganronpa stuff.

True Danganronpa stuff."", ""This was the most brutal anime so far that I have watched. If you have watched Danganronpa: The Animation it is actually kind of useless to watch the other 2 seasons, especially this one, because it is just a long OVA of what has happened in the past.The story is great, but to my taste it was too brutal, it became really unwatchable, and I defenetly really don't like this season for Danganronpa.It's kind of like watching a completely different anime, with the same story almost. Like in Tokyo Ghoul, where there were Tokyo Ghoul:RE and we got completely new characters. The thing that is...different here that this is played in the past, so again, it is not really a big deal if you completely just ignore this whole season. We all know what happened in Danganronpa:The Animation (first season) and I also recommend the other Danganronpa 3 to watch, but honestly, it wouldn't even be that big of a deal, not only to skip this season, but to mix the two Danganronpa 3 seasons up, since it's completely different in time.I didn't like that I didn't see anything of what happened with Naegi, Aoi and the animator guy who I forgot the name of xs.I didn't like what happened to Hinata, and I didn't like that almost every character died, or got completely crazy, so it's almost the same, as if they would have died. But I guess this is just a sad ending anime, which is completely fine, but for my taste, I would say it's a nono.There were many brutal scenes, especially in the 2nd part of the season, the first few episodes were pretty chill, there were also many funny moments. The brutality started from I think around episode 6 or 7, but I'm not exactly sure, when the class representatives, or whatever their name is, started to kill each other. I felt really really really uncomfortable, it was really brutal and depressing, which I guess suits a horror anime very well, but again, it is really far away from my personal taste in genres.I felt like the ending was really rushed, and they tried to explain the whole story and the creators were like... okay there is the ending, end of story. It felt a little weird, and it didn't even feel like an ending. It was just one more episode.The characters... I liked Chisa, and I'm happy that we actually got to see this side of her, and I loved her class. My favourite was the gamer girl, Nanami, I really cried when she died, it was so horrible.I still really dislike Murakata and Sakakura for what they have done in the other Danganronpa 3 series, this time around they were just more likeable, and I kind of understood why they acted the way they acted. Sakakura however is just a straight up loser, and he puts his needs first instead of every humans lives, and then acts like the big saviour of the world. He backstabbed not just Murakata, but everyone. But well, later on Murakata backstabbed him too, so it's 50-50 at the end of the day. This makes me  so sad because i think Sakakura is an extremely good looking character, to see him get ruined like this is just annoying.Talking about good looking guy ruined by a shitty character, mister Sonosuke Izayoi, and her idiot girlfriend Ruruka Ando.Ando is my most hated anime character of all time so far, I am really disgusted by her, and her sugar freak boyfriend. Worst couple I have ever seen. I feel horrible for Kimura and she deserved better.So overall, this anime is pretty useless to watch, unless you want to know the backstory, and if you are INTO horror and blood and death and psycho stuff. This one was just completely not for me, and i can't wait to watch stupid but entertaining Slice of life animes after this.Story 5/10Art 2/10 (why were the background characters all in blue?!)Characters 3/10Enjoyment 1/10Overall 1.5/10 because I can't give a higher point to my personal view, although i have to admit, the story itself is great. different here that this is played in the past, so again, it is not really a big deal if you completely just ignore this whole season.

You absolutely need to be caught up on what happens in the games in order to fully understand what is going on in this anime. What the anime accomplishes is a fun and despair filled experience that will help tell the tale of our gifted class.Story: 6/10As you hopefully already...know, this anime revolves around the class that we interacted with in the second game. We are given a spotlight on how the class interacted with each other before the horrible killing event that destroyed not only Hope's Peak Academy but also most of the world. The one thing that is really holding me back on enjoying this prequel is the pacing. We start out at a good pace but then things start rushing once the first despair event comes into play. There is also a huge time skip early on that does not help with the pacing issue. Then once the anime hits its stride, it ends. The ending events just come so quickly that I found it hard to fully invest in the actions happening on screen.Animation: 9/10I one hundred percent love the art-style. It mends very well with what I remember in the game save for Akane's and Ibuki's character models. For some reason they just look...off from what I remember from the game. The architecture is very appealing, the background shots are detailed, the eyes are of course awesome, and the characters look and move great on screen. There is a very good sense of fluid action (even though there really isn't a whole lot of action scenes).EDIT: I forgot to mention how awesome the OP is. It changes as the season comes closer to the end which is a really cool touch.Sound: 9/10They thankfully did not butcher the music from the first and second game. It is used very well in the anime in key spots as well as in non-critical scenes. Also hot damn that opening song is amazing. The voice actors retain their likeness from the games especially Junko. Overall it was a very pleasing anime to listen to.Characters: 8/10So due to the pacing issues I brought up in the story section the characters do feel a little flat. Some of them get a huge spotlight but a lot of them really get sidelined. Regardless though these characters do feel like their counterparts in the second game (which is a good thing). Junko however completely steals the spotlight even though she does not appear until the halfway point of the anime. Her character is just all over the place and it is just a joy to watch her inflict despair on everyone. Bonus points for another certain female character that of course steals the scene once she arrives (you know who I'm talking about).Overall: 8/10It's hard to not over-score this anime since it really is one for the fans of the games. If you watch it without playing the games (WHICH IS A REALLY BAD IDEA DON'T DO IT) then you will probably be lost and think it is average. For the fans though I think that the anime does a pretty good job of expanding our knowledge of what we already knew. The show is not perfect (due to pacing and sidelined characters) but it is very far way from average. Great acoustic qualities, amazing visual presentation, and amazing despair make this anime a must watch for the fans of the game.Enjoyment: 8.4/10Thanks for reading my review!

Before this season you should have seen season 1.The season contained 11 episodes and almost half the season about nothing happened, apart from an intense ecchi-containing character. Only around episode 6 and further around 8 did something begin to build up on the explanation. Which really ruined the entire arc of the season. It was also extremely weak in detail. So in overall, this Season was just there for bad characters, fan service and nothing else.Story:...The story of the plot focused on the events of the past and the story of hope, which ended in despair.Nothing at all happened. You only got to know the flat characters. Then everything escalated a little and it was over again.One could easily have cut this season by half the airtime, given the lack of material. Or be able to expand better with a little creativity. However, none of this was done.Animation / pictures:There is nothing negative about the animations, they don\'t really differ much from those from the first season. They still look pleasant and slightly new.Characters:Gorgeous, just gorgeous.You really follow the pattern here- Individual design = interesting character-No, that\'s just wrong. And again you have a bunch of personalities who do nothing, just seem completely irrelevant and irrelevant.Except for one or the other character who has a relationship to the other seasons, there was nothing worth mentioning here.As expected, you also had to build in an enormous amount of fan service. This was undoubtedly missing in the first season.Music:There is nothing new to say. Intro and Outro was normal. Soundtracks Soundtracks have been very absent. Until the end you hardly noticed it and it was mostly average.My conclusionIt is a season that you must have seen to be able to follow the content. But unfortunately it has become very disappointing in terms of content and simply did not seem impressive, not even close.I write this Review after watching all the other seasons and yes, this one is the worst by far.

The anime focused on this new cast of characters as well as, new aspects of the Hopes peak academy that I never imagined, as someone who was yet to play the games.The anime portrayed the reserves course and ""The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History"" effectively, the light-hearted high school moments paired with the darker events that occur in the anime...are paired together accordingly.

However, the op reflecting the calming aesthetics of the intro supports the sound design of the anime itself. Junko had a lot of attention placed on her and we gain more insight into what she was like prior to ""The Tragedy"" other characters like Hajime, Nagito even Sakakura.

This one was much darker than the first, and in a way a lot more terrifying. The graphic amounts were still on the smaller side of the R-rated ones, but the violence itself and the drive behind it is much darker. Danganronpa really has a message to convey, and the message honestly chilled me to the bone. How people can be driven to do awful things, not to people they hate or strangers, but friends. There is a lot of truth in here, and in the midsts...of the world's chaos currently, it's rather frightening to think that we, also, could be close to, 'The Most Despair Inducing Event in the History of Mankind.' Close to all the violence against one another, and all the distrust. Close to the end of the world.

They do. All of the kids have a super fancy skill including...the one super muscly dude who blew up half a building die to his...trip to the bathroom?? True story. And they are all normal humans. Another guy is a good cook and a pervert who ends up doping the class with a date-rape drug so that made this awkward if I were to watch this with other people.Junko is also super OP and evil and also breaks the fourth wall a few times. She causes the apocalypse after she kidnaps a guy who says ""I love anime"" many times and a guy who was a loser who signed up to become a human experiment after he wanted to be less of a loser and uses their abilities to brainwash the masses and slaughter a bunch of high schoolers.(not necessarily in order, although the slaughtering high schooler\'s thing repeats a few times)Junko has a twin sister who has a kink for getting treated like dirt by Junko, she actually gets screen time here instead of the first Danganronpa animation as she gets killed off in the first episode there.Hinata is the loser guy who gets to be the embodiment of ""Hope"" and gets long hair and red eyes as a result, he also gets regrets when his almost girlfriend dies tragically, causing all the class to become brainwashed people full of DESPAIR.Despair breaks the world as the result of one teenager brainwashing a bunch of kids and then society collapses pretty quick. Too bad for the world I guess, you tried?...That\'s pretty D E S P A I R - I N D U C I N GArt: 4/10A much lighter tone then the Future arc, although it gets darker as the story progresses in colour and subject matter. Also there\'s pink blood again, definitely nicer to look at then if there was red blood.The animation is fine although I \'m pretty sure the gymnast girl isn\'t wearing a bra and her boobs would be slapping her in the face more often.Nothing really bad or crazy good, it\'s decent.Sound: 6/10The opening was pretty good, I rather liked the softer tone it had, plus the nice pastel-looking visuals. I also really liked the kind of mumble/voice speaking at the beginning.The ending was decent as well, I also don\'t remember much about it.Characters: 3/10The point of this arc was to explain the characters/motivation of the Future arc, and it did a decent job. It felt rather long and plot-dependance heavy throughout the middle to end, as in the character\'s interactions were not present enough nor interesting enough without following the actual plot of and Junko\'s planning of ""The Most Despair Inducing Event in History etc"" to be good enough on their own.The students all felt pretty one-dimensional, other then how they tried to develop the gamer chick Chiaki Nanami although she didn\'t really have enough of a personality for that so it felt forced. Also Hinata, although he was pretty boring before and after he became the embodiment of Hope.Also wow you know Kyosuke, Chisa Yukizome and Juzo Sakakura are important and have deep backstories because they get a decent amount of screentime as well as they spy on people to get answers and want to create an ideal world. Also Sakakura turns out to be gay for Kyosuke and wants to stay in the closet so bad he lets Junko plunge the world into Despair. Glad they developed his character well enough for me to care. Oops.Enjoyment: 4/10This actually tried to explain things and cover a lot of plot, and I appreciate that. I just don\'t appreciate how it all turned out, it dragged in the middle and they didn\'t make me care enough about the characters and their relationships to believe how affected they all were by Nanami\'s death. Also no way she would have lived that long (JUST long enough to break down Hinata/Izuru Kamukura\'s emotional walls to make him cry) after being impaled that many times.Overall: 4/10One scene that stuck with me was when Junko forced one random bg character into sawing his own head off, that was messed up. This reminds me of a certain Holme\'s ability to brainwash anyone after talking to them...COUGHeurusCOUGHAlso I felt the quippy ""we don\'t have enough screentime for this"" lines were a bit much. Also the whole Ryota Mitarai thinking ""all because I like anime"" like, too many times for too many ""serious"" moments. the one super muscly dude who blew up half a building die to his...trip to the bathroom??

And I must say, watching the series for the first time while being completely hyped for the series clouds one\'s judgement for the series. From my first time watching I remember the series being really fresh and a good way to explore Danganronpa stories and lore. Unfortunately, it really isn\'t any of those.Story: 6Danganronpa 3: Zetsubou-hen goes back to the past, before any of the happenings of the main games/anime adaptation. We follow the future-to-be main cast of the Super Danganronpa 2 game [SDR2 SPOILERS] turned...into the Remnants of Despair, which is revealed in the final chapter of the game [SPOILER END]. Generally the anime is to be watched after beating SDR2, since the anime would be even more confusing without the original experience, so to say. All characters are generally introduced in the beginning, but all the totally wack first episode probably turned off any watchers who aren\'t familiar with the SDR2 cast. But really all the series is, is over-explaining plot points from the SDR2 game and giving fanservice to SDR2 fans, who were desperate to see the game get an adaptation like the first one did. After re-watching the series, I realized that that\'s all it can give. On top of that, the series also introduces unnecessary characters, plotpoints and -twists to give the series more depth and a longer runtime in total.  In conclusion, the story isn\'t very good, but that doesn\'t mean that it isn\'t entertaining to watch. I will address some of the plotlines and reasons a bit later.Art: 7Lerche is actually one of my favorite animation studios, but the animation in Danganronpa 3 is average compared to some of their other works like Assassination Classroom or the more recent Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun. Both series had high-quality, smooth and interesting animations that Danganronpa unfortunately doesn\'t really have. The designs are mostly faithful to the original game, only a couple of things like appearance or clothes have been matched to the correct time (where the series sits in the DR timeline). The new characters the series introduces are mostly a bit boring with a few exceptions like Ruruka and the other new students that the series gets more into in Mirai-hen. The animation is mostly smooth, if you don\'t look at the background characters too much, which is enough to make it enjoyable.Sound: 9One thing that Danganronpa and Studio Lerche both usually nail is voice acting and soundtracks, and this series is no exception. Most of the voice actors from the original SDR2 game are back to voice their characters, and all the voice performances are really solid. If I had to point one specific voice performance out, it\'d be the amazing Megumi Ogata who came back to do Komaeda and Naegi\'s voices. Her performance is the most notable in the series, and she continues to nail both the determined, optimistic Makoto Naegi and the more calm, cool but crazy Nagito Komaeda. The soundtrack is a solid one combining some new tracks but also some older ones that were used in thew original games and the first anime adaptation. Both the opening and ending are fresh and unique, especially the opening, which I didn\'t skip even once while watching.Character: 9What really keeps me from giving the characters of this anime a 10 are mostly two reasons:1. The new charactersMost of the new characters added don\'t give anything fresh into the series to the point where every time the series tries to focus into these new characters and make them go through character development, I am not interested in any way. The new characters, especially the Ultimate Animator, are unnecessary for the experience of the most Danganronpa fans. We don\'t necessarily need a plot line explaining how Junko ended up making the Despair videos, since most people accepted it as a fact when it was first introduced in the games. Second of all, the whole plot line involving Chiaki. [SPOILERS] the purpose of bringing Chiaki back was mostly, again, probably fanservice and filling plot holes. When it was first revealed in the game that Chiaki was the traitor of the Future Foundation and a computer AI, it was presented as a fact, not necessarily needing a detailed explanation, at least for me personally. Still, even though I\'m not too fond of this whole plotline and how it linked into Hinata and the teacher, I understand the series\' reason to address this plotline-slash-plothole and make Chiaki even more of a lovable character. Her death is one of the most despairful of the series, and definetly bittersweet when you watch it for the first time. [SPOILER END]2. The amount of stereotypia and lack of character development the older characters are givenI would assume that most of us watched this series because of the fact, that it would let us see our favorite SDR2 character on screen and to know the full story of how they became the Remnants of Despair. And yes, the series gives us mostly what it promises. But what it had given to the unnecessary development of the new characters, it lacks in the development of the older characters. Since most of the characters does ""die"" during the SDR2 game, it would\'ve been awesome to see the characters that maybe had a little less development in the game to go through some development in the anime series. Personally would\'ve liked to explore Fuyuhiko and Peko\'s relationship more, since I felt like it had more potential that it was given. Also Mikan\'s plotline made sense for her character, but was in a weird way, disappointing and unsatisfying. Chiaki is one of the only SDR2 characters to go through very solid character development and a good arc that manages to give everything it needed and had. Even Hinata\'s whole plotline was addressed in a lackluster way compared to the influence it ended up having in the end. Also, to address the fangirl in the room, one of the other most popular characters is absent for around half the series, and existed solely to give more content and fanservice. It literally goes like boom, the character is gone, and six episodes later, boom, he comes back. It made no sense at any point , and probably was one of the reasons the creators gave the character a special later.Enjoyment: 9Even with all its flaws, the series is still a fun watch and especially when you watch it for the first time, very satisfying. Even when watching for the second time, I enjoyed the experience and even laughed out loud a couple of times. Sadly, while watching, I had this thought in the back of my head that I couldn\'t brush off the whole time I was watching it. It went somewhere along the lines of ""why am I enjoying this so much when it clearly isn\'t very good in actuality"", and I feel like it sums my feelings pretty well. The series is worse than what you think while watching, which can really either be a good or a bad thing. The series manages to pull the heartstrings and fangirl/boy heart of every Danganronpa fan, even though in conclusion the series is rather lackluster. And in all honesty, what else do you need? If one enjoys the series even though it has a lot of wasted potential, that means that the series managed to use its best qualities to the fullest.Overall: 8 into the Remnants of Despair, which is revealed in the final chapter of the game [SPOILER END].

This Despair Arc is a great example of how brainwashing is an acceptable answer sometimes... but not in all cases.First things first, I've really been enjoying these 2 season threes so far. But enjoyment isn't always enough for a recommendation. I have to classify this one under 'Mixed Feelings,' because the Danganronpa franchise has always had one big issue... That issue being that you really can't enjoy it properly without going all in. You have to play the...games AND watch the anime to get the whole experience. And I believe an adaptation should be able to stand alone, so that's a failure on its part.You can technically get the whole story of the first game through the season one adaptation... but in a way that's really rushed and unlikely to endear you to the characters the way the game does. (Made a whole separate review for that season, so I'll try not to repeat myself here.)But the second game never got an anime adaptation, and I really don't think you can properly enjoy this arc without already knowing these characters through the game. Feel how poignant it was to step back in time and see the happier days where they all started, knowing that it all falls apart... But the reveal at the end of game two that the flawed but loveable group of kids we'd gotten to know through the simulation was actually our main villains spurring on the world's destruction out in the real world made them super intriguing. It definitely got me excited to see exactly HOW it all falls apart. Which brings us back to the brainwashing.So. When is brainwashing okay?For the nameless, faceless lackeys who jumped on board? Sure. The story's plausibility was always a bit of a weak point in the games. They literally just brush over it when the apocalypse is introduced at the end of the first game, don't even try to give you an explanation, because they clearly couldn't find a way to make Junko's followers make sense. Mass brainwashing kind of makes sense. (Though, for the other members of the reserve course specifically, the school's attitude and policies were truly fucked up. I feel like there was enough fuel on that fire that brainwashing wasn't exactly necessary but... Nameless, faceless. Enough said.)For a character like Chisa, who really embodied hope? Okay. There was no believable way that Junko was going to win her over. And it became important to the rest of the story even happening that Chisa be convinced to defend her to Munakata, convince him that she wasn't behind it after all.But for the rest of the class, the Remnants of Despair? Absolutely not.It's really important to note that the group of kids in the second game felt more openly flawed than the kids from the first game. For a lot of people, that just made them more relatable, was part of the reason why the second game was so well-loved. The characters were more rounded and just more interesting overall. But they were flawed as hell, practically bubbling over with their various insecurities. Many of them had been abused so regularly throughout their lives that they didn't even realize that they deserved to be treated better. I have never seen a group more ripe for being manipulated. So to fall back on a deus ex machina like brainwashing for THEM? Unforgivable. I get that they probably didn't have time to show Junko winning each of them over... but the material was there. They should have made time for it.That aside, I did really enjoy the Despair Arc as a whole. There were a few other flaws. The way they chose to characterize Mukuro was really disappointing. And I'd really hoped to see more of Junko and Mukuro interacting with their class but... not enough time. I get that. It was satisfyingly brutal. I liked seeing the drama with Fuyuhiko's sister's death play out and learning how it influenced Hajime's actions and mindset. And Chiaki's death was wonderfully horrifying. The Danganronpa franchise may have its flaws... but it's never been one to pull its punches, and I love that about it. games AND watch the anime to get the whole experience.

And it became important to the rest of the story even happening that Chisa be convinced to defend her to Munakata, convince him that she wasn't behind it after all.But for the rest of the class, the Remnants of Despair? Absolutely not.It's really important to note that the group of kids in the second game felt more openly flawed than the kids from the first game. For a lot of people, that just made them more relatable, was part of the reason why the second game was so well-loved. The characters were more rounded and just more interesting overall. But they were flawed as hell, practically bubbling over with their various insecurities. Many of them had been abused so regularly throughout their lives that they didn't even realize that they deserved to be treated better. I have never seen a group more ripe for being manipulated. So to fall back on a deus ex machina like brainwashing for THEM? Unforgivable. I get that they probably didn't have time to show Junko winning each of them over... but the material was there. They should have made time for it.That aside, I did really enjoy the Despair Arc as a whole. There were a few other flaws. The way they chose to characterize Mukuro was really disappointing. And I'd really hoped to see more of Junko and Mukuro interacting with their class but... not enough time. I get that. It was satisfyingly brutal. I liked seeing the drama with Fuyuhiko's sister's death play out and learning how it influenced Hajime's actions and mindset. And Chiaki's death was wonderfully horrifying. The Danganronpa franchise may have its flaws... but it's never been one to pull its punches, and I love that about it."", 'lots of spoilersI quite like the first couple episodes because it was refreshing to see the DR2 gang together again without a care in the world. Honestly, I probably wouldn’t mind a slice of life anime with just the Danganronpa students (well, minus a few of the really, really stupid ones). Anyway, I really didn’t like how it transitioned from a happy-go-lucky setting to sudden chaos and destruction. Junko somehow meets Ryoto (by this so called “fate”…yeah, more like asspulling at its finest), and somehow makes a brainwashing anime which is totally unrealistic and unconvincing, yet the anime still went along with it. Instead of...showing the characters gradually sink into murderous villains (and we didn’t even end up seeing their heinous acts), they were magically transformed into spawns of the devil! And the audience is supposed to just accept that? Yeah, no. Oh I did like the Chiaki death scene though, I would say that was the only event in the anime that actually did a decent job of pushing someone from hope to despair. showing the characters gradually sink into murderous villains (and we didn’t even end up seeing their heinous acts), they were magically transformed into spawns of the devil!

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR. Maybe I\'ll continue with the manga.

Unfortunately, there's no Ushiko-Umao reference in this one. The story's pretty interesting since it's got time travel and inevitable time paradoxes, though. We get a little info on the lives of the main characters after the events of the first movie, then we also learn about how things are for them three years later.

I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie.

""', ""'Shin Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Beginning' is the second Kimagure Orange Road movie, which was shown in the mid90s. It's 90s æsthetic rather than 80s. It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter. That's why the manga ending is said to be different to the...anime ending. Also, Matsumoto did not approve of the writing of the first movie.This second movie, on the other hand, is not written by Matsumoto. Its source material is the Shin Kimagure Orange Road novels which are reportedly not as good as the original manga. It follows the events of the first movie.Here are the bad parts of the movie. The drama of movie 2, which is 22-year-old Kyousuke and 19-year-old Kyousuke getting trapped in a time loop, is not really anything to write home about.The original anime TV series was inconsistent in its rules on time travel. In episodes 47 and 48, it finally decided that every time travel is accounted for and that there's nothing you can do to change the past. Apparently, KOR: Summer's Beginning follows the rules of episodes 47 and 48. Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination. If we insist that moving to maturity is one of Kimagure Orange Road's themes, both movies satisfy this. Movie 1 is about confronting and breaking from the toxic love triangle of the original anime. Movie 2 completes the cycle with the reconciliation of the three and their renewed friendships standing on a firmer and more realistic foundation.The story of movie 2 can be any random time travel episode from the anime but given cinematic weight. It's better than the TV series but falls short of the emotionality of movie 1. anime ending.

""', ""'Shin Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Beginning' is the second Kimagure Orange Road movie, which was shown in the mid90s. It's 90s æsthetic rather than 80s. It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter. That's why the manga ending is said to be different to the...anime ending. Also, Matsumoto did not approve of the writing of the first movie.This second movie, on the other hand, is not written by Matsumoto. Its source material is the Shin Kimagure Orange Road novels which are reportedly not as good as the original manga. It follows the events of the first movie.Here are the bad parts of the movie. The drama of movie 2, which is 22-year-old Kyousuke and 19-year-old Kyousuke getting trapped in a time loop, is not really anything to write home about.The original anime TV series was inconsistent in its rules on time travel. In episodes 47 and 48, it finally decided that every time travel is accounted for and that there's nothing you can do to change the past. Apparently, KOR: Summer's Beginning follows the rules of episodes 47 and 48. Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination. If we insist that moving to maturity is one of Kimagure Orange Road's themes, both movies satisfy this. Movie 1 is about confronting and breaking from the toxic love triangle of the original anime. Movie 2 completes the cycle with the reconciliation of the three and their renewed friendships standing on a firmer and more realistic foundation.The story of movie 2 can be any random time travel episode from the anime but given cinematic weight.

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR.

I thought he seemed out of character, though; he was hitting on Madoka as if he never came to his big realization.The plot feels kinda aimless once Kyosuke gets sent to the future. He's confused, he doesn't know what to do or where to go... All he can do is give us a tour of the future to show us the after story. Once the solution is presented... Well, he didn't have to work for it at all.

It would be sort of unusual for a person to still be growing at that age...Yusaku is still missing in action. I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie.

Despite that, I still found it interesting, though. to learn who the hell the guy is. I thought he seemed out of character, though; he was hitting on Madoka as if he never came to his big realization.The plot feels kinda aimless once Kyosuke gets sent to the future. He's confused, he doesn't know what to do or where to go... All he can do is give us a tour of the future to show us the after story. Once the solution is presented... Well, he didn't have to work for it at all. It gets you feeling like there won't even be a climax, but then there's sort of one shortly after.The details in the art and animation made it look more like a movie than the first movie. It was still pretty average, not like it was so incredibly smooth that it stands out. I guess you could say it was about as good as any other anime movie based on a series. Y'know, stuff like Spirited Away is on another level.The characters have smaller eyes than before and generally look older and a little more modern. One point I found odd was the size difference between Kyosuke age 19 and 22. It was like comparing a teen to an adult... but they were both adults.

""', ""'Shin Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Beginning' is the second Kimagure Orange Road movie, which was shown in the mid90s. It's 90s æsthetic rather than 80s. It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter. That's why the manga ending is said to be different to the...anime ending. Also, Matsumoto did not approve of the writing of the first movie.This second movie, on the other hand, is not written by Matsumoto. Its source material is the Shin Kimagure Orange Road novels which are reportedly not as good as the original manga. It follows the events of the first movie.Here are the bad parts of the movie. The drama of movie 2, which is 22-year-old Kyousuke and 19-year-old Kyousuke getting trapped in a time loop, is not really anything to write home about.The original anime TV series was inconsistent in its rules on time travel. In episodes 47 and 48, it finally decided that every time travel is accounted for and that there's nothing you can do to change the past. Apparently, KOR: Summer's Beginning follows the rules of episodes 47 and 48. Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination. If we insist that moving to maturity is one of Kimagure Orange Road's themes, both movies satisfy this. Movie 1 is about confronting and breaking from the toxic love triangle of the original anime. Movie 2 completes the cycle with the reconciliation of the three and their renewed friendships standing on a firmer and more realistic foundation.The story of movie 2 can be any random time travel episode from the anime but given cinematic weight.

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR.

Unfortunately, there's no Ushiko-Umao reference in this one. The story's pretty interesting since it's got time travel and inevitable time paradoxes, though. We get a little info on the lives of the main characters after the events of the first movie, then we also learn about how things are for them three years later. I think this stuff would be particularly appreciated by fans of the series since it gives you that sense of closure.One character from the OVAs appears in the movie, so you may want to watch the OVAs first...to learn who the hell the guy is.

The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR. Maybe I\'ll continue with the manga. KOR really made me enjoy my memories so much.', ""This movie ties up the loose ends left by the previous one. Unfortunately, there's no Ushiko-Umao reference in this one. The story's pretty interesting since it's got time travel and inevitable time paradoxes, though. We get a little info on the lives of the main characters after the events of the first movie, then we also learn about how things are for them three years later. I think this stuff would be particularly appreciated by fans of the series since it gives you that sense of closure.One character from the OVAs appears in the movie, so you may want to watch the OVAs first...to learn who the hell the guy is. I thought he seemed out of character, though; he was hitting on Madoka as if he never came to his big realization.The plot feels kinda aimless once Kyosuke gets sent to the future. He's confused, he doesn't know what to do or where to go... All he can do is give us a tour of the future to show us the after story. Once the solution is presented... Well, he didn't have to work for it at all. It gets you feeling like there won't even be a climax, but then there's sort of one shortly after.The details in the art and animation made it look more like a movie than the first movie. It was still pretty average, not like it was so incredibly smooth that it stands out. I guess you could say it was about as good as any other anime movie based on a series. Y'know, stuff like Spirited Away is on another level.The characters have smaller eyes than before and generally look older and a little more modern. One point I found odd was the size difference between Kyosuke age 19 and 22. It was like comparing a teen to an adult... but they were both adults. It would be sort of unusual for a person to still be growing at that age...Yusaku is still missing in action. I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie. It wasn't very exciting or whatever and it didn't really have me guessing what would happen next since they introduced the solution to the problem pretty early in the movie.

""', ""'Shin Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Beginning' is the second Kimagure Orange Road movie, which was shown in the mid90s. It's 90s æsthetic rather than 80s. It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter. That's why the manga ending is said to be different to the...anime ending. Also, Matsumoto did not approve of the writing of the first movie.This second movie, on the other hand, is not written by Matsumoto. Its source material is the Shin Kimagure Orange Road novels which are reportedly not as good as the original manga. It follows the events of the first movie.Here are the bad parts of the movie. The drama of movie 2, which is 22-year-old Kyousuke and 19-year-old Kyousuke getting trapped in a time loop, is not really anything to write home about.The original anime TV series was inconsistent in its rules on time travel. In episodes 47 and 48, it finally decided that every time travel is accounted for and that there's nothing you can do to change the past. Apparently, KOR: Summer's Beginning follows the rules of episodes 47 and 48. Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination. If we insist that moving to maturity is one of Kimagure Orange Road's themes, both movies satisfy this. Movie 1 is about confronting and breaking from the toxic love triangle of the original anime. Movie 2 completes the cycle with the reconciliation of the three and their renewed friendships standing on a firmer and more realistic foundation.The story of movie 2 can be any random time travel episode from the anime but given cinematic weight.

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series.

It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR. Maybe I\'ll continue with the manga. KOR really made me enjoy my memories so much. appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol.

Unfortunately, there's no Ushiko-Umao reference in this one. The story's pretty interesting since it's got time travel and inevitable time paradoxes, though. We get a little info on the lives of the main characters after the events of the first movie, then we also learn about how things are for them three years later. I think this stuff would be particularly appreciated by fans of the series since it gives you that sense of closure.One character from the OVAs appears in the movie, so you may want to watch the OVAs first...to learn who the hell the guy is. I thought he seemed out of character, though; he was hitting on Madoka as if he never came to his big realization.The plot feels kinda aimless once Kyosuke gets sent to the future. He's confused, he doesn't know what to do or where to go... All he can do is give us a tour of the future to show us the after story. Once the solution is presented... Well, he didn't have to work for it at all. It gets you feeling like there won't even be a climax, but then there's sort of one shortly after.The details in the art and animation made it look more like a movie than the first movie. It was still pretty average, not like it was so incredibly smooth that it stands out. I guess you could say it was about as good as any other anime movie based on a series. Y'know, stuff like Spirited Away is on another level.The characters have smaller eyes than before and generally look older and a little more modern. One point I found odd was the size difference between Kyosuke age 19 and 22. It was like comparing a teen to an adult... but they were both adults. It would be sort of unusual for a person to still be growing at that age...Yusaku is still missing in action. I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie.

It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter. That's why the manga ending is said to be different to the...anime ending. Also, Matsumoto did not approve of the writing of the first movie.This second movie, on the other hand, is not written by Matsumoto. Its source material is the Shin Kimagure Orange Road novels which are reportedly not as good as the original manga. It follows the events of the first movie.Here are the bad parts of the movie. The drama of movie 2, which is 22-year-old Kyousuke and 19-year-old Kyousuke getting trapped in a time loop, is not really anything to write home about.The original anime TV series was inconsistent in its rules on time travel. In episodes 47 and 48, it finally decided that every time travel is accounted for and that there's nothing you can do to change the past. Apparently, KOR: Summer's Beginning follows the rules of episodes 47 and 48. Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination. If we insist that moving to maturity is one of Kimagure Orange Road's themes, both movies satisfy this. Movie 1 is about confronting and breaking from the toxic love triangle of the original anime. Movie 2 completes the cycle with the reconciliation of the three and their renewed friendships standing on a firmer and more realistic foundation.The story of movie 2 can be any random time travel episode from the anime but given cinematic weight.

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol.

Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination. If we insist that moving to maturity is one of Kimagure Orange Road's themes, both movies satisfy this. Movie 1 is about confronting and breaking from the toxic love triangle of the original anime. Movie 2 completes the cycle with the reconciliation of the three and their renewed friendships standing on a firmer and more realistic foundation.The story of movie 2 can be any random time travel episode from the anime but given cinematic weight. It's better than the TV series but falls short of the emotionality of movie 1."", 'I re-watched Shin Kimagure Orange Road just a while ago. This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR. Maybe I\'ll continue with the manga.

Unfortunately, there's no Ushiko-Umao reference in this one. The story's pretty interesting since it's got time travel and inevitable time paradoxes, though. We get a little info on the lives of the main characters after the events of the first movie, then we also learn about how things are for them three years later. I think this stuff would be particularly appreciated by fans of the series since it gives you that sense of closure.One character from the OVAs appears in the movie, so you may want to watch the OVAs first...to learn who the hell the guy is. I thought he seemed out of character, though; he was hitting on Madoka as if he never came to his big realization.The plot feels kinda aimless once Kyosuke gets sent to the future. He's confused, he doesn't know what to do or where to go... All he can do is give us a tour of the future to show us the after story. Once the solution is presented... Well, he didn't have to work for it at all. It gets you feeling like there won't even be a climax, but then there's sort of one shortly after.The details in the art and animation made it look more like a movie than the first movie.

One point I found odd was the size difference between Kyosuke age 19 and 22. It was like comparing a teen to an adult... but they were both adults. It would be sort of unusual for a person to still be growing at that age...Yusaku is still missing in action. I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie.

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR.

We get a little info on the lives of the main characters after the events of the first movie, then we also learn about how things are for them three years later. I think this stuff would be particularly appreciated by fans of the series since it gives you that sense of closure.One character from the OVAs appears in the movie, so you may want to watch the OVAs first...to learn who the hell the guy is.

It would be sort of unusual for a person to still be growing at that age...Yusaku is still missing in action. I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie.

It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter.

""', ""'Shin Kimagure Orange Road: Summer's Beginning' is the second Kimagure Orange Road movie, which was shown in the mid90s. It's 90s æsthetic rather than 80s. It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter. That's why the manga ending is said to be different to the...anime ending. Also, Matsumoto did not approve of the writing of the first movie.This second movie, on the other hand, is not written by Matsumoto. Its source material is the Shin Kimagure Orange Road novels which are reportedly not as good as the original manga. It follows the events of the first movie.Here are the bad parts of the movie. The drama of movie 2, which is 22-year-old Kyousuke and 19-year-old Kyousuke getting trapped in a time loop, is not really anything to write home about.The original anime TV series was inconsistent in its rules on time travel. In episodes 47 and 48, it finally decided that every time travel is accounted for and that there's nothing you can do to change the past. Apparently, KOR: Summer's Beginning follows the rules of episodes 47 and 48. Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination. If we insist that moving to maturity is one of Kimagure Orange Road's themes, both movies satisfy this. Movie 1 is about confronting and breaking from the toxic love triangle of the original anime. Movie 2 completes the cycle with the reconciliation of the three and their renewed friendships standing on a firmer and more realistic foundation.The story of movie 2 can be any random time travel episode from the anime but given cinematic weight. It's better than the TV series but falls short of the emotionality of movie 1. anime ending.

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR.

Unfortunately, there's no Ushiko-Umao reference in this one. The story's pretty interesting since it's got time travel and inevitable time paradoxes, though. We get a little info on the lives of the main characters after the events of the first movie, then we also learn about how things are for them three years later. I think this stuff would be particularly appreciated by fans of the series since it gives you that sense of closure.One character from the OVAs appears in the movie, so you may want to watch the OVAs first...to learn who the hell the guy is. I thought he seemed out of character, though; he was hitting on Madoka as if he never came to his big realization.The plot feels kinda aimless once Kyosuke gets sent to the future. He's confused, he doesn't know what to do or where to go... All he can do is give us a tour of the future to show us the after story. Once the solution is presented... Well, he didn't have to work for it at all. It gets you feeling like there won't even be a climax, but then there's sort of one shortly after.The details in the art and animation made it look more like a movie than the first movie. It was still pretty average, not like it was so incredibly smooth that it stands out. I guess you could say it was about as good as any other anime movie based on a series.

It would be sort of unusual for a person to still be growing at that age...Yusaku is still missing in action. I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie. It wasn't very exciting or whatever and it didn't really have me guessing what would happen next since they introduced the solution to the problem pretty early in the movie.

It would be sort of unusual for a person to still be growing at that age...Yusaku is still missing in action. I don't remember what happened to him in the series at all... like he just faded away at some point. Would Hikaru accept him if he managed to directly tell her how he feels? This feels like one loose end that could possibly end that love triangle once and for all.Anyhow, it was a pretty decent movie. It wasn't very exciting or whatever and it didn't really have me guessing what would happen next since they introduced the solution to the problem pretty early in the movie. Despite that, I still found it interesting, though. to learn who the hell the guy is. I thought he seemed out of character, though; he was hitting on Madoka as if he never came to his big realization.The plot feels kinda aimless once Kyosuke gets sent to the future. He's confused, he doesn't know what to do or where to go... All he can do is give us a tour of the future to show us the after story. Once the solution is presented... Well, he didn't have to work for it at all. It gets you feeling like there won't even be a climax, but then there's sort of one shortly after.The details in the art and animation made it look more like a movie than the first movie. It was still pretty average, not like it was so incredibly smooth that it stands out. I guess you could say it was about as good as any other anime movie based on a series.

It shows the characters when they were older, so there's changes in the character design. There were flashbacks as well as pictures that were similar to the original anime we love but with some small differences. It requires getting used to but it's not that bad.Note also that Izumi Matsumoto's vision of Kimagure Orange Range [the mangaka of KOR] differs from that of the director and the screenwriter. That's why the manga ending is said to be different to the...anime ending. Also, Matsumoto did not approve of the writing of the first movie.This second movie, on the other hand, is not written by Matsumoto. Its source material is the Shin Kimagure Orange Road novels which are reportedly not as good as the original manga. It follows the events of the first movie.Here are the bad parts of the movie. The drama of movie 2, which is 22-year-old Kyousuke and 19-year-old Kyousuke getting trapped in a time loop, is not really anything to write home about.The original anime TV series was inconsistent in its rules on time travel. In episodes 47 and 48, it finally decided that every time travel is accounted for and that there's nothing you can do to change the past. Apparently, KOR: Summer's Beginning follows the rules of episodes 47 and 48. Hence, there was no actual tension.The future Madoka might have been emotional over what's happening to Kyousuke, but as viewers, we know that it will end well.(Minor plothole: How is it possible that 22-year-old Kyousuke wasn't able to avoid being trapped in the first place given the fact that he also travelled into the future?)That said, even though fans of the manga did not like movies 1 and 2, I like it. And even some fans of movie 1 aren't exactly keen on movie 2. But as far as I'm concerned, it's not really bad despite reading many naysayers.The heartbreak of the first movie was necessary, but it was not well received in Japan, which is why some say movie 2 was produced. It provided space for the reconciliation of the three characters while at the same time taking Kyousuke and Madoka's relationship to the next level. And future Hikaru is gorgeous. I think this is a satisfying conclusion to the franchise.Movies 1 and 2 aren't actually necessary if you think about it. The TV series ended at the right moment when Kyousuke and Madoka kissed offscreen, and coming out as a couple and Kyousuke breaking Hikaru's heart could've been left to our imagination.

This is my second time watching it.Have to admit that the experience wasn\'t as good as the first time. Shin KOR gives you a semi-old feel, so as a person exposed to post-AD2000 animations, it doesn\'t really give you a full retro feel or a new feel. Once you get used to HD quality anime, you\'ll need to take some time to get accustomed to Shin KOR artwork. Nevertheless, I kinda liked the artwork. It has lost a bit of the original appeal, but the change in artwork makes it easier for later generations to...appreciate Orange Road.Before I start, just a warning that I may reveal some spoilers subtlely, but I try not to (as for all my other reviews soon to come).My ratings (y\'know like 9 for story, 7 for art, etc) are kinda biased for Shin KOR because I simply love KOR too much lol. But pretty much this was the kind of rating I\'d give when I watched it 5 years ago, or perhaps better. I\'d highly recommend this to everyone who watched and liked Kimagure Orange Road (TV/OVA) because it is sort of an ending to the story. One reason I liked Shin KOR was because I could relate with the characters and I know what happened in the TV/OVA/MOVIE.The story was pretty well-made. It followed the KOR series chronologically and it put a stop to the story itself. The feel and direction was very different from the original though. The kind of experience you\'d get is different from KOR, and the climaxing points are emphasised on different areas.Shin KOR is slightly aimed at a more mature audience I rkn, with many suggestive sexual content. Pretty mild but enough to feel that, hey the characters are already adults. I didn\'t quite like the mature direction it was heading to, but it was still alright. I loved the idea about time travel though, and how it was pieced together. It kinda came to me that ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (Toki o kakera Shoujo?sp)"" was inspired by orange road. The romance was awesome and refreshing, which is what I love about KOR.The artwork is similar to 1990+ animations. Colours used give you a warm feeling, and brings out the landscape really well.The OST is really nice. I was shocked that it\'s by Yuki Kajiura because it\'s not her usual kind of \'opera-sensation\' music. I think this was one of her earliest works in Anime. The music brought life to the movie. In fact my favourite part of the movie was the piano pieces played in the movie.Character development wasn\'t very much present, because the foundations were still based on the TV series. But really, the characters have grown much in this movie. It was really fun to see how they become like. The change was rather great (inclusive of the character design). Quite a lot of dialogue between characters, but the feelings of the characters were well portrayed. It touched me.Overall it\'s an enjoyable movie for me on Christmas Day. I\'m starting to miss KOR. Maybe I\'ll continue with the manga.

Deca-Dence,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40056/Deca-Dence,"['""The world must be rid of bugs."" Sorry, let me rephrase that: ""The world NEEDS bugs."" With all that: Login/Logout of the Deca-Dence. ""It is for me to decide which WORLD to live in!""Never have I been THIS pumped-up and excited for original anime, because unique shows are a dime a dozen of few hits and many misses. But in the case of Deca-Dence, I can confidently say that it was a constant harbinger of expectations running wild and subverting them all at the same time of questioning me: ""What comes next? What should I (not) anticipate?"" And I was blown away each and every...time with what Deca-Dence has offered in its more-than-enough perfect 12-episode storyline about a decayed world that is then occupied by cyborg-like avatars from an in-game perspective.First off, I have to just commend the all-star production team of Deca-Dence, which comprises of talented director Yuzuru Tachikawa, scriptwriter Hiroshi Seko, character designer Shinichi Kurita, and many of the staff behind this colossal project. Fans of Tachikawa and (especially) Kurita will be delighted to hear that their works on Death Billiards, Death Parade have made them a household name, while Tachikawa and Seko have been in even bigger shows like Attack on Titan and Mob Psycho 100. (Kabaneri in Seko\'s perspective is shitty, NGL) Needless to say that these 3 are the big names in this show, and what a way to celebrate the living and breathing of anime by collaborating altogether to make something that is a trope, yet still make something special and different that I definitely won\'t be forgetting anytime soon.Secondly, let\'s tackle the elephant in the room: Hiroshi Seko\'s scriptwriting as a whole (including that PARTICULAR plot twist that thankfully doesn\'t betray the entire source and inspiration of the show). The meaning of Decadence (one word) is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as: ""The moral or cultural decline as characterized by excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury."" And back to Deca-Dence (the same one word, split into two parts), shows a world that is once habited by humans, but excessive decay have rendered them out of extinction by the manufactured creatures known as Gadolls, and cyborgs have taken over as humanity\'s last bastion of life. See, the feeling of Deca-Dence is like playing RPGs: you have your own avatar to resemble your traits, and the in-game humans are just NPCs that serve their roles to fight against evil (the Gadolls) and die mercilessly at the behest of the corporation in control. And that company is the Solid Quake Corporation, which houses these cyborg denizens in the Deca-Dence and controls them like any administrator or Game Master would to have a stabilized, all-governing system. Before I get too far ahead though, let\'s bring in the central characters.Natsume is a cheerful, bubbly young girl whose father (and his colleagues) have been all but decimated by a Gadoll attack, leaving her behind with a lost right arm and the dream to be a ""Gear"" when she grows up. See, the class system in Deca-Dence is split into two: Gears, the strongest of humans that are able to fend themselves from Gadoll attacks and eliminate these respawning creatures, and Tankers, which are primarily support characters in the background that serve to keep Deca-Dence afloat with the Gadoll\'s ""blood"" called Oxyone, which coincidentally is the lifeblood of the mobile fortress to unleash big-scale attacks. Growing up with a prosthetic right arm and joining as a Tanker is too boring for her, but meeting up with a burly guy named Kaburagi, he is more than meets the eye.Kaburagi was once a veteran for the Deca-Dence (when it was free roaming), and he was considered the highest class of Rankers for doing the same role that the Gears are doing now. But due to a mishap of his former teammates rebelling against the system, he was questioned by Hugin, the overall commander for Deca-Dence and subsequently demoted to eliminating the rebels a.k.a ""Bugs""  secretly in the background a.k.a doing the dirty work for them. The thing is, anyone who is registered as an avatar is tracked in the Solid Quake system, but Natsume is a special case: she is a ""bug"", and in the special case of hide-and-seek, Kaburagi as one of the previous ""administrators"" decides to keep her under wraps away from the system tapping her presence, and in the way, nurture her growth from a Tanker to a Gear.With the other characters in toll, the hide-and-seek game officially starts with Kaburagi making pivotal decisions every step of the way to keep her away from Hugin, and have her participate in the missions for Gears to keep the Deca-Dence safe. From that moment on till the eventual reveal of the overall setting (which baffles Natsume with destroying her expectations when she comes to find out the REAL truth), with Hugin chasing Kaburagi down after seeing the fire in Natsume\'s eyes to depict the world as how she sees it, he begins a change that would define his character back to his original Ranker status as a fighter who would fight for the better of mankind, for Deca-Dence. Even with the ""bugs"" of Solid Quake which are a constant nuisance, they also do serve a part to play in part to rebel against the status quo and fight for what they believe is right. And what a profound statement all this is.Studio NUT, coming after ""Saga of Tanya the Evil"", and subsequently coming off from former Madhouse members, with Deca-Dence, they\'re a studio that I can firmly accept that they\'re not to be rifled with. Even with the less-than-impressive CGI that thankfully isn\'t a chore to watch, it has been consistent throughout this series, and it\'s a blast to see the art and animation get its flexing of the vibrant world and with it, the lore of science fiction.Even better is the sound department, under yet another talent that is Fumiyuki Goh. Having worked with big names like Overlord, it\'s of no surprise that his talent have worked wonders for this show, adding onto the atmospheric worldbuilding with every inch of consideration. Great pairing of the OST with Konomi Suzuki\'s OP (to which her songs are getting better repertoires) and Kashitarou Itou\'s ED. Never have asked for great songs in yet another paltry season, but I\'m glad that it exists.Overall, this was a buffet of a treat from start to finish, and while I don\'t ever think that this will get a Season 2, pretty much what is said can be translated into this phenomenal show that I still can\'t stop trembling in fear and excitement over the past 3 months. Am quite sad that after the plot twist of Episode 2, haters just kinda shrugged it off and leaving this to dust, because greatness awaits in every step of the way.One of the few original anime that I can wholeheartedly recommend, but it\'d be best to binge all the way through. Quite satisfied at what we got, and there won\'t be anime like this to grace the small screens in a very long time that sparks creativity and lavishness. time with what Deca-Dence has offered in its more-than-enough perfect 12-episode storyline about a decayed world that is then occupied by cyborg-like avatars from an in-game perspective.First off, I have to just commend the all-star production team of Deca-Dence, which comprises of talented director Yuzuru Tachikawa, scriptwriter Hiroshi Seko, character designer Shinichi Kurita, and many of the staff behind this colossal project. Fans of Tachikawa and (especially) Kurita will be delighted to hear that their works on Death Billiards, Death Parade have made them a household name, while Tachikawa and Seko have been in even bigger shows like Attack on Titan and Mob Psycho 100. (Kabaneri in Seko\'s perspective is shitty, NGL) Needless to say that these 3 are the big names in this show, and what a way to celebrate the living and breathing of anime by collaborating altogether to make something that is a trope, yet still make something special and different that I definitely won\'t be forgetting anytime soon.Secondly, let\'s tackle the elephant in the room: Hiroshi Seko\'s scriptwriting as a whole (including that PARTICULAR plot twist that thankfully doesn\'t betray the entire source and inspiration of the show). The meaning of Decadence (one word) is defined in the Oxford Dictionary as: ""The moral or cultural decline as characterized by excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury."" And back to Deca-Dence (the same one word, split into two parts), shows a world that is once habited by humans, but excessive decay have rendered them out of extinction by the manufactured creatures known as Gadolls, and cyborgs have taken over as humanity\'s last bastion of life. See, the feeling of Deca-Dence is like playing RPGs: you have your own avatar to resemble your traits, and the in-game humans are just NPCs that serve their roles to fight against evil (the Gadolls) and die mercilessly at the behest of the corporation in control. And that company is the Solid Quake Corporation, which houses these cyborg denizens in the Deca-Dence and controls them like any administrator or Game Master would to have a stabilized, all-governing system. Before I get too far ahead though, let\'s bring in the central characters.Natsume is a cheerful, bubbly young girl whose father (and his colleagues) have been all but decimated by a Gadoll attack, leaving her behind with a lost right arm and the dream to be a ""Gear"" when she grows up. See, the class system in Deca-Dence is split into two: Gears, the strongest of humans that are able to fend themselves from Gadoll attacks and eliminate these respawning creatures, and Tankers, which are primarily support characters in the background that serve to keep Deca-Dence afloat with the Gadoll\'s ""blood"" called Oxyone, which coincidentally is the lifeblood of the mobile fortress to unleash big-scale attacks. Growing up with a prosthetic right arm and joining as a Tanker is too boring for her, but meeting up with a burly guy named Kaburagi, he is more than meets the eye.Kaburagi was once a veteran for the Deca-Dence (when it was free roaming), and he was considered the highest class of Rankers for doing the same role that the Gears are doing now. But due to a mishap of his former teammates rebelling against the system, he was questioned by Hugin, the overall commander for Deca-Dence and subsequently demoted to eliminating the rebels a.k.a ""Bugs""  secretly in the background a.k.a doing the dirty work for them. The thing is, anyone who is registered as an avatar is tracked in the Solid Quake system, but Natsume is a special case: she is a ""bug"", and in the special case of hide-and-seek, Kaburagi as one of the previous ""administrators"" decides to keep her under wraps away from the system tapping her presence, and in the way, nurture her growth from a Tanker to a Gear.With the other characters in toll, the hide-and-seek game officially starts with Kaburagi making pivotal decisions every step of the way to keep her away from Hugin, and have her participate in the missions for Gears to keep the Deca-Dence safe.

Quite satisfied at what we got, and there won\'t be anime like this to grace the small screens in a very long time that sparks creativity and lavishness.', ""Alright this is my favourite anime of all time, obviously a big statement to start a review with. I obviously don't expect anyone else to think so highly of the series, but I genuinely do think it is a masterpiece. I also don't like breaking anime down by how MAL does reviews numerically, but eh I'll give it a go.Story: 10This is a fast-paced anime, it's a 12 episode original. Keep that in mind, personally I think the pacing is well done. Every episode has its own direction in terms of what it wants to do if that makes sense, but it's still under one...story. The story itself looks simple during the first episode, but all I'll say is that there's A LOT more to it. Many philosophical concepts explored in the story, which I won't get into but if you go into the story with a philosophical lens you'll find a surprisingly high amount of stuff for 12 episodes. There are some central themes that are well-focused and explored throughout the run of the anime, and we get good conclusions to them when needed and others are left more open-ended when that is appropriate.Art: 8I'm not gonna act like it's some Ufotable or Bones stuff because it's not, but the art is still well-done. There are basically two main distinct art styles in Deca-Dence, and it throws some people off, think of Mob Psycho 100 or Masaaki Yuasa works. But the animation itself is pretty damn well done, has really great aerial combat(this is from the same studio who made Tanya the Evil for context), and transitions between the two styles damn well. The directing is also fantastic; episode 5, 8, and 10 stand out a ton in this regard.Sound: 10I don't like talking about something as obviously subjective as music/sound in an analytical sense, but I'll say that the soundtrack was awesome and used very well, with many memorable tracks(especially the ED wowie). Voice acting was on point, and sound effects were well done. I don't have any flaws with it, fantastic job. Also Koyasu Takehito has a big role doing what he does best, sounding evil. Can't go wrong with that.Character: 10Our two main characters of Natsume and Kaburagi are FANTASTIC, and definitely carry in this department. They have a wonderful relationship that I can best describe as a shared inspiration. Both of our characters develop tons both due to each other and their general environment, and it feels very genuine. Natsume in particular has some moments that absolutely blew me away. The rest of our cast are obviously not as explored since this is a short anime, but some such as Minato and Fei bring interesting perspectives and make for some great dialogue. Our antagonistic force is also very well done with reason to their actions, and we come to a quite fitting resolution.Enjoyment: 11I seriously still can't believe how much this anime appealed to me. Obviously the enjoyment rating can vary person by person, as can honestly any of the other ratings. I've literally cried just from thinking of how much I love this anime, on more occasions than I can count. Episode 5, 7, and 10 are literally my three favourite anime episodes of all time. The anime also made me laugh a bunch of times, it's certainly good at being goofy when it wants to be. So yeah, I enjoyed it a ton. If you're super stuck up about me rating enjoyment as a 11, then just think of it as a 10 doesn't make a difference for me. Fantastic anime regardless :) story.

An original sci-fi adventure. I honestly can’t remember the last original sci-fi anime that gave me a lasting impression. But luckily in the Summer Season of 2020, we have this show called Deca-Dence, an original science fiction animated by studio NUT. But did it leave a solid impression?Judging by the synopsis alone tells me exactly what to expect initially. We have the post-apocalyptic setting with humanity on the brink of distinction. Humanity fights to survive in this dark age and we follow the journey of two characters – Natsume and Kaburagi, with very distinctive backgrounds. Coming into this...show, I had one main goal in mind and that’s to embrace the creative story in a sci-fi world.Let’s get business out of the way first. Prior to even watching the first few episodes, I realized that director Yuzuru Tachikawa is involved with this project. He’s worked on previous titles such as Death Parade, Mob Psycho 100, and even parts of Steins;Gate. Those are among some of my favorite titles in recent years so I had my expectations set high. But looking back at that roster, Deca-Dence stands out very differently. Among the first things I came to notice in this show is the theme of survival. We have to realize the timeline takes place since hundreds of years ago and in reality, humanity itself is in danger of extinction. This is caused by the presence of the mysterious lifeform known as Gadolls. The first few episodes shows us the life style of two types of people, the Gears and the Tankers. Natsume has a dream of becoming a Gear fighter but to her disappointment, she ends up becoming a maintenance worker. Serving under the wings of Kaburagi, she soon realizes what he’s really capable of and in a twist of fate, he offers to train her as a warrior. Talk about a change at luck, right?Well, it turns out, that's not the only element of surprise. This isn’t your typical survival sci-fiction adventure as we quickly find out about the existence of a mega corporation known as Solid Quake. The second episode also reveals the plot twist for the purpose of Gears, simulated characters built to fight the Gadolls in the way of video games. Don’t make a mistake though. This isn’t some isekai show where the protagonists are thrown into some virtual reality world. Humanity is truly in danger. However, the plot twist will caught most viewers off guard as it shifts from the typical science fiction tropes you see so often. It may sound outlandishly risky and indeed, Deca-Dence’s antagonists is actually an evil organization. After the second episode, Deca-Dence almost feels like a different show.That’s the beauty of original anime. You’ll never see it coming. From episode two and beyond, we are shown more details about the inner workings of Solid Snake and why characters behave the way they do, especially Kaburagi. One of the elements of the show also involves capitalism at its extreme nature. Natsume and Kaburagi aren’t just living in a world dominated by mysterious lifeforms but they are controlled by capitalism. The war they’re fighting isn’t just about survival anymore because in reality, there’s no limit at how many Gadolls can exist. It’s like a live service video game with admins adding whatever amount of content as they please. Picturing it in your head right now and you’ll realize how hopeless this will be for humanity.Still, humanity does have hope thanks to the efforts of Natsume and Kaburagi. One of the key selling points of the show is their character chemistry. At first, they just seemed like a pair that were forced to work together but overtime, the two bonded and become more than just fellow comrades. Natsume in particular shows she is adamant to achieve her dream. Kaburagi realizes her potential and trains her to be a Gear fighter, even in some of the most ridiculous ways possible. What’s more important than ever is they represent the hope for humanity. When everything seems hopeless, they fight for the greater good. This applies more to Kaburagi’s case including one episode where he becomes a prisoner. Watching Kaburagi’s actions in such an episode shows that he is more than a fighter. He’s a believer in that one day, humanity will be in a world where capitalism isn’t a dominant force and humans will no longer have to live in fear.Studio NUT hasn’t been in the animation business industry for long. Their most noticeable work was Youjo Senki back in 2017. Deca-Dence artwork style didn’t seem appealing at first based on the trailers and promotional material. It had a decent production quality but nothing in particular stand out at first. With the fictional fortress made of 3D art, it actually symbolizes as an icon in their world, a place of salvation. Character designs of the human cast is more intact with modern animation style while the cyborgs were drawn by hands. To make the art look more distinctive, we have the cartoony look for the simulated virtual characters. From the second episode and onwards, you’d be surprised to see how different the show looks when scenes shift between one settings to other. Finally, the Gadolls resemble monsters you’d can picture from sci-fi fictional stories – monsters with Godzilla-like intimidation and a whole lot of otherworldly characteristics.Deca-Dence took the sci-fi genre by storm. What started out as a generic opening of the first episode quickly turned itself around after the big revelation. Such a reveal gave Deca-Dence more of an identity, an IT factor that defines this show’s story and characters. This isn’t a typical sci-fi show that you may get used to and over time, you’ll come to appreciate what Deca-Dence really is.

Yet, Deca-Dence managed to arrive out of nowhere and give us 12 weeks of greatness. Unfortunately, it was always going to be difficult to compete with Re:Zero airing at the same time and on the same day, but for those of us who did get a chance to view the show, we saw something special.From the same studio that brought us Youjo Senki, Deca-Dence is unlike anything I've personally ever seen, and the closest I could compare it to plot-wise would be Guren...Lagann mixed with Mortal Engines, Shingeki no Kyojin and MMORPG elements. It's a world where humanity must overcome impossible odds to survive and is an enjoyable watch that blends unique characters with a rich and lively sci-fi world. As you'd expect from studio NUT, the animation, art and quality are all top notch. My only complaint in that department would be the CG at the end of the series, particularly the final fight, I found to be pretty bad. Other than that, actions sequences, OST's and character models are consistently good.Lastly, the show also manages to break the anime original curse by having a solid ending that is consistent with themes presented throughout. So often anime original shows will have a great start and fall off at the end. Not this time.Deca-Dence has definitely been one of the best shows of the year and it's a shame it was overshadowed due to its release time and date, but I can assure you it is worth a watch and will probably not disappoint you.

At first glance, Deca-Dence may seem just like the type of show that was described above, as in another generic Attack on Titan rip off action show with a forgettable main character with blind shonen character motivations. This review will cover why Deca-Dence is not another repetitive series, can stand on its own merits, and how it is genuinely an original and new take on survival action anime.Story: 8Many...people recognized that studio NUT, the studio behind Youjo Senki was involved in making Deca-Dence and rightfully expected top tier visuals, what they might have forgotten though was studio NUT’s penchant for episode 2 twists. Similarly, how to other shows they have made, Deca-Dence has a huge curveball twist 2 episodes in, it stops seeming like a generic survival in a post-apocalyptic world anime immediately and becomes much more interesting.The story takes place in a world where monsters known as Gadoll happen to have destroyed society and all the remaining humans are living in a large mobile fortress known as the Deca-Dence. The main characters consist of the idealistic Natsume and the hardened Kaburagi, both at first seem like coworkers and regular humans working on the Deca-Dence. However we later find out that Kaburagi is actually just an avatar for an AI that is playing a game, in fact the entire scenario in episode 1 is flipped on its head as we learn the world is no more than an amusement park for cyborgs and humans are an endangered species.As an anime original series, with this many plot points thrown in in the first few episodes, there was concern that the show would not be paced properly with the limited episodes. In hindsight the concerns were not necessary, the show was paced very quick but it did not feel rush, time on screen was never wasted, and overall the series came to a satisfactory ending.Art: 9The one comparison with Attack on Titan that I find fair is in regard to the art and animation of this series. Visuals in Deca-Dence are spectacular, from the amazing 3dCGI integration, to the excellent character and monster designs, and the overall perfectly choreographed fights. At first I was not expecting to much, even if its Studio NUT the pandemic has hit the production values of most shows, but rest assured, if there is one thing this series is not lacking, it is great visuals. The Alpha Gadoll fight specifically was one of the best fights that have been animated in 2020, the Alpha Gadoll was a monster that was hyped up but seemed like a letdown during its appearance do to its small size. When the fight started though, the visuals quickly demonstrated why the Alpha Gadoll was such a threat, its combat intelligence and speed made it very hard to deal with and it had heat vision and the ability to generate fog. Most of this was visually communicated perfectly, enough that we did not even need the dialogue, this sort of visual narration is lacking in many anime today and it is a treat to finally witness it after so long.Background art in this show was top tier, there were so many interesting landscapes, both in the regular world and in the world of the cyborgs. The amount of varied landscapes, the passive Gadoll in the backgrounds, the careful use of monster corpses and the Deca-Dence in all its glory on the horizon greatly helps with immersion into the story.Character designs for the cyborgs in this series are quite fresh, they do appear somewhat cartoonish however the clash and contrast in atmosphere between the saturated and gritty human side and the cartoonish game world cyborg side actually improved the series. The cyborg character designs helped communicate the general difference in danger and weight for the respective sides in the series, it also helped differentiate the huge difference in world view between the human characters and the cyborgs. There was also a nice touch added by the character designs in expressing character personality, with Kubaragi being the outlier, most characters acted exactly like their designs would expect the audience to view them as. The big guy was tough, the girl was smart and well spoken, and that evil looking guy was the traitor.The sound: 7The OP was pretty solid, although its not super memorable it isn’t bad either. The sound effects in general excellent, from the fights, to the robot and game effects, and everything in between. Background sound in Deca-Dence is quite immersive, and though the OST and OP are not exceptional enough to put in a playlist, they perform their role adequately in the show itself.Characters: 9Kaburagi and Natsume certainly RISE UP to the challenge of being this season’s top duo, and although they face stiff competition from other popular sequel series, I would say these 2 are definitely among the best this season. The absolute chemistry between Kaburagi and Natsume, the amount of times he shuts her down and the amount of times Natsume defies his expectations and shocks him has been great. Natsume eventually has to come to the realization that her world is manufactured, and this leads to a huge change in perspective that can normally ruin a show, however it was handled with tact and her perspective change felt natural. Natsume specifically realizing that her journey towards wiping out the Gadoll wasn’t a means to an end, but that she really just wanted to become stronger and more confident through her journey was a great revelation that was foreshadowed throughout the series. Kaburagi eventually betraying the system was also built up well, cameos of him working with Natsume over a long period of time, his prior friend who was deemed a bug like Natsume being scrapped and him living with the guilt, his keeping of a pet Gadoll despite the rules. Overall both characters have a lot of growth in this series, and it’s hard to claim the show has a primary protagonist, both characters are excellently developed and their motivations and changes in perspective were well written, enough that it never felt like their decisions were sudden impulsive out of character moments.The other members of the cast also integrate into the story pretty well. The popular school acquaintance eventually comes along to helping Natsume, her old friend although worried about her at first, eventually comes to terms with Natsume taking on dangerous work. The cyborgs themselves have a very lively cast, and they contrast heavily with the humans with their carefree attitude, the named cyborgs who were in prison with Kaburagi were definitely the best ones. Overall the characters in this show are some of the best this season, and despite only having 12 episodes, they are some of the most fleshed out characters across any anime.Overall this show gets an 8, for being both a pleasant surprise, and maintaining its quality throughout the show. Normally anime originals are unable to stick the ending, maintain a proper pace, or fall apart in production quality, however Deca Dence lives up to the standard set in episode one and keeps delivering. people recognized that studio NUT, the studio behind Youjo Senki was involved in making Deca-Dence and rightfully expected top tier visuals, what they might have forgotten though was studio NUT’s penchant for episode 2 twists. Similarly, how to other shows they have made, Deca-Dence has a huge curveball twist 2 episodes in, it stops seeming like a generic survival in a post-apocalyptic world anime immediately and becomes much more interesting.The story takes place in a world where monsters known as Gadoll happen to have destroyed society and all the remaining humans are living in a large mobile fortress known as the Deca-Dence. The main characters consist of the idealistic Natsume and the hardened Kaburagi, both at first seem like coworkers and regular humans working on the Deca-Dence. However we later find out that Kaburagi is actually just an avatar for an AI that is playing a game, in fact the entire scenario in episode 1 is flipped on its head as we learn the world is no more than an amusement park for cyborgs and humans are an endangered species.As an anime original series, with this many plot points thrown in in the first few episodes, there was concern that the show would not be paced properly with the limited episodes. In hindsight the concerns were not necessary, the show was paced very quick but it did not feel rush, time on screen was never wasted, and overall the series came to a satisfactory ending.Art: 9The one comparison with Attack on Titan that I find fair is in regard to the art and animation of this series. Visuals in Deca-Dence are spectacular, from the amazing 3dCGI integration, to the excellent character and monster designs, and the overall perfectly choreographed fights. At first I was not expecting to much, even if its Studio NUT the pandemic has hit the production values of most shows, but rest assured, if there is one thing this series is not lacking, it is great visuals. The Alpha Gadoll fight specifically was one of the best fights that have been animated in 2020, the Alpha Gadoll was a monster that was hyped up but seemed like a letdown during its appearance do to its small size. When the fight started though, the visuals quickly demonstrated why the Alpha Gadoll was such a threat, its combat intelligence and speed made it very hard to deal with and it had heat vision and the ability to generate fog. Most of this was visually communicated perfectly, enough that we did not even need the dialogue, this sort of visual narration is lacking in many anime today and it is a treat to finally witness it after so long.Background art in this show was top tier, there were so many interesting landscapes, both in the regular world and in the world of the cyborgs. The amount of varied landscapes, the passive Gadoll in the backgrounds, the careful use of monster corpses and the Deca-Dence in all its glory on the horizon greatly helps with immersion into the story.Character designs for the cyborgs in this series are quite fresh, they do appear somewhat cartoonish however the clash and contrast in atmosphere between the saturated and gritty human side and the cartoonish game world cyborg side actually improved the series. The cyborg character designs helped communicate the general difference in danger and weight for the respective sides in the series, it also helped differentiate the huge difference in world view between the human characters and the cyborgs. There was also a nice touch added by the character designs in expressing character personality, with Kubaragi being the outlier, most characters acted exactly like their designs would expect the audience to view them as. The big guy was tough, the girl was smart and well spoken, and that evil looking guy was the traitor.The sound: 7The OP was pretty solid, although its not super memorable it isn’t bad either. The sound effects in general excellent, from the fights, to the robot and game effects, and everything in between. Background sound in Deca-Dence is quite immersive, and though the OST and OP are not exceptional enough to put in a playlist, they perform their role adequately in the show itself.Characters: 9Kaburagi and Natsume certainly RISE UP to the challenge of being this season’s top duo, and although they face stiff competition from other popular sequel series, I would say these 2 are definitely among the best this season. The absolute chemistry between Kaburagi and Natsume, the amount of times he shuts her down and the amount of times Natsume defies his expectations and shocks him has been great. Natsume eventually has to come to the realization that her world is manufactured, and this leads to a huge change in perspective that can normally ruin a show, however it was handled with tact and her perspective change felt natural. Natsume specifically realizing that her journey towards wiping out the Gadoll wasn’t a means to an end, but that she really just wanted to become stronger and more confident through her journey was a great revelation that was foreshadowed throughout the series.

Even though the theme is of the post-apocalyptic world, it brings a fresh take on this genre.Really good music with a great storyline.I came here after glass reflection's recommendation and I'm glad I picked it up.The characters are all lovely and especially the BOSS.The show may start a little slow but just after the 2nd episode, it picks up pace.The most important part of the show is that it feels real.The animation is top-notch and the characters are also very funny....I would highly recommend this anime to everyone.(okay so now my views about this anime has changed completely)It did start great and I gave it a 10/10 after watching the first six episodes, but at the current moment, the show feels very boring to a point where I had to leave it.

It\'s probably going to be one of the most original shows to come out this season amidst a cloud of trashy unoriginal and sequel anime that has plagued the last few seasons that has honestly been boring the hell outta me. Prime examples being ""Maou Gakuin no Futekigousha: Shijou Saikyou no Maou no Shiso, Tensei shite Shison-tachi no Gakkou e"" that is also premiering this season, which despite its trashiness is doing a lot better in terms of community engagement which problems...me.Anyways back to the review.By far the most original aspect of this anime is its story, episode 1 is probably one of the best pilot episodes an anime can have, it immediately establishes the world and where our protagonist, Natsume, stands in the social ladder on Deca-Dance a massive moving fortress that is humanities last stand against the Gadolls, i.e. CGI monsters. However, by the time you watch episode 2 and 3  your expectations of the show are already shattered but in a good way. What first seemed like a simple enough post-apocalyptic world unravels into a more complex narrative that has the potential to explores many intriguing themes such as political order, sovereignty, mortality and ambition. Going any deeper into these themes would, unfortunately, lead to a bunch of spoilers, so I’d suggest you go watch it! However, the show has only just started so for now (Story) 8/10.The art style is clean and feels like every character belongs in the Deca-Dence universe, the show is very colourful and energetic, the right colour choice for a show that is trying to emulate the setting of a video game, which complements the plot of the show really well for reasons that go into spoilers. Just believe me on this one. The animation is well polished and to my surprise, despite the amount of CGI in this anime it actually doesn’t look terrible and blends in with the show well at times but I have to give them props for the ambition they have with the CGI elements. Art/Animation: 8/10The sound in this is crisp, the weapon sound effects are spot on and ambient sounds didn’t strike me as bad. When sound is done right you don’t notice it and it becomes apart of the animation and that seems to be the case here. 8/10Our two main characters, Natsume and Kaburagi, are well-developed characters with depth and are relatable in many ways. Natsume is a character with strong motivations as she tries to seek self-confidence in a world that only seeks to take that away from her. And Kaburagi is facing the reality of the choices that he made in the past and is constantly forced into a tough situation and needs to make tough choices, he feels that he is stuck in a system of power that leaves him with little freedom and that gives him a pessimistic world view and a sense of hopelessness at times. Overall, very interesting characters that you are really rooting for. Character: 10/10Overall, this show has high promise and I have high expectations for it. After all, this anime is coming from the Director of Mob Psycho II and we all know how well that went. So I’ll leave it at an Overall: 9/10. me.Anyways back to the review.By far the most original aspect of this anime is its story, episode 1 is probably one of the best pilot episodes an anime can have, it immediately establishes the world and where our protagonist, Natsume, stands in the social ladder on Deca-Dance a massive moving fortress that is humanities last stand against the Gadolls, i.e. CGI monsters.

You'll find stories in anime that you won't find anywhere else, concepts that have never been explored in Hollywood, and surprises that make most novels look formulaic. However, as I grow older I find myself becoming more of a grump about airing anime. Most seasons these days don't even have one show that I'll watch to completion, and if I do pick up something new it's almost always from the backlog. What's up with that? Anime's in a bit of a boom: standards...for visuals and audio are higher than ever, huge companies like Netflix are funding production of shows, and the anime audience has expanded further into the mainstream than ever before. This should be the golden years.And yet, the vast majority of modern shows are creatively bankrupt.That doesn't mean they're bad. Look, I liked Demon Slayer episode 19 as much as the next guy. But from a story perspective the highlights of modern anime are mostly been-done shonen moments except now they have better animation and OSTs. I get tired of that. If I want flashy visuals paired with cool music, I'll go watch an AMV. Give me a original, passion-driven story any day.Along comes Deca-Dence. An anime-original years in production, not created to sell source material or advertise a gatcha game. All you have to do is dip your toe into the first episode to see the level of thought and detail that went into this show. The world is vibrant, complex, and obviously deeper than the audience can see at first glance. The animation is fluid. The combat mechanics are innovative. It's everything that anime fans are always claiming they want to see, so why in the flying fuck is it currently sitting at a lower score than The Misfit of Demon King Academy on MAL? Do we, as anime fans, recognize the message this sends? Don't try new things, keep making power-fantasy isekai trash. That's where the money's at.Anyways, here's why you should watch this show, and not Re:Is it Wrong to Pick Up My Little Sister in A Demon Dungeon: Zoku.Deca-Dence starts out as a Gurren-Lagann esque story following a group of surviving humans in a post-apocalyptic world struggling to survive against a swarm of aliens that have taken over the planet. Even with that basic premise, the show differentiates itself from its ilk in a few key ways.First of all, the protagonist Natsume doesn't have any special powers. No magic drill. No mecha. No titan form. In fact, it's the opposite: she's handicapped, having lost her right arm when she was a child. She has to combat the harsh elements of the world in front of her using the same technology as everyone else, and anything she's going to contribute is going to have to come from her ability to manipulate that technology. This gives a lot more weight to her achievements, because they feel earned instead of handed to her on the platter of destiny.Second, there's the combat system itself. In the world of Deca-Dence, 'Tankers' and 'Gears' fight insectile aliens using gravity balls strapped on their backs that allow them to levitate when near their opponents. They then use harpoons to skewer the insects and drain their blood. Studio Nut has done a great job in the first six episodes for making these scenes look FANTASTIC, following characters through the air as they duck and weave in an anti-gravity situation. These fights also have an interesting element to them, because while the insects they hunt are a threat, they're also a resource, so combat is both a fight for survival and also a hunt to keep the fortress of Deca-Dence, where the humans live, functioning.Third, the show DOESN'T bombard you with action. It knows it doesn't need spinning angles and exploding aliens to keep your attention. Instead, it takes time to get to know the characters and their daily lives. A good portion of the first episode is dedicated to following Natsume around as she adjusts to her job of cleaning the ship. Sprawling shots of the vivid landscape set the tone for a story of mythical scale, while moments of reflection for both Natsume and the other protagonist, Kaburagi, do more to invest the viewer in the first few episodes than any minute of high-tension.So yeah, it sounds good, right? But wait, that's only just the beginning. Deca-Dence would be a perfectly solid passion-project as a straightforward post-apocalyptic survival story, but this is a review whining about creativity in anime. See, what makes Deca-Dence so fah-reaking awesome is that it has layers. There's the original premise, which is great and the show sticks to, but starting in episode two there's an additional perspective added to the story. This hardly even feels like a twist, because it arises so naturally from all the information given in the first episode, but it breaks open the scale of the story and introduces an additional dimension (and an entirely new art style) that shifts the audience's understanding of everything happening with Natsume and the ship of Deca-Dence. This isn't just a twist: this is a twist done WELL, a piece of the story falling into place that feels like it should've been there all along, and the result is a show with a split perspective, an unusual level of complexity, and the tact to handle it. If you're looking for shows that take big risks and pull them off, THIS IS WHAT YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING.Obviously it's uncertain how the show will manage to tie everything together. It could all fall apart, as anime loves to do (fuck you, Erased.) But as of the halfway point I can safely say that Deca-Dence is ambition meshed with talent, a fascinating and engaging look at a unique and layered world, with fantastic visuals to back it up and likable characters.

I know I know it\'s not very usual of me to give a preliminary review an 8 but come on, this season is awful. From the shows I\'m watching now, The God of Highschool sucks, Rent-a-Girlfriend does not look promising and Uzaki-Chan is straight-up bad. This season of anime is truly the dump. But there\'s this, Deca-Dence, a show that actually I was looking...forward to from the trailer.I\'m going to be frank, the first episode was not really good. The pacing was off, emotions were off, a ton of things that weren\'t what I expected. An example, we have the first few scenes of our main character, Natsume, father just got killed and her losing her arm. That was a lot to intake. What came after was better, it just showed for a rushed introduction which I can get pass, definitely wouldn\'t have liked if they dragged the introduction of Deca-Dence too long but I felt it could have been done slightly better.The second episode is an introduction to our other main character, Kaburagi. Here\'s where things got different... So apparently this show takes place in a simulation. Wow. Not what I expected but it\'s a cool concept. Humanity has died but technology has risen so much that simulations can be made of real-life for enjoyment. Sounds very realistic. We also got to know that Kabu (for short) is one of the fortunate people to be the participants in this ""simulation"".But everything changes when DIO appeared! My oh my did Dio get me again, every time I hear his voice it\'s always a surprise. Fast forward pass episode 3 which is mainly about Hatsume learning how to fight, we get to episode 4. From what Kaburagi said is really interesting. He seems like he wants to overthrow this simulation system they are currently living in. Which is honestly quite interesting, a surprise to be sure but a pleasant one. From this point onwards I have a good feeling this show will do good.-SCORES- (for now)Character- 7/10: While there are the occasional jerk-ass cliche characters, the rest is pretty good. Most of them feel human, act human and react like a human. All with a twist of being anime. Hatsume honestly is quite a decent character, she probably the most ideal and basic outlooking and positive main character one can predict but apart from that she\'s pretty likeable. Same goes with Kaburagi, with the context of his background it\'s interesting how he acts in the so-called simulation world.Art- 8/10: NUT. The parts where Kaburagi is in his main form (not the human one) it gets kinda weird. It feels like a super cartoony kids show. I\'m guessing it\'s just to balance out the production budget but hey, if they get to make the fight scenes look smooth as hell why not?Writing- 7/10: I see potential, a lot more than the other titles I\'m currently watching. I\'m interested in how this will turn out.Sound- 7/10: Not too much, not outstanding but certainly not out of place. The intro is like every anime intros ever, outro\'s fine.Overall, please be a good show, I don\'t want to suffer through this season without any good things to look forward too every week.Strong 7 to a Light 8 forward to from the trailer.I\'m going to be frank, the first episode was not really good.

While it's  not original of course, but it's still fun and strange and different in it's own right. While it might be a little confusing at first, but it's really explained well enough in order for you to get things. With the story following two characters with completely different backgrounds, and how differently they handle humanity's survival.The art style has two different styles. The usual standard that looks clean cut and good, while the other side of it,...is a little cartoonish. Which isn't bad at all, and it's weird at first, but it's different, and nothing wrong with something different. Good all around there. While the sound matches each point of the show really well. Even the effects in the more cartoony way.The characters themselves, there isn't a big cast, outside our mcs, and one or two others so far that have had a ton of details gone into. But that's fine, the characters that are the focus are good in their own right. Our MC in particular being a determined loveable bundle of joy, which I just adore.Is it super amazing so far?

It took me an unusually long time to firmly ground my takes on Deca-Dence (DD.) Even as recently as a couple of weeks ago, I was constantly flip-flapping between my thoughts on the series and whether or not it was meeting its objectives. Was this a muddled mess of a plot? Or the best-written show of Summer? After (much) deliberation I’d now answer with: “a little bit of both.”...As promising as this premise is, there are key details that one could easily miss, ruining the entire experience. And even when interpreted as intended, DD fails to see through its fullest potential. I hope you’ll join me as I attempt to inspect the puzzling case that is DD: the strengths, the weak spots, the twist in Episode 2, and more. On that note, there’s no way I can hold a meaningful talk about DD without spoiling that major left-turn, so I advise you to have at least caught up with the first three eps before reading further.There aren’t many recent prospects in anime that left me as excited as Deca-Dence (DD.) That’s coming from a guy who mostly watches his Japanese cartoons seasonally, so make of that what you will. The last time Mob Psycho director Yuzuru Tachikawa got involved with an original work, the small OVA got picked up by none other than Madhouse for a 12-ep series nowadays known as “Death Parade.” Learning that one of the brightest industry talents was attaching himself to another original script^ sent my expectations through the roof. I openly shared my hype in discussions and gave this series my backing. This had the potential of becoming the dark horse of Summer and I was thrilled.DD’s pilot did little to keep me hopeful. The episode had your standard post-apocalyptic setting, a dystopian class system, a by-the-books arc about our MC proving herself, and a CGI battle with a horde of indistinguishable alien blobs. I was just about ready to lower my expectations significantly when they brought out a giant mecha transformation sequence while Konomi Suzuki belts the (admittedly banger) OP. None of this was bad by any stretch, but we’ve seen it all before. For a Tachikawa production there seemed to be a copious lack of ambition and intrigue. Something to really knock my socks off.And blow me away it did, with a huge heel-turn that changed everything. The reveal that the Deca-Dence fortress was in fact an entertainment facility controlled by a space corporation won me over. Shifts in context challenged me to question everything taking place in the surface world and what that meant to the chibi cyborgs participating in the simulation. The newfound setting opened up room for worldbuilding, which the show does rather well at times. It occasionally drip-fed information about how the grand illusion was held together by staging scenes in control rooms, factories that manufacture the Gadoll aliens for the company, and the storage facility for our robots’ in-game avatars. A dichotomy presented between the remaining humans and their descendent cyborgs was fertile ground for social commentary to go along with some sick action scenes. Ideas behind the ranged aerial combat feel distinct and something out of a video game, and cool concepts pop up wherever you look.Now you might think that I had a good time with Deca-Dence. But I didn’t. For most of its run, anyway. See, my dumb ass didn’t quite pay attention to the second episode, as I was still reeling from its amazing twist. This was probably the worst possible mistake I could have made while watching the show, because for several weeks it was the only episode that defines who Rankers and Tankers are. To make matters worse my brain went on overdrive from that episode on, and my frustration grew as time went by. When a supposedly important character death occurred mid-season I had no idea what to feel, since I failed to catch the context behind that moment. Was that character a human or a cyborg? There are different implications for each interpretation, so which should I take? What the hell is a “bug” anyway? I kept running into those same issues with each plot point, running into brick walls as I regressed and reassessed the story. I never realized the answers to those questions until late in the season, and even then it took a series re-watch for me to comprehend what was happening. I’m all for sheepishly admitting that I ruined the experience for myself, and in retrospect I enjoyed a lot of the narrative presented. However, that isn’t the only reason I’m sharing this anecdote; other viewers I’ve talked to have had equally confusing experiences, indicative of greater problems with DD’s storytelling.In an interview conducted midway through DD’s airing (one I highly recommend you check out+,) Tachikawa admits that him and his team made the setting “somewhat complicated.” There’s certainly credence to his statement, but I don’t think that fully describes what’s happening here. A pattern crops up where select scenes pack exposition in dense chunks, separated with slower story segments. This stop-start pace runs about as well as a truck low on oxyone and robs DD of its momentum. Normally I wouldn’t find this approach problematic, but certain episodes don’t give me a lot of faith that the writers are using its single-cour length wisely. A notable example came hot off the heels of a big cliffhanger, where we follow characters in a factory processing… feces. These lulls in the narrative are all that harder to get through when those moments of plot progression leave holes unfilled. Earlier I mentioned my misunderstandings with the show’s terminology, but even the parts that I could make out yielded unanswered questions of their own. A bulk of those gaps lay with the relatively-unexplored secondary characters. Human survivors in Deca-Dence don’t come across as, well, humans (adding to the confusion with Rankers & Tankers.) These background roles aren’t given a ton of complexity, which is a huge shame. The aforementioned potential for social commentary and ideological reflection got relegated along with characters like Fei, Mikey and Kurenai. The apparent caste divide between “upper-class” Rankers and the “lower-class” Tankers goes unmentioned, which I found really strange. The episodes I enjoyed most were ones that were better able to tap into that potential, namely Episode 7 and its long-overdue return to the community Natsume was fighting to protect. Most of the writing behind its cast contrasts and betrays the intricacies presented by the premise, making me question if the series could be improved on given a higher episode count. Then again, judging from the kind of story DD wanted to be, perhaps my expectations were too high to begin with.In the interview I brought up earlier, Tachikawa claims that while the setting was complicated, the plot was “more straightforward.” It’s an observation I agree with 100%. To better describe what we’re referring to, let’s briefly compare DD with the other script by this director. Death Parade was a story revolving around arbiters charged with deciding the fate of the dead. Episodes were mostly self-contained but came in a variety of tones and themes. Some nifty worldbuilding was done in the background, while not being necessarily integral to the plot. Instead, the show dedicated its focus to challenging the viewer’s understanding of morality and ethics. Death Parade chose to present a fully-fledged question and left the viewer to derive their own answers. On the other hand, DD’s conclusion was all but set-in-stone the moment it revealed its twist. You know what they never say: “Nothing like a good ol’ battle against a ‘Big Brother’ AI to convey your anti- (space) corporation sentiments.” Joke aside, this predictability was a series mainstay even amidst some incredible surprises, as opposed to the ambiguity of Death Parade. One show held all the cards, the other laid them all out on the table as early as Episode 6. This resulted in the story feeling needlessly demanding at times, setting up a hard-to-follow plot but paying it off with a less-ambitious message. With such a fascinating backdrop which arguably surpasses that of Tachikawa’s previous script, one can only wonder if this mostly-predictable journey and its half-explored ideas could have spent more time developing in the ‘Pipe’line. Now, none of this is to disparage what the show does well; “straightforward” doesn’t mean “bad.” So enough of me bemoaning what the show could have been, and let’s get into what makes DD work.At DD’s core is an affecting bond between its central characters. Amidst my countless conflicted thoughts on the series, one constant remained clear: Natsume carries the show on her back. She may not clock in the most screentime but is always a joy to watch. A lot of these narratives about protecting important, “helpless” characters struggle to make an emotional connection with the viewer. Natsume could have easily fallen into that trap by being written as annoying, overly-childish or a cheap plot device for instigating conflict that feels illogical and unnatural. Thankfully, DD never runs into this issue; Natsume is charming and entertaining to watch. In a reversal of the Damsel-in-Distress, she is fully capable of fending for herself in dangerous situations. Giving her character resilience and strength in spite of her physical handicap made her an empowering figure. She shares plenty of chemistry with “Kumicho!” Kaburagi. While the stoic protagonist may not feel as endearing, he’s still a welcome presence on-screen. Instrumental to DD’s success is their bond when they’re together and their development whenever they’re apart. Utilizing their vastly different backgrounds and perspectives to good use, the series is able to convince us that this formidable duo have what it takes to conquer the system.Fun, kinetic action is another of the show’s strengths. Hordes of Gadoll getting mowed down every week made for an entertaining spectacle. Sound and visuals are serviceable, no problems there. I appreciated the design contrast between the Space Colony and Earth. The chibi robot designs may have put some people off, and it admittedly takes some time getting used to. Use of CGI was inevitable but far from nauseating. Overall this was a good effort from relative newbies Studio Nut, and I wouldn’t mind checking out their future projects.Tl;Dr: My experience with Deca-Dence was one of misunderstandings. DD fell short of the lofty expectations I had for an original script penned by Director Yuzuru Tachikawa. Failure to keep up with the show’s fascinating setting and missed thematic opportunities hampered my time with the show further. Nevertheless the series still stands out amongst its peers with its strong central character dynamic and distinct action scenes. The world presented, while incomplete in some aspects, is a complex dystopia that occasionally makes for thought-provoking TV. There is a good story and kernels of good ideas hidden in this massive show, making it one of the more interesting highlights in this year’s anime lineup. Just pay attention, don’t make the same mistakes I did. 7/10~STRAY RAMBLINGS (SPOILERS):-- +Reference: https://sea.ign.com/feature/163759/deca-dence-director-yuzuru-tachikawa-on-the-origins-behind-his-sci-fi-anime-epicHighly recommend you give this a read :)-- ^While he’s listed as series director, Tachikawa stated in an interview that he had worked on the foundations of the script.

Actually, it’s more awful than anything else.The post-apocalyptic motif is the flavor of the year, given all the calamitous events of 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic; crap anime; raging, uncontrollable fires; more crap anime; locust swarms in Africa and India; and then there’s Gibiate, which is too horrifying to put words to).  But in the universe of Deca-Dence, the dystopian society in which the characters find themselves in is not frightful or nightmarish; rather, it’s just bland and sweepingly devoid of any essence of...‘life.’  The problem derives from the characters’ cliched personalities that serve as superficial representations of how humans respond to these situations.  Frankly speaking, the hollowness of Deca-Dence’s characters was reminiscent of the mechanical, unthinking first-person protagonist in any video game; someone who spouts humdrum dialogue and is controlled to act in a formulaic manner.  In essence, I couldn’t empathize with them; which becomes a hindrance when certain death (cop-outs) occur.Natsume’s aspiration of becoming a ‘Gear’ falls in line with every disenchanted Shōnen protagonist who gets told, “no,” at first, but continues nonetheless because they’ve got unsurpassed determination (and special “blah, blah, blah” that makes them… well, special).  Kaburagi, Natsume’s reluctant teacher, offers no interesting nuances to the mentor archetype in the hero’s journey.  Even Kaburagi’s Vegeta-esque, rage outburst was a cheap mimicry that did nothing to add to the story or his growth as a character; he is as straightforward as a ruler, which makes him all to predictable and beyond boring.Now, while the plot did throw the viewer for an early loop — via concealing its true intention — it wasn’t the type of surprise that instilled optimism or a state of shock; on the contrary, it lacked the necessary impact that its predecessor (AoT) pulled off with style and conviction.  This disappointment was compounded further with the pedestrian animation that offered no signs of splendor, making it a tepid affair from beginning to end.  Additionally, the omega type Gadoll in episode 11 — i.e., the armored (Red) Lobster of doom — was far from ‘buttery-smooth’… i-in aesthetics (could you imagine the seafood cracker you’d need to eat this behemoth!).  Furthermore, the fortress city of Deca-dence, itself, was just a mishmash of mundane protuberances that left little-to-no impression in this viewer’s mind.All in all, the passionless messaging and vacuous thematic elements, made Deca-dence the perfect symbol of the declining state of anime in the modern age — making its name, ‘decadence’ (i.e. a state of decline), quite appropriate. ‘life.’  The problem derives from the characters’ cliched personalities that serve as superficial representations of how humans respond to these situations.

Im not a big fan of the cgi bugs but thankfully thats not much of a problem most of the time as when there are more dynamic scenes the art style includes no cgi which is cool cause it only enhances the fights almost like in attack on titan.SoundThe music is good and I was surprsied to find out that the person who worked on the music also worked on the mobile game and adaption of kinngs raid, its cool to see new people work together bringing new blood into the industryThe voices sound good, I like kurenais voiceNatsume is cute, and kabu is cool but there is more to kabu and indeed the entirety of deca dance than meets the eye.Now listen the only reason my enjoyment is a 7 is cause we're only 4 episodes in, while I have high hopes I am also getting gainax vibes which can either be a good or bad thing. That being said, its nice to see something a bit more original than usual"", ""Firstly, this show has fanatics. I think mainly because of a plot twist in episode 2. Fanatics ignoring all the criticism by accusing them to not comprehending little simple plot twist in ep 2.Art is good except chibi part which is very annoying style because of how less info it gives about charecters to  the viewer.So why show is bad (contains small amount of spoiler),humans with cyborg bodies act like too childish and except MC. Cyborgs don't act like human at all.World building has a lot of flaws, its dystopian with mass surveillance, but time to time that surveillance became useless in...most critical places like debugging center.Also viewer needs more info about how all the humanity being okay with playing deca dence as their only hobby and job. As i said cyborgs in show supposed to be human and they are far away from being a human with their motivations, actions and desires. most critical places like debugging center.Also viewer needs more info about how all the humanity being okay with playing deca dence as their only hobby and job.

After watching so many anime that were unfinished, I decided to just read the manga. I decided to give this anime a shot, since it is an original series. Natsume was the one who made me want to watch it, since not many leads are female warriors.I really like the relationship between Kaburagi and Natsume. Kaburagi is a rule follower who hardly questions his superior's orders. He starts to develop a father-daughter bond, (I think, though I also ship him) with Natsume. Kaburagi reminds me of Auron from Final Fantasy X, and Natsume reminds...me of Emma from The Promised Neverland.  Their personalities are so similar. Kaburagi and Auron are both cool bad-asses. Natsume and Emma are both recklass and stubborn in what they want.The cyborg world has a cartoony style and the human world has a realistic art style to it, which I find is a neat way to combine different styles together.

Unlike adaptations, you only have a few trailers and some sentences to derive your expectations from and I feel the key to any good anime original show is to make use of that unknown factor and surprise the audience every now and then with new twists to the series keeping the experience fresh. Deca-dence doesn't quite manage that, but the transition from the first episode to the second had me hooked like no other as what started out as a Shingeki-no-Kyojin-meets-Monster-Hunter show undergoes a complete 180 change into an MMO-esque show with cutesy robots.This total dichotomy...is the core gimmick to the show and to its credit the vast disparity in artstyles do make for many fun moments as the show alternates back and forth between the two environments. However beyond that the show doesn't have much to offer in terms of originality or unique setpieces, less than halfway into the show it becomes a fight-the-power type show as Kabu and Natsume rise up against the System. The show does become more formulaic and predictable in its latter half, and the appeal of the contrasting artstyles would have worn out their initial welcome at this point. Part of this can be attributed to its short 12 episode length, meaning it can't really introduce any new original elements without radically changing the structure of the whole show, but it's still wasted potential.Now onto the actual show, there is a surprising amount of slapstick in this. Natsume being the brunt of many of these definitely led to several memorable moments with her very animated and lively expressions making for great reaction images. The tone is generally lighthearted as well and doesn't get nearly as dark as the first few minutes of the show may lead you to believe. There is no real clash in tone surprisingly considering the dual narrative the show employs and it all flows nicely together. The action scenes are fine, but none of them ever reach the same hype levels as the first and final major setpiece involving the deca-dence. Playing the OP in action scenes is practically cheating.Overall Deca-dence is a fine show, so long as you don't expect the show to continuously up itself with progressively insane twists every episode. It's a fun adventure type show that's over before you know it and regrettably not that memorable in the long run, but at least that ending sure was worth the journey.6/10 is the core gimmick to the show and to its credit the vast disparity in artstyles do make for many fun moments as the show alternates back and forth between the two environments.

Over all this show was extremely enjoyable.  While I don't think it is quite worthy of a perfect score, it was a one of a kind experience to watch.  The interaction between the lead characters, the way the story is told, the art, and the world are some of the best I have seen in anime.Deca-Dence transports the viewer into a new world, the likes of which...have not been seen before.  The way it handles the world building and translates that information to the viewer is masterful.  The viewer accompanies the lead character Natsume as she learns more about the world she was born into, never truly understanding reality until late in the show.  Just like Natsume, I was surprised with new information about the world every episode, massive plot twists occurring throughout the show, even in the first episode.  It was fun to speculate on the implications of every new idea and mechanic introduced, I wound up calling and talking to friends who haven't even seen it about the world.The art is spectacular.  The animation is fluid and clean.  There were only a couple of times were I noticed a downgrade in quality, but that would amount to maybe a minute of the entire runtime.  The show uses bright colors that make every scene interesting.The sound did its job, but it was nothing out of the ordinary, but the voice actors were stupendous.  The opening and endings were both bangers though.The characters provide the perfect avenue to grow with and understand the world.  The lead characters do not follow typical anime tropes, having a few quirks that make them stand out, and come across as real people that you get to know through dialogue and time.  It helps that the show doesn't take itself too seriously and is full of humor.  Natsume and Kabu have some crazy good growth and development and have one of the best relationships in anime.

They did a really good job of showing both aspects of the deca-dence world in a way that was similar but had their own solid differentiation's.The characters are all so wonderful.

It's been a while since I've seen a seasonal anime do something original and new with its story that it's a huge breath of fresh...air from the sodden monotony of the industry as it is right now.

Everything from the wise-landscape shots to the close in character shots looks gorgeous, and the CGI is used to great effect and blended very well.

Many dropped it in the first episode because they weren’t interested in a post apocalyptic dieselpunk setting, and many more dropped it in the second episode because they didn’t like the sci-fi twist. It’s hard for the average viewer to get into what it’s about, in the same way shows like Brigadoon, and Shinsekai Yori are hard to get into. It’s also what makes them stand out and in case you manage to get used to their unorthodox presentation, you will get some...of the most ambitious series of the years they came out. But that mostly means they are trying to be different far more than they are trying to be entertaining, thus they are not shows for the casuals and they don’t stand a chance next to whatever is made for mass consumption. This means Deca-dence is worth watching mostly for its ideas and ambition, rather than its presentation and execution.As someone who feels nothing when he watches something that was made for mass consumption, such anime are far more captivating than by the numbers fighting shonen ala Black Clover and My Hero Academia. The setting is partly a post apocalyptic wasteland where people have to constantly fend off monster attacks and get their fuel and food from the corpses of said monsters, and partly an advanced sci-fi society where everyone’s consciousness has been placed inside a robot and works for keeping the system free of bugs. There is tension and there are stakes, since people are constantly killed on both sides, and initially the situation appears to be hopeless and quite depressing. Despite all that, the tone is light. The characters are not behaving in a grumpy and shroud manner as a result of a world where most of them are dead and they are being constantly attacked by monsters. The heroine in specific is one step away from a silly comic relief. She makes a joke out of almost everything and tends to ridicule the grim situations. It’s like you are watching Attack on Titan, but the main character is Potato Girl.The male robot mentor is by far the best character, as he serious in his line of work and questions the system he is part of without coming off as a clown. Up to the point he befriends a bug, refuses to obey his superiors, and gets punished for not following the program, he brings a very pragmatic side to a show that is full of silly looking robots inside human avatars that are playing a game. Once he gets to the prison and he has to do some hacking shenanigans, the realism is mostly lost, because of how easily it happens. And basically, once the prison arc begins, the show is also revealing its weaknesses, since it constantly finds excuses to plot armor him in situations anyone else would have died, as well as to give him hax abilities that can overrun the safety measures of the system despite being within the confines of a gulag. In essence, he got more powerful than ever before by being suppressed by the very system that doesn’t want him to do more. That was so immersion-breaking.The concept remains cool and it kinda explores themes regarding reality, existentialism, and free will. But, it’s hard to take it seriously when the heroine is a comic relief, the robots are silly looking, and most of what is going on gets infodumped to the viewer. There are a lot of forced explanations coming from chibi robots that are plugging liquid shit in their ass, which leave you thinking ‘What am I watching?’ So yeah, as intriguing as it was with its cool ideas, it presents them in such a silly way to the point of becoming a detractor for most. It eventually manages to tell a full story, but the tone remains light and despite the global threat both civilizations are facing, the problems are solved way too easily and the finale leaves you with an almost fairy tale ending. I had fun with how it stood out from everything else at the time it came out, but it is definitely not for everyone and the levity surrounding the conflict doesn’t let it be more than just okay as a whole.And by the way, just being okay, is still more than being bad. Deca-dence is still one of the very few shows I liked in 2020, which was supposed to be a new era for anime thanks to Korean webcomic adaptations.

Deca-dence is still one of the very few shows I liked in 2020, which was supposed to be a new era for anime thanks to Korean webcomic adaptations. I have far more respect for a show that tried to do things differently and which nobody was hyping, than for cashgrabs that Crunchyroll was constantly promoting as a new era for anime, when they were rushjobs based on overrated trash, made solely for selling subscriptions.', 'For anyone that is interested on picking up a new show with good quality and good animation and decent story ,i will really recommend deca dence an original show  Like (darling in the fraxx,akama no kill, gurren langa) . leaving that out of the way deca dence main issue was people were expecting a new attack on titans due to the similarities of the trailer of the show. deca dence is a 12 episode anime  series that genre contains action fiction  science fiction .this anime was not very well receive by community for pulling the biggest 360 ever made in anime...many fans were disappointed caused animes was not remotely closed to be an attack on titan clone . which i say to this can you really be considered an otaku/weeb if you dont watch stuff out of your comfort zone and discriminate  shows just for being different and  not pulling the same plot over and over again .i thought the point of being a weeb is  to be different not be like everyone else.

The plot is mediocre and the execution made it extremely boring, they would have been better off making this an attack of titan ripoff. I feel like they needed to go more in depth when talking about the gear's world but that didnt happen all they talked about were bugs.The characters are bland. The MC is just your stereotypical child MC. Kaburagi is a decent character, but his development is predictable and almost all of the side characters are easily forgettable.The animation is fine nothing to be proud of.

I can't say much for the sound as I haven't paid attention and it is not a strong focus of the anime.

You\'ll be glad you did.', ""Deca-Dence is a 2020 original anime from Nut. That's right, the Youjo Senki studio. I've only reviewed the one anime from them and it was decent. So, let's jump in and hope they maintained at least that level of quality.Story:Our tale is set in a dystopian future where humanity is stuck in a mobile fortress called deca-dence and fending off attacks from monstrous abominations called Gadoll. We swiftly learn that the whole deca-dence scenario is a game for cyborgs in a world run by an amoral mega corporation and interacting with the endangered humans is one of the features, though they don't know...the truth. And that's not really a spoiler since you learn all that in the second episode. We follow a cyborg, Kaburagi, who works as a recovery agent to deal with those the system deems bugs and a human girl, Natsume, who wants to exterminate the Gadoll and save humanity.The biggest problem with the series is the pacing. There are a lot of elements to the series and none of them are very well expounded upon and the world building relies heavily on exposition due to it simply being too short to naturally expand on it within the narrative. Another issue is the ending. This series has the same issue as the Fate franchise in that everything builds up for a bitter-sweet ending but then the writers can't woman up and follow through so in comes some complete bullshit to save the day.There are a couple areas where I really give the writing credit. First of all, the series takes a lot of familiar dystopian elements but uses them in a unique way that keeps them compelling and fresh. I also give the series credit for being consistently interesting. There's never a point where it gets dull either from dragging or by delving too deeply into formulaic territory.Characters:The characters are semi-interesting. The major ones have some layers. The secondary ones are a bit dull. They tend to follow very common archetypes. The series really needed more time to develop their relationships and needed to do more to showcase how the corporate structure of their world impacted them. Honestly, the character dynamics are a weakness in the series as a whole. We know, for example, that Natsume is good friends with one of the girls she grew up around and has some issues with another but those relationships are very stagnant and rely on the friend/ rival archetypes rather than any actual writing effort.Art:The artwork is pretty nice. The cyborg and monster designs are fairly creative and interesting. The technology they use for Deca-dence and the world in general looks interesting enough. The regular human characters look a bit boring but they're decent enough. The action sequences are pretty nice with the floating tech, harpooning and such. It almost looks like something out of Shingeki no Kyojin when the characters are getting really floaty but it definitely also has a lot of cyberpunk qualities that give it its own distinct feel.Sound:The actors do a fine job. Kusunoki Tomori, Konishi Katsuyuki, Murase Michiyo and more deliver strong performances. I like the way the cyborgs have a quality to their voices that's slightly off, sounding almost auto-tuned while regular humans and the in-game avatars just sound normal. The music is fine.Ho-yay:There are some moments where Natsume seems to have a bit of a crush on Kurenai but not many. Though, in all fairness, there's not much romance in this series in general.Areas of Improvement:1. This series needs more natural world-building. Not exposition but some actual, legitimate world building.2. If you set yourself up for a bitter-sweet ending, you need the ovarian fortitude to follow through. Don't give me a contrived happy ending pulled straight from your ass.3. Give me some compelling side characters. You can get by with having fewer important side characters if you actually give some depth to the ones you have.Final Thoughts:I wanted to like this anime more. It has some compelling ideas and some legitimately different aesthetics and execution. But then you get the rubbish ending, largely bland characterisation and a shit tonne of exposition to replace actual world building. As such, I have to give it a 6/10.

The story doesn't want to pull punches either, while there are some less important deaths they feel...impactful and bring a slightly more mature feel to the anime.In summary if you want a quick anime to watch with a good story, good characters with a good ending look not further than Deca-Dence. impactful and bring a slightly more mature feel to the anime.In summary if you want a quick anime to watch with a good story, good characters with a good ending look not further than Deca-Dence."", 'Deca dence as an anime, is quite different especially when it comes to the aspect of art .

You won't love it, but you will probably like it. It's far from generic (this is one of the most unique concepts I've seen in an anime), but it's also far from the best thing you will ever watch. It has a lot of the tropes from other anime and movies (it's basically just a bunch of different concepts from different movies, shows, and games), but put together it's cool, even if there are some weird contrast between styles that don't really work. The action is very...reminiscent of attack on Titan, and it has the same cool vibe to it, which I really enjoyed. The weird cyborg stuff kind of threw me off at first, but I grew to accept it as a thing that is in this universe. I wish they weren't as cartoonish though, it makes the show feel a little less genuine to me.

At first you might compare the story and concept to anime such as attack of titan or the likes but wait until later episodes you\'ll find yourself watching a very unique and creative story and they did a great job for the storytelling, it didn\'t feel rushed or confusing. The story revolves around the survivors of humanity and trying to protect their mobile city, deca-dence, from monsters called Gandolls but they don\'t know that the...world their living in, the monster they fighting and the city they protecting are all manufactured and controlled by  the system and whoever to reach the truth will be considered as ""bug"" and must be eliminated.For me the most charming aspect of the animation is the artstyle. Brilliant colors even though they are on an apocalpyse setting, good character design and smooth animation specially during fight scenes that\'s all you want to ask for  this kind of anime. For the sounds it\'s good but not the best but the ED song is really good you must hear it atleast once or twice XD Aside from that i really appreciate the MC\'s seiyuu, the one who played as Natsume. She\'s really a good seiyuu but a fresh one too. She\'s new in the industry so good job!The MC is really enjoyable to watch. She\'s an adorable sunshine with the determination to improve herself and have confidence in herself I think she\'s very unforgettable character for this season. For the others, they are good at their own ways but not powerful enough. I think I won\'t forget the characters of Jill, Kaburagi and Kurenai. They are cool.

The first episode really pushed me away, and the only thing that kept me from abandoning it was Natsume the main protagonist. I\'m glad that I stuck with it though, as the show has only continued to grow on me, and prevented me from throwing away what I initially thought would be an above average concept, executed poorly. I feel as if Deca-Dence will go unfinished by many due to its arguably terrible art design choice when it comes to depiction of the Gears and their world. It\'s simply jarring to switch between...the fluidly animated struggles and daily life of the humans, to this weird stylistic depiction of the robot like creatures/AI known as Gears.  I don\'t know what studio NUT was thinking, but they definitely aren\'t gonna make me NUT from the animation of those abominations.However, now that I have that off my chest, I can tell you that I am not only enjoying the show, but am anticipating its conclusion. The breadth of possibilities available to this story is amazing, and one of the main reasons I keep coming back. While it isn\'t revolutionary, the story has its own unique take on the ""humans driven to the brink of extinction"" trope. This show plays with the concept that all of human suffering is planned and coordinated. They are mere pawns/NPCs to be used in games for the enjoyment of a higher or more advanced species, this is fairly unique and leaves a lot of room for interesting developments in the future. My main fear lies in that though, while I enjoyed how quickly the plot developed at first, the show will need to be careful not to crash at max speed. Running head first into a conclusion that isn\'t well prepared or deserved will only result in disaster.This show is split between two main plot points, that revolving around the Gadoll attacks and how the humans deal with these hardships. The other concept driving the plot is the mystery surrounding the ""Gears"". While I am more interested in the later in terms of story, the former has a much more solid cast of characters, and doesn\'t suffer from the aforementioned art style, which did I mention really sucks. Kaburagi and Natsume have a terrific chemistry together making for a lot of wholesome scenes as they complement each other\'s growth as a human and a...? Whatever Kaburagi is. They help each other mature and develop who they are and want to be, and this make for some really good scenes.I have grown fond of this show, which seemingly came out of nowhere, and has many weird quirks, but I would still recommend it to most anime fans despite its flaws. While it is hard to give a definitive score as of right now, it is sitting as a strong 7 or a weak 8 for me. But really, how they decide to develop the overarching plot will truly decide if it is deserving of the praise I have given it, because if they mess that up, the show has few other reasons to be watched. the fluidly animated struggles and daily life of the humans, to this weird stylistic depiction of the robot like creatures/AI known as Gears.

It is definitely a pretty wacky show in regards to the world-building and how the show plays out. Although in some areas perhaps skimmed over or rushed it does give hope to more great stand-alone shows to come.The show features humans and humans that have given up their humanoid states to live somewhat differently as you will see. The planet earth itself is somewhat in ruins in a pretty unusual way of continuing life as this show shows us. It has a good story that is played with good detail...to the end with a conclusion that finishes it off entirely but in a nice way that doesn't feel rushed for the story as the holes left behind are more from the world-building and going forwards.Art of the show is very high quality if not somewhat wacky in nature. It holds out pretty much the entire way through since parts of it are not designed to be perfect.Sound has a pretty banging OP and ED. The general sounds and SFX noise is very good.Characters develop throughout in great detail which includes that of side characters.

If I had to sum up my experience watching this with one word, it would be ""surprising."" I honestly didn\'t expect this level of quality from a studio that\'s made basically one other thing so far suddenly deciding to do anime original Attack On Titan fusion dancing with Mortal Engines, Ghost In The Shell, and arguably a dash of James Cameron\'s Avatar.I have a tendency to rate things with a lot of leeway towards the higher sides...and usually always round up rather than down when I\'m on the fence about something, and I\'ll admit this show was no exception to my rating generosity, but hear me out. Also, sorry if this review is bad; it\'s like 2am and I\'m operating on zero sleep right now.Story 8/10: Humanity is in a post apocalyptic setting, huddled together in the last bastion of civilization and fighting a losing battle against the monsters of the outside world that mysteriously appeared out of thin air long long ago.You\'ve heard this a million times before, I wont bore you with the finer details but know it is very heavily AOT inspired. That does not mean it\'s a clone, a little bit of a tangent but I\'m so tired of seeing this argument; you wouldn\'t call an Isekai show a SwOrD aRt OnLiNe ClOnE just because SAO was the first show to go absurdly viral with the Isekai formula.Normally I would give my two cents on the actual story itself, as well as some key points, but it\'s basically impossible without telling you a giant spoiler that happens pretty early on. The story is rock solid and very good, and for the most part all of the loose ends got tied up in with exposition well before the ending, but there are more unanswered questions then I would have liked. Other than that, I liked the plot twist, but I will admit it was very jarring and might turn some people off. If your not feeling this show after 3 episodes, you probably won\'t love it.Art 8/10: They switch back and forth between a rubber hose/chibi hybrid and classical 2d animation, depending on certain plot things I don\'t want to get into for your own sake. I realize that it\'s a pretty strange transition for most people, it was for me as well, but it grows on you after a while. There is very little CGI, and the panoramic landscape shots are absolutely fucking amazing. This show is an odd duck in the arts department, on one hand I know that the quasi-LooneyToons graphics are off putting, and on the other hand the time spent with the classic animation is drop-dead gorgeous. Not much more I can say about this without spoilers, but the show has it\'s own very unique style, even if not everyone will eat it up.Oh, and the fight scenes are awesome.Sound 8/10: The opening and ending are both bops, and the rest of the soundtrack puts in the legwork when it needs to and rarely ever pulls it\'s punches. The sound design is also pretty neat and the voice acting is as far as I can tell very good as well.Character 9/10: Holy shit, the leads for this are so good. I really REALLY don\'t want to get into details about this, but the two main characters are an easy S tier and thankfully the bulk of the show focuses on their growth as characters and their dynamic; to be honest that\'s probably why this show works so damn well to begin with. Sadly the supporting cast doesn\'t have a ton of depth or focus due to the disappointingly short runtime, and the villain is more than a bit lacking, but the MCs more than make up for everyone else.Enjoyment 9/10: This show starts off at a pretty normal pace and dials it up rapidly before cranking that soulja boy at max volume and diving into meticulously organized insanity; to say that this show was fun is underselling it. Only reason this isin\'t a 10, is because the initial plot twist is a little jarring no matter how you look at it, and I feel like it could have been done a little less suddenly. Also, the ending was satisfying but still felt a tad bit rushed, that being said I was still very happy with the conclusion and it does wrap things up with a nice bow and a definitive ending.Overall 9/10: Overall I think this was one of the best shows to come out of last year and certainly the best original. A compelling story, truly spectacular artwork, phenomenal lead characters, and barrels of fun coupled with a decent soundtrack make for an action packed 12 episode that you are sure to remember long after you finish watching them. Additionally, this show exudes a warm sense of passion, creativity, and the boldness to try something new over and over again. Keep in mind, this studio has made more or less one other thing ever so far. For how far my expectations where exceeded, I would be amiss if I didn\'t give this at least a 9.Bravo studio Nut, the world NEEDS more originals from you. and usually always round up rather than down when I\'m on the fence about something, and I\'ll admit this show was no exception to my rating generosity, but hear me out. Also, sorry if this review is bad; it\'s like 2am and I\'m operating on zero sleep right now.Story 8/10: Humanity is in a post apocalyptic setting, huddled together in the last bastion of civilization and fighting a losing battle against the monsters of the outside world that mysteriously appeared out of thin air long long ago.You\'ve heard this a million times before, I wont bore you with the finer details but know it is very heavily AOT inspired. That does not mean it\'s a clone, a little bit of a tangent but I\'m so tired of seeing this argument; you wouldn\'t call an Isekai show a SwOrD aRt OnLiNe ClOnE just because SAO was the first show to go absurdly viral with the Isekai formula.Normally I would give my two cents on the actual story itself, as well as some key points, but it\'s basically impossible without telling you a giant spoiler that happens pretty early on. The story is rock solid and very good, and for the most part all of the loose ends got tied up in with exposition well before the ending, but there are more unanswered questions then I would have liked. Other than that, I liked the plot twist, but I will admit it was very jarring and might turn some people off. If your not feeling this show after 3 episodes, you probably won\'t love it.Art 8/10: They switch back and forth between a rubber hose/chibi hybrid and classical 2d animation, depending on certain plot things I don\'t want to get into for your own sake. I realize that it\'s a pretty strange transition for most people, it was for me as well, but it grows on you after a while. There is very little CGI, and the panoramic landscape shots are absolutely fucking amazing. This show is an odd duck in the arts department, on one hand I know that the quasi-LooneyToons graphics are off putting, and on the other hand the time spent with the classic animation is drop-dead gorgeous. Not much more I can say about this without spoilers, but the show has it\'s own very unique style, even if not everyone will eat it up.Oh, and the fight scenes are awesome.Sound 8/10: The opening and ending are both bops, and the rest of the soundtrack puts in the legwork when it needs to and rarely ever pulls it\'s punches. The sound design is also pretty neat and the voice acting is as far as I can tell very good as well.Character 9/10: Holy shit, the leads for this are so good. I really REALLY don\'t want to get into details about this, but the two main characters are an easy S tier and thankfully the bulk of the show focuses on their growth as characters and their dynamic; to be honest that\'s probably why this show works so damn well to begin with.

What initially came off as a promising yet overly familiar show about the last of humanity fighting for survival ends up being more than meets the eye by the second episode. Although it is that reveal in the second episode that can be a total turn off for some people whether it be narratively with the change in direction that people thought the show was going to go with, or artistically with the new art and character designs mixed into the show. But as weird as the reveal may be, the creators really stick to this...idea and end up handling it to a satisfying degree till the end.Spoilers aheadAs it is stated in the synopsis the show is about the last of humanity living in a mobile fortress that the show is named after, and defending/hunting bug like creatures known as Gadolls. Using the parts from the Gadolls as food and resources and most importantly using their blood as fuel. Accompanied by the humans are the Gears who are a strangely rainbow colored human like beings who make up most of the fighting force against the Gadolls. With Natsume, our main protagonist, hoping to join and fight alongside them, although ends up being dashed away by not qualifying. And what could have just been a bog standard show about Natsume trying to work hard to prove to them that she is capable ends up being more than that by the second episode. Because while the plight of human survival is a true reality, it is being used for the expense of other beings as a sort of Truman Show-esque MMORPG so they can have fun killing Gadolls and collect their blood that they need for survival as well.The show ends up being split into two different plotlines with the primary one being the standard plot from the beginning about Natsume trying to work and improve herself in order to one day fight against the Gadolls, unaware (like most humans) of the greater system controlling them. While the other plotline follows her mentor Kaburagi who is part of the system and is trying to destroy it for himself and in order to stop the artificially perpetuated suffering that humans had to go through for so long. As he sort of uses Natsume to unknowingly help him due to the fact that she is an anomaly in the system. With both plotlines inevitably coming together during the final 3 episodes delivering an otherwise satisfying conclusion.For a show that only had 12 episodes they were able to do a whole lot with it. Although one of the things that was pushed to the wayside would be character depth. Many of the side characters are two-dimensional at best. Even the main two duo of the story have simple characterization and easy to understand mentality, personality, and motivations. Of course none of this is a bad thing as many of the characters have easily likeable personalities and even the main antagonist has a weird charm to him as well.It also helps that the show has some pretty good production values especially when it comes to it’s zero g-esque, but overall it’s just very good.

An anime set in a post-apocalyptic world, wherein humanity is in the brink of extinction and living under the threat of a “Kaiju” like life form called Gadoll. The humans left in the world resides now in Deca-Dence, a mobile combat fortress used to fight Gadoll. To fight Gadolls humans are engaged in aerial combat against mini-Gadolls and use the blood-sucking harpoons to gather its blood. Since it can used as a power source, used to power their...equipment used in aerial combat and Deca-Dence itself. The Deca-Dence then, once all powered up can launch a huge fist-like weapon to kill the Larger Gadoll.Story: 9/10I liked the fact that this is an OG anime, I had a spoiler-free experience watching it. I’ve been spoiled a lot recently in lots of LN and manga adapted anime. This anime is basically Howl’s Moving Castle meets Attack on Titan meets Godzilla with extra steps. And based on the synopsis and the 1st episode of the anime, I ended up with a “I’ve seen this before” expression. That is until the 2nd episode aired and dropped a huge plot twist. The world is actually ruled by the cyborgs and, the Deca-Dence and Gadoll are just manufactured for entertainment purposes. Deca-Dence ends up being a virtual game for cyborgs to play. Cyborgs uses a manufactured human-like avatars in order to play the game. And humanity is treated as NPC and they have no idea that this is happening. Ever since episode 2, lots of plot twist and turns are introduced, making the anime more interesting to watch.Characters: 8/10The main characters of this anime are Natsume, a human girl who dreams to fight Gadoll and wishes to end its threat against humanity, and Kaburagi, a cyborg who is a retired pro-gamer who actually was the best gamer in the Deca-Dence game. These two meets and one day Kaburagi decides to teach Natsume how to fight Gadolls. Their chemistry reminded me a lot of Joel and Ellie from Last of Us. Natsume is your fun and friendly little girl while Kaburagi is your grumpy uncle who doesn’t like talking with you. As Kaburagi teaches Natsume in combat, he gets interested and influenced by the way Natsume lives. Kaburagi cannot defy the system of the game and cyborgs since he is a cyborg himself. Unlike Natsume who is free to do whatever she wants and works her way to achieve her own dreams. Kaburagi envies this so he decides to, like Natsume, push himself to the limit even if he had to defy the system and get consequences from doing so. Throughout the anime we would see these two characters develop a lot plot wise.Art: 7/10The animation is spectacular specially in combat, and well-choreographed fighting scenes. They integrated CGI animation for the aerial combat and the massive fights of the Deca-Dence and Gadoll. Though, I can’t take the character design seriously since the cyborgs are cutely designed although unique in its own way.Sound: 7/10Another good intro song by Konomi Suzuki (she sang opening songs for NGNL and Re:zero). Although the soundtracks and sound effects were all mediocre.Overall: 8/10Anime gets interesting every episode, the plot twists were surprising, and a wholesome ending. equipment used in aerial combat and Deca-Dence itself.

When it was announced months ago, I watched its promotional videos and got a taste of its story and it got me right away, anybody would be captivated by it, it is very original. It has plot twists, as well, the plot twist on episode 2 got me more hyped and excited for the next episodes to come.With...this type of story, setting and plot, I'm wondering why only a few people watched it (well of course it's still a new anime haha) but compared to the other shows this season, it is quite underrated. I hope more people will get to watch this show because it is a MASTERPIECE, directed by the famous Yuzuru Tachikawa, the director of may other good animes, steins;gate, kill la kill and mob psycho 100. It's just splendid.Art, 9/10, it is good, I can't say anything else. Its art style is one of those art styles that I want to see every time, it's so beautiful that you would just want to look at it every other while, if you get what I mean.Sound 9/10, yeah, it is also good, I think the voices are enjoyable and is really fitting of the characters. And the music are good, I really liked the OP and ED it is very catchy and such, these are very fit theme songs.Character 10/10, I liked every character. There are no characters that lack personality.Enjoyment 10/10, it is rare for me to enjoy an anime this much, especially these days, and I'm glad such an anime existed. That's all I could say, and overall I rate this amazing show 10/10.I hope I did a good job writing a review, and yeah, if you're reading this and you haven't watched the show yet, go and do it, I promise it will be a great time. this type of story, setting and plot, I'm wondering why only a few people watched it (well of course it's still a new anime haha) but compared to the other shows this season, it is quite underrated.

While I was first brought in by its visuals and Deca-Dence (the city) itself, it was the story and characters (especially the main two of Natsume and Kaburagi) that kept me attached. Watching how these characters reacted to developments to their own worldview was a truly amazing experience, and I highly recommend this show to everyone who watches anime.The first and second episodes have an almost jarring difference in art but as the second episode finishes, it becomes clear how the different species of this world are designed. I...came to love the little intricacies and mechanics behind some of robotic aspects of the characters shown and was thrown back in nostalgia by the almost cartoony look.Truly, this is a sci-fi original that truly expanded my own viewpoints on different genres of anime, and would say is one of the best pure originals I've seen in a long time! came to love the little intricacies and mechanics behind some of robotic aspects of the characters shown and was thrown back in nostalgia by the almost cartoony look.Truly, this is a sci-fi original that truly expanded my own viewpoints on different genres of anime, and would say is one of the best pure originals I've seen in a long time!"", 'Criminally underrated. This really redeemed the season, along with the second season of Re:Zero turning out much better than expected.While I don\'t usually write reviews, I find the ~7.5 rating here is really misleading, so hopefully, this review is helpful.Deca-Dence starts off as a general man vs monster sort of anime in the first episode, looking really nice in terms of characters and art. I thought it would be a solid 8/10 from that, and it probably would be rated higher if they stayed in that plot. But right on the second episode, the plot completely shifts. I want to avoid spoiling, but I...will say that this shift is what hurts this score. Many people found it confusing or did not like a change in art. After finishing the anime, all I can tell the people that dropped it ""jokes on you"".Deca-Dence is not a long anime with in-depth storytelling or a hyper fighting anime with colorful fighting sequences. It is a short seasonal anime with really nice art, a great plot, and very unique aspects. While there are issues you can spot, this anime has consistently good episodes that left me in awe every week. It is definitely worth watching or at least watch the first 4 episodes.Tldr; there\'s a lot to this anime.

Kab\'s and Natsume father-daughter relationship and evolution are pleasing to watch, despite the secrets.The universe is original, even if there is a parallell with somewhat societal problems. And the animation is good.I think I can understand why people won\'t like it, but I\'m glad I gave this show a chance ! ', ""*Spoilers Ahead*Deca-Dence is best described as an ambitious amalgamation of Gurren Lagann, Attack on Titan, and The Matrix, that still falls quite short of the quality, impact, and timelessness those stories have. The story is, on the face of it, an adventurous and creative concept. Giant robots fighting giant monsters is a tried-and-true formula, and not just in the Mecha genre. The world that is constructed here is engaging and lore-filled, which often distracts from some of the drawbacks the show has on display. However, despite the dynamic nature of the story, I only found myself enjoying half the show, and that is this anime's...major sin; Deca-Dence is split down the middle in every category. In the story, I found the parts focusing on the Humans, or 'Tankers', the most engaging. Their struggle against the monstrous Gadoll is epic and classic, populated by a smooth combat system and believable characters with real struggles and motivations. Natsume's struggle to become a stronger person is set perfectly in this world which challenges her to do exactly that, and this complex society of post-apocalyptic humans living in a moving city with a dedicated racial caste of warriors called 'Gears', absolutely sucks the viewer right in. However, despite my general reluctance do so so, I must discuss a spoiler here in order to fully cover where this anime really falls apart. When the reveal comes about it all just being a game, about the Cyborgs manufacturing the Gadoll in order to hunt them for sport in a weird MMORPG/VR experience, it is not only boring but also cheapens the whole appeal of what makes the initial plot great. If the story didn't take this direction with the Cyborgs the anime as a whole would have received a much better score. The art faces a similar issue. The backgrounds, interiors, characters of varying importance, and even down to the final detail, the Human storyline is beautiful. Studio NUT made something that looks effortlessly beautiful in every single shot of the Human story. The split here comes with the Cyborgs and their world. I understand where they were going with the Cyborgs, but they end up looking stupid and as a result I am unable to take them seriously. Their world is all bright colors, soft shapes, and empty rooms, and that is dreadfully unappealing. I hated having to look at them so much, and wished that they at least look cool for all the screentime they get. CG is also used here, mostly for the Gadoll, and it is glaringly obvious every time. I find it hard to believe that this CG work was done in 2020. There are also obvious moments where the characters are just not animated, perhaps to save time or money, but it makes them look insane at points. The sound is ok, nothing less than I expect from a modern anime, but it just meets the requirement. The soundtrack is a good choice for its hype fuel aspect, but the sounds of life are only present at certain moments, drowned out most of the time by the competent voice acting. Of course, the way the Cyborgs sound is also strange and cheap, and their whole sound profile is rough and unfinished by comparison. The characters were amazing in the Human storyline, especially in terms of Kaburagi in his avatar and Natsume striking out to live her own life on her own terms. The Cyborgs, save for Kubaragi, fell flat for me. Even the former commander Minato was one note. Only the most important people in the Cyborg story, like Kaburagi and the iconic villain Hugin, are fully realized characters at all. Everybody else in the Cyborg storyline feels like NPCs. At the end of the day, the Human storyline in terms of overall quality and enjoyment gets a 7, but the Cyborg storyline which is present around every corner by episode 6, gets a 4. At the end of the day, Deca-Dence is not a particularly good anime, and though it did have the potential to be great, it smothered itself trying to be about a dozen things it's not. Mainly; It is not the masterpiece it presents itself to be. The Gurren Lagann references are fun, though. major sin; Deca-Dence is split down the middle in every category. In the story, I found the parts focusing on the Humans, or 'Tankers', the most engaging. Their struggle against the monstrous Gadoll is epic and classic, populated by a smooth combat system and believable characters with real struggles and motivations. Natsume's struggle to become a stronger person is set perfectly in this world which challenges her to do exactly that, and this complex society of post-apocalyptic humans living in a moving city with a dedicated racial caste of warriors called 'Gears', absolutely sucks the viewer right in.

A river has such a great amount of rocks and distractions and it directly crashes into such distractions and rocks creating chaos but it does not stop, and the rocks are a vital need for such a unique current that is reality. One of my favorite applications for such logic (or philosophy if you wanna call it that) is the hate there is for hate, people are always striving for happiness, agreement, acceptance, wholesomeness and other such nice and happy emotions and forms, and of course i do agree that such things might work for certain people (not for everyone though, some people were born for the darkness) there is also a strong need for hate and destruction, for reasons explained before. A an existence with no chaos and no sparks can be seen in the famous anime Technolyse, for the setting of that anime is exactly a motionless river, the results of such a boring river and the strong need there is for chaos. There is no need to end chaos, you must simply become chaos itself and then your life will also flow naturally.

Don\'t watch the TV version of Little Witch Academia by the way, it\'s not very good, just watch the original OVA. Anyways, Michiyo Murase, my favorite voice actress, she reminds me of Arai Satomi, known for her roles such as the one and only Kuroko Shirai from the anime adaptation of Kazuma Kamachi\'s とある魔術の禁書目録, first animated by J.C.

The courage to make a super different story and far from being that post-apocalyptic world cliché that many people would like to be seeing, is undoubtedly laudable.Episode 6 shows how people who do not follow the world's systematic standards are treated. It also shows that these people get used to this bad life and think they have nothing to do. He questions who does not try to revolutionize things; it's because of these people that nothing changes.But there are also more human messages and out of discontent with the system, as is the case of episode 7, where we can follow even more an approach and exploration of the characters' personality and their feelings, about their relationship with the whole situation that they are living.Natsume is a very rich character, who develops very well and fights against herself and her problems every day to try to get stronger and stop being a burden to others, but what makes this whole Natsume story interesting is not the story itself, but Deca-Dence's outfit because that story is to be expected for a protagonist.The outfit with non-human beings and the whole game involving humans, is sensational, because it already breaks the mood a lot in the second episode of the anime and is totally different from other things that have characters identical to that of Deca-Dence.The anime already presents everything in the first 2 episodes, so there is no way to get excited about its origin as if you were discovering new information, because in fact you are only seeing the development of everything that the anime represents.Minato is a character who shows the point of view of the person who is lost with the amount of absurd information he has acquired from all sides of the world, so he does not know if it is correct to continue living normally as if nothing is happening, or if the correct  is to try to fight the system.Kaburagi represents the person who already knows that he can fight against the system and has a very strong decision that leads him to understand how to do this.And Natsume is the character who does not know how to fight the system, because she is too innocent and still has no idea what the system is or even if it exists.So there is this parallel of identity of 3 people to function as a metaphor for something that really happens in our world and to pass on the message after all that if the system is wrong, we have to come together to change this situation.Episode 8 keeps talking about people who get used to the system by ordering what you have to do, and they think you can't go against the system, because otherwise the world would become rebellious and chaos. The character Minato has a lot of charisma and influence within these questions.The end still shows Kaburagi talking and coming to the conclusion that you can't escape the system, but you can join forces with several people and force the system to change because of that.You have extremely well-developed characters within an ergonomic and inviting proposal, and the ending finally shows you the conclusion of a subtext in the work on vegetarianism and veganism, two things that are quite debated when you observe that almost nobody eats meat in this  world, and at the end of the day the Gadolls become pets living together with everyone else.There are several cabbage, lettuce plantations, and this is extremely interesting.  This raises the question of the destruction of animals in an ecosystem and whether we really need to consume meat to survive.Deca-Dence is definitely amazing in its two outfits and is extremely well defined and worked on.  Harmony and creativity are beyond what ordinary eyes can see. start this review, I must tell you that initially I loved watching this anime.Deca-Dence seemed to be anything possible in this world, before its release, and it was exactly what I least expected.

However, it becomes incredibly weighed down in the final segments.It suffers from a very shallow cast of one-and-two dimensional characters whose motivations can often be dubious at best, which becomes more noticeable as time goes on and the characters (and their relationships) never really change dynamic. It also is saddled with what I\'d consider to be one of the most out-of-place, forced, manufactured ""crises of faith"" I\'ve ever seen in an anime.

This show very nearly lost me during the first episode, all signs pointed to it being not worth my time, but I persevered to the end credits. Right when I was about to drop it, the post-credits scene of episode 1’s reveal proved how Deca-dence would be anything but boring.  Standard and safe, yes, but not boring.Quick warning label for the first episode: Deca-dence is entertainingly epic and goofy for all eleven of its episodes after the first one, heck maybe even including the first one depending on what you know going in....Not that the first episode is bad or anything, it’s a perfectly adequate opener, it just short sells the quality of the show a bit.  Meta spoilers here, skip to the next paragraph to avoid.  The first episode is deceitful regarding the setting of the show, it won’t really contribute much to the experience on just the first viewing, so I’d recommend coming back and watching it again after you’ve seen the whole show once so you can appreciate it a bit better, kind of like the first episode of Steins;Gate.Once the story kicks off proper, you’d be forgiven for thinking Trigger made this, as it follows similar beats to Promare or Gurren Lagann (I know it’s not Trigger but the same people worked on it), coupled with a similarly vibrant color palette and art style, albeit toned down a bit to match the grittier post-apocalyptic tone.  There’s no crossover between the production teams for this show or anything Trigger’s made (Deca-dence’s staff is all relatively new to the industry, VA’s not withstanding), but the inspiration is clear.  It turns out that studio Nut took the right lessons from those shows, as Deca-dence does hit many of the same spots quite well.The story’s your standard “Fight the powah!” journey; the powers that be are controlling the ruined world in a rather dystopian fashion and are reacting to things they cannot control in much the same way that yours truly reacts when he sees a spider crawling across his floor in the corner of his eye.  We watch as our protagonists experience the effects of this from their own unique perspectives and ultimately strive to create a better world.  Like I said, standard.  The specifics of all this are communicated to us in relatively fun, entertaining, and effective ways.  Even if you’ve seen this all before, which you likely have, it doesn’t really feel like you’re retreading old ground as much as you’re seeing a new version of it.  There are many anime out there that don’t have this going for them.And really that’s the whole Deca-dence package in a nutshell.  It’s a journey down a well-treaded path yes, but it’s a pretty enjoyable one and that’s something I really want to stress.  Of the six anime I finished this season, this was one of the easiest to watch; normally I’m someone who has to get into the right mood to watch something, but I was consistently looking forward to the new episode coming out every week.  That’s really the best way I can communicate just how enjoyable Deca-dence is, it’s just well-written and well-made to the point where its lack of originality seems to almost be a non-issue.  Actions scenes are exciting, characters are fun even when they’re simple, jokes land when they come up.The main theme of certain people in society being bugs (in the programming meaning of the word, i.e. something unexpected and beyond the control of those running the system) is attacked in much the same way Gurren Lagann communicates its theme: very loudly and obviously.  And while I doubt it’ll ever be as iconic as Gurren Lagann, it’s just as effective in getting the message across.  The theme being front and center never took away from all the other values Deca-dence has to offer, and I’m sure this show will inspire some people in much the same way GL does.I’d also like to quickly note that the ending was unfortunately a bit of a failure.  The final fight preceding it was pretty freaking hype in all the usual anime ways, but once the story’s conclusion is reached and the epilogue plays, well, it’s quite accurate to say the lingering plot threads could be used to weave together a rope about as powerful as one of Superman’s hairs.  It’s honestly a little embarrassing just how much is unresolved, and most of it isn’t nitpicks, it’s blatantly obvious stuff any member of the audience would be justified in demanding an explanation for.  The creators were also a bit overly-focused on creating a golden ending where everyone lives happily ever after, the whole epilogue in general feels way to forced; more of what small children in the audience would want to happen, less of what the sequence of events making up the plot would suggest would actually happen.Overall, though, I’m glad I watched Deca-dence.  Even if this won’t be one of my favorites, being able to sit down at the end of every week and enjoy the concentrated goodness its staff Nut-ed (I’m so sorry) out each week was absolutely worth it, and I’d definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to just enjoy something simple but not garbage over a weekend.

The final fight preceding it was pretty freaking hype in all the usual anime ways, but once the story’s conclusion is reached and the epilogue plays, well, it’s quite accurate to say the lingering plot threads could be used to weave together a rope about as powerful as one of Superman’s hairs.  It’s honestly a little embarrassing just how much is unresolved, and most of it isn’t nitpicks, it’s blatantly obvious stuff any member of the audience would be justified in demanding an explanation for.  The creators were also a bit overly-focused on creating a golden ending where everyone lives happily ever after, the whole epilogue in general feels way to forced; more of what small children in the audience would want to happen, less of what the sequence of events making up the plot would suggest would actually happen.Overall, though, I’m glad I watched Deca-dence.  Even if this won’t be one of my favorites, being able to sit down at the end of every week and enjoy the concentrated goodness its staff Nut-ed (I’m so sorry) out each week was absolutely worth it, and I’d definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to just enjoy something simple but not garbage over a weekend.', 'The return of Yuzuru Tachikawa.Last year due to all the situations going on around the world the summer season was a little slow in producing the great amount of anime that we had become accustomed to in past years, it has not ceased to surprise us with some quality bets that manage to demonstrate the talent and passion behind their productions. Among the titles I saw during that particular period, one of the biggest surprises came from an original series whose ambition is to surprise its audience with a premise that shows that you should not judge a book by its cover or in the...specific case of Deca-Dence, you should not judge an anime by its trailers and initial appearance.Produced and animated by NUT studio with a total of 12 episodes, Deca-Dence is an original project directed by Yuzuru Tachikawa who you may remember for his incredible career at Madhouse being the director of Death Parade and Mob Psycho 100, at the same time he participated in projects like Kobato, Chihayafuru or Bleach.  I mention his past at Madhouse because the story of Deca-Dence or at least its beginnings go back to those years, with many of the participants of projects like Death Billiards coming back together for this new work even if their busy careers prevented for quite a while that they would meet again even if the project was already being talked about around 2016. Character design was by Shinichi Kurita, cyborg design belonged to Kiyotaka Oshiyama from DURIAN studio, enemy design by Satoshi Matsuura, art direction by Takashi Ichikura, cinematography by Masashi Uoyama and Masato Takahashi directing the 3DCG elements. The music was the work of Masahiro Tokuda while the supervision and editing of the story was in charge of Hiroshi Seko. Not to mention various guest artists in specific episodes.Gadolls are beasts that destroyed the world, the few remnants of humanity are living in the mobile fortress Deca-Dence that despite depending on the Gadoll fluids to function is the greatest weapon available against them. The inhabitants of the fortress are divided between Tankers or civilians who are in charge of the maintenance and cleaning of Deca-Dence, along with the Gears who fight the threat of these beasts in a battle that seems to have no end. Natsume is a young Tanker who dreams of being able to fight, prove her worth and someday know the peace of the end of the conflict, but it is not until she meets an ex-Gear who will decide to teach her how to defend herself that her world will begin to change. Welcome to Deca-Dence, the most popular virtual reality game from Solid Quake Company. Developed as a controlled sanctuary for the dwindling human race, the company\'s cyborgs can descend into humanoid avatars to fight and protect the fortress that gives the game its title. Kaburagi was one of the best players, but seeing the heartlessness of the system where he is just one more replaceable gear among hundreds of other gears like him, he just waits for his eventual deactivation. But meeting a young Tanker will give him the hope and conviction he needs to try to change the system that rules the world.Deca-Dence is a story of parallels and contrasts, which with enormous ambition is packed in simple twelve episodes where it has many ideas and little time to explore them but gives its best to do so. Under the initial appearance of being just another story where humanity is trapped in a desperate struggle for survival, soon this work shows us how everything is nothing more than part of a system that to preserve itself and the status quo maintains the constant conflict considering each individual as little more than replaceable parts. Thus a young human girl who is unaware of the true nature of the world but wishes to prove herself and obtain peace, will become the reason why a desperate Cyborg who only hoped to stop functioning in a small act of defiance, would take the will to break the cycle. Doing justice to its name of decadence this is a work about the will to fight against a complacent system, the reasons to move forward despite the adversities and to find within each individual the value of individuality. All wrapped in a web of mysteries, lies and eventual revelations that starting from the second episode do not give any rest to wanting to know what comes next. Perhaps not everyone likes how from the beginning the viewer is taken away the blindfold behind the truth of the events, but the complicity in waiting for the characters to discover the truth is a hook that easily captures the interest if you follow their game, especially when in a complacent industry like the anime industry original works like this are extremely few.Although it does not reach exactly the same standards of Madhouse productions in which Yuzuru Tachikawa has participated, Deca-Dence is still an ambitious production not only at a narrative level but also at a technical level that shows off NUT\'s skills when it comes to work. Mixing more traditional animation with multiple digitally produced elements, this is a work with a sense of scale like few others, with huge sets and powerful framing of characters that give life to each of the scenes throughout the series. When this anime decides to stop for a moment it can be imposing using cameras, colors and the same scale of its scenes to present the ideas, all while the action scenes are frenetic with the strength and agility of their combats.  However, if there is an element that contrasts like the story itself is in the character design, because although the humans are presented with the aesthetics of any other anime, the Cyborg are the ones who for better or worse steal the show. Their cartoonish appearance not only contrasts with the remnants of humanity that co-star in the series, but is also used as a distraction to demonstrate the darker and more brutal side of the series featuring lobotomies, slavery and other adorable situations. The only ""but"" with the production is that perhaps the mix of 2D and 3D at times leaves something to be desired, but this is one of those series that I want to see polished in the jump from TV to BD.Regarding the musical aspect of this work, I must say that this series has one of those solid soundtracks that are overwhelmed by the rest of the aspects in its production. Masahiro Tokuda\'s work is not particularly recognized with a relatively recent career in the manga/anime world, but he manages to give life to each of the scenes in conjunction with the other elements in a more than effective work. Overall the soundtrack is one of those that are best enjoyed separately, without being obscured by the rest of the elements. As far as sound effects are concerned the series is fine, managing to give life to the movements even those where gravity is altered. In terms of opening and ending themes, we have the opening called ""Theater of Life"" performed by the singer Konomi Suzuki that full of energy invites to adventure, while the ending is ""Kioku no Hakobune"" performed by Kashitarō Itō that with a nostalgic tone makes us think about the adventure that has been witnessed so far.It\'s far from perfect, but I\'m not kidding when I say that it\'s easily the best I\'ve seen in original proposals throughout last year\'s releases. With works like this the NUT studio proves that it is a place that offers quality works that even with the obvious CGI the brutality of putting details even in rubble in order to give life to their works ends up playing in their favor when it comes to immerse the viewer in their show and it is not the only one among its small details that earn the goodwill on my part. The only downside I can see is how with 12 episodes the series can not explore in depth its characters and some events seem to come out of nowhere, this to the point that reminds me a little of the comparisons between the films and the series of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann where the first even if they contained the most iconic scenes lacked those times of calm where the viewer meditated the events and knew more facets of its huge list of characters. However, if there is one series that deserves to be given a chance, it is simply Deca-Dence. specific case of Deca-Dence, you should not judge an anime by its trailers and initial appearance.Produced and animated by NUT studio with a total of 12 episodes, Deca-Dence is an original project directed by Yuzuru Tachikawa who you may remember for his incredible career at Madhouse being the director of Death Parade and Mob Psycho 100, at the same time he participated in projects like Kobato, Chihayafuru or Bleach.

There were so many other things I was trying to catch up with that this show just fell through the cracks.BE WARE, the cover for this show is not indicative of the actual show. After episode 1 you will see that this show is not at all what it seems. The bombshell reveal in episode two will either make or break this show for you as it completely shifts art styles, voices, manners of speech, plot, and well...everything gets flipped on its head. This is what makes this show....Honestly at first I was conflicted thinking...man why not just keep the show going, but then it would simply be a hybrid between attack on titan and darling in the franxx which were already done. Well, they added a HUGE SAO element to it and that really made everything feel fresh and unique.Now that that is out of the way, about the show. First of all, I feel like the art styles chosen for the show are adequate, but honestly could have been better. That is where I knock that 1 point off. Both the dub and sub are fantastic, outstanding actually.The best way I can summarize this show without spoilers is this; Its surprisingly good, oddly funny, and strangely wholesome. I binged it in one day, and it really felt so well done. Pacing was spot on to keep the story going and keep you invested every single step of the way and the characters are far and few between that they don't feel like they overlap. I feel like the characters are all unique enough and are given just enough back story to allow for a really good one hit wonder of a show where there is a beginning, and an ending without any loose ends.Also, please watch the last episode all they way to the last second, otherwise...you will be a bit confused as to how it all wraps up.ENJOY!PS: No this show doesn't really live up to the standards of the masterpieces it takes its ideas from, but that does not mean I should take points off for it. In a bubble, its a great show, and comparing it to other shows that go on for longer, have much higher budgets and more effort put into them and try to milk their respective fan-bases with merch etc, is unfair. I am not one to compare shows with each other, and like to watch them in their own bubble, as if I know nothing about anime, so if its a show I can give to a non anime fan and they will like it, it gets good scores from me.

Don\'t be put off by the fact that the sci-fi story may seem superficial at first glance, and immerse yourself in a well-told story about a young girl who tries with zeal and full commitment to improve the dystopian environment around her.Story: End time scenario with twist and turns that entertains well (8/10)The human race, which is threatened with extinction, the few survivors form a community in the mobile fortress Deca-Dence. The community consists of the tankers and the ""gear warriors"". The Gears fight against monsters, the so-called Gadolls, while the tankers...take care of the exploitation of the Gadolls killed by the Gears. So the tasks in the Deca-Dence are distributed and here the adventure of the tanker girl Natsume begins. She wants to become a member of the Gears and does everything to make her dream come true. There is much more to explore, so stay tuned.Characters: simple, with increase in complexity as the plot progresses (8/10)The characters are very simple at first, but as the story progresses, a certain complexity successfully develops. This development goes hand in hand with the plot, so that even fully developed characters can experience a change that influences and makes their reactions understandable. All in all the production seems plausible and well thought out. In my opinion, this is a huge plus for an original anime TV series, especially considering that studio NUT hasn\'t been around that long. The cast is extensive, but not fully provided with backstory and depth. For just 12 episodes, however, the characters are well staged and interesting, that\'s done smart.Natsume:The young tanker girl grows up an orphan after losing her father and her right arm in a Gadoll attack. Her character is great. Despite her loss, she is not filled with hate but with enthusiasm and her heart is open to new things. The new task she is given does not quite match her dreams at first, but she does not get discouraged.Kaburagi:He is a typical old warhorse and commands the repair crew to which Natsume was assigned. His grumpy nature makes him seem unsympathetic at first, but there is more behind this façade. One has such a presentiment when he speaks that supervising maintenance work is not all that is inherent in his past. At the latest with the discovery of his little roommate “Pipe”, Kaburagi suddenly becomes likeable.Fei:She is Natsume\'s best friend, they grew up together and share many memories. Even so, they are very different and the older they get, the clearer the difference becomes. Fei wishes for a simple and happy life as possible. She doesn\'t have Natsume\'s ambition to achieve more. A very interesting conflict, plausibly staged, but the series is too short to give the subject more depth. An important character that is unfortunately mostly overlooked.Kurenai:She is a legendary fighter against the Gadoll and Natsume adores her. The character concept is almost a bit too simple, pretty, tough and a good fighter. Well, she is a man\'s dream, but suitable for the colourful troupe and likeable, she becomes by her empathy as well as the nice quirk that she has a crush on Kaburagi.Donatello:He is a former member of the Gears group (top Rankers), to which Kaburagi also belonged. He\'s a good fighter with a strong build, he\'s loud, headstrong but not the smartest. Nevertheless, his character has a few surprises that one wouldn\'t necessarily have expected.Minato:He is the commander of the Deca-Dence and the only authority he has to respond to is Hugin. Minato`s character has classic humanistic traits. He is aware of his responsibility and fulfills his task with great integrity and a sense of duty. However, his conscience demands that he reconsider his priorities. A very human figure with high ideals, who nevertheless values friendship from the bottom of his heart.Jill:Her character is admirable because there are not many women in the field of mechanical, electrical and hardware engineering. It\'s fun to see how she supports the revolution with her skills at a high technical level, especially when Donatello is put in his place by her dictation.Visuals: A mixed bag and the reason for a slightly lower score (7/10)The art is good overall. The characters have a different appearance. Natsume and some of the Gadolls reminds me a little of the anime ""Bōnen no Xam’d"", but I rate that as positive. The fortress is futuristic and yet somewhat old-fashioned with the chain drive. The vehicles often have a very clear reference to current car models. This is not really bad, but some Steam Punk or more bizarre like in the ""Mad Max"" movies would have made the design more of an eye-catcher. Personally, I didn\'t like the use of CGI on some of the cars, especially in the last third of the series. On the other hand, the background and also the Gadolls with its very simple appearance were basically very fitting for the premise of the series. The design of the cyborgs is hand-drawn, the use of CG3D models was deliberately avoided, which I think is a good decision. Of course, one could argue that another decision would have allowed more details, I leave it to the viewer whether this criticism is justified, and just allow myself to point to the finale.The art department makes very good use of the light and shadow effects and the colours also have a hue that matches the mood of the scenario.The animation is excellent and harmonises with the previously mentioned play of light and shadow as well as the colour palette, so that a very fluid overall picture is created. CG is not my cup of tea and is very disturbing in some scenes. Of course, CG offers a lot of details that are great on machines, but with living things it seems artificial and therefore out of place, especially when the cyborg creatures, in contrast, were hand-drawn. In my opinion, this seems inconsistent and reduces the rating.Sounds: Very well suited, great OP and nice ED as well as good VA (8/10)The background music was composed by Tokuda, Masahiro. One might object now that he is not yet so well known, but I think that will change. His arrangements have given many scenes a very good and coherent emotional emphasis. I was particularly struck by the use of musical style elements, borrowed from Irish folklore. This is a really good musical background for the rather lively nature of e.g. Natsume and many other members of ""The Power"". A few of the insert songs reflect this very nice and I really enjoyed listening to them.The OP theme song ""Theater of Life"" was performed by Suzuki, Konomi. It is a lively start to the series and the music is good. Great rock sound and with the strong but very feminine voice of Suzuki-san overall cool and it sounds great - fresh, full of energy.The ED theme song ""Kioku no Hakobune"" is performed by Itō, Kashitarō and great soft rock. The title is not only a successful arrangement, but also lives from the cool and somewhat strange voice of Itō-san. I especially enjoyed the title because it is not only a soft ending, but individual, a bit unique and yet a perfect answer to the demands of an ED song.I admit the voices of the two main characters, Natsume spoken by Kusunoki, Tomori and Kaburagi spoken by Konishi, Katsuyuki, are very good. The emotions of the characters are voiced very well. Especially the lively and impetuous nature of Natsume is conveyed to the audience in a very amusing and likeable way. But also the second row has very good Seiyū. I noticed for example the voice of Chiba, Susumu in the role of Natsume\'s father Muro. His role is not long, yet I noticed his pronunciation and the good intonation very positively. I also really enjoyed the voice of Kitamura, Eri for the role of Kurenai. A bit rough but still feminine, which underlines the empathy of the character very positively. It is not immediately noticeable, but the realisation of the dubbing hits the character very well. And when we talk about very fitting voices, I would also like to mention Shibata, Mei as ""Feis"" Seiyū. The embodiment of the shy and rather reserved Fei was very good, both in pronunciation and tone of voice.Last but not least the sound effects were also well done. I was very positively surprised that the different sounds for e.g. breaking up the earth\'s surface, bursting metal etc. sounded very good and plausible. However, the effects did not come to the fore, which in combination with the good music and voice acting resulted in a very harmonious overall sound.Deca-Dence is one of the few series of 2020 that I would like to recommend! The script is well written and the story as well as the hidden allusion to the title and the premise are well communicated. The characters are catchy, likeable and their syncronisation sounds great. The animation is fluid and not jerky, so the series as a whole will certainly grab your attention. The first episode may be perceived as somewhat lackluster, as it builds up the entire background of the story, but from the second episode on the series unfolds much more action-packed and exciting.My suggestion: watch the first 2-3 episodes and then decide whether you want to continue watching or not.As always, thanks for reading and have fun watching. take care of the exploitation of the Gadolls killed by the Gears.

A few of the insert songs reflect this very nice and I really enjoyed listening to them.The OP theme song ""Theater of Life"" was performed by Suzuki, Konomi. It is a lively start to the series and the music is good. Great rock sound and with the strong but very feminine voice of Suzuki-san overall cool and it sounds great - fresh, full of energy.The ED theme song ""Kioku no Hakobune"" is performed by Itō, Kashitarō and great soft rock. The title is not only a successful arrangement, but also lives from the cool and somewhat strange voice of Itō-san. I especially enjoyed the title because it is not only a soft ending, but individual, a bit unique and yet a perfect answer to the demands of an ED song.I admit the voices of the two main characters, Natsume spoken by Kusunoki, Tomori and Kaburagi spoken by Konishi, Katsuyuki, are very good. The emotions of the characters are voiced very well. Especially the lively and impetuous nature of Natsume is conveyed to the audience in a very amusing and likeable way. But also the second row has very good Seiyū. I noticed for example the voice of Chiba, Susumu in the role of Natsume\'s father Muro. His role is not long, yet I noticed his pronunciation and the good intonation very positively. I also really enjoyed the voice of Kitamura, Eri for the role of Kurenai. A bit rough but still feminine, which underlines the empathy of the character very positively. It is not immediately noticeable, but the realisation of the dubbing hits the character very well. And when we talk about very fitting voices, I would also like to mention Shibata, Mei as ""Feis"" Seiyū. The embodiment of the shy and rather reserved Fei was very good, both in pronunciation and tone of voice.Last but not least the sound effects were also well done. I was very positively surprised that the different sounds for e.g. breaking up the earth\'s surface, bursting metal etc. sounded very good and plausible. However, the effects did not come to the fore, which in combination with the good music and voice acting resulted in a very harmonious overall sound.Deca-Dence is one of the few series of 2020 that I would like to recommend! The script is well written and the story as well as the hidden allusion to the title and the premise are well communicated. The characters are catchy, likeable and their syncronisation sounds great. The animation is fluid and not jerky, so the series as a whole will certainly grab your attention. The first episode may be perceived as somewhat lackluster, as it builds up the entire background of the story, but from the second episode on the series unfolds much more action-packed and exciting.My suggestion: watch the first 2-3 episodes and then decide whether you want to continue watching or not.As always, thanks for reading and have fun watching.', '-Spoilers Included-""We exist for the sake of the system"" - HuginDeca Dence was a surprise for me this season, and I went into it thinking it was another apocalyptical anime like Attack on Titan, but the twist in episode 2 was a pleasant one. After the twist in ep 2, this anime has been praised by many critics for its originality, yet also criticized by haters. Let us see how this anime fares.Story- The story first seems like an apocalyptical anime, where humanity has been hunted down and must survive dangerous threats in a sheltered area. This premise probably sounds pretty similar to...lots of other anime that were produced. However, episode 2 came around, and we see that this story is original. It turns out the humans are living in a simulation where cyborgs run the place, creating Gadolls for their pleasure. Even though plenty of people disliked the twist, I think it was a good one that kept me engaged throughout. This is not to say that the plot is perfect. I feel like many plot points could have been fleshed out better and the ending could have been explained a bit better. As a whole though, the plot is solid.Art- I have not seen Studio NUT\'s art before, but it seems neat to me. Nothing that turned me off, but nothing too incredible. The fight scenes were animated quite beautifully, however.Sound- The OST and the music is quite pleasant to listen to. My favorite song is the ending, Kioku no Hakobune. The battle OST is also very hype. In terms of voice acting, I don\'t see any issues here.Character- This is where I have a bit more complaints. In my mind, two characters are worth talking about. First is Kaburagi. He starts as a man who is pessimistic about the world and lives for the sake of living, with no purpose. However, as he gets more and more time with Natsume, he finally sees that there are things worth fighting for in life. I enjoyed his character growth. The second character is Natsume. In my mind, she is a bit too cliched and even annoying at times. Her impact on Kaburagi was fascinating to watch, yet her boundless optimism is a bit off-putting and she acts far too rash and hot-blooded for me to like. Other than those two, other characters get too little development or even screen time for me to discuss. This is another issue I find with this anime, and one example is Sarkozy. He could have had a lot of development as he grows out of his shell and his personality was intriguing, but he was written off too quickly. His death had a little impact on the show compared to what he could have had, and I would feel the same towards many other characters. To summarize, I think the show had lots of characters that had unused potential, but Kaburagi\'s development was good.Enjoyment- At first, I didn\'t enjoy the show too much, but the twist in episode 2 was captivating and kept me wanting to see more after each episode. The story felt rushed, but I would be glad to see a season 2 if it was greenlit.Overall- I don\'t think this show is a masterpiece, judging by how it handled its characters, but its twist was enjoyable and the story is solid. I would recommend this show to you if you like a decent Sci-Fi story. lots of other anime that were produced. However, episode 2 came around, and we see that this story is original.

I would recommend this show to you if you like a decent Sci-Fi story.', 'Deca-Dence is the personification of the problems I have with a lot of sci-fi, which is why I tend to avoid that genre in general. What a lot of sci-fi anime and basically any other form of media love to do is make use of a interesting, futuristic concept and basically throwing it in a story without any explanation. Deca-Dence does exactly this.Deca-Dence throws in random, ""cool"" ideas, like cyborgs, ""AI system that everyone has to follow,"" and ""dystopian society"" into a survivalist plot of humans vs monsters.Basically, the story just features these things in the plot, and you as the viewer are expected to...make sense of it all. There\'s not much, if any, explanation at all for how things became the way they became. It\'s just implied that these things could have feasibly happened, and now it\'s an integral part of society now.I mean, this story doesn\'t bother with making sense at all.  Plot holes are innumerous. I won\'t mention every single one, since that\'d be too much. But, some things I\'ve noticed which are just stupid is the fact that every human is chipped, but robots aren\'t? They\'re given an extremely amount of autonomy with no supervision or monitoring at all. You\'d think for such an advanced system, there would be event logs, thought manipulation, or at least a kill switch. If the system\'s wish was for autonomy of cyborgs, a kill switch would be the smallest of the smallest precautions. They did it to humans. Clearly, they could have done it for the cyborgs. The whole thing about how the Deca-Dence system is a game for cyborgs? It\'s never explained at how the game works at all. Nothing about what cyborgs do are really explained. Plus, the fact that such an elaborate game was set up to begin with is weird. Wasn\'t the system created to prevent human tragedy to happen again? How did it evolve to: creating a game where humans are an attraction? Isn\'t this system supposed to act in the best interest of mankind? Shouldn\'t humans be given the highest priority? Why are they living like caged animals in a ruined continent? How about the fact that the ""bug correctional"" facility is an absolutely arbitrary place only put in the story for there to be a way for cyborgs to rebel? What about Gadol? It seems like oxyone is a vital resource to even the cyborgs. It seems very weird, then, that this stuff is absolutely pumped into the Gadoll. What\'s the point? Where does Oxyone even come from? is it ""farmed"" from the Gadoll? Is there a net gain of oxyone from creating Gadoll? Seems like the answer is no, considering the conclusion of the series. Gadoll seem to have no practical purpose other than entertainment. There are so many other things, but these are the thoughts I was thinking of the entire time this stupid cyborg part of the plot comes inn to play.This story, disregarding the sci-fi BS is honestly not bad. I really wonder why it had to be complicated in such a way. Probably just because it\'s easier to have something like a ""dystopian system controlling all."" There\'s a clear enemy in this case, and the entire plot and motivation of the characters can be really simple given the circumstances. Given Nastume\'s ""determination to become someone alive,"" that gave Kaburagi the motivation to ""break the system."" It\'s such a simple message for such an elaborate and god-forsaken plot. If there was none of this sci-fi, then there would have had to be a coherent plot, good character development, and a decent conclusion. It seems that this story didn\'t really want any of that.Honestly, characters in this story are alright, it\'s just that they weren\'t given enough time to shine. Nastume goes through her entire hero\'s journey in such little time, but she\'s a decent character still. Imagine if she had more time to develop and more arcs focused around her? She could have single-handedly carried the series on her back. Instead, she\'s relegated to more of a support role for Kaburagi. Her character development period is rushed as a result. Kaburagi is obviously not a bad character. He goes through a similar period of soul searching just like Nastume, albeit in completely different circumstances. Other characters, I don\'t have much to say. There definitely are quite a few decent side characters, and they had the potential to become great in their own right, but sadly, they were pushed to the side due to the focus of the story being the plot of ""overthrowing the system."" Like I said, characters  had the potential to be decent, and Nastume and Kaburagi were even considered ""good,"" it\'s just that almost all the characters weren\'t given a lot of room for development, and so almost all of them feel a bit bland.I thought the art and animation in this show was amazing from episode 1. Sure, there was bad CGI from the gadolls, but the facial expressions on Nastume were vivid and rich, the backgrounds stunning, and the fight choreography good. It seems that all of the budget went into that pilot episode since the rest of the show felt really bland. It\'s a shame.Deca-Dence essentially is filled with plot holes that the creators don\'t even bother to explain, but you\'re expected to sit through this narrative and accept that ""this is how things operate in this world"" of the show despite it not making much sense. Add some generic message and purpose to the characters, and you have Deca-Dence\'s sci-fi portion of the story. The ""humanity vs monsters"" plotline is a lot more interesting, but it gets ruined by the sci-fi plot. it could have been like Attack on Titan or Code Vein, where it could have been a desperate battle for survival against monsters, but instead we get this convoluted story. make sense of it all.

To be quite honest with you and out of stupidity, the amount of times they mention Deca Dence in this, I still haven't a bloomin clue what Deca Dence is. I suppose my monkey brain self just admired so much of the art and the fighting scenes out put into this that you'll immediately get lost in a good way lol...Seriously the teamwork with Natsume and Kaburagi were just so wholesome man! I just like...Natsumes confident attitude like she does them fights good! Likewise with Kabu, for a cute little robot avatar, he just surprises you on how clever he is! However I think the best character in this is Jill. She definitely is best girl with her sly clever attitude when she's helping out with Kabu. The actress Michiyo Murase did a phenomenal job voicing her!Yeah if you like you're mad max themed and monsterish type of story, look no further and watch this anime! It's also by the director who did the fantastic Mob Psycho 100😁😁 Natsumes confident attitude like she does them fights good!

It usually looks good but every once in a while it either drops to mediocre or it gives us action scenes that are gems to watch. In fact, there's an action scene from the 6th episode that was animated in such a poor way that you'll think your internet connection died or something.2) I found the monster design to be unimaginative.3) the visuals are pretty and colorful to look at.Sound:1)The cast of seiyuus is a mix of veteran, legendary and rookie seiyuus. Despite this, I think everyone gave a solid performance so the seiyuus themselves and...the directors did a very good job.2) The soundtrack is okay.Story and characters:1) this anime only explains the setting by the 3rd episode and has a slower start compared to similar shows like Kotetsujou no Kabaneri or Youjo Senki (I'm comparing these due to the action packed/action oriented shows they are). Even so, it's totally worth it to be patient and stick around and invest your time into the story and its characters.2) Although the premise isn't something entirely new, I'd say that the concept, setting and characters were very well designed and written. It's impossible to watch Deca-Dence and not care about the world or the people and creatures that live in it. You'll want to know more and more and that's something that nowadays it's kind of rare to find in regular seasonal shows. At least in my opinion.3) I adored the ending but (SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!)  three things left a bitter taste at the show's final moments. Kabu and Natsume's reunion was something that I wanted to watch so bad and to have the anime just cut the audience off felt like my eyeballs had been poked with two middle fingers. I honestly feel cheated out this reunion scene. And also, at this stage Natsume's character design has longer hair but the final scene shows a picture of this reunion with Natsume's from old days... while in the present day so it's a visual plothole and it's just a lazy attempt at nostalgia of a haircut we just saw 2 minutes ago. And hum... WHERE'S PIPE?!?!?!?!?So, the verdict is this anime gets an 8/10 from me. I would love to see a sequel out of this, even if the ending appears to resolve everything about the story. I also feel like this show appeals to everyone regardless of age, gender and also genre preferences. Still reading?

That episode reveals the truth behind the world of Deca-Dence and it does it astounding and amazing the spectator in the probably most effective way I\'ve ever seen. There the story splits beetween the world of Natsume and Kaburagi, and while in...episode 1 Natsume seemed to be the main main character, Kaburagi proves himself being a more interesting and round character, well Natsume remains a great character too, who represents the human spirit and determination ecc..., but Kaburagi is just amazing.The show from what I remember has no big clichès, well you got it: the plot and the story are good, the real problem with Deca-Dence is something I really can\'t ignore: the characters.As I said both Natsume and Kaburagi are good, the problems come with everyone else. Honestly the part of Natsume was a bit worse than the Kaburagi one, it had on his side only the art which was without any doubt way better, the main problem with it is the fact the characters are wasted, for example Linmei who I really expected to be an important character appears in the whole show for like 1 minute overall, it\'s too strange, I wouldn\'t be surprised if it was due to some timing problems during the realization of the anime, which are understandble after all that ""coronavirus stuff"", but still it\'s a problem, also Kurenai could have been an interesting character, and she does her best in order to, but she just fails; on the Kaburagi side there are plot twists, suspence and a lot of cool stuff, the characters are not even that bad so his part is much more interestingThe opening was good, never skipped it, I don\'t remember the endingDeca-Dence is an anime about dreams, war, the limits the fun should have, the inevitability of fate, the importance of invididuality and one\'s opinion, the getting check without knowing, asserting your thoughts, sacrifice and probably even more, it\'s a good anime, go watch it as soon as you can, it doesn\'t have the attention it deservesEven if... well, Deca-Dence could have given much more if only it had 3 or 4 more episodes, unlucky it had not. episode 1 Natsume seemed to be the main main character, Kaburagi proves himself being a more interesting and round character, well Natsume remains a great character too, who represents the human spirit and determination ecc..., but Kaburagi is just amazing.The show from what I remember has no big clichès, well you got it: the plot and the story are good, the real problem with Deca-Dence is something I really can\'t ignore: the characters.As I said both Natsume and Kaburagi are good, the problems come with everyone else.

The concept is where I'm giving most of the points to on this one, as I honestly felt nothing watching some characters die or becoming 'bugs'. To me, this show goes a whole different direction than you expect following the episodes 1 and 2. But the novelty wore off after a while. Even with this barebones anime season, I was behind on this show a lot. I would watch older shows on my plan to watch instead. This show didn't captivate me like other people have been...saying. The artwork is cool, but I personally never vibed with most of the characters. I'm left with this takeaway: never let yourself become caught up in the waves of the system.

Usually anime loves to overdo the ""we must force love stories onto the main characters at all costs"", here we have a familial tie, and a unique one at that, with it being a step-father and daughter. You just don\'t see that touched on a lot in anime, and when you do the step-parent is some evil monster that hates the child, and their biological parent can\'t see it! I really enjoyed this aspect of the anime. I loved seeing their relationship build...to the point that they genuinely cared for one another. If the anime were to continue on this route, with the emphasis on these two characters and their relationship, I would have rated it at least an 8. You can see that they aren\'t perfect either, this isn\'t some shiny, bubbly, everyone is perfect style of characters, they do have their flaws which makes them even more likeable. Even the side characters come across as more human than the usual absurdity you can get in anime\'s with characters maniacally laughing out loud as everyone just stares at them.BUT. The genre changes around the 4th/5th episode, and it becomes a very typical run of the mill action anime. I also hated this whole idea that the robots became the focus of Deca-Dence, and I personally found it very jarring to go from a very complex, touching, sensitive anime. To one that was basically \'the whole world is lying to you, and there\'s a villain who\'s holding us back, now we\'ve gotta fight lots and ignore any sorts of below the surface emotions\'. Ignoring all the inconsistencies in legitimate human logic/emotion, when they all basically find out that their lives are a lie.

Firstly, imagine all the players and NPCs of Log Horizon living in the enclosed walls of Attack on Titan where the titans outside are instead monsters. Secondly, unlike Log Horizon where players are powerful individuals, in this scenario it's the NPCs that are powerful. Thirdly, unlike Attack on Titan where it seems that humans are standing on thin ice for their survival, this anime portrays the powerful NPCs as capable of going against the monsters outside the wall, while the players are trying their best to survive. Now imagine...that among the players and the NPCs have anomalies such as abnormal personalities or defects etc. These anamolies causes complications within the society of NPCs and players and this complication arises from an unknown source. This becomes clear when compared to the monsters - which should be the anamoly - are not addressed.If the above analogy was not clear, another alternative analogy would to be think about this like the Matrix. And, just like the Matrix (the second one), they make a huge theme about anamolies in the system (i.e. Neo, the main character). Following this analogy, the story basically talks about the relation between players, NPCs and their anamolies.Character: Characters in the anime are very straight forward. This is even more so when looking into the two main characters. The main heroine is direct about her dreams and ambitions. In constrast, the main character is cynical and has lost his drive for living. Therefore, the two characters become an interesting dynamic duo where they influence each other with their conflicting personalities. Their interactions also influence other characters, in particular a specific set of characters.Art & Sound: The art of the anime is fitting for their surroundings, however the distinct differences between the two races (continuing from our analogy), players and NPCs, is a little cartoonish. The Opening fits the childish nature of the art.Overall: If you've read my score, and you have gone through this review, you can see why my rating is low. The reason why I did not go lower is because the particular tropes they used at first was interesting at first, but execution of said tropes was handled poorly. This is evident in the story section, where I have explained the premise of the story with two different analogies, but the catch is I didn't need to watch all 12 episodes to describe the story (I only needed 2!). Hence, the story quite predictable based on the first 2 episodes. Furthermore, the opening and ending share a light-hearted tone that conflicts with the more serious themes of the anime, however it does compliment the cartoonish nature of the characters.In conclusion, the anime had potential but it dropped off very quickly, and the inconsistency between the serious theme of the plot, opposed to the style of the animation, opening, ending and art does not mesh well together. Moreover, (bit of a spoiler!), the main focus of theme about anamolies is counter-intuitive when you compare it to the way the NPCs live. If you want to know more, you might want to watch the whole anime, but this particular point is what made me rate this anime as mediocre. that among the players and the NPCs have anomalies such as abnormal personalities or defects etc. These anamolies causes complications within the society of NPCs and players and this complication arises from an unknown source.

Not based in anything like manga or light novel or game, so it didn't pass through the popularity filter before getting green lit for animation.Taking that into account, I got to say that this is a very good anime series. It is quite hard for original series to have a good plot and good pace. At first it seemed like the usual isekai, only to have one revelation show up and throw everything you had accepted so far out of the window. It's up to the viewer to...see through the hole that has been opened before your eyes. If you peek, you might enjoy what you see.Plot wise, it was quite predictable after a certain episode mid point through the series but don't let this drive you away from it. It is quite enjoyable. It had many original elements in it, or usual elements applied quite creatively.There were some characters introduced in the first episode that I thought were gonna play a larger role in the series, but it wasn't. While their lack of screen time didn't affect my score for this series, it left me wondering how much potential this series might had if they were given more participation.Many questions has been left unanswered, but the studio had limited budget and time. Considering this was an original series probably made just to show off the capabilities of the studio (it is fairly new), those questions will be left unanswered for eternity with no second season or sequel planned.So... story wise, it was very good. Not your usual adventure series and had many plot twist that made it quite intriguing. Still, left me with many questions that might never be answered, so I give it an 8.Art: it is quite good. Drawings might not be everyone's favorite but they were acceptable to me. Nothing outstanding but not bad either. Animation was quite good too. Landscapes were beautiful many times. And the 3DCG was quite good. They really wanted to show off their 3DCG and I'm quite sure Production Committees will consider this studio for their projects.Sound: nothing outstanding but not bad either. Opening and Ending theme were very enjoyable. The opening is one of my favorites if not the 1st place. Gets you hyped up for an adventure.Characters: well, some of them didn't get proper development or enough screen time, others had plenty of story to be told, but given time and budget constraints, they might never get their background explained. Otherwise, they were quite good. I found Natsume relatable at times, especially at a certain episode (and you might identify it immediately as soon as you get there).Enjoyment: Very good, very good. As I have said before, the plot was predictable after episode 5 or 6, but I didn't know it was going to unfold in some unexpected ways. Actually It surprised me how it was actually executed. It exploited many things in a good way and gave me entertainment no other original anime series gave me in recent times. And I have just realized, there aren't that many original anime series that made me truly enjoy them.Overall, Deca-Dence is very good. Wish it had 13 episodes instead of 12 to explain some bits (no pun intended) or expand the lore a bit more but other than that, You might enjoy it. Give it a try and don't drop it, at least until you get past episode 4. see through the hole that has been opened before your eyes.

In a sea of \u200b\u200bfantasy works with watery aesthetics, Deca-Dence is a very well positioned lifeboat.It is not an innovative idea, far from it, this type of story exists in droves. But rhythm control and interactions elevate this relationship to much more than it could in twelve episodes. Natsume is the classic hopeful character that for many will not turn into anything, just for not having one arm. Kaburagi is the defeated hero, who was digested and slaughtered by the system, leaving only an empty shell. That...is why it is so beautiful and comforting to see the Natsume's influence on him. See him finding a purpose to get up again, and move on.The anime will be divided between characters who are completely resigned to everything and those who want to break with everything. Often a very antagonistic character ends up being infected by the ideas of another, and changes completely in the process. It is impressive the script's ability to make it impactful and meaningful to the story whenever it happens.Natsume turns the whole story upside down. And this is very interesting to follow.

I highly recommend you watch this anime. You will not regret it."", ""Straight to the point:STORY: For me it was the second best part of the anime, because the way they twisted the plot in the second episode without a single fear was incredible. The plot maintain a certain unique characteristic style which is: you never know what to expect because they already teared down every possibility. The whole construction of the decadence of a society was also simple but exciting, I mean, for an original anime, it makes clear what they want to point out with a simple story. (9/10)ART: This is a complicated point. I really like the cartoon based characters to show how was...the cyborgs and stuff but the way they put into the anime was kinda strange. The alternance between anime style and cartoon style wasn't so good because they're too discrepant from each other, which gave me kinda of feeling out of place. Maybe it was the colors or even the joint of both in the end, but I really felt uncomfortable. I understand why, but I didn't like it so much. (6/10)SOUND: This is the shortest part of my review because, aside from the opening and ending, the sound design and productions wasn't so clear. The sound and music never had an great impact until the last two episodes, which was for me a way to show that it was the end. I mean, when it comes to our mind of great sound and music design in a anime, we can even remember thee scenes where they were playing (Ex: L's Theme in Death Note). So it wasn't that good but it was fair comparing for what they showed to us. (6/10)CHARACTER: The best part of the show for sure. You really buy the idea and the personality of each character into the show, which shows to us that they were constantly developing all the characters that had even a slightest importance for the plot as a whole. Don't have much to say because I've enjoyed every single construction and was truly related to the motivation and reasons of the main characters. (10/10)ENJOYMENT: It was a truly and unexpected anime for me. Brilliant 'til the end and keeping the watchers, focused in every episode, constantly waiting for the next week to keep watching the show. The only and little problem for me, it was that they shouldn't let all the conclusion to the end, and felt bit rushed, but nothing that compromised the enjoyment or even the understanding of what we're expecting for the anime. (9/10)OVERALL: At the overall it was a great anime. Not a masterpiece tho, but it was that kinda anime you recommend for someone with especific genre choice, like it was that kinda of Pinterest flowcharts of recommendations. For sure it was for me the best anime from Summer Season, because they we're intringuing me since the beggining (and I'm not THAT into generic shonens like GoH) and maybe should appear on my list for the best of year (still not finded one the overpass Eizouken in quality).

After I had it recommended to me I picked it up and I was pleasently surprised by it.To get this out of the way, it is really nothing like Attack on Titan at all. While it shares aspects of the premise and movement system with AOT, the execution is completely different. This anime is fun, feel-good action anime that follows the rise of the main character (Natsume) as she finds the strength she always desired.It is kind of...similar to Gurren Lagann in that way. In fact, now that I think about it, it is similar to Gurren Lagann in a lot of ways. A character that learns to find the strength within themselves. A world that is not what it initially seems. The power of love and friendship saving the day. None of this is anything new, but it is a tried and true formula that does what it tries to do very well.That is the best way I can describe the anime. It doesn’t do anything new, but it does everything well. The art is really good and the fight animation was surprisingly well done (aside from the occasional CGI). The music was solid and got the job done. The characters are nothing new, but have their own motives and personalities that you can understand.The only real issue that I have with this anime is that it can be way too easy dor the characters to achieve goals that were made out to be impossible. Characters will go entire episodes saying that it is impossible to do something, only for it to be done with very minimal resistence. It is a little eye-rolling at times when it happens, but it isn’t bad enough to take away from the anime too much because it doesn’t take itself so seriously.When it’s all said and done, this is just a nice anime that you can enjoy as long as you go in not expecting something serious like Attack on Titan but with monsters.It’s a solid 7. similar to Gurren Lagann in that way.

The twist was so unexpected that some people began to drop it. Now just from the first episode itself, people might think it is a dupe of AoT/SnK. From my POV, if we take it as a whole – it's not. BUT, it is just as good!One of the things that makes me love and enjoyed this so much was the character development. I have to say that this anime has one of the most solid character...development, and it was done truly well. The protagonist was endearingly likable and has the sunny-disposition MC trope personality to counter the desolate nature of her mentor. I adore the relationship between these two because the studio really paid attention to that by the amount of screentime and fleshing out their character developments together.Talking about the story, I was completely absorbed because I do enjoy sci-fi and how they direct the plot. Some people do not enjoy twists, but I very much do. I love things that I cannot expect. Things fall into place as you go through the episodes. I did not feel any dissatisfaction as they didn't drag any parts just for the sake of filling the quota for an episode. One episode felt complete and not draggy, and this drives me to continue watching. It is also considered short as well, with only 12 episodes.TLDR; I really enjoyed this and the last episode ties the whole anime well by itself. There were some questions that can certainly be exploited and I take that as a small hope for another season. Overall, the finale did tie the premise completely, though it leaves room for a season 2 if the studio wanted to do so! How I loved this, that I even wished for more.

This one took me by surprise with it's original concept. In a year after year of repeated, rehashed concepts, this is a light refreshing anime that is lots of fun! Definitely give it a watch and I'm glad I saw it. If you've been tired of the same-old, same-old, give this a shot. You won't regret it.What I liked about it:Unique concept. In the far future humans live in a giant mobile city, that keeps them protected from creatures who constantly attack. Soldiers fight back using flying packs, and the two classes of citizens: Tanks and the Gadol, team up...to fight the creatures. The story comes from learning about the secrets of the two classes of citizens, and follows a girl named Natsume who wishes to be a soldier, who is taken under the wing by her boss, who see's potential in her.It's a kind-hearted story with loads of action and lots of fun, and a genuinely good time. And the concepts and art are unique. The tone reminds me a lot of Little Witch Academia, or Kill La Kill. So if you like those you will very likely enjoy this.

And the concepts and art are unique. The tone reminds me a lot of Little Witch Academia, or Kill La Kill. So if you like those you will very likely enjoy this. Definitely worth a shot."", 'Yes, this review contains spoilers (DUH)When watching ""Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld"", and Asuna waxes poetic over how great it is that her friends were willing to risk losing their avatars (which represent hours of work) to save the lives of AIs (basically, a newly minted sapient life form), and she effectively equates several hours of work with a human life, did you also feel like reaching through the monitor screen and punching her in the head?If yes, this anime is for you.Deca-dence is a reverse Isekai - it is the story of a post apocalyptic world, where the majority of surviving...humans are cyborgs (basically human brains in a brightly colored CGI shell),  except for a small population living in a mobile fortress called Deca-Dence. These \'true\' humans don\'t know about the existence of the cyborgs or anything else. Their fortress is under contant attack by \'Gadoll\' - giant monsters bent on its destruction (FYI, gadoll is Hebrew for \'big\').The reverse Isekai  comes in from the fact that the cyborgs create and pilot human avatars in Deca-Dence to fight the monsters and score points. It\'s a hugely popular game.Oh, did I mention that the monsters are created by the cyborgs to menace the human population, to create a storyline for the game.This anime faces all the questions that all the anime like Sword Art blithely skate past without acknowledging.  It doesn\'t really provide any answers, but that\'s ok - good SF should make the viewer think, not spoon feed them answers humans are cyborgs (basically human brains in a brightly colored CGI shell),  except for a small population living in a mobile fortress called Deca-Dence.

It really is an interesting anime surrounding the fact the anime is actually a sound rendition of Nick Bostrom\'s simulation argument. He argues if ""the fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one"", then it follows that we probably live in a simulation. Deca-dence is a simulation anime that is not quite isekai and yet provides a premise that philosophers want to know whether Sims have conscious experiences. Tankers overcrowded living condition makes me think about how Earth...is becoming overpopulated. This begets the question, is the Earth a simulation? Are we simulated Sims? Natsume being a bug in the simulated world has to be eliminated, but became friends with her eliminator Kaburagi. Their story to stop the unfairness of the world to make the world a better place, will it happen? Watch Deca-dence to find out!I highly recommend Deca-dence to everyone. is becoming overpopulated.
