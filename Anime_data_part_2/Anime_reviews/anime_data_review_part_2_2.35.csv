Koukaku Kidoutai Arise: Ghost in the Shell - Border:3 Ghost Tears,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19193/Koukaku_Kidoutai_Arise__Ghost_in_the_Shell_-_Border_3_Ghost_Tears,"['TRIVIA: The third episode of Arise is subtitled ""Ghost Tears"" because the franchise is presently balled in a corner weeping from the garbage juice squirted into its eyes.Preface: I usually don\'t bother to write reviews unless I find myself auto-forming a review in my head as I watch. This occurred during the third episode of Arise because the flaws are so glaring they jump out at you neatly wrapped; it almost feels like this review has been written for me and I\'m merely transcribing. Easy as transcribing is I still wouldn\'t post, unless what I saw which seemed so obviously godawful to me had yet...to be slandered as much as it deserved. So with 2 reviews on here ranging from mediocre to absolute perfection, here I am to commit abortion.Central Flaw: Motoko the pussy.The main draw of GITS, for me, has always been the Major. She\'s one of the best female characters in the medium, in any medium, and on her own merits. She can\'t be pigeonholed into any one trope, because she\'s a complex character dealing with massive global, political, and philosophical issues - but always tempers them with her own individual existential concerns. The diffracted nature of her personality is greatly needed to sell the concepts of the series, ie, how augmentation can change the self-hood we experience in relation to our bodies and consciousness. The Major is subversive in appearance and proclivities (scantily clad, domineering, bisexual in the manga and SAC) to the point of being intimidating in modern contexts, and this quickly sells us on the reality of the universe she inhabits with its changing values, moral codes, and opportunities. She\'s a fluid character in a fluid environment; in every iteration she\'s shown to fluctuate between loyalty to external forces and roguish self-actualization at the expense of others. In short, she\'s a great example of a strong female character precisely because she\'s so much more than just a strong female: she\'s unpredictable.And so it\'s a great pain to see her reduced to a hetero-normative cliche romance where she defers completely to a one-note, flat-out Bishounen who predictably betrays her. It\'s conceptually flawed, but the script is even worse: imagine if Ripley from Alien(s) was inserted into Bella\'s place in any given Twilight scene, and you\'d essentially have every romance scene in Ghost Tears.I understand that a prequel requires showing us characters when they weren\'t yet themselves, when they were foolish and idealistic and more vulnerable than we\'re used to seeing them. But the problem is we\'ve already seen this delicate spin on the Major in 2nd Gig, and the Kuze romance had substance, mostly because the related plot-line developed the Major in a significant way; the Ghost Tears romance develops young Motoko insomuch as she has a teen girl epiphany that love can be specious. The only signs of the old Major come in short bursts whenever someone pushes her over the edge, and in these misjudged scenes the Major is simplified to another extreme and becomes merely histrionic.Hurting the integrity of an iconic character is enough to make Arise a botched effort but its other sins seem almost endless:Flaw #2: The supporting cast becomes the ancillary cast.I understand there\'s only so much you can do in 60 minutes, but aside from seeing Motoko become Motoko, the novelty of Arise is that you get to see Section 9\'s recruitment. Or at least that used to be the marketing ploy of the OVAs, now I\'m not so sure. Each episode has just been a barrage of things happening which so happen to involve a future member of Section 9, so that after the climax we\'re treated to:Motoko: Hey, want to be on my team?Future member: Okay.There\'s no grandeur to them joining, they don\'t even seem to play major roles in the proceedings deserving of their recruitment. Togusa was the addition to the team this time around but if you asked me what he did that so demanded his involvement I couldn\'t tell you, because I can\'t remember anything he did.The characters being put into the periphery is more glaring in Ghost Tears because they\'re sidelined for the dull romance. But what really sets their writing apart as poor this time around is their reduction: the full extent of their presence in most scenes is the delivery of a signature character trait (e.g., Batou delivers sarcastic one-liners, Togusa mentions his Mateba, Paz talks about his relationship troubles). We\'ve seen all this before, across two different installments of the franchise, and by this point the characters are just self-referents winking at the audience.And the Logikoma got about one line. Why even add a moe-relief device to something with such a short run-time in the first place if you won\'t let them deliver?Flaw #3: Production integrity.The Oshii GITS films are some of the most beautiful traditional and digital animation, respectively, that you can ever hope to see. And although SAC had its problems (especially in the first season) with characters going off-model at inopportune times, the production integrity on an episode by episode basis was absolutely amazing for a 52-episode series. We don\'t get nearly the same level of craft in even 60 minutes of Arise, where characters go off-model so severely their heads seem to glide up and down on their necks like moeblob thermostats.And it\'s not even a budgetary concern because you can tell the budget was enormous, it\'s the fact the designs aren\'t sustainable for anything other than static close-ups. Coming off the heels of SAC, which had some of the best character designs in the franchise (and the industry as a whole), this is BS.Flaw #4: Convoluted garbage.It\'s a testament to what little I have to say about the plot when it\'s almost the last thing I address. I can\'t begin to tell you the specifics of anything that happened except for the various lazy twists slinged out toward the end that render your attention up to that point a wasted effort, because none of the specifics really amount to anything. So it\'s a good thing I barely paid attention. And this is not for lack of trying: the script is at ends with itself. It has no clue how to communicate to an audience visually or textually.The majority of scenes are people sitting around and talking - and this is somewhat of a staple in the franchise. GITS involves heavy exposition that mixes a lot of lingo and jargon together: corporate, philosophical, bureaucratic, political, technological, legal. The structure of SAC is usually a dense briefing followed by the actual meat of the episode, so if you phase out during these expository sequences you\'re screwed. But SAC and the films isolate these expository sequences between actual plot development, and they employ a lot of visual staging to guide your attention throughout. Ghost Tears is almost entirely exposition. There is no pacing, there are no deftly wrought symbols, there are no beautifully rendered settings, there is little to no actual directing involved. People talk, and they talk a lot, and they talk about things yet to be given a visual referent.Nothing that occurs outside of talking adds emphasis to the plot threads, because anything that isn\'t talking is mindless and random action sequences so wholly removed from relevance that they don\'t even feature human characterization. In one scene an innocent worker discovers he has a sort of explosive inside his prosthetic arms, and so to save everyone else from the impact Sec. 9 throws this dude\'s entire body down an elevator shaft with no remorse, no comment, no beat at all aside from complaining about the smoke. This could be intentional, but I can\'t imagine what the writers thought they were accomplishing: if the characters aren\'t involved in their surroundings to the point of having logical thoughts or feelings of accountability, why should I care about what\'s going on? It becomes a mere series of events. SAC and the films have characters doing what they do because of grounded motivations, and if they ever come to the point of allowing casualties for the greater good they have internal and external conflicts. So there\'s mindless violence on one end and needlessly dense exposition on the other end with no balance involved. I\'m left feeling like no single scene has impact on the other.There\'s nothing cohesive about the nuts and bolts of the script but there\'s also nothing cohesive about the themes underneath. Motoko yearns to feel human so she has romantic relations. Cool, but we\'ve seen this before and it\'s unrealistic to believe that anyone (but especially Motoko) would feel more human when engaging a partner so inhuman and boring. Other themes involve the difference between bodies and objects, losing track of identity when your body is switchable, etc., all cool, all done before in the franchise, all irrelevant to the actual plot of the OVA.I haven\'t even mentioned what the plot is. So what is the main plot? Something about water corporations. Riveting. Granted, the seedy underbelly of ostensibly benign corporations is an interesting concept, but the script doesn\'t allow you to consider this because it\'s handled with no mystery - a character appears on-screen and says I Work for Water. It\'s a shame the writing team didn\'t think to utilize this aspect of their script, just as they didn\'t think to utilize any other aspect of their script.Final flaw: the Kaworu dynamic.And we come full circle with the romantic interest. I can\'t remember what his name was so I\'ll refer to him as Kaworu, because that\'s essentially who he is, and his dynamic makes much less sense when not paired with a weak-willed character like Shinji, and instead with the diametrically hyper-willed Motoko. The chemistry with Kaworu makes no sense, and this is most evident in how Motoko is written as a completely different character in all of their Attack of the Clones-esque gallivanting.The conflict between the Major\'s sense of duty and sense of self can be easily grafted onto a romantic situation and, as I\'ve said before, already was in 2nd Gig to much greater effects precisely because it involved tragedy and schism. In Ghost Tears there is no conflict: the Major becomes weak willed and seems comfortable staying there until the story pulls her back out.Bonus flaw: the soundtrack.It sounded like Playstation-era shovelware techno BG music and the ending song with Sean Lennon (???) was the aural equivalent of dumping a tanker-truck of sand onto a gaping flesh wound.---It\'s ironic that a major visual theme (pretty much just an aesthetic choice with no depth at all) is water and water-related things, because this is essentially a watered down and pointless version of the franchise. Absolutely avoid it at all costs unless you enjoy watching stillbirths. to be slandered as much as it deserved. So with 2 reviews on here ranging from mediocre to absolute perfection, here I am to commit abortion.Central Flaw: Motoko the pussy.The main draw of GITS, for me, has always been the Major.

Absolutely avoid it at all costs unless you enjoy watching stillbirths.', 'Ghost Tears opens with Motoko making passionate love to her then-lover, Akira, later even featuring the two attending another couple’s wedding with Motoko wearing a rather promiscuous, alluring dress. Her colleagues, especially Batou, make fun of how fatuous and short-lasting this relationship is. How does Motoko respond? She hacks Batou’s prosthetic arms, again reminding him of how humiliating it is to be punched by your own fists.Being the third installment to the Ghost in the Shell Arise series, Ghost Tears is quite the bombshell. A sexy and assertive Motoko leads an investigation into a terrorist organization whose symbol is the Scylla, an ancient sea-monster....Meanwhile, given that the original Ghost in the Shell franchise only hinted at casually sexual relationships between Motoko and a few others, a great leap is taken to visually display Mokoto and Akira ""passing the time together."" And no, cyborg sex is just as crazy as it sounds.As the story progresses, Mokoto and Akira\'s relationship eventually blossoms into a romance. And while this new development may sound fun and gratifying, the romantic flavor in Ghost Tears bears a double-edged sword. For one, because previous installments of the franchise never mention much about Motoko’s romances, teasing dialogue about Motoko’s former relations with men can feel a bit unnatural. Although Motoko has indeed always had an enigmatic quality about her, seeing her supposedly fall in love with another person simply doesn\'t blend well with her exceedingly self-reliant personality. However, that is not to say the romance wasn’t fleshed out appropriately. In fact, Ghost Tears is brave in attempting this feat while exploring crucial parts to Motoko’s character: Should a cyborg as robotized as Motoko live as a human or as an object? Should she love another human with ease?These inquiries are hardly new to the franchise, after all. The original Ghost in the Shell (1995) portrays a mysterious and dystopian universe filled with questionings of the self, and Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig similarly spotlighted Motoko’s character feeling lost, uneasy, and insecure. However, Ghost Tears breaks away from the crowd by sacrificing the always rational, composed Motoko in lieu of a perhaps more humane and emotional depiction of Motoko. As a result, her struggles become a bit more relatable, but can also alienate some viewers due to their inconsistencies to Mokoto\'s depiction as a character in the rest of the franchise.In addition, the plot is also somewhat of a mixed bag. Similar to the first two parts of the Arise series, the mystery feels underwhelming mostly due to how little information is revealed, the loose pacing, and how quickly everything is pieced together. Akin to other installments of the Arise series, there’s hardly any thrill in its predictable manner of presenting a murder, some suspects, and then the resolve. In particular to Ghost Tears, the slow pacing for most of the movie is a rather different approach than the action-filled climax and beginning. And for some, this blend could come off as distasteful and chaotic.The animation has its highs and lows: for the most part, the action sequences are fluid and invigorating when there are exciting encounters. Moreover, the blue ocean scenery within Mokoto’s mental universe and the city backdrop capture great atmosphere depth. However, there are some fairly flawed and dreadful-looking illustrations of Motoko in certain scenes. Her character design and composure would look off-set, and this made the animation look very shaky at times. But hey, at least Motoko’s exposed body was drawn to be aesthetically pleasing and rather erotic in some scenes; so no complaints there. Complementing the art, the OST was used suitably, and the ED in particular ended on a chill, feel-good vibe that left the movie on a pleasant note.Recapturing the strangely charming aura of the original Ghost in the Shell (1995) while putting its own spin on Motoko\'s character, Ghost Tears is unique in its content but lackluster in its presentation: All in all a must-see for fans of the Arise series thus far.The third time’s the charm.

Almost.', ""So another GITS is here. This time we learn something new about Major's past and also about the legendary Section 9.I think this Arise series is getting better and better with every episode. I really enjoyed this one and I think it was the best on of Arise so far. I loved the thoughts about the cyberbodies, are they real bodies or just a things?This film contains again all the GITS stuff like hacking into other people's minds, problems with some body parts, super cool Motoko Kusanagi and of course all the other characters, logicomas etc.We can see again cyborgs and humans side by...side. The ending scene for example, Kusanagi talking to Togusa, A special trained full cyborg and a normal natural human almost like from a history, like he's not really from that age. And not only that scene. Although Motoko is a full cyborg and had a dark past, we can see her also falling in love in this episode, not in a normal way like we probably know from all the romantic films but still...Also one interesting scene about old people with a new lives with a new cyborg bodies, living again, getting married etc. Kinda interesting. side.

Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Border:3 Ghost Tears is the first Arise episode to show what the other ones lacked, Section 9 back in action, and this certainly works in favor of this new episode. This is what you should expect from this movie: a SAC style plot with the most intricate storyline so far in Arise,...SAC style action and operations starring all your favorite characters with their SAC personalities for the most part, for the first time since 2nd Gig the Major's romance, and some themes and references to the original film as well. Before I get into more detail, I have to say this was definitely my favorite of the Arise series so far, and I'm sure you will like this one if you enjoyed the last couple.I can imagine Ghost Tears being a little bit controversial to the long term fans of Ghost in the Shell. The reason is because Ghost Tears features something that has never really been especially prevalent before, which is romance. Ghost Tears has a romance between the redesigned Major and an original character called Akira Hose. This romance is very direct, mature, and at times a little bit cheesy but definitely more prevalent then the extremely subtle romance in GiTS and the little bit in 2nd Gig. I don't think it was a bad romance at all actually, in fact its making Arise stand out in its own way. Sure its cool to see all this SAC stuff again, but if I want SAC I'll go watch SAC. By having some original flair, this anime is able to call itself a true new incarnation of Ghost in the Shell. Akira Hose himself, is a pretty interesting original character. This is the first time Arise has succeeded at doing this. Although he is in a somewhat similar role, Akira Hose is not quite Hideo Kuze, he is much less of an egoist, must less of an idealist, much less imposing, and much more charming. If Hideo Kuze is a rock, Akira Hose is the water. Now, Akira Hose isn't exactly character of the year. He has one motivation and basically makes a misshapen beeline to achieve his objective while getting sidetracked by his Major love interest. A little bit predictable but a good addition to the cast dynamic which had already largely borrowed from a 12 year old anime.A little bit more specific will follow. Ghost Tear's plot revolves around a conspiracy involving an illegal weapons manufactor stationed in Japan sending weapons to a fictional arabic country so it can fight its arab spring and what not. Section 9 is called to investigate how they are smuggling these arms, what the arms are, and what the hell it has to do with the exploding dam across the road. Hell yeah, classic Section 9. So the plot had its own share of detail. It is more intricate than the first Arise, it has more plot twists, it does not sacrifice sense for suspense, and it was definitely better than the rather paper thin plot of Arise 2. I enjoyed it well, but that was just one part of this anime that made it a success. All members of Section 9 had their moments, not just Motoko. Batou wisecracks against the Major and gets hacked which was hilarious, and rips someones head off. Borma is still bald and Borma, he threw some innocent bomber to his grave in a action so swift and deadpan I wasn't sure if I should have cried or chuckled. Togusa's facial detail has somewhat gone down, but his personality has not. He uncovers most of the case in this episode, good going Togusa. Etc etc. So it was a pleasant surprise that characters got their due when they were neglected before.Plot was good, characters were fun, and the action was nice. Arise also has a couple things that are more aligned with the original GiTS (and 2nd GiG to a degree.) For example, Motoko reveals her complex (surprise) about her cyborg body and how she feels alive with it. This is something we see in GiTS obviously, but not in SAC to much of  degree. It was interesting, albeit not in the same league of depth GiTS goes to. I give them props for throwing in the Togusa's revolver joke too, that just kind of wrapped the references altogether.Music was underwhelming and unmemorable for the third time consecutively. Intro and ending music aside, theres nothing you will remember from this movie I am sure. If One Minute Warning and Stamina Rose can get stuck in your head theres no reason Arise can't do the same.The verdict is: it's good. I gave this episode a 7 not because there were any problems but just because it wasn't particularly outstanding in it succeeding categories. However, I am most definitely pleased with the anime I just watched, definitely the best Arise episode so far! SAC style action and operations starring all your favorite characters with their SAC personalities for the most part, for the first time since 2nd Gig the Major's romance, and some themes and references to the original film as well. Before I get into more detail, I have to say this was definitely my favorite of the Arise series so far, and I'm sure you will like this one if you enjoyed the last couple.I can imagine Ghost Tears being a little bit controversial to the long term fans of Ghost in the Shell. The reason is because Ghost Tears features something that has never really been especially prevalent before, which is romance. Ghost Tears has a romance between the redesigned Major and an original character called Akira Hose. This romance is very direct, mature, and at times a little bit cheesy but definitely more prevalent then the extremely subtle romance in GiTS and the little bit in 2nd Gig. I don't think it was a bad romance at all actually, in fact its making Arise stand out in its own way. Sure its cool to see all this SAC stuff again, but if I want SAC I'll go watch SAC. By having some original flair, this anime is able to call itself a true new incarnation of Ghost in the Shell. Akira Hose himself, is a pretty interesting original character. This is the first time Arise has succeeded at doing this. Although he is in a somewhat similar role, Akira Hose is not quite Hideo Kuze, he is much less of an egoist, must less of an idealist, much less imposing, and much more charming. If Hideo Kuze is a rock, Akira Hose is the water. Now, Akira Hose isn't exactly character of the year. He has one motivation and basically makes a misshapen beeline to achieve his objective while getting sidetracked by his Major love interest. A little bit predictable but a good addition to the cast dynamic which had already largely borrowed from a 12 year old anime.A little bit more specific will follow. Ghost Tear's plot revolves around a conspiracy involving an illegal weapons manufactor stationed in Japan sending weapons to a fictional arabic country so it can fight its arab spring and what not. Section 9 is called to investigate how they are smuggling these arms, what the arms are, and what the hell it has to do with the exploding dam across the road. Hell yeah, classic Section 9. So the plot had its own share of detail. It is more intricate than the first Arise, it has more plot twists, it does not sacrifice sense for suspense, and it was definitely better than the rather paper thin plot of Arise 2. I enjoyed it well, but that was just one part of this anime that made it a success. All members of Section 9 had their moments, not just Motoko. Batou wisecracks against the Major and gets hacked which was hilarious, and rips someones head off. Borma is still bald and Borma, he threw some innocent bomber to his grave in a action so swift and deadpan I wasn't sure if I should have cried or chuckled. Togusa's facial detail has somewhat gone down, but his personality has not. He uncovers most of the case in this episode, good going Togusa. Etc etc. So it was a pleasant surprise that characters got their due when they were neglected before.Plot was good, characters were fun, and the action was nice. Arise also has a couple things that are more aligned with the original GiTS (and 2nd GiG to a degree.) For example, Motoko reveals her complex (surprise) about her cyborg body and how she feels alive with it. This is something we see in GiTS obviously, but not in SAC to much of  degree. It was interesting, albeit not in the same league of depth GiTS goes to. I give them props for throwing in the Togusa's revolver joke too, that just kind of wrapped the references altogether.Music was underwhelming and unmemorable for the third time consecutively. Intro and ending music aside, theres nothing you will remember from this movie I am sure. If One Minute Warning and Stamina Rose can get stuck in your head theres no reason Arise can't do the same.The verdict is: it's good. I gave this episode a 7 not because there were any problems but just because it wasn't particularly outstanding in it succeeding categories. However, I am most definitely pleased with the anime I just watched, definitely the best Arise episode so far!"", 'Themes:Evolution of Section 9.Are we our bodies?  Are our bodies just a tool?  If our bodies are a tool, then what are we, a soul?The power of an idea, the hero as idea/meme (hearkening back to the concept of Stand Alone Complex)How a ""full human"" fits in a cyborg world....Loss, what happens after a tragedy.We see a much more sensual Major in this, and after seeing this, it makes sense why Major was never one for much romance.Speaking of Major, there are some sweet scenes in the cyber world, with some moderate fanservice, but this reminds me of how much less fanservice there is overall in this series compared to others.The thing that grated me watching this episode was the multiple versions of Major and other characters.   Sometimes you would see multiple versions of the same person in a single shot.  It\'s like one animator started the first half of the scene, then someone else with a slightly different style finished it.The fact that black market underground trading is providing so many plot points feels a bit underwhelming to me.  I can only say ""meh"", and hope they end up writing diverse stories.

And the lowest rating on MyAnimeList. I\'ll use that to support my observation. But still that advantage is so slight that I\'m not even sure if it was better than the first episode. My main reasoning for this is that it turns the focus away from being a detective thriller back towards world building and character development. This means Arise is getting closer to that chemistry that made Stand Alone Complex such a winner. This comes at a somewhat unnecessary cost, however, when the actual action-centric...climax of the movie is significantly limper than the previous two. Though at that point it seems like they were limited by the expected running time. I continue to like teen Makoto less and less, but at the same time she becomes a more fleshed out character. She\'s still off-putting in her childish arrogance which clashes heavily with her professionalism and alleged experience and intelligence.In this episode most of her transgressions revolve around her attachment to her latest boyfriend, a guy that immediately gives off mad serial killer vibes and everyone instantly realizes he\'s obviously suspicious but Makoto irrationally defends him and breaks protocol multiple times for her own self-satisfaction regarding the case. On the other hand, some of Makoto\'s background and way of thinking is actually touched upon here. She\'s often used as a borderline ""anonymous"" character, so these moments are rare. She talks about how she feels swapping bodies and trying to hold on to the sensation of being a human after becoming a cyborg as a child. It\'s insightful to her character but also the setting, as we see more personal ways people cope with the changing world - one of the things nearly lost in Arise that makes it less engaging than previous installments. That\'s where it gets ironic and shallow, when a concept about retaining individuality as the world moves closer to a singularity is reworked into a story that\'s so concerned with being stylish entertainment that it forgets to look at the individual. Even still, these moments feel all too brief and familiar for Ghost in the Shell, so they aren\'t touching the franchise\'s previous levels of insight.These personal scenes are overshadowed by the same investigational action thriller style of the previous episodes. On that front, Ghost Tears\'s plot seems more obtuse and aggravating to follow. There are so many factions referenced in this conspiracy that have no inherently logical, direct link to each other that keeping the arbitrary relations straight is more work than usual. Water plants, prosthetic developers, a previously unmentioned separatist war - goddamn, chill out. Togusa becomes more involved in this episode, not so much as he deserves - again, he adds that personal touch to the cast as the most ""normal"" member. But, Arise shows it\'s able to do a much better job at utilizing the entirety of the standard Section 9 members than previous entries. There\'s still an obvious hierarchy of importance among them, but giving them more lines and involvement in the investigation still goes along way to making them feel like actual team members rather than sidekicks. Ghost Whispers predictably continues in the same direction as the rest of Arise, but the added touch of drama shows that the creators still have it in them to make something true to Ghost in the Shell\'s pedigree - they just haven\'t actually realized it yet. climax of the movie is significantly limper than the previous two.

Rife with action, great science, and some interesting bits of character development, it’s been a highly successful attempt at rekindling interest in the series for both established fans and newcomers alike. Ghost Tears, the recently released third episode, continues the false memory storyline of the first two episodes while giving us another pretty good case that the newly formed Section 9 must solve. Terrorists are blowing up politicians and facilities dealing with water. These terrorists...are being traced back to a hacker during the war prior to the series, and this hacker is someone whom Motoko killed back then. So are these people his proteges? Meanwhile, Motoko is having a spicy romance with a man in the prosthesis industry and things are looking good for the duo.Once again we have another interesting and complex case, along with some background story and this bad guy called the Firestarter who is implanting false memories in people. In that regard, we can see a lot of Stand Alone Complex‘s influence wherein a main thread is weaved in with individual cases. It’s interesting and keeps you watching and waiting for the next one. This episode also gives us a deeper glimpse into some of the characters, especially Motoko, and is also dabbling with the idea of cybernetic bodies becoming real human bodies; that “What is human?” question that is central theme of the series. Despite that, there’s still the problems that pervaded the first two episodes. The animation is pretty bad (see the above picture) and the music isn’t all that great either.I can look past these few problems though and see that this is an enjoyable return to the Tokyo of GitS. It’s still accessible enough that newcomers will enjoy it and still complex enough to interest old fans.There’s one more episode to go and the previews are shaping it up to be pretty awesome (in fact, it looks a lot like Stand Alone Complex).

Proceed at your own discretion!Reviewing OVA can be tricky at times due to their highly condensed materials. Thus it only make sense that there will be slightly different evaluating criteria for them compared to the common anime.Mai-Otome 0~S.ifr~ is the prequel to the popular Mai-Otome series produced by Sunrise. This OVA elaborates (in great depth) about the origin of many things which results in Mai-Otome including the origins of the Blue Sky Sapphire GEM, Schwartz, Aswad,...the Garderobe Academy, and the hidden connection between Mai HiME and Mai-Otome. Therefore it should be no brainer that one should watch Mai-Otome before watching 0~S.ifr~.Story:The one department where this OVA really shines. Thanks to the mysteries left behind by its predecessor, 0~S.ifr~ had much to cover (and fans were expecting nothing less). While the 3 episodes combine to roughly 80 minutes in length, the amount of materials it covered was extremely impressive. Each event in the story was well executed and planned in advance (not some random event out of the blue). Of course, in order to fully understand the topics in the OVA, one is required to have backgrounds from Mai-Otome AND Mai HiME.Art:The animation quality is still the area which needs improvement on. As a product of 2008, the animation level is definitely not the best that Sunrise could have produced. There were not much differences (if any) between the animation quality from Mai HiME (2004) to 0.~S.ifr~.Sound:All three endings were sang by Minami Kuribayashi (Erstin Ho in Mai-Otome). Minami also sang a large portion of Mai HiME and Mai-Otome\'s theme songs, so any Mai series fan should have been accustom to her voice by now.One interesting point viewer might notice when watching 0~S.ifr~ is style to the music sound entirely different from the previous Mai metaseries. That is because 0~s.ifr~\'s music was not written by the popular musican Kajiura Yuki, instead the music this time is provided by the less well knownKuniaki Haishima.Character voice (CV) should also be a point of interest in 0~S.ifr~ because of the great casts of talented seiyu.1. Ami Koshimizu, CV of Sifr Blan, mother of Nina Wang. Ami Koshimizu has voice acted in numerous popular series, including Kallen in Code Geass, Horo in Spice and Wolf, Nina in Mai-Otome, etc.2.

The story is balanced with both deep and comedic moments, and is filled with action-packed scenes.Like the other Mai-Otome series, the art is the same. There is little CG effects.

Much like how the baby-boomer generation are able to enjoy ABBA only after &ldquo;growing up with it&rdquo;, you can only appreciate these later OVA entries in the franchise if you've been groomed into a state of meek compliance by its more charismatic forbears. If you were to just pick it off a shelf and watch it without this crucial requirement of already being a fan of its origin, then you...will find it to be a tedious and puerile pile of crap. But there are those of us who were enamored by Mai HiME, which actually had the entertainment assets to bring in a fresh audience and then whip them into a bunch of frenzied addicts by pulling what I still consider to be the most ambitious/desperate direction change in a show ever: from a frivolous high-school comedy to a heart-wrenching melodrama. The following series, Mai Otome was another worthwhile addendum to the franchise. But we are now on the second OVA series set in the Mai Otome universe, and it's becoming clear that the three episodes of Sifr had to tap into the last dregs of potential left in the &ldquo;Mai&rdquo; pedigree. With that said, you'll understand that the only way to make this OVA series worthwhile is by being a fan of the previous works. It's a prequel, so obviously there's benefit in knowing all the background story, but more importantly, if you're a fan of the franchise you'll still be able to appreciate the style and tone prevalent in Sifr, even though it now lacks the edge to bring in new viewers.But a show doesn't need edge to be entertaining. If you know what to expect from an Otome OVA, then you should be able to extract some fun from this. The usual approach of having a bloated cast of cute and sexy (definitely leaning more toward the sexy type this time, which is a shame because I'd rather more girls like my beloved Arika!) girls and a story that juggles both action and some dramatic subplots is still applied. It's just that, with only the space of 3 episodes to work with, and almost no appearances from established characters, the OVA struggles to make any of its array of characters feel worthwhile or in any way memorable. I mean, sure the character designs were as cute and unique as ever, and they were vital enough with their lines, but they just didn't get enough material to really give them presence. No one was fleshed out or had enough screentime to leave a mark or have their idioms/personalities remembered. Because the plot had to move so fast, and because the episodes had such sparse release dates, it was more like seeing disjointed flashes of the characters and they all ultimately burr together into a mess of moe.Sifr, the lead character, essentially felt like Arika from the Otome TV series without the clumsy moe-appeal. Rena Sayers was soft-spoken and unnaturally guilt-ridden about her powers, but I didn't find her interesting at all. Most people would agree that her two points of interest rest firmly on her chest, one of which is delightfully exposed in the final episode (which gives it a lower nipple count that Zwei). The character I was most interested in had less than a handful of lines. Sakura has a really amazing character design and I was really intrigued by her mysterious role in the show. Her inclusion seems to be just a hook to lead into a  following OVA series, if there will be one. I suppose it worked too, because I would watch another OVA just for her. The villainous force was pretty much laughable, although M9 was a lethal foe whenever she was thrust into battle.And speaking of battles, there was a lot more action-based excitement than in previous series, especially in the final episode, where the banked animation budget was pillaged to deliver a fast and furious duel between the two opposing superpowers in the series: Rena Sayers and M9. The immense power of any androids in the 'Mai' franchise has always struck me as kind of bizarre, as though being made of metal and alloy entitles you to limitless abilities and power &ndash; why not just do away with Otome and build royal android bodyguards? But M9 provided the only test of Rena's powers and the result was actually quite spectacular, even with the slight DBZ feel. Any battle that spans more than one atmosphere and involves more than one re-entry has gotta be good! The action quota in this series was certainly fulfilled, and the animation was there to back it up, even if there are some obvious shortcuts in places to save the cel count (like teleportation). As with the other series, the detail in the cel animation is quite low, but this enables the studio to keep things consistent and curtail potential moments of QUALITY. Perhaps the reason they seemed to have plenty to spend on the animation is due to their cutting off of Yuki Kajiura from the musical lineup. She has done the score music for every other entry in the franchise, so this is a pretty big change. Fortunately, I'm not a big Kajiura fan so I wasn't altogether bothered by the switch to an unknown for the musical score. About half of the score music was strikingly familiar, which made me feel like the whole score was just lifted from other movie/tv scores and tweaked a bit. But nonetheless, the music did the job almost well enough and, at the very least, it wasn't awful to the point of vexation.So the production was like the rock of the series &ndash; the only thing that was solid and reliable. The plot, on the other hand, was more like a face-full of gravel &ndash; a painful mess. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a case of severe over-ambition. We have a group (or just one?) of writers who envisioned 26 episodes worth of plot and couldn't bring themselves to simplify it when it came to the crunch and it had to be crammed into about 80 minutes of anime time. By the time it got to the end of the show, I had given up almost entirely. There was something about a weaver, which is dangerously powerful. Rena has a mysterious power, or it may have not been mysterious and I simply failed to pay attention well enough to miss the bullet-speed explanations. There was too much going on with all the characters, for any one of their subplots to have any satisfying conclusion (or even a middle or beginning), and the main plot lacked momentum in its confusion.The result is a colourful series with cute characters, some pretty fun action scenes, and not much else. For interested fans, there are still sprinklings of references to Mai HiME, hinting at a connection between the universes, but it's clear now that that won't be taken anywhere. More importantly, the 'Mai' formula just feels tired now, without humour and dramatic impact. Hell, Sifr didn't even have much fanservice (although Eri being stripped down to her cat-ears and panties in episode 2 was pretty good, and I suppose there was quite a lot if you count the incredibly cute maid outfits as fanservice). Thankfully, it did have the requisite amount of yuri undertones for a &ldquo;Mai&rdquo; series though, and the scene where Eri was trying to get a kiss out of Rena while the others gossiped behind a couch was one of my favourite scenes. I definitely preferred Zwei to this, because it already had that established cast and story to work with, and because the pacing was more relaxed. will find it to be a tedious and puerile pile of crap. But there are those of us who were enamored by Mai HiME, which actually had the entertainment assets to bring in a fresh audience and then whip them into a bunch of frenzied addicts by pulling what I still consider to be the most ambitious/desperate direction change in a show ever: from a frivolous high-school comedy to a heart-wrenching melodrama. The following series, Mai Otome was another worthwhile addendum to the franchise. But we are now on the second OVA series set in the Mai Otome universe, and it's becoming clear that the three episodes of Sifr had to tap into the last dregs of potential left in the &ldquo;Mai&rdquo; pedigree. With that said, you'll understand that the only way to make this OVA series worthwhile is by being a fan of the previous works. It's a prequel, so obviously there's benefit in knowing all the background story, but more importantly, if you're a fan of the franchise you'll still be able to appreciate the style and tone prevalent in Sifr, even though it now lacks the edge to bring in new viewers.But a show doesn't need edge to be entertaining. If you know what to expect from an Otome OVA, then you should be able to extract some fun from this. The usual approach of having a bloated cast of cute and sexy (definitely leaning more toward the sexy type this time, which is a shame because I'd rather more girls like my beloved Arika!) girls and a story that juggles both action and some dramatic subplots is still applied. It's just that, with only the space of 3 episodes to work with, and almost no appearances from established characters, the OVA struggles to make any of its array of characters feel worthwhile or in any way memorable. I mean, sure the character designs were as cute and unique as ever, and they were vital enough with their lines, but they just didn't get enough material to really give them presence. No one was fleshed out or had enough screentime to leave a mark or have their idioms/personalities remembered. Because the plot had to move so fast, and because the episodes had such sparse release dates, it was more like seeing disjointed flashes of the characters and they all ultimately burr together into a mess of moe.Sifr, the lead character, essentially felt like Arika from the Otome TV series without the clumsy moe-appeal. Rena Sayers was soft-spoken and unnaturally guilt-ridden about her powers, but I didn't find her interesting at all. Most people would agree that her two points of interest rest firmly on her chest, one of which is delightfully exposed in the final episode (which gives it a lower nipple count that Zwei). The character I was most interested in had less than a handful of lines. Sakura has a really amazing character design and I was really intrigued by her mysterious role in the show. Her inclusion seems to be just a hook to lead into a  following OVA series, if there will be one. I suppose it worked too, because I would watch another OVA just for her. The villainous force was pretty much laughable, although M9 was a lethal foe whenever she was thrust into battle.And speaking of battles, there was a lot more action-based excitement than in previous series, especially in the final episode, where the banked animation budget was pillaged to deliver a fast and furious duel between the two opposing superpowers in the series: Rena Sayers and M9. The immense power of any androids in the 'Mai' franchise has always struck me as kind of bizarre, as though being made of metal and alloy entitles you to limitless abilities and power &ndash; why not just do away with Otome and build royal android bodyguards? But M9 provided the only test of Rena's powers and the result was actually quite spectacular, even with the slight DBZ feel. Any battle that spans more than one atmosphere and involves more than one re-entry has gotta be good! The action quota in this series was certainly fulfilled, and the animation was there to back it up, even if there are some obvious shortcuts in places to save the cel count (like teleportation). As with the other series, the detail in the cel animation is quite low, but this enables the studio to keep things consistent and curtail potential moments of QUALITY. Perhaps the reason they seemed to have plenty to spend on the animation is due to their cutting off of Yuki Kajiura from the musical lineup. She has done the score music for every other entry in the franchise, so this is a pretty big change. Fortunately, I'm not a big Kajiura fan so I wasn't altogether bothered by the switch to an unknown for the musical score. About half of the score music was strikingly familiar, which made me feel like the whole score was just lifted from other movie/tv scores and tweaked a bit. But nonetheless, the music did the job almost well enough and, at the very least, it wasn't awful to the point of vexation.So the production was like the rock of the series &ndash; the only thing that was solid and reliable. The plot, on the other hand, was more like a face-full of gravel &ndash; a painful mess. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a case of severe over-ambition.

Mononogatari 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54883/Mononogatari_2nd_Season,"[""It's a crying shame that zero review has been written for this season of Mononogatari so far, so here I am.It continues right where they left off at the end of the first season and doesn't skip a beat.  So those who missed the previous 12 episodes won't be able to enjoy much of what 2nd season offers, and there are plenty.Mononogatari brings a pretty decent entertainment value with right amount of mixture of supernatural, folklore and creative action.  Sprinkled with dry humor, character growth of the MC (who was as stiff and boring as a piece of plywood in...the first half of season 1) and subtle development of romance between the two protagonists, the show has been a revelation.Now with 5 episodes to go and the final conflict just about to boil over, try not to blink...  Oh and the OP is such a banger.There you have it, my 1st MAL review short & sweet. the first half of season 1) and subtle development of romance between the two protagonists, the show has been a revelation.Now with 5 episodes to go and the final conflict just about to boil over, try not to blink...

I like to think of it as a poor man’s JJK with less gore and worse animation, but a way better story. If you’re into occult and supernatural fantasies with well written characters and a genuinely intriguing plot, this is the one for you.What Mononogatari lacks in animation quality it makes up for in writing. As I’ve said time and again, I can tolerate poor animation if it’s substituted for a good story and they nail it here.Season 2, which feels like more of a second cour rather than a...completely new season, builds on the firmly established characters and lore from the first 12 episodes. Hyoma’s development continues to be impressive and the season focuses on his evolving relationship with Botan and the bridal trousseau.For me, this is where the show really shined. Hyoma came off as a really edgy and hateful person in the beginning of the story. Over the first season we saw him start opening his mind and accepting that his biases and prejudices against Tsukumogami were misplaced. Admitting that you were wrong is a hard thing to do and is truly the sign of a mature person. This season takes things further with him not just being open to that possibility, but fully embracing his position as a resident of the Nagatsuki estate. His relationship with Botan and the others goes from one of necessity, to a genuine familiar bond.This season is also where we really start to see the overarching narrative of the story take shape. Season 1 was good, but a bit disjointed at times story wise. Some episodes felt very monster of the week-y, whereas in this one it’s gradually becomes clear who the real antagonist(s) are culminating in a very satisfying and emotional final battle. Sadly, it feels like the anime ended right as the story was really getting going and I could really go for another season.The animation is the elephant in the room when it comes to Mononogatari. It’s not very good. Frankly, some of the fight scenes feel so lifeless and devoid of energy. It’s hard to really get into them. Luckily, this isn’t really a show that relies on that. Yea, there’s the big fight in the last 4 or so episodes of the show, but it’s a character driven story about accepting loss, forgiving yourself and opening yourself up to others. The supernatural action stuff is just a bonus for me so I’m not going to knock it severely for that.Mononogatari is a very solid watch that I think would surprise a lot of people if they gave it a watch. Yes, the mc looks like a dollar store Eren. But he’s much more than that and you’ll quickly find yourself falling in love with these characters.

The main aspect is mainly around using the power, growing it to fight different guys with power and then ending up as the best. But rarely do we ever get the chance to actually do more with it. Despite the stupid idea of because people believe it then it exists, Mononogatari has always been capable of building up on the supernatural in a very fulfilling way.When I started the first season of this anime, I didnt expect to enjoy it to the point of wanting a 3rd season...or looking forward to the next episode so badly.

Apparently...yes and no.Mangaka Onigunsou's anime adaptation continues where we left off with Part 1 back in Winter, and I'm not gonna lie, it felt like a work that was awfully dated by the time the anime adaptation came out almost a full decade since the start of the manga (almost 9 years to be precise). The story of spirits crossing over to the human world and possessing objects to gain its physical form to become tsukumogami, and a boy whose life was scarred by the evil ones so much...that to try living with a tsukumogami-laden family to learn his control of hatred. That was the evolution of the main protagonist Hyoma Kunato, the son of the Kunato Saenome faction and his relationship with the young woman that would change his life forever: Botan Nagatsuki of the Nagatsuki House of tsukumogami, being possessed by a marebito that's the target of all Saenome factions.It's safe to say that Part 2 here will feel more of the same if you have seen Part 1 back in Winter, so if the anime didn't grasp your attention from the get-go, then you can stop reading this review here. For the few who did venture out for more of what's to come, Part 2 basically ups the ante of the relationship between Hyoma and Botan, as well as the various groups and enemies that become a major factor of the show as it wears on. Hyoma, at this point, still wears his hatred of tsukumogami on the heart of his sleeve, though thanks to Botan, aside from the various giggles that their relationship is taken to the next level, he becomes better at his craft of mastering the ways of the Saenome, as well as learning to trust the family, which in turn, acts as the Nagatsuki Bridal Trousseau against the evil-doers who thwart their path onto unleashing Botan's marebito capability as the god of all tsukumogami and spirits.Of course, the action accompanies the intensity of facing new characters like the Bureau of Traditional Music through Tsumabiki, Fukie and Tsuzumi, as well as the paper umbrella tsukumogami that have their sights on Botan, as well as Hyoma for getting revenge on them for the killing of his well-capable siblings at a young age. The good thing is that with Botan being the target, there is the fear mongering that she is truly in danger as Hyoma and the Nagatsuki House fight to keep her survival against strong enemies, but that is coupled with the same production values that follow from Part 1, though it feels polished, albeit with the same inconsistencies that's the case for Bandai Namco Pictures's standards.Other than that, the OST for Part 2, it was a downgrade over what Part 1 had with ARCANA PROJECT's somewhat good OP and TRUE's beautiful ED, replacing it with Megatera Zero's somewhat fitting Shonen-feelish OP and Azusa Tadakoro's low-key feel good-ish ED.Even after another season of Mono-NO-gatari, am I convinced that mangaka Onigunsou's work is good? Probably not, it's just as forgettable as Part 1 comes, though even with the heavy action of Part 2 that delivers big time as a redemption arc of sorts, the entire product still feels mediocre at best. I've said in my review of Part 1 that if this show's anime adaptation would've come a lot earlier, say the mid to late 2010s, it would at least have a cult following, but in 2023 where tropes have been repeated to soulless repetition, I'm sorry to say that Mono-NO-gatari just didn't really stand out amongst the crowded pack of AniManga.It definitely is a redemption of an ugly duckling, but still, this certainly, and cohesively, is no swan. that to try living with a tsukumogami-laden family to learn his control of hatred.

Their dynamic remains the emotional core of the series, resonating with viewers on a personal level.Mononogatari's unique approach to incorporating Japanese folklore into its narrative continues to be a strong point. Each spirit encounter draws from a wellspring of cultural mythology, showcasing the producers' commitment...to authenticity.

One notable drawback is the pacing. While the slow burn approach can be effective in building tension, at times it leads to episodes that feel stretched thin. This pacing issue occasionally tempers the show's momentum, detracting from its overall impact.Additionally, the introduction of side characters proves to be a double-edged sword. While some of them inject fresh energy into the story, others feel underdeveloped and distract from the main narrative.

But for a summary of my feelings on the first season: Mononogatari is a solid show with a wonderful cast of characters, good writing and an interesting plot and power system which is sorely let down by its overall art and animation. That, and it fails to stand out in a sea of anime and manga about secret or public organisations...fighting with and/or against malevolent spiritual beings living and sometimes working among the populous of which greats such as JJK and Chainsaw Man are a part of and lead the pack.The story continues with Hyouma learning to be a little less angry and racist towards Tsukumogami as he lives with them and learns from them in his task to protect Botan and the sealed god within her. Unfortunately, sweet doki-doki moments the two of them awkwardly share, usually to the delight (or frustration in Yuu’s case) of the Bridal Trousseau members, can’t last forever as the nemesis Hyouma has been hunting for to take revenge for the murder of his brother and sister is about to make its move.This season's primary focus was on Botan and Hyouma’s relationship. I like Hyouma’s straightforward, honest yet, completely dense personality which has opened up throughout the story and even works to subvert a lot of Shonen-battle story tropes. Botan is also well-fleshed out this season. Her status as this ticking time bomb anomaly is slowly reformed amongst hard-stance exorcists as they come to realise that she's just an adorable marshmallow who's trying her best and isn’t defined by the malevolent god sealed in her.I also enjoyed the introduction of the new Tsukumogami faction, the Bureau of Traditional Music and their eccentric personalities as they live only for rock and roll. They’re very funny and their philosophy leads to a very interesting turn of events.Like season one, the animation is unfortunately the main factor that holds Mononogatari back. The art can waver between looking good or flat and bland with character's faces falling off-model. There are times when the animation can look fine, sometimes even good, but fights sometimes lack the weight, energy and frames needed to pull off a satisfying brawl. Overall it’s subpar.Malevolent Spirits: Mononogatari has the potential to be an 8 or even a 9 out of 10 if it wasn’t held back by its production. I suppose it depends on how much you value animation over a story, but whilst its story is great Mononogatari is the kind of show that needed some “Oomf” in its animation to get people turning heads. I’d understand if you’re someone who looked at Mononogatari and brushed it aside, but if you have some space on your watch list, I recommend giving it a chance.7/10 Good. fighting with and/or against malevolent spiritual beings living and sometimes working among the populous of which greats such as JJK and Chainsaw Man are a part of and lead the pack.The story continues with Hyouma learning to be a little less angry and racist towards Tsukumogami as he lives with them and learns from them in his task to protect Botan and the sealed god within her. Unfortunately, sweet doki-doki moments the two of them awkwardly share, usually to the delight (or frustration in Yuu’s case) of the Bridal Trousseau members, can’t last forever as the nemesis Hyouma has been hunting for to take revenge for the murder of his brother and sister is about to make its move.This season's primary focus was on Botan and Hyouma’s relationship. I like Hyouma’s straightforward, honest yet, completely dense personality which has opened up throughout the story and even works to subvert a lot of Shonen-battle story tropes. Botan is also well-fleshed out this season. Her status as this ticking time bomb anomaly is slowly reformed amongst hard-stance exorcists as they come to realise that she's just an adorable marshmallow who's trying her best and isn’t defined by the malevolent god sealed in her.I also enjoyed the introduction of the new Tsukumogami faction, the Bureau of Traditional Music and their eccentric personalities as they live only for rock and roll. They’re very funny and their philosophy leads to a very interesting turn of events.Like season one, the animation is unfortunately the main factor that holds Mononogatari back. The art can waver between looking good or flat and bland with character's faces falling off-model. There are times when the animation can look fine, sometimes even good, but fights sometimes lack the weight, energy and frames needed to pull off a satisfying brawl. Overall it’s subpar.Malevolent Spirits: Mononogatari has the potential to be an 8 or even a 9 out of 10 if it wasn’t held back by its production. I suppose it depends on how much you value animation over a story, but whilst its story is great Mononogatari is the kind of show that needed some “Oomf” in its animation to get people turning heads.

The anime seems to have a vendetta against the mere thought of letting Hyoma even think about cooking. Episode after episode he has done nothing but be angry and get his salad tossed.

I'll refrain from spoilers in this review.The story is the weakest point of the special. The episode is divided into two parts. The first part is wonderfully cute, and I am a sucker for cute romances, and I straight away rated it 10. There are a few cliche shojo scenes and I went kyaaah in he first half. But then there's the second part too, which is a...bit boring. Thus the 7/10 score.Art is as usual. Morioka-san is darn cute and so is Lily-san. That's a plus.Sound is terrific. The special uses the original OP and ED of the anime, and they are really good.Nothing much to say about the character. Sakurai is great as the shy boyfriend, and Morioka, is just goddamn cute. I'd give anything to get her in real life.Overall I'll rate this special 8. Why? Because it's damn good. Most of the anime specials are just extra episodes but this one is actually a sequel. You get more of the cute romance of the couple and some pretty doki doki going shojo moments in the first half. I'd have given it a 9 if not for the second half. It just seems like an afterthought and my hopes further got dashed when the bikini costume wasn't used(insert evil grin).So, should you watch it? Absolutely YES.

Still, it was a good episode and a great closure to the anime, instead of leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth from the main anime, I managed to rinse my mouth with this OVA, making me remember this anime in a slightly fonder light.

Not only did Moriako and Sakurai became even in visiting each other’s houses, but they got to experience Fruits de Mer with each other irl, too!

It was a bit too long, and more stupid than any of the other subplots the actual anime had :’) It was great to watch, tho, haha.

The whole thing is basically Morioka wanting to upgrade her pc and Sakurai offering her a hand at that. So they spend the entire episode upgrading the rig and building it.

I loved watching the characters make relationships with one another both in and out of the MMO game they play together. It is a bit amusing to me that the characters play as the opposite sex, because that’s a super common thing...to do as a queer person. But, since this show had straight romance, that’s besides the point. This show highlighted what it feels like to be emotionally connected to people that you aren’t sure you will ever meet face-to-face and how close people can become despite that.

Lodoss-tou Senki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/207/Lodoss-tou_Senki,"[""Of all the Anime series that I have viewed, Record of Lodoss War holds a special place in my heart.  If you happen to be fond of fantasy adventure videogames as I am (or great literature such as J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings), then this 13-episode video series is a very clever hybrid of these two great works of art. It's got everything fans could ask for--dragons, elves, dark gods, unlikely yet compelling heroes, villains you'll either hate (or love, depending on who you side with), action, suspense, romance, a small dose of humor, and an engaging feel to keep on watching...by the time each episode ends.This is a direct-to-video animation series produced back in 1990, which unfolds over thirteen half-hour episodes. Adapted from the fantasy novels of the same name by Japanese author Ryo Mizuno, Lodoss is a classic good-vs-evil story, exploring the chronicles of six adventurers: these include Parn, a young, inexperienced warrior eager to (literally) jump at any chance to clear his father's tarnished name; Deedlit, a spunky, mystical high elf who tries (with varying degrees of success) to prove her love to Parn; Etoh, a loyal, good-natured cleric; Slayn, a gentle wise mage; Ghim, a gruff and tough dwarf; and Woodchuck, a wanted criminal who nonetheless provides loyalty (and occasional chagrin) to his pals.The story is hardly original, and the plot tends to &quot;jumps around&quot; from one event to the next (for instance, the first episode starts off in the &quot;middle&quot; of the heroes' quest; chronologically, it'd be best to see eps 2-5, 1, and then 6-13)--yet the overall show is so engrossing that this fault (in addition to a few others I'll come to in a moment) becomes irrelevant.It's the characters which make Record Of Lodoss War so much fun, and much of the best scenes belong to Parn and Deedlit; especially in a royal banquet episode where she forces Parn to dance with her (one of my favorite sequences from the show). As is typical of a elf-dwarf rivalry, Ghim and Deed bicker about each other's differences yet maintain a somewhat begrudging level of self-respect. It's Parn, however, whose plight stays with you long after the show approaches its climax. Eager to discover whether his father died in disgrace or not, he finds a father figure in Kashue. (This gets on Deedlit's nerves; she continually competes with the king for Parn's attention--a running gag that plays out unfortunately for only a couple of episodes.) In the latter episodes, we meet two new characters who don't get much screen time but are no less fully realized. Shiris, the hotheaded young mercenary who vies with Deedlit for Parn's affections is strongly depicted, as is her partner (and secret love), Orson, the moody Berserker, who becomes an angry, uncontrollable monster at the sight of Shiris in trouble.Even the bad guys are richly developed. Ashram, as mentioned, isn't driven so much by malice as he is by what he believes is right; in fact, he becomes the most three-dimensional of the villains for that reason alone. For support, he has a Dark Elf accomplice named Pirotess (the opposite of Deedlit) who'll do anything to prove her loyalty to him... including sacrificing herself. Karla, incidentally, is no ordinary villainess. Her primary goal is to bring to Lodoss the balance she feels has been so greatly disturbed... yet her psychologically unbalanced persona leads her to cause far worse chaos with deadly consequences. She is shifty, cunning, manipulative -- an almost deadly combination. Wagnard, on the other hand, is just plain evil -- every bit the equivalent of Kefka from Final Fantasy III who cackles fiendishly as he puts his dark plans into action. When we first meet him, he appears to be a nondescript character, but when he becomes possessed by Kardis, he becomes frighteningly villainous. (Every scene he's in sends shivers down my spines.)Its the strength of the characters and their chemistry as well as the compelling (if jumpy) plot that make Lodoss as a whole that one can overlook its occasional shortcomings, notably the animation, which, although gorgeously drawn, uses a low cel count resulting with some stiff movements. Taking into account that this is an older show, however, this doesn't really detract all that much (although there are some later episodes where some of the same footage is reused, for cost cutting purposes).No fantasy adventure would be complete without a stirring soundtrack, and Record of Lodoss War delivers this in style. The musical score by Mitsuo Hagita is mostly symphonic, although it is (obviously) generated by electronics. Yet the compositions were so rich and lovely that they eventually grew on me over the course of the show. Equally lovely are the opening and ending theme songs, &quot;Adesso e Fortuna -Now &amp; Fortune-&quot; and &quot;Fantasia of the Wind&quot;, both of which are excellently sung in Japanese by Sherry. As a nice bonus, these songs were even translated for the English version; the woman who sings the dubbed songs, Lisa DeSimone, sings with an equally splendid voice.One aspect of Lodoss often criticized is the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media in 1996, a time when most dubs had a low reputation. I've read all kinds of mixed opinions about this English track; some say its fake and/or mediocre while other claims its unbearable, but here's a better review from one of its several (albeit outspoken on the net at least) enthusiastic fans (that's me). No, it's not perfect, and some lines do come off as a bit awkward, but a lot of the voice-overs are really good. In particular, Billy Regan (Parn), Lisa Ortiz (Deedlit), Al Muscari (Slayn), Jacques Le Can (Woodchuck), Simone Grant (Karla &amp; Leylia), John Knox (Ashram), Jayce Reeves (Wagnard), and Alexander J. Rose (Wort and the Narrator), are among my favorites. Plus, the dialog is close to the subtitled script and packed with some memorable one-liners (Parn: &quot;Quick, Deed, what's this dragon's weak spot?&quot; Deedlit: &quot;I'm not a dragon expert! How should I know?!&quot;) and great chemistry between the actors. I especially loved the interactions between Parn and Deedlit, the banter between Ghim and Deed, and a lot of other things. Which is why it saddens me that some would find all of this &quot;inferior&quot; to the Japanese language track. I listened to parts of the Japanese language track, too, and while I did find it to be of top-quality, I find that the dub still holds its own position decently. Of course, it may be in danger of being overshadowed by some of the better dub productions of today, but for a dub made in 1996, its a rather decent, if unspectacular listen. I'm still fond of it, as a matter of fact, even after hearing some better ones.Record of Lodoss War has received its share of detractors over recent years, probably due to its cheap production values and/or inconsistent plotting. However, it is important to remember that these &quot;shortcomings&quot; is mainly because it's an older Anime series. While Lodoss may show its age in places, its infectious appeal and complexity rings true even after other shows of its ilk, and like most classics, it can stand against the test of time. by the time each episode ends.This is a direct-to-video animation series produced back in 1990, which unfolds over thirteen half-hour episodes.

It's Parn, however, whose plight stays with you long after the show approaches its climax. Eager to discover whether his father died in disgrace or not, he finds a father figure in Kashue. (This gets on Deedlit's nerves; she continually competes with the king for Parn's attention--a running gag that plays out unfortunately for only a couple of episodes.) In the latter episodes, we meet two new characters who don't get much screen time but are no less fully realized. Shiris, the hotheaded young mercenary who vies with Deedlit for Parn's affections is strongly depicted, as is her partner (and secret love), Orson, the moody Berserker, who becomes an angry, uncontrollable monster at the sight of Shiris in trouble.Even the bad guys are richly developed. Ashram, as mentioned, isn't driven so much by malice as he is by what he believes is right; in fact, he becomes the most three-dimensional of the villains for that reason alone. For support, he has a Dark Elf accomplice named Pirotess (the opposite of Deedlit) who'll do anything to prove her loyalty to him... including sacrificing herself. Karla, incidentally, is no ordinary villainess. Her primary goal is to bring to Lodoss the balance she feels has been so greatly disturbed... yet her psychologically unbalanced persona leads her to cause far worse chaos with deadly consequences. She is shifty, cunning, manipulative -- an almost deadly combination. Wagnard, on the other hand, is just plain evil -- every bit the equivalent of Kefka from Final Fantasy III who cackles fiendishly as he puts his dark plans into action. When we first meet him, he appears to be a nondescript character, but when he becomes possessed by Kardis, he becomes frighteningly villainous. (Every scene he's in sends shivers down my spines.)Its the strength of the characters and their chemistry as well as the compelling (if jumpy) plot that make Lodoss as a whole that one can overlook its occasional shortcomings, notably the animation, which, although gorgeously drawn, uses a low cel count resulting with some stiff movements. Taking into account that this is an older show, however, this doesn't really detract all that much (although there are some later episodes where some of the same footage is reused, for cost cutting purposes).No fantasy adventure would be complete without a stirring soundtrack, and Record of Lodoss War delivers this in style. The musical score by Mitsuo Hagita is mostly symphonic, although it is (obviously) generated by electronics. Yet the compositions were so rich and lovely that they eventually grew on me over the course of the show. Equally lovely are the opening and ending theme songs, &quot;Adesso e Fortuna -Now &amp; Fortune-&quot; and &quot;Fantasia of the Wind&quot;, both of which are excellently sung in Japanese by Sherry. As a nice bonus, these songs were even translated for the English version; the woman who sings the dubbed songs, Lisa DeSimone, sings with an equally splendid voice.One aspect of Lodoss often criticized is the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media in 1996, a time when most dubs had a low reputation. I've read all kinds of mixed opinions about this English track; some say its fake and/or mediocre while other claims its unbearable, but here's a better review from one of its several (albeit outspoken on the net at least) enthusiastic fans (that's me). No, it's not perfect, and some lines do come off as a bit awkward, but a lot of the voice-overs are really good. In particular, Billy Regan (Parn), Lisa Ortiz (Deedlit), Al Muscari (Slayn), Jacques Le Can (Woodchuck), Simone Grant (Karla &amp; Leylia), John Knox (Ashram), Jayce Reeves (Wagnard), and Alexander J. Rose (Wort and the Narrator), are among my favorites. Plus, the dialog is close to the subtitled script and packed with some memorable one-liners (Parn: &quot;Quick, Deed, what's this dragon's weak spot?&quot; Deedlit: &quot;I'm not a dragon expert! How should I know?!&quot;) and great chemistry between the actors. I especially loved the interactions between Parn and Deedlit, the banter between Ghim and Deed, and a lot of other things. Which is why it saddens me that some would find all of this &quot;inferior&quot; to the Japanese language track. I listened to parts of the Japanese language track, too, and while I did find it to be of top-quality, I find that the dub still holds its own position decently. Of course, it may be in danger of being overshadowed by some of the better dub productions of today, but for a dub made in 1996, its a rather decent, if unspectacular listen. I'm still fond of it, as a matter of fact, even after hearing some better ones.Record of Lodoss War has received its share of detractors over recent years, probably due to its cheap production values and/or inconsistent plotting. However, it is important to remember that these &quot;shortcomings&quot; is mainly because it's an older Anime series. While Lodoss may show its age in places, its infectious appeal and complexity rings true even after other shows of its ilk, and like most classics, it can stand against the test of time."", 'Overview:Record of the Lodoss War was a HUGE hit when it came out in 1990 Japan. It also gained strong popularity among the tiny US anime fandom of the early 90s. Unfortunately, this anime has not aged gracefully. Normally I hate using the phrase ""aged poorly"". It\'s something that young punks use too often to just shit on anything over 10 years old. In this one instance though, I\'m afraid it\'s kind of unavoidable.Background:Record of the Lodoss War was a 1990 OVA based on a Japanese short novel... based an a Japanese tabletop RPG...which was a ripoff of Dungeons and Dragons. Take the most cliche...Western high fantasy tropes and they are ALL here in Lodoss War, distilled down to their most basic. The characters go well beyond archetypes and into the realm of laughably generic. The plot was already just a standard D&D campaign in the novel, but the 10 episode OVA had to cut out a LOT of the novel. If Wheel of Time is like bare bones high fantasy, this OVA is like sucking the marrow from those bones.Popularity:As I mentioned previously, this OVA was a smash hit and spawned a ton of video games, radio dramas, manga, and a 27 episode sequel! So HOW did it get so popular?! To understand this, we have to go back to the year 1990 and look at it from that perspective. Ring the bell sucka! School\'s in session!Just as it used to take a few years for a Japanese fad to spread to America, it took a little bit for American trends to spread to Japan. In the early 90s, Japan was heavily influenced by American culture of the 1980s. High fantasy was HUGE in the 1980s. The utterly mediocre Wheel of Time books were dominating the best seller lists in America. WOT gained such popularity in the Southern US that Atlanta created Dragon Con as a WOT convention. To this day it is the largest geek convention in the Southeast US! Dungeons and Dragons was an absolute cultural phenomenon. He-Man was the most popular toy in the US. You couldn\'t go anywhere without running into Tolkien inspired high fantasy with elves, dwarves, orcs, and all the rest. There were plenty of high fantasy based video games in Japan by 1990, but not really any high fantasy anime or manga at the time to meet this demand. Record of the Lodoss War was created to fill a hole that NEEDED filling back in that time. Today, there really isn\'t the same thirst for Tolkien style high fantasy and there are already 100  fantasy anime better than Lodoss War. Keep in mind that Japanese gamers LOVED Hydlide when it hit home PCs back in 1984. Today...there isn\'t much of a Hydlide fandom. Lodoss isn\'t THAT bad, but at times it feels close.There is one other reason that Lodoss sold like hotcakes back in its day. Deedlit the Elf chick and her sex appeal. Deedlit was in many ways the first true ""waifu"" in anime. Before this you really didn\'t see lonely virgins collecting TONS of figurines and body pillows of their favorite anime girls. You\'ve probably heard lots of people online waxing nostalgic for the anime heroes of the 80s. They all had chiseled muscles, hard jaws, broad shoulders, and looked MANLY! When have you heard people talk about how they want female designs from 80s anime back? That\'s right. You haven\'t. Look at the top 300 waifus on MAL. You\'ll see Yoko Littner, Senjougahara, Rei and Asuka, Lucy Heartfilia, Nami, Erza, Hinata, etc. NONE of these were around in 1990. Even Android 18 and Major Kusanagi weren\'t around yet. The only rivals Deedlit had were Lunch from Dragonball and Cutie Honey from the 1970s!Story:A young swordsman with no parents must team up with an elvish archer, an axe wielding dwarf named Gim, a Wizard, and a thief to go on a long journey and thwart an evil God. Did I mention this series has little imagination of its own? The only creative thing to come out of this series was an evil sword called ""Soul Crusher"" that took possession of its owner and had a giant eye in hilt. The game Soul Calibur BLATANTLY stole this from Lodoss War. I mentioned this before, but the novel had to be very abridged. In one episode, our heroes decide they need to go meet an old wizard and learn the weakness of an evil sorceress named Karla the Grey. In the next episode, it just announces that they have returned from seeing the wizard and learned all about her. Lodoss has a firm policy of ""Tell, don\'t show.""Characters:The characters once again are SO generic that I can\'t really say much about them. Instead I\'ll focus on Deedlit, who is the only character ANYONE remembers from this series. She was drawn with long blonde hair, massive bouncy breasts, and very soft facial features. Deedlit was being drawn by a young Satoshi Urushihara, the KING of breasts! That\'s all I need to say. She IMMEDIATELY falls in love with the young swordsman right after meeting him and plays his sexy sidekick. She doesn\'t really have any chemistry with our leading hero Parn, but her looks still win her ""best girl of 1990"". Fuck Bulma! She was still being a total bitch on Namek at this point.Art:The art by Studio Madhouse is decent for the most part, but this wasn\'t Madhouse\'s top performance here. In the 80s and early 90s, Madhouse was at its best with feature films like Wicked City or Ninja Scroll. It could also do 3 episode OVAs like Cyber City ""God Damn Vampire"" Oedo, which looks WAY better than Lodoss. With a 10 episode OVA, the budget got so strained that we end up with a still image of a dragon getting dragged across the screen in a moment of unintentional hilarity.Music:The soundtrack is pretty damn limited and plays the same tracks over and over. The closing theme is awesome though and contains the line ""please fall asleep on my breasts.""Overall:Lodoss is not an anime that\'s going to knock the socks off new anime viewers in 2018. Still, if you are interested in anime history and want to see a neat time capsule of the year 1990, it is worth checking out. Just go into it knowing what to expect and put on your archaeologist hat.

Some of my fondest memories were playing old school dungeon-crawler video games on the PC, and interacting with this type of fantasy lore. Lord of the Rings, Willow and the Chronicles of Narnia all come to mind when reminiscing of some of my favorite fictional fantasies, and there’s plenty of anime out there that scratch the itch. Legendary anime studio Madhouse attempted to tackle Record of Lodoss War in the early 90’s, a time when fantasy novels and movies were undoubtedly on the rise. It has a palpable Dungeons and Dragons feel,...and is nostalgic of those all-nighters with friends, chugging our Mountain Dews and munching on Doritos while rolling the 20-sided die one more time. Unfortunately Lodoss is plagued with a sense of “generic” that’ll have you thirsting for more depth… which’ll sadly never come. Coupled with some of the most inconsistent English voice acting I’ve ever heard, it’ll be an anime you’ll probably forget soon after watching it.My biggest complaint about Lodoss is that it wasn’t given the proper amount of episodes to expand its story properly. It has such an engrossing atmosphere and massive worldbuilding potential that is squandered terribly due to a lack of time investment. What we’re left with is a marginalized “good vs. evil” approach, thinning the cast of characters to generic protagonists and antagonists. A series with this much imagination needs the proper nurturing to ensure success, and 26 episodes would’ve given it more of a fighting chance. On top of that, they decided to drop the viewers into the middle of what is chronologically after the 5th episode… only leading to the confusion. I don’t know if different mediums of media were trying this reverse storytelling at the time, but it was entirely unnecessary and only confused the hell out of me, and I’m assuming a lot of other people.You follow Parn (yep, sounds like porn) and his stereotypical group of fellow travelers (a cleric, wizard, elf, dwarf and thief) as they seek to prevent the destruction of the planet by baddies that want to control the universe. Sound intriguing? Well, I can assure you that this is the Dynasty Warriors button masher of plots. Considering the source material is actually written to emulate a D&D experience, the dungeon master must’ve been rather disappointing. The main character transforms from useless fodder to going toe for toe with the most powerful foe on Lodoss (which has definitely never happened in an anime before), all in the course of like 5 episodes. There's a loose backstory referencing his father and restoring his family’s honor, but it’s unconvincing at best. Generic quotes like “I'll get you!” and “you're no match for me!” resonate from his vocabulary on occasion, and you sense there isn't much there are on his intellectual level. Parn’s childhood friend Etoh, the with perhaps the worst English voice actor of all time, accompanies him as a sworn companion.Deedlit, a high elf and Parn’s hinted love interest, is a princess that randomly decides to join the adventure. Given the fact that she’s actually of royalty, she naturally drops everything to answer the underlying question of what is happening to her people. And honestly, the rest of the main pack is irrelevant. A gaggle of genericized fantasy tropes, which doesn’t create the best selling point. The most interesting character in the entire series is Ashram, a knight who seeks the highest power, but has some serious self-identification and reflecting to do in the process. He’s initially perceived as a villain, but can actually draw some empathy and understanding as the series elapses.In addition to being a relatively generic series, Lodoss is littered with bits of randomness along the way. Although the “potential” romantic relationship between Parn and Deedlit never actually develops, there are plenty of awkward exchanges or long stares that force the viewer into thinking there’s something there. I’m just not buying it, there’s almost no chemistry between the two. Not to mention the interest fellow traveler Shiris (the girl with the berserker friend) has in Parn…. something that's awkwardly left by the wayside. There's also the evil witch Carla, with perhaps the most unassuming name in anime villainy existence, and another dark elf that sporadically falls for Ashram along the way. The more I get frustrated with the lack of finesse in writing, the more I realize what the anime was modeled after: a D&D quest. Speaking from experience, the element of randomness doesn’t even scratch the surface of the ridiculous stuff me and my friends used to come up with when we played. So…. I guess there’s that.Sometimes I don’t consider it fair to criticize animation from the 90’s or earlier, because it’s merely a sign of the times. In Lodoss’ case, the art style isn’t necessarily my cup of tea but it’s consistent with the art out at the time in terms of quality. From what I remember reading, the studio actually utilized a sizable budget in order to get exactly what they were looking for in terms of emulating various fantasy elements and characters. Some of the fight scenes are actually quite fluid as well, something that earlier anime had issues with. No choppiness or quality drop during the heavier action sequences, something I can really appreciate. Especially when you consider the issues modern day anime have with frame drops and inconsistent animation, likely without any legitimate excuse.Did I mention how bad the voice acting is? Central Park Media, a NYC based company took the reigns dubbing Lodoss. It was clear they had no idea what they were doing. Some acting is decent, but others are absolutely atrocious. It’s almost as though when the producers signed off on it they were doing more of a “screw it”, knowing they’d be out of a job anyway. If you’re a fan of dubs due to convenience, I strongly suggest you watch the Japanese version or avoid it altogether. It’s THAT bad. Performances like this employs hopefulness for my future seiyuu career… I digress.The rest of the music is slightly unfitting, but about what I expect from an early 90’s series. Anime was largely in a learning period, starkly evident by the slow female ballads present in their OPs. For a show so focused on action and fantasy elements, the OP just...doesn’t work. As a standalone track it’s quite present, reminiscent of “Fly Me to the Moon” from NGE, but not an anime fit. The background tracks depict the genre much better. They’re full of orchestral life, and build crescendos left and right.As much as I disliked certain aspects of Lodoss, I enjoyed it overall. However, one must understand that most of my enjoyment comes from a mix of nostalgia and relatability. I was a HUGE nerd in my high school days, so Lodoss speaks to me in some ways other anime cannot. On the other hand, it’s leaps and bounds from being “good” by any normal definition. Perhaps I would’ve enjoyed it more if I had watched the Japanese dub vice the English, but a generic plot, short run time and forced romance all work to cripple Lodoss, dooming it from the start. I would recommend this series to fans of other fantasy anime or earlier shows, or those just looking for something different.

The completest in me tells me I have to at least see the TV series that follows. I haven't had any luck finding it, however. This anime has a special place in my heart due to the nostalgia factor. I only hope that the TV series that follows this up somehow gives better closure. And one minor gripe, I think all of us understood the backstory of Lodoss by the 3rd episode so it really wasn't nessesary to retell it prior to every episode.Art:It's very good looking...for an older piece, however it's not so old as to forgive some of the shortcuts and mistakes that are noticable.Sound:I love good sound.

I just wish there was more down to earth characters like Woodchuck.Enjoyment:I really do like this anime alot. It's more nostalgia than anything but I do like it. I recommend this Anime to fans of Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons or other swords and sorcery stories.Overall:Fanboy opinions and nostalgia aside you should...Borrow it!See reviews and more at my site BRANS!: http://bumrapanimeneverseen.blogspot.com/"", 'Nostalgia can be such a nice feeling, evoking vivid memories and moods. On the negative side, it can result in a depressive malaise or obsessive longing; more positively, it can lead one to aspire to something new, even greater. In the case of media, though, the rose-tinted image from memory is usually better—especially if it leads back to childhood. That\'s certainly the case for Record of Lodoss War: It\'s visually striking enough and well presented to the point that it can seem grander of a fantasy than it really is, and contrary to the emperor with no clothes parable, RoLW is an emperor peacocking in...lavish and ornate robes at the behest of his advisors who hope to distract the populace from realizing their puppet king\'s drooling idiocy.As is so common to the fantasy genre, it loses any sense of the fantastical due to the mundanity of its endlessly recycled, clichéd roots, and the production values tank so often that the illusion of solidity cannot be maintained. Anime has often been known for its limited animation, usually making up for this with more calculated direction and editing of highly detailed and shaded (ahem, maybe not so much now...) character designs and backdrops—exposition, dialogue, and storytelling are all prioritized a bit more heavily than is the norm for animation as well. Madhouse is a solid studio, but they take the above formula to its extremes here. The character designs, even if some of them are on the generic side, are often rendered with so much detail, you\'d be hard-pressed to believe these characters will be animated at all, and the staff often heap loads of stills on us with the bare minimum of movement. The dragons look immense and fearsome next to our puny heroes, but good luck not laughing once you see them tugged across the screen like a kite on a wire that is stiff as a board.The animation can be striking when they pour in enough time or budget. The opening is lovely, and the first episode is filled with stellar work, especially the scene with the dragon—with Toshiyuki Inoue responsible for most of the choice bits. There are often bursts of stylish limited animation throughout, but the relief becomes scarce. Of course, they make sure to squeeze the most detailed animation into Deedlit, so they can sell their endocrine disrupting PVC figurines, which you need to make absolutely sure to never touch, should you be brave enough to wander into the dungeon of a weeaboo or otaku, torch in hand.There is a greater problem at hand than the animation, however. In fact, the series often manages to transcend the sometimes poor animation via solid storyboarding and directorial magic. What cannot be so easily dismissed is that the story, the setting, and almost everything about this anime is impressive, first and foremost, in how it is the most generic of all generic fantasy stories to have ever been generic. It\'s so generic that I have to use the word a plethora of times to emphasize how generic it is and to make it absolutely clear that I am not exaggerating by calling it generic—not in the slightest. This is the quintessential generic fantasy: a basic elemental magic system, sexy female elves, a short and stout dwarf with a battle axe; mindless hordes of goblins, kobolds, orcs, etc., and a few big dragons along the way; bog-standard D&D-styled classes for all of the characters, such as priest, thief, warrior, etc.While this is a fairly standard tale of good guy versus bad guy, there are some betrayals and shifting alliances, but most of the ""complexity"" comes from the most tiresome cliché in fantasy, where a god or the heroes have to maintain the world\'s balance. I\'m getting sleepy already. I hate this in fantasy. I mentioned this in my reviews for Ellcia, Final Fantasy... and while I\'m not sure if I broached the subject with Mizuno\'s Crystania, it does apply there as well. I\'m sure if you did a large survey of fantasy anime/manga, you\'d find a similar pattern (I feel this tends to be less pronounced in isekai, but that is in no way an endorsement of the genre). You\'ll see this concept often in novels, video games, TV series, movies, and whatever other medium. That\'s probably part of what led to Made in Abyss being so popular. It has a fantastical, unique world, and the thematics are more personalized and meaningful than ""Okay, gang, we gotta make sure the fire spirits are nice and toasty over here and we water the earth spirits"" or whatever inane variant.With RoLW, it\'s a little more realistic, with a powerful witch/warlock entity conspiring to ensure that no great power conquers the continent, playing the different sides against each other and manipulating them directly. It\'s actually more of a political realist take on the genre than any kind of ecological or spiritual focus that is more common. Yet the presentation of it is diluted into tedium because of the focus on the witch so effortlessly pulling Jenga blocks out of empires, as opposed to a more complex conspiracy that might lend this the depth it sorely needs.Mizuno, as far as I can tell, is something of a hack fantasy writer. I\'ve only seen his adapted work, so I can\'t say much about his novels. It probably doesn\'t help that the novel series this anime was based on was actually a novelization of the transcripts of some kind of D&D game. That\'s why this series is so generic and cliché, and it feels like the characters were ripped straight out of an RPG—that\'s because THEY WERE, in the most literal sense possible of an actual BO-drenched dork fest, and when the budget drops and we\'re panning over slideshows of dragons and knights, I feel like Ken Burns was there that day and made a documentary comprised of paintings documenting the epic and valiant D&D game and charted the perilous journey that inspired the legendary RoLW franchise.Most of the characters don\'t have much of a purpose to the story. The whole point of all of these characters is to form a party like in an RPG. Most of them are not useful. Woodchuck hardly ever does anything, and Etoh is pretty much dead weight other than to heal characters after battle. The two mercenaries feel as if they were written in at random (they were) and almost none of the characters have distinct personalities or even motivations to maintain the party or do anything in particular. The dwarf at least had a motivation, separate from the party, but nothing about his story was compelling. Why was Deedlit even there in the first place? Because there was a sexy female elf quota, and all that fetish fuel merchandise isn\'t going to sell itself. Parn is kept as everyman and bland as possible so any schlub can imagine himself wooing Deedlit.Parn and Deedlit lack any chemistry, but what was especially amusing is when he was asking her to stay behind and not enter the war. The intent was to show he cared about her, but he never appeared very interested in her up to that point, and hardly even during or after that point. Honestly, he spent more time casting googly eyes at King Cashew for like an entire episode than anything substantive with Deedlit. The Parn-Cashew tension was so thick I probably would have mistaken this for a yaoi, where the sought after Parn had grown jaded with female company and rejected numerous beautiful female suitors so he could mosey off with his tall and tan dessert man (don\'t worry, I\'m sure there are plenty of fanfics fulfilling this function), and the two of them being swordsmen leads to all kinds of potential jokes that even I am tasteful enough to forego.With the immense genericness that I\'ve alluded to, it\'s hard to even recognize whether or not the writing is good, as it\'s so unbelievably familiar, like you could have written it yourself and then start to wonder if your fanfic was plagiarized. For what it\'s worth, it doesn\'t seem too badly scripted—just unoriginal and predictable to the point of tedium. Half of the time, I didn\'t pay attention to the story, my eyes glazing over in boredom, yet I never felt like I missed a plot point at all because none of the specifics really matter. Everything they do revolves around acquiring knowledge or an item that will allow them to thwart an antagonist or some such. It could even be said that the world building is horrendous, but it\'s probably more accurate to state that the world itself is too dull for there to be any world to build upon at all.The way this story was plotted was a little weird, and I wouldn\'t say it worked too well. The first episode is the best, and it takes place somewhere in the middle of the plot, then we\'re back to the beginning with Parn being a wuss, and it remains a long, bloated story that never really goes anywhere. The last few episodes are more viscous than the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, and I thought they would never end. Instead of an open ending, it\'s really unfinished, and you\'ll have to watch the lower-budget TV series that remakes most of the OVA and then continues the story. Both are mediocre at best. Immersion into the world is broken either by tedious storytelling or Ken Burns\' direction or a subpar bout of storyboarding or bad and reused animation (I swear they even reversed some of the footage\'s orientation and shifted the colors in an attempt to trick the audience).What is RoLW? A fantasy, if you can keep it. A fantasy should transport you to another world, but I don\'t get any sense of that at all. When I\'m watching this, I feel like I\'ve been transported to Mizuno\'s dank basement in the 1980s with a bunch of lard-asses (now I\'m spinning fantasy—fat people don\'t exist in Japan) with cheese poof-fingers huddled around in a circle. It smells like death and the air is thick with sweat. They\'re pushing around cheap figurines that look just like the heroes in the dreck we know as RoLW. Mizuno is madly recording transcripts and there\'s the palpable dread of knowing he\'ll adapt this tripe into a novel that will become a sensation. lavish and ornate robes at the behest of his advisors who hope to distract the populace from realizing their puppet king\'s drooling idiocy.As is so common to the fantasy genre, it loses any sense of the fantastical due to the mundanity of its endlessly recycled, clichéd roots, and the production values tank so often that the illusion of solidity cannot be maintained.

Also, this is one of the anime where I had some of the hardest time actually deciding on how to rate it.  Then, I realized that it is probably going to be just above average. And it did just that.Story:It revolves around the wannabe swordsman named Parn and his fellow adventurers who are trying to avert further warfare and save Lodoss from the oncoming evil. This is a setup for a good anime, and I liked it. However, there were many plotholes that could...be dug into this anime, and for good reasons, and not necessarily bad ones. This story was meant to be more of a story about a hero who triumphed against all odds, and trust me, the odds were stacking against him WAY more than I anticipated, but he prevailed in the end, and got the girl. Also, it felt like it was VERY rushed too, so there is that. So basically, it wasn't horrible, but it definitely was what I expected, and did have some twists and turns I did not expect, but overall, it did its job. (5/10)Art:Oh, I dreaded actually getting to this part, because it is a 90's anime, and I know I shouldn't bash a 90's anime for not looking very good, but sadly, the animation was bad, and that is even when you consider the times it was in. There was a whole lot of reused shots and reused still images. Also, some of the flames didn't look like flames, some of the blood didn't look like blood, and even some of the lip movements didn't even happen when a character was speaking, despite them not being too far away. It just looked like a big mess. Sure, I did enjoy seeing how some of the characters looked and how they moved, but oh my word, I sometimes had to pause the anime, when a particularly badly animated scene or movement occurred. (3/10)Sound:Now, the anime surprised me a little by adding in music that wasn't exactly fitting the tone all the time, nor was it varied, but it was consistent and knew what it was trying to say, even if it didn't always say it. It had a couple of REALLY good songs, or selections of songs, and some of the sound effects weren't that bad either. However, there were a couple songs that were mediocre at best. The voice acting was pretty good, but it just wasn't as great as it could have been, both dubbed and subbed included. It was just above average, but it didn't pull through all the time. (6/10)Characters:Well, what can I say, there were some I really liked and some I really disliked. Parn, for example, has some of the best luck I have seen of a fantasy anime protagonist, like seriously. He didn't even know how to fight with a sword until almost halfway through the third episode, and by the time the anime ended, he apparently was good enough to handle one of the main villains, who could easily kill him in the first few episodes. and even though this is the character section, another problem I had was the lack of time notifications about whats going on. I really didn't like that part, especially when it came to the development of characters. Also, the love story between Deedlit and Parn felt SO forced that I could become one of the most confused people on the planet after seeing it, and yet it was still so interesting, because you know it is part of the story. Also, everyone else just felt more like someone who was just there to fulfill a necessary spot, of both the different classes and races like humans, elves and dwarves. I don't know. They were all very likeable, but at the same time, there was not much time to explore into many of their stories. (5/10)Enjoyment:However, this was the highest rated part of the series, and it is the shortest. I REALLY enjoyed watching this anime, despite all of these mediocre findings of mine. What can I say? I love fantasy, and this anime fulfills the role nicely, even though it has a lot of flaws in it. To me, its like seeing Lord of the Rings. Sure, there are a number of plotholes in it that I can think off the top of my head, but it definitely was very enjoyable to watch, and after watching this anime, I want to explore more of the lore in this universe, because it is so fascinating, and yet there was so little that was put forth out there.Overall, I really enjoyed this anime, despite its flaws. It may need a lot of work in different areas, but I do recommend you watch it, even if it might not be that great.Overall: 6/10. be dug into this anime, and for good reasons, and not necessarily bad ones.

Many others like it fail where this anime grabs you and truly enthralls  from the very beginning. Its character progress is a defining aspect that leads to a wonderful adventure. It has everything in just the right dosage, not too mention great character interaction. The art work for its time is sure a landmark in anime. If i had never seen this great masterpiece i would have never acquired my addiction for all things anime. ', ""I don't know what it comes down to. Maybe it's the color composition and background art. Maybe it's the contrast of digital vs. hand-drawn animation. Maybe it's the fact that the characters are all adults or at least adult-looking, rather than children or teenagers. Maybe it's a combination. Maybe it's all of the above. Maybe it's something I'm missing. Whatever the case, watching fantasy anime from before the advent of Sword Art Online is a wild, quasi-mystical experience. They just have such a different look and feel to them. The result is a world that instantly captivated me from its opening sequence.In today's day and...age, even some of the better fantasy anime that do not outright copy the SAO formula, their worlds and environments still somehow end up retaining that same plastic, candy-colored look and feel. I believe that Martin Scorsese’s point about contemporary superhero cinema very much also applies to the state of the modern isekai and fantasy genres. Exceptions always exist, certainly, such as Kouta Hirano's Drifters, but there's a reason they are called exceptions. They are few and far between. We've become so accustomed to the SAO aesthetic, that it's not until we see a fantasy show that came before it, that we realize or are reminded of what was lost, and how different and unique each show used to look.The OVA opens on a narration scene of the universe’s history, very much akin to Galadriel’s exposition at the beginning of Fellowship. Is it as tight? Is it as concise? Is it as relevant? Is the premise as unique and inspired? No, absolutely not, but after more than a decade of being brainwashed by SAO clones and derivatives, a return to classic fantasy made me feel as though I was awoken from a deep sleep and I was instantly drawn in.There’s not much point in me talking about the plot, for an abridged version of the aforementioned narration scene will be featured at the start of each and every single episode, but the basic idea is as follows. War is once more coming to the island-continent of Lodoss, and it is up to our merry band of 6 adventurers to prevent it, and if they can't, then they must at least make sure Lodoss itself still exists in the aftermath. This gave the show a sense of purpose I had forgotten was possible in fantasy. What do you mean this isn't a journey to collect bitches for your harem?Parn is our swordsman hero protagonist, and he is accompanied by Deedlit, the beautiful elven user of spirit magic, Ghim, the stoic dwarf axe-user, Etoh, the priest healer, Slayn, the sorcerer, and Wood, the skeevy rogue. Do any of these characters have even a sliver of an original bone in their body? Not a chance, no, but there is a qualitative difference between the unoriginal characters of today and the unoriginal characters of yore.The overwhelming majority of characters today are clichés and stereotypes that pander to the fans’ desires and fetishes. That's why a lot of them feel like they don't belong. Fate/Apocrypha‘s Atlanta isn't a cat girl in because it made sense for the story. She's a cat girl because weebs love cat girls. Did the story of Re:Zero need Ferris to be a trap? Do Rem and Ram need to be wearing maid outfits? No, again, Ferris is a trap because weebs love traps. Rem and Ram are dressed as maids because of how popular the look is. None of it serves the story’s universe. It simply serves the fans, hence the term fanservice.All of Lodoss’ characters, though wildly derivative and unoriginal, feel like they belong to the world they’re in. None of them feel shoehorned in. They are all stereotypes that serve the story and setting, not the audience, and you would be surprised what a massive difference that makes.The resulting effect was so radically different, that even something as generic as chanting spells through poetry, which is a trope so trite that even modern isekai shlock makes fun of it, somehow felt compelling to me here. The first time we see Slayn chant a barrier into being to protect his mates as they retreat, I could not be more enthralled and wanted to know more!Record of Lodoss War was an OVA released by studio Madhouse in 1990. The anime was based on a Japanese short novel, which was in turn based on a Japanese tabletop RPG, which was in turn a rip-off of Dungeons & Dragons. The OVA was such a smash hit that it spawned a litany of video games, radio dramas, manga, and even a 2 cour sequel, though this initial OVA is the only entry in the franchise that found any substantial success in the West.I often see terms like “cliché” and “breath of fresh air” thrown around a lot in conversations like these, typically in order to describe one's positive or negative experience with any given story. Before we can have an intelligent discussion about the subject, however, we need to define our terms, for they do not always mean the same things at all times. When talking about whether or not something is a cliché or a breath of fresh air, rather than “what”, the more important question is “when”. Would it have been reasonable to call the content of Lodoss cliché back in the 90s? Perhaps, but is that assessment still fair today?Consider the following. The 80s and 90s were saturated with super serious and overdramatic fantasy and sci-fi stories that, after years and years, had become exhausting and stale. Enter Mike Myers’ big dumb green ogre. In 2001, DreamWorks Animation released an instant classic in Shrek. Shrek was the solution that Hollywood came up with in order to fix the state of cinematic fiction at the turn of the millennium. It felt like a breath of fresh air because it beautifully parodied the pretentious and predictable tropes of Disney movies. Alas, like I said, it's a matter of when, not what. In the words of Terenas Menethil, “No king rules forever, my son.” By its third installment in 2007, Shrek’s own formula, which originally made it such an international runaway success, had itself become cliché in turn.Regardless, DreamWorks opened the floodgates to the parody genre. Every single armchair writer who previously never got anywhere because of a lack of creativity, was now free to rip-off every already-existing IP in their purview under the guise of parody and satire. This led to the genre completely jumping the shark with dumpster fires like Meet the Spartans, The Comebacks, Scary Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Date Movie, Stan Helsing, The Starving Games, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, and so on, and so forth.We now live in the world of 20 years later, and every single mainstream movie in recent memory has either been some kind of openly satirical work, or has at least contained substantive satirical elements. Granted, while the MCU had a humoristic tint from the beginning – what with RDJ’s Iron Man – starting with the success of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel has turned this into an exact science. There’s a reason the phrase ‘Marvel humor’ exists. Some of their latest entries, such as Thor: Ragnarok and Thor: Love and Thunder, are legitimately difficult to categorize into a genre. Do they even count as primarily action movies with comic relief anymore? Or are they just straight up comedy movies with some action relief? And herein lies the importance of asking “when”.After all, what is a cliché? A cliché is a trope that has become overused in recent memory. Well, when every single piece of entertainment that has come out in ages is a parody or satire of some sort, then the turns table, and the parody becomes the cliché and the serious drama becomes the breath of fresh air once more.For the benefit of the jury, I present to you Exhibit A: Aquaman. In spite of being inextricably linked to a sinking ship of a cinematic universe and its protagonist having been the butt of every superhero joke for the past half a century, the success of Aquaman proves that audiences were clamoring for a return of the unironic fantasy genre – a classic, archetypal hero’s journey that takes itself seriously and attempts to sincerely sell you on its premise without subverting it with self-deprecating humor or self-aware meta gags. Mind you, the relative failure of the Aquaman sequel, which included a whole lot more of the aforementioned self-satirizing elements, serves only to further prove my point.As such, it is my contention that, to a contemporary audience that has spent the last 2 decades being force-fed a constant stream of media that mocks everything that is beautiful and sincere, it is inappropriate to describe Lodoss as cliché. If you are as desperate as I am for even a whisper of a genuine story, then Lodoss will feel like, dare I say it, a breath of fresh air.Nevertheless, nostalgia for a bygone era can only take you so far. What matters at the end of the day is the quality of the material itself. Does Lodoss hold a candle to the heavy hitters of Western fantasy? Surprisingly, until the release of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, many considered Record of Lodoss War the de facto king of cinematic fantasy. Even after it was dethroned, in the eyes of many critics, it still reigns supreme in the realm of animated fantasy.Alas, as is the case with all trends, the genre became populated by and bigger and better IPs, and Lodoss slowly became lost to the void of cultural oblivion. The shadow cast by Berserk was too deep and too dark.The tragedy of Lodoss is that it lives and dies with its aesthetic. I so wanted to like it more. I really did. Regrettably, once the retroactive novelty of the non-SAO fantasy feel wore off, and the return to a Tolkienesque aesthetic alone was no longer sufficient to keep me engaged, it became utterly transparent that the show had little to offer beyond that.Though the setting and worldbuilding initially drew me in, before long, it became apparent that the emperor is wearing no clothes. Now, you might think to yourself, and you would not be wrong, that Lodoss has better worldbuilding than 90% of fantasy anime, so how can I possibly be unhappy with it? It has always been my belief that any given work of art needs to be judged, not by some universal standard, but by the standard of what it is attempting to be. Lightweight entertainment like Cautious Hero, My Next Life as a Villainess, and How Not to Summon a Demon Lord have no real worldbuilding to speak of, but then again, they don't need it. They have no lofty aspirations to rise to any kind of standard of fantasy excellence. Lodoss, on the other hand, presents itself with all of the haughty pretense in the world. It expects itself to be taken seriously as definitive epic, and it simply falls utterly short of said expectation.The main narrative thrust of Lodoss is the big war backdrop constantly going on in the background. Our main characters are not OP light novel guys and gals. It is made very clear to us that they can't solve everything single-handedly through brute force. For most of the story, their primary goal, more than anything else, is to just stay alive, for the war is too vast and unwieldy for them to get involved. They eventually get dragged into it in spite of their best efforts, and they don't really… do anything. For all the hype about wars and battles, there’s not much of either. When actual battles are shown on screen, it's mostly either stills or recycled shots of the same action animation over and over again. And then, at the end, through some kind of pretzel logic, Parn solves everything single-handedly through brute force.In a sense, I was reminded of Made in Abyss. You are constantly told that this is a world full of cool shit, and you are told that cool shit is always going on, and it is – just never really around you. All of the cool shit is contained in the stories other characters tell you about things that happened elsewhere or in flashbacks, but what you actually see happening around the main cast is fairly mundane. If I were inclined to be cruel, I would say that a more fitting name for the show would be Record of Lodoss People... Which Tangentially Touches on the Lodoss War... Briefly... Sometimes. Fortunately, I am a very polite and kind person and would never say that.Perhaps the best (worst) example of this is the fact that for the first few episodes, the party’s main objective is to find this wise old sage and ask for his advice concerning the coming strife. You spend several episodes with them struggling on their way to meet this dude. Naturally, you can't help but get a bit excited about what he's gonna tell them, what they're gonna learn, the things that are about to come to light. Then, midway through episode 6, you learn that they're back in the kingdom and the meeting with the sage happened off-screen. You then get a CliffsNotes version of what they learned from the sage. What's the Japanese expression for “show, don't tell”?Much of the same goes for the characters. They have very little to offer beyond the appeal of their archetypes. They are all very nice for as long as you can indulge in the feeling that you’re watching anime LotR, but as soon as that spell wears off, it becomes apparent that what you're watching is something more akin to Rings of Power – mind you, minus the political poison, just the hollow characters.Speaking of which, even accounting for my initial enchantment with the characters and their designs, I disliked Deedlit from the get-go. Make no mistake, she's beautiful and all that, but literally one of her first speaking lines is some tsundere shit where she's blushing while frowning. Remember how Akira Toriyama-sensei used to draw pouting girls as having inflated cheeks? As though they’re blowing air into them, all ready to burst? That’s exactly the visual I’m talking about. I think she was mad she wasn’t getting enough attention. Maybe she was quarreling with the dwarf? Fuck if I remember. No, I'm sorry, we haven't yet come full circle to making that cliché cool again. As far as I was concerned, she was kind of dead in the water from that point on.As time moved on and the series progressed, I grew to genuinely dislike Parn, the protagonist. If I've said it once, I've said it 100 times. I don't understand the appeal of protagonists who are the literal worst at everything and easily the least interesting and likable out of the entire main cast. As a wanna-be swordsman, Parn is not the best melee fighter of the group. That would be Ghim, the dwarf. He can't use offensive or protective magic like Deed or Slayn. He can't use healing magic like Etoh. He's also not as cunning and crafty as Wood. In terms of conventional intelligence, the argument can credibly be made that he is legitimately the dumbest of the group. So, then why is he our protagonist? Why is this the dude we follow around? Why is everything centered around him? Why does everyone take him so seriously?The one thing he's got going for him is bravery. Full disclosure, even there, I don't accept that he is any braver than some of the other party members, but let's pretend, for the sake of argument, that he is. Ok. In principle, I don't have a problem with a protagonist who's got nothing going for him except bravery, because the bulk of the enjoyment stems from the journey – his journey to become cool, that is.The rub here is that Parn never really goes through any meaningful change. He is the epitome of hype without action. He is the leader of the group and we are told he is a born leader, but we never see any evidence of that being the case. In fact, we never really see any evidence that he is exceptional in any way, shape, or form. We are told that he is our last hope for this, that, or the other, but we never see any evidence that he is special or uniquely equipped to do much of fucking anything. He will often be praised and honored for his actions, and he is the one chosen to inherit Lodoss’ version of Excalibur, but again, we never get any indication of tangible growth or evolution on his part, so as to be worthy of any of it. By the resolution of episode 13, he still very much felt like the same dickhead from episode 1.The finale was a rush to get to the main bad guy and save the day. On the way there, various threats and obstacles interfere with Parn et co. Every one of the obviously stronger, more experienced, and more competent supporting characters stays behind to deal with said obstacles and they all tell Parn some variation of “Go! You have to make it! All of our hopes rest on your shoulders! You are the key!” and I'm just left thinking, why? Literally why? Where's this assumption coming from that he would somehow perform any better than any of you? What's special about him? It was a feeling very reminiscent of The Philosopher’s Stone, when Ron said: “Harry, it's you that has to go on, I know it. Not me, not Hermione – YOU!” Again… why?The argument can be made that a lot of these issues are to be laid at the feet of the anime, not the source material, for the OVA had to cut the story up pretty drastically in order to make it fit the 13-episode length of the series. Would the epic have felt more fulfilling had it included all of the novel’s contents? Perhaps, but there are some problems that cannot be hand-waved away in that manner.It got to be so unfocused, that by the end, I tuned out completely. It took me a whole ass week to motivate myself to watch the final episode.Oh, and lest I forget, a word of advice to any aspiring worldbuilders out there. If you're going to have less than 50 names of items, characters, and locations in your story, make sure to name them something more distinct than: Falis, Falaris, Fleve, Flaim, Fianna, and Fahn. Those are all real names that all represent very different and important elements of the Lodoss narrative. I mean…Still, Lodoss is a forgotten gem of the Japanese take on Western fantasy. If you’re at all a fan of fantasy or isekai anime, you owe it to yourself to check out the big poppa. This is ground 0. This is where it all comes from. Will it lose you eventually? Maybe, but the journey up to that point will be well worth your time, because somewhere within us, buried deep, I think we all feel this indescribable sense of loss. We’re all longing to go back, pining for something artful and perhaps a little dark, if for no other reason than just exhaustion with today’s retina-burning flashy colors.Take Disney, for instance. If you look at Disney movies today, it’s as though Toy Story never ended. If you go back, however, and take a look at Sleeping Beauty, 75% of that film consists of frames you would be unsurprised to find on someone’s wall. Lodoss is not quite Sleeping Beauty, but it is the Oliver & Company to The Lord of the Rings’ Lady and the Tramp. That is to say that it’s nowhere near as good, largely derivative, but still very enjoyable because it is representative of the era and satiates the same deep-seated yearning. To many, to this day, it is an unshakable staple of the genre.Besides, if you’re not as critically-minded of an asshole as I am, and it is highly unlikely that you are, most of the problems I outlined here might not even register with you, let alone bother you.P.S.: Under no circumstance whatsoever are you to watch this show if you suffer from photosensitive epilepsy. There are so many scenes of brightly and rapidly flashing lights in this anime, that on occasion, it came dangerously close to giving even me a headache. No matter how you cut it, it’s just an irredeemable aspect of the visual production. Even in the absence of the danger of causing seizures, the attempt to fabricate excitement by way of shoving strobe lights in your face every 5 minutes is just disturbing and tiresome. age, even some of the better fantasy anime that do not outright copy the SAO formula, their worlds and environments still somehow end up retaining that same plastic, candy-colored look and feel. I believe that Martin Scorsese’s point about contemporary superhero cinema very much also applies to the state of the modern isekai and fantasy genres. Exceptions always exist, certainly, such as Kouta Hirano's Drifters, but there's a reason they are called exceptions. They are few and far between. We've become so accustomed to the SAO aesthetic, that it's not until we see a fantasy show that came before it, that we realize or are reminded of what was lost, and how different and unique each show used to look.The OVA opens on a narration scene of the universe’s history, very much akin to Galadriel’s exposition at the beginning of Fellowship. Is it as tight? Is it as concise? Is it as relevant? Is the premise as unique and inspired? No, absolutely not, but after more than a decade of being brainwashed by SAO clones and derivatives, a return to classic fantasy made me feel as though I was awoken from a deep sleep and I was instantly drawn in.There’s not much point in me talking about the plot, for an abridged version of the aforementioned narration scene will be featured at the start of each and every single episode, but the basic idea is as follows. War is once more coming to the island-continent of Lodoss, and it is up to our merry band of 6 adventurers to prevent it, and if they can't, then they must at least make sure Lodoss itself still exists in the aftermath. This gave the show a sense of purpose I had forgotten was possible in fantasy. What do you mean this isn't a journey to collect bitches for your harem?Parn is our swordsman hero protagonist, and he is accompanied by Deedlit, the beautiful elven user of spirit magic, Ghim, the stoic dwarf axe-user, Etoh, the priest healer, Slayn, the sorcerer, and Wood, the skeevy rogue. Do any of these characters have even a sliver of an original bone in their body? Not a chance, no, but there is a qualitative difference between the unoriginal characters of today and the unoriginal characters of yore.The overwhelming majority of characters today are clichés and stereotypes that pander to the fans’ desires and fetishes. That's why a lot of them feel like they don't belong. Fate/Apocrypha‘s Atlanta isn't a cat girl in because it made sense for the story. She's a cat girl because weebs love cat girls. Did the story of Re:Zero need Ferris to be a trap? Do Rem and Ram need to be wearing maid outfits? No, again, Ferris is a trap because weebs love traps. Rem and Ram are dressed as maids because of how popular the look is. None of it serves the story’s universe. It simply serves the fans, hence the term fanservice.All of Lodoss’ characters, though wildly derivative and unoriginal, feel like they belong to the world they’re in. None of them feel shoehorned in. They are all stereotypes that serve the story and setting, not the audience, and you would be surprised what a massive difference that makes.The resulting effect was so radically different, that even something as generic as chanting spells through poetry, which is a trope so trite that even modern isekai shlock makes fun of it, somehow felt compelling to me here. The first time we see Slayn chant a barrier into being to protect his mates as they retreat, I could not be more enthralled and wanted to know more!Record of Lodoss War was an OVA released by studio Madhouse in 1990. The anime was based on a Japanese short novel, which was in turn based on a Japanese tabletop RPG, which was in turn a rip-off of Dungeons & Dragons. The OVA was such a smash hit that it spawned a litany of video games, radio dramas, manga, and even a 2 cour sequel, though this initial OVA is the only entry in the franchise that found any substantial success in the West.I often see terms like “cliché” and “breath of fresh air” thrown around a lot in conversations like these, typically in order to describe one's positive or negative experience with any given story. Before we can have an intelligent discussion about the subject, however, we need to define our terms, for they do not always mean the same things at all times. When talking about whether or not something is a cliché or a breath of fresh air, rather than “what”, the more important question is “when”. Would it have been reasonable to call the content of Lodoss cliché back in the 90s? Perhaps, but is that assessment still fair today?Consider the following. The 80s and 90s were saturated with super serious and overdramatic fantasy and sci-fi stories that, after years and years, had become exhausting and stale. Enter Mike Myers’ big dumb green ogre. In 2001, DreamWorks Animation released an instant classic in Shrek. Shrek was the solution that Hollywood came up with in order to fix the state of cinematic fiction at the turn of the millennium. It felt like a breath of fresh air because it beautifully parodied the pretentious and predictable tropes of Disney movies. Alas, like I said, it's a matter of when, not what. In the words of Terenas Menethil, “No king rules forever, my son.” By its third installment in 2007, Shrek’s own formula, which originally made it such an international runaway success, had itself become cliché in turn.Regardless, DreamWorks opened the floodgates to the parody genre. Every single armchair writer who previously never got anywhere because of a lack of creativity, was now free to rip-off every already-existing IP in their purview under the guise of parody and satire. This led to the genre completely jumping the shark with dumpster fires like Meet the Spartans, The Comebacks, Scary Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Date Movie, Stan Helsing, The Starving Games, You Don't Mess with the Zohan, and so on, and so forth.We now live in the world of 20 years later, and every single mainstream movie in recent memory has either been some kind of openly satirical work, or has at least contained substantive satirical elements. Granted, while the MCU had a humoristic tint from the beginning – what with RDJ’s Iron Man – starting with the success of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel has turned this into an exact science. There’s a reason the phrase ‘Marvel humor’ exists. Some of their latest entries, such as Thor: Ragnarok and Thor: Love and Thunder, are legitimately difficult to categorize into a genre.

Plus I felt bored of watching nothing but Pokemon and Sword Art Online all throughout the semester, so I figured I might as well try something I've never seen before. This has gotten a lot of praise from fans, and I thought I'd like it. To an extent, I did, but...honestly, I can't really see why people like this. Now don't get me wrong, it's not a BAD anime. Heck, I'd watch this over every ecchi anime in the world! However, there's just too much...wrong with it to really be conceived as anything other than decent. But the show's main problem is that it's just way too short and way too convoluted for its own good. By convoluted I mean like Digimon Adventure 02 convoluted. What do I mean? Let's explain, shall we? (Note: this review is only about the OVA, not the TV series. I haven't seen the latter, and don't know if I'm going to or not)There's definitely a story to this anime. But the problem is, I can barely comprehend it, as there's just WAAAY too much being shoved down my throat. All I managed to comprehend was that a group of people meet and join forces, an evil empire called Marmo is trying to take control of Lodoss, there's some evil spirit trying to manipulate everything, and at the end, some wizard tries to resurrect one of the goddesses that split Lodoss. That's about it, really. Remember when I said Escaflowne isn't giving people time to absorb its story? Well, I take it back. Lodoss does it too, but far worse. There's so much going on within that timespan that it tries to bite off more than it can chew. It doesn't help that everything jumps around like a kangaroo high on sugar, so you can barely tell exactly what the heck is going on! Part of it could be the fact that its thirteen episodes long, and had it been extended to 26 or even 52 episodes, the story would be more comprehensible, and everything would feel more connected and flow better. If you want to tell a good story, don't just throw in a bunch of events and shove them down our throats without giving us time to chew it! Popolocrois had 25 episodes, yet it had a perfect balance between the story and the characters, the episodes felt more connected, and they kept a consistent yet restrained output. It gave time to develop its story and explain what was going on, and it didn't need to rely on adding in as much stuff as possible. It knew how much it could chew at a time and managed to come out fine in the end. Lodoss really needs to work on that.The animation...I'll be honest here, it really hasn't aged well, and there's lots of errors. Heck, one part of the opening sequence looks like two of the characters were cut from paper and pasted on a background! There's too many still frames, and I think the animators wasted too much budget on making everybody's costumes as elaborate and fantasy-like as possible. But I do like the character designs, though! Plus nobody looks the same. In a time where modern anime characters look too much the same except with different eye and hair colors and different hair lengths, the character designs in this are very refreshing. I'll at least give the show credit for that. The music...while the opening and ending are nice, they're still a little bit generic, and the background music isn't really all that memorable. Some pieces sound like they came from popular video games, like Zelda or Final Fantasy.The characters...eh. They're all kinda bland to me. Nobody was even remotely interesting to me. We have the hero, the chick, the mage, the skeevy guy, the evil villains, etc. Because the story is so freakishly convoluted to the point of looking like an overflowing trash bag, it really suffered in characterization. They could have made these characters into real characters, but here they're just a bunch of bland archetypes. The only characters I thought were even remotely interesting were Orson and Shiris, and they don't appear until episode eight! I really want to like these characters, but even after 13 whole episodes, I still feel like I've only JUST started getting to know them. They could have been more fleshed out, which is a shame. Had the creators gotten more episodes and didn't try so hard, they could have been able to do great things with them.There's a difference between balancing things out and biting off more than you can chew, and unfortunately, Lodoss is the latter. While I appreciate its efforts, it was just trying too hard, and because it tried too hard, it suffered greatly as a result. Escaflowne had somewhat the same problem, but it had 26 episodes (it was going to be longer but their budget was cut so they had to make do with 26), and it at least tried everything it could to get its story out, and it wasn't freakishly convoluted either. It also did its best to fit in a lot of character progression, even though it was also extremely focused on its story. Plus, their characters were more interesting! Escaflowne, while it didn't entirely succeed in its effort, at least tried to balance out its story and characters, and for what its worth, it did a good job. Popolocrois has 25 episodes, yet it knew what its story wanted to be, didn't try to go for anything big, and balanced out its story and characters in whatever time it had, and it really worked in its favor. Lodoss...it just wound up biting off way more than it could chew, and wound up suffocating in the process. All it really needed was more episodes and more time to flesh out both its story and characters so we'd be able to comprehend everything better. Maybe they had budget issues and couldn't do it? Were they not able to get it to air on TV? I dunno. Also, we also get reminded that there was a great war resulting in the creation of Lodoss. It'd be one thing if this was said once, but he explains it in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!! We freaking get it! The story's hard enough to comprehend as it is! That pointless opening scene was really not necessary, and Lodoss has suffered enough as it is.All in all, Lodoss isn't a bad anime. It was just too short and took on more than it could handle. All it really needed was more episodes and a lot of polishing. But I can at least appreciate its good points, and if you're looking for an escapist fantasy anime, check it out. wrong with it to really be conceived as anything other than decent. But the show's main problem is that it's just way too short and way too convoluted for its own good. By convoluted I mean like Digimon Adventure 02 convoluted. What do I mean? Let's explain, shall we? (Note: this review is only about the OVA, not the TV series. I haven't seen the latter, and don't know if I'm going to or not)There's definitely a story to this anime. But the problem is, I can barely comprehend it, as there's just WAAAY too much being shoved down my throat. All I managed to comprehend was that a group of people meet and join forces, an evil empire called Marmo is trying to take control of Lodoss, there's some evil spirit trying to manipulate everything, and at the end, some wizard tries to resurrect one of the goddesses that split Lodoss. That's about it, really. Remember when I said Escaflowne isn't giving people time to absorb its story? Well, I take it back. Lodoss does it too, but far worse.

Record of Lodoss War is The Lord of the Rings of anime. Maybe not as highly regarded as Tolkiens fantasy trilogy but still a spectacular addition to the genre.One of the very first OVAs I was introduced to back in the late 90s ROLW was everything I'd ever wanted out of american animation but never recieved. A dark and serious fantasy adventure that touched on all the familar qualites that the genre is known for. Knights, Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, Wizards, and epic bloody battles. This was a show strictly made for Fantasy fans.The...story is pretty straight forward with a few twists and surprises here and there but it's mostly the world is in peril from a great evil and our band of heroes must set out to defeat this evil and save the peoples of Lodoss. It's simple but satisfying. Theres great characters throughout the entire series and just when you think theres no one else to introduce we get treated to probably my two favorite characters Shiris and Orson. A couple of bandits that join up with our heroes around the midway point that gives the show a breath of fresh air after the few dark eps leading up to their introduction.Last thing I want to touch on is the animation. Now remember this is 1990. So its not going to be nearly as pretty as what your use to watching these days. But theres  a certain charm to its dark and dirty old school style approach that makes me apprechiate it even more today then I did back then. It's a great product of an art style long gone.Record of Lodoss War. Fantasy fans shoud love it. Casuals should apprechiate it. Whichever catergory you fall under one things for sure.

You should respect it."", 'You know, when I first told people that I was going to watch Record of Lodoss War, the first reaction from fans of the series was always “Oh, Lodoss? God, the soundtrack for that is amazing!” Immediately after saying this, they would hastily insist that the rest of the show was great too, but I found it funny how that was always the first thing they thought of when they thought of the series, especially given how much of a big deal it was back in the 90’s.If you were a part of the 90’s Western anime fandom, it was impossible for you to not...at least be aware of Lodoss. It was a staple of that era of Suncoast Video and Animerica Magazine, and its influences can still be seen today. Ever wonder why elves in anime have really, REALLY long ears? Lodoss, that’s why.However, the thing about a lot of media which is emblematic of a specific time period is that it can age with that time period. Case in point, George Macdonald’s Lilith was ground-breaking when it was first published, but it has largely been forgotten now in the wake of its superior successors, like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.. Some shows and books can be like that local restaurant everyone in your town eats at. To those from that time and place, it’s the best and a source of precious memories, but to any outsiders, it may be nothing special, or even outright unappealing.So, as someone who was born in this period of anime fandom, but never grew up in it, how well does Record of Lodoss War appeal to me? Well, first, let’s explainWhat is Record of Lodoss War?--Record of Lodoss War is a 13 episode OVA series, based on a series of “RPG Replays”. During the 80’s in Japan, magazines such as Comptiq would serialize replays, which were transcripts of tabletop RPG campaigns, and Lodoss began as one such replay of Dungeons and Dragons. The replay proved to be so popular, that the sessions were collected and published as three novels, which would in turn spawn short stories, audio dramas, film and tv adaptations, video games, and a new tabletop RPG based around the replay’s world and characters. It’s kind of a big deal.While it is a pop cultural phenomenon in Japan though, the 13 episode OVA which I am reviewing now is really the only piece of this phenomenon that ever caught on in the West, though it caught on like a house on fire. Indeed, to quote Mike Crandol of Anime News Network,“This causes many fans of the fantasy genre to fairly drool upon seeing Record of Lodoss War for the first time. In fact it was not until Peter Jackson\'s ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptation that Lodoss War was dethroned as the king of cinematic fantasy, live-action or otherwise. In the animated realm, however, it still holds absolute sway.”-Record of Lodoss War DVD Collection - Review - Anime News NetworkSo what’s the plot? Well, uh… there’s a dwarf named Ghim, and he goes looking for the daughter of a high priestess who went missing a while back. And then along the way, several characters like the protagonist Parn join him on his search. And then there are these evil dark figures who want to do something evil and their campaign to take over the world plays out in the background while our heroes go on their quest.If you’ve noticed that the answer to this question has less to do with the actual plot and characters, and more to do with the OVA’s place in pop culture history, well, I think you may begin to see the main issue.How does the world of Record of Lodoss War work?--Okay, so long, long ago, Marfa, the goddess of creation, went to war with Kardis, the goddess of destruction. The ensuing battle was so huge, it ripped the earth apart, and caused a new island to break away from the continent. That island’s name was Lodoss, and it\'s where our story is set.The setting is pretty barebones and basic, although I’ll admit I found myself drawn to it. Admittedly this basicness is largely a product of its inception. Tabletop RPG’s are less concerned with making worlds with intricate politics, economics, or cultures, because the main purpose of an RPG world is to give our players a place to explore, and in that regard, Lodoss succeeds brilliantly. Easily one of its strengths is that the big war which is raging between the various kingdoms of Lodoss remains a constant backdrop to our heroes’ quests, and said heroes get dragged into the war despite their best efforts. But rather than being all-powerful protagonists who are able to single-handedly solve the war on their own, the main goal of Parn’s group is simply to stay alive, with the war being far too large and multifarious for them to do anything else.It’s a nice subversion of fantasy cliches, although the same cannot be said for the series’ handling of fantasy races. Agan, this series started out as a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, so there are certain races that exist solely as enemies for our heroes to kill. However, while this sort of thing makes sense for a game that requires player input and challenges, it makes significantly less sense for a story with characters and motivations.In the second episode, Parn helps a young woman in his village who is being attacked by goblins, but later gets chastised by the other villagers for this. Y’see, even if the goblins are violent, the mayor of the human village has told everyone that they need to leave the goblins alone. If the humans don’t bother the goblins, the goblins won’t bother the humans, and peace, however tentative, can be maintained. While Parn was right to protect the fair maiden from the filthy hands of the goblin horde, by killing one of them, Parn has almost certainly given the goblins an excuse to gather their forces and enact revenge on the entire village. It’s a serious moral dilemma, and Parn is now faced with the quandary of what to do next.What does he do next? Well, he and his best friend Etoh leave the village without telling anyone so that they can enter the goblin settlement and kill all the goblins before they try a raid. Really. Now, there are two possible ways to interpret this action.The first way is that the goblins really are pure evil and monstrous brutes, and Parn is right to want to kill them all like you would want to kill some rats or cockroaches. If that’s the case, then he’s being incredibly stupid about the whole thing. At the very least, he should warn the other villagers, so that they have time to prepare if the goblins attack in retaliation. It’s clear from his earlier fight that he only killed that one goblin the first time around through dumb luck, and there’s no way he has the skill to take on an entire settlement of goblins, even with Etoh. So if he really wants to mount a raid on them, he’d do best to at least get some other people to help him.The second way is that the goblins aren’t all evil, and the actions of the marauding band is as chastised in the settlement as Parn’s actions were in the village. The goblin leaders may be punishing the band and trying to come up with a peaceful solution of their own. If that’s the case, then either Parn is willingly escalating the conflict simply because he wants glory and hates goblins that much. Or, an even less charitable interpretation, Parn and Etoh don’t see anything wrong with killing goblins simply because they aren’t human. Their actions then are akin to someone in our world going “Hey boys, y\'wanna go on down to the Rez or the Pale of Settlement and have some fun?”Parn’s actions make perfect sense for a game campaign, when our players need enemies to fight, but they make significantly less sense for an actual story, where people need reasons to do what they do beyond simply “I need XP”. The worst consequences for a player’s actions in an RPG setting is that they die themselves, or they get their party killed. But thanks to Parn’s actions, a shit-ton of people die! He couldn’t even leave a fucking note to the mayor. Like, hey man, you should like, fortify or something. And yeah, this makes a bunch of the surviving villagers mad, but that’s the only negative consequence Parn faces. Parn NEVER looks on the events of that day and thinks “Oh, huh, maybe I should have done things differently.” or “Maybe I bear some responsibility for all those people dying.” The narrative actually rewards his actions, by allowing him to tag along with Ghim’s quest, attaining glory and honor and all that stuff, and possibly finding out what unknown dark force made the goblins so violent. And for the rest of the series, or at least what else I could get through, this pattern keeps happening. Parn’s recklessness and stubbornness continuously make things more difficult for his companions, especially since he doesn’t have the martial skill to back this attitude up. But instead of his friends calling him out or him going through some realization, everyone he meets can’t help but love him and praise him and reward him for all his actions.And let’s take a look at the heroic group itself. From a purely narrative standpoint, it makes no sense whatsoever. Like Geralt’s Hanse in the Witcher, the characters have almost no depth or backstory of their own. They run into each other largely out of coincidence and then stay together because that’s what is needed for the plot to advance, even when there is no reason for them to stay together at all.Take, for instance, Deedlit the elf and Ghim the dwarf. They are constantly at each other’s throats and making snide comments about each other’s races, and it all begs the question “Why?” Why do Deedlit and Ghim hate each other so much? Why does Deedlit hate dwarves and Ghim hate elves? As far as I know, this never gets answered, at least not in-story. The out-of-story answer is, of course, because that’s what Tolkien did. Tolkien’s dwarves and elves hated each other, so these dwarves and elves must hate each other too.Okay, fine. But then, that still leaves the question, why do Deedlit and Ghim stay together in the group? Even if we leave aside the question of why they hate each other, why would they ever stick together for more than five minutes if they hate each other so much? In The Lord of the Rings, Gimli and Legolas started out hating each other, but given how the one ring needed to be taken to Mordor or else the world would end, they were willing to put aside their differences for the greater good.In Lodoss though, even though there is SOME weird, dark force lurking around with evil plans, none of the group knows what those plans are. The main reason they are traveling together is to find the girl Ghim is looking for. That’s it. There aren’t any world-ending stakes at play here, they’re just looking for a missing girl that Deedlit doesn’t know or care about. So she has no reason to stay with the group at all, besides Parn.And again, that’s the thing. While there aren’t any in-universe reasons for things to happen in Lodoss, there are always out-of-universe reasons, and in the case of Deedlit, her entire purpose is one massive, out-of-universe reason. Deedlit is in the group solely because she is in love with Parn. Why is she in love with Parn? Because the writer of the Replay novels, who played Parn in the RPG sessions, wants a sexy elven waifu. That’s it. You’re never going to get any other explanation besides that. Even if Parn does nothing but badmouth or ignore her, which happens CONSTANTLY in the series, Deedlit never stops being totally enamored with him. Does she have friends, family, a backstory? Who cares, she’s a sexy elven waifu, that’s all you need to know. From what information I could gather on the replays, it seems Deedlit was played by a buddy of the writer’s, and I am not at all surprised, given how Deedlit’s actions in the OVA perfectly resemble how two dudes think women act, despite these actions making no sense when you try to imagine her as a character and not a wish-fulfillment fantasy.There is no reason why several of the main characters couldn’t have been combined or excised for this story. Indeed, that probably would have made the story stronger. If you combine Parn and Ghim, say, make the quest about Parn trying to find his mysterious dad who disappeared, that’s already a more compelling narrative than “I got kicked out of my village and am going to wander around until I find out things.” If you cut Slayn out and gave his magic duties to Etoh, it wouldn’t really change anything in the plot. And if you beefed up Deedlit’s backstory and motivation, she might honestly be more than just a waifu mascot. Woodchuck… he’s alright. Good comic relief. You can keep him.The problem with the world of Lodoss isn’t so much the world itself, but the people living in it. I don’t mind cliche settings if the characters are compelling. But in the case of Lodoss, the characters are cardboard.What does Record of Lodoss War have to say?--Nothing, really. It’s a bog-standard fantasy quest, and there’s nothing in the way of deeper themes or messages. Again, it’s an RPG campaign. You’re watching an RPG campaign, but you don’t have the benefit of it being your own campaign with your own group of friends. Which leads to myFinal Verdict--I can’t speak for everyone who plays Tabletop RPG’s, but I think I can say without fear of contradiction that the biggest draw of games like Dungeons and Dragons is the fact that you play it with your friends. Maybe you enjoy collecting the figures and designing the dungeons, but the main reason you like to play Tabletop RPG’s is that you’re with your buddies. You know your friends. You know their idiosyncrasies, their jokes, the way they play their characters, and so you know more or less what to expect from a DnD session with them.If you are not from that friend group though, if you are an outsider looking in and you remove the element of friendship, it simply isn’t as enjoyable. The characters of Record of Lodoss War are really flat, but that’s because they were meant as vessels for a friend group to play with. They were never designed to carry an actual, proper plot on their own, but it’s because of this that I, as an outsider looking in, simply cannot get into Lodoss.The soundtrack is indeed amazing. The animation is top quality. The world, while basic, is still pretty engaging. But the characters are dull as a brick, and even though they are my only real, major complaint with the series, that one aspect is honestly enough to kill any enjoyment I have. I’m sure that some diehard fans will complain that, because I only made it five episodes through, I’m not in a position to judge Lodoss. But if you can’t finish eating an unappetizing meal, that’s a bad meal. If you can’t sit through a boring movie, that’s a bad movie. And even if Lodoss may “get” good in the future, that would still mean I’d have to put up with the nonsense that made me quit for who knows how much longer.I couldn’t even finish Record of Lodoss War, and when I can’t even finish a work, that gets it a 1/10. Maybe, as Mike Crandoll said, Record of Lodoss War did indeed set the bar for animated fantasy, or at least for fantasy anime. If that’s the case though, then it set the bar very, very low. at least be aware of Lodoss. It was a staple of that era of Suncoast Video and Animerica Magazine, and its influences can still be seen today. Ever wonder why elves in anime have really, REALLY long ears? Lodoss, that’s why.However, the thing about a lot of media which is emblematic of a specific time period is that it can age with that time period.

During the 80’s in Japan, magazines such as Comptiq would serialize replays, which were transcripts of tabletop RPG campaigns, and Lodoss began as one such replay of Dungeons and Dragons. The replay proved to be so popular, that the sessions were collected and published as three novels, which would in turn spawn short stories, audio dramas, film and tv adaptations, video games, and a new tabletop RPG based around the replay’s world and characters. It’s kind of a big deal.While it is a pop cultural phenomenon in Japan though, the 13 episode OVA which I am reviewing now is really the only piece of this phenomenon that ever caught on in the West, though it caught on like a house on fire. Indeed, to quote Mike Crandol of Anime News Network,“This causes many fans of the fantasy genre to fairly drool upon seeing Record of Lodoss War for the first time. In fact it was not until Peter Jackson\'s ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptation that Lodoss War was dethroned as the king of cinematic fantasy, live-action or otherwise. In the animated realm, however, it still holds absolute sway.”-Record of Lodoss War DVD Collection - Review - Anime News NetworkSo what’s the plot? Well, uh… there’s a dwarf named Ghim, and he goes looking for the daughter of a high priestess who went missing a while back. And then along the way, several characters like the protagonist Parn join him on his search. And then there are these evil dark figures who want to do something evil and their campaign to take over the world plays out in the background while our heroes go on their quest.If you’ve noticed that the answer to this question has less to do with the actual plot and characters, and more to do with the OVA’s place in pop culture history, well, I think you may begin to see the main issue.How does the world of Record of Lodoss War work?--Okay, so long, long ago, Marfa, the goddess of creation, went to war with Kardis, the goddess of destruction. The ensuing battle was so huge, it ripped the earth apart, and caused a new island to break away from the continent. That island’s name was Lodoss, and it\'s where our story is set.The setting is pretty barebones and basic, although I’ll admit I found myself drawn to it. Admittedly this basicness is largely a product of its inception. Tabletop RPG’s are less concerned with making worlds with intricate politics, economics, or cultures, because the main purpose of an RPG world is to give our players a place to explore, and in that regard, Lodoss succeeds brilliantly. Easily one of its strengths is that the big war which is raging between the various kingdoms of Lodoss remains a constant backdrop to our heroes’ quests, and said heroes get dragged into the war despite their best efforts. But rather than being all-powerful protagonists who are able to single-handedly solve the war on their own, the main goal of Parn’s group is simply to stay alive, with the war being far too large and multifarious for them to do anything else.It’s a nice subversion of fantasy cliches, although the same cannot be said for the series’ handling of fantasy races. Agan, this series started out as a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, so there are certain races that exist solely as enemies for our heroes to kill. However, while this sort of thing makes sense for a game that requires player input and challenges, it makes significantly less sense for a story with characters and motivations.In the second episode, Parn helps a young woman in his village who is being attacked by goblins, but later gets chastised by the other villagers for this. Y’see, even if the goblins are violent, the mayor of the human village has told everyone that they need to leave the goblins alone. If the humans don’t bother the goblins, the goblins won’t bother the humans, and peace, however tentative, can be maintained. While Parn was right to protect the fair maiden from the filthy hands of the goblin horde, by killing one of them, Parn has almost certainly given the goblins an excuse to gather their forces and enact revenge on the entire village. It’s a serious moral dilemma, and Parn is now faced with the quandary of what to do next.What does he do next? Well, he and his best friend Etoh leave the village without telling anyone so that they can enter the goblin settlement and kill all the goblins before they try a raid. Really. Now, there are two possible ways to interpret this action.The first way is that the goblins really are pure evil and monstrous brutes, and Parn is right to want to kill them all like you would want to kill some rats or cockroaches. If that’s the case, then he’s being incredibly stupid about the whole thing. At the very least, he should warn the other villagers, so that they have time to prepare if the goblins attack in retaliation. It’s clear from his earlier fight that he only killed that one goblin the first time around through dumb luck, and there’s no way he has the skill to take on an entire settlement of goblins, even with Etoh. So if he really wants to mount a raid on them, he’d do best to at least get some other people to help him.The second way is that the goblins aren’t all evil, and the actions of the marauding band is as chastised in the settlement as Parn’s actions were in the village. The goblin leaders may be punishing the band and trying to come up with a peaceful solution of their own. If that’s the case, then either Parn is willingly escalating the conflict simply because he wants glory and hates goblins that much. Or, an even less charitable interpretation, Parn and Etoh don’t see anything wrong with killing goblins simply because they aren’t human. Their actions then are akin to someone in our world going “Hey boys, y\'wanna go on down to the Rez or the Pale of Settlement and have some fun?”Parn’s actions make perfect sense for a game campaign, when our players need enemies to fight, but they make significantly less sense for an actual story, where people need reasons to do what they do beyond simply “I need XP”. The worst consequences for a player’s actions in an RPG setting is that they die themselves, or they get their party killed. But thanks to Parn’s actions, a shit-ton of people die! He couldn’t even leave a fucking note to the mayor. Like, hey man, you should like, fortify or something. And yeah, this makes a bunch of the surviving villagers mad, but that’s the only negative consequence Parn faces. Parn NEVER looks on the events of that day and thinks “Oh, huh, maybe I should have done things differently.” or “Maybe I bear some responsibility for all those people dying.” The narrative actually rewards his actions, by allowing him to tag along with Ghim’s quest, attaining glory and honor and all that stuff, and possibly finding out what unknown dark force made the goblins so violent. And for the rest of the series, or at least what else I could get through, this pattern keeps happening. Parn’s recklessness and stubbornness continuously make things more difficult for his companions, especially since he doesn’t have the martial skill to back this attitude up. But instead of his friends calling him out or him going through some realization, everyone he meets can’t help but love him and praise him and reward him for all his actions.And let’s take a look at the heroic group itself. From a purely narrative standpoint, it makes no sense whatsoever. Like Geralt’s Hanse in the Witcher, the characters have almost no depth or backstory of their own. They run into each other largely out of coincidence and then stay together because that’s what is needed for the plot to advance, even when there is no reason for them to stay together at all.Take, for instance, Deedlit the elf and Ghim the dwarf. They are constantly at each other’s throats and making snide comments about each other’s races, and it all begs the question “Why?” Why do Deedlit and Ghim hate each other so much? Why does Deedlit hate dwarves and Ghim hate elves? As far as I know, this never gets answered, at least not in-story. The out-of-story answer is, of course, because that’s what Tolkien did. Tolkien’s dwarves and elves hated each other, so these dwarves and elves must hate each other too.Okay, fine. But then, that still leaves the question, why do Deedlit and Ghim stay together in the group? Even if we leave aside the question of why they hate each other, why would they ever stick together for more than five minutes if they hate each other so much? In The Lord of the Rings, Gimli and Legolas started out hating each other, but given how the one ring needed to be taken to Mordor or else the world would end, they were willing to put aside their differences for the greater good.In Lodoss though, even though there is SOME weird, dark force lurking around with evil plans, none of the group knows what those plans are. The main reason they are traveling together is to find the girl Ghim is looking for. That’s it. There aren’t any world-ending stakes at play here, they’re just looking for a missing girl that Deedlit doesn’t know or care about. So she has no reason to stay with the group at all, besides Parn.And again, that’s the thing. While there aren’t any in-universe reasons for things to happen in Lodoss, there are always out-of-universe reasons, and in the case of Deedlit, her entire purpose is one massive, out-of-universe reason. Deedlit is in the group solely because she is in love with Parn. Why is she in love with Parn? Because the writer of the Replay novels, who played Parn in the RPG sessions, wants a sexy elven waifu. That’s it. You’re never going to get any other explanation besides that. Even if Parn does nothing but badmouth or ignore her, which happens CONSTANTLY in the series, Deedlit never stops being totally enamored with him. Does she have friends, family, a backstory? Who cares, she’s a sexy elven waifu, that’s all you need to know. From what information I could gather on the replays, it seems Deedlit was played by a buddy of the writer’s, and I am not at all surprised, given how Deedlit’s actions in the OVA perfectly resemble how two dudes think women act, despite these actions making no sense when you try to imagine her as a character and not a wish-fulfillment fantasy.There is no reason why several of the main characters couldn’t have been combined or excised for this story. Indeed, that probably would have made the story stronger. If you combine Parn and Ghim, say, make the quest about Parn trying to find his mysterious dad who disappeared, that’s already a more compelling narrative than “I got kicked out of my village and am going to wander around until I find out things.” If you cut Slayn out and gave his magic duties to Etoh, it wouldn’t really change anything in the plot. And if you beefed up Deedlit’s backstory and motivation, she might honestly be more than just a waifu mascot. Woodchuck… he’s alright. Good comic relief. You can keep him.The problem with the world of Lodoss isn’t so much the world itself, but the people living in it. I don’t mind cliche settings if the characters are compelling. But in the case of Lodoss, the characters are cardboard.What does Record of Lodoss War have to say?--Nothing, really. It’s a bog-standard fantasy quest, and there’s nothing in the way of deeper themes or messages. Again, it’s an RPG campaign. You’re watching an RPG campaign, but you don’t have the benefit of it being your own campaign with your own group of friends. Which leads to myFinal Verdict--I can’t speak for everyone who plays Tabletop RPG’s, but I think I can say without fear of contradiction that the biggest draw of games like Dungeons and Dragons is the fact that you play it with your friends. Maybe you enjoy collecting the figures and designing the dungeons, but the main reason you like to play Tabletop RPG’s is that you’re with your buddies. You know your friends. You know their idiosyncrasies, their jokes, the way they play their characters, and so you know more or less what to expect from a DnD session with them.If you are not from that friend group though, if you are an outsider looking in and you remove the element of friendship, it simply isn’t as enjoyable. The characters of Record of Lodoss War are really flat, but that’s because they were meant as vessels for a friend group to play with. They were never designed to carry an actual, proper plot on their own, but it’s because of this that I, as an outsider looking in, simply cannot get into Lodoss.The soundtrack is indeed amazing. The animation is top quality. The world, while basic, is still pretty engaging. But the characters are dull as a brick, and even though they are my only real, major complaint with the series, that one aspect is honestly enough to kill any enjoyment I have. I’m sure that some diehard fans will complain that, because I only made it five episodes through, I’m not in a position to judge Lodoss. But if you can’t finish eating an unappetizing meal, that’s a bad meal. If you can’t sit through a boring movie, that’s a bad movie. And even if Lodoss may “get” good in the future, that would still mean I’d have to put up with the nonsense that made me quit for who knows how much longer.I couldn’t even finish Record of Lodoss War, and when I can’t even finish a work, that gets it a 1/10. Maybe, as Mike Crandoll said, Record of Lodoss War did indeed set the bar for animated fantasy, or at least for fantasy anime. If that’s the case though, then it set the bar very, very low.', 'This one is a little bit serious. If you want to talk about this in DnD perspective, these are the guys that take everything serious and say that you can’t talk out of character and all that. Sure there is a little comedy but it is pretty much ether nurd-ifide or magically complicated. Maybe this is why I don’t really get along with the serious people… because I didn’t much care for it. Now this doesn’t mean that it is bad, oh no. It’s far from bad even to today’s standards. It just takes a lot of talking and standing around before anything really significant...gets done.The characters are alright though I have to wonder about the names and character designs. Ghim, the dwarf, reminds me a lot of Ghimbli from Lord of the Rings, and I’m not sure but depending on when Rune Soldier was made, Deedlit looks a lot like Crysta, the elf girl they meet. No matter how you try to sugar coat it, Parn is pretty much a weakling trying to fit into his father’s armor, though that’s mostly what he looks like. He does have a brave heart though, which I have to sit down and roll my eyes at since it’s pretty much generic. The whole thing is freaken generic and rather boring to me most of the time.The animation, though beautiful, felt more like still shots with lips flapping because The fight scenes aren’t well done in today’s standard. They might have been fine back then but I come from a generation where we like our active fight scenes and not this ‘clash swords and talk’ thing most of the characters do.The voices, mostly actually miss in the English version and since I couldn’t find the Japanese, I couldn’t see weather it was the same there too. This is just one that I really wish had some more comedy to keep me interested. The narrator got on my nerves a hell of a lot more then the others though.

A few petty coins were left behind for his prize, a priceless treasure known as ""Record of Lodoss War""...OK, enough of that, you want to see a review of the 13-episode OVA series Record of Lodoss War.  So, right off the bat, here\'s my objective opinion: This is a flawed, often deeply-flawed series, but one that has a lot of high points to go along with its flaws.  Personal opinion, though?...I love this series.  I love this series because its creators clearly loved it, and that shows.So let\'s talk about those flaws.  The story is strong, but the pace of the story is fairly uneven, taking its sweet time here and there while rushing (or even skipping) ahead at other parts.  In fact, \'uneven\' could probably be the big criticism of Record of Lodoss War as a whole, since it can, thanks in part to those pacing issues, be applied to the problems with the characters as well, since we\'re missing or at least have poorly emphasized elements of their development and arc.The animation is another thing, and part of where I\'d like to point out being able to see a creator\'s love for something: The images are all gorgeous.  Look at just about any still from the show and chances are you\'ll be able to like what you see.  Now, I don\'t actually know the production history of Record of Lodoss War, but later on, when you just know the budget was running dry and corners had to be cut they just use... less of it, relying on slow pans over their scenes and very limited movement.  It never looks worse, just less animated.  The ""Budget is out, have to cut corners"" ending situation is hardly unique to Lodoss, but unlike other examples the creators of Record of Lodoss War knew where they could cut those corners and where they absolutely could not cut them in order to still tell the story they wanted to tell and transport the viewer to this fantastical world.  Again, trying to think of it objectively I have to mark the show down for what it did there, but I think they found the best solution they could to their problem that it seems clear from the final product that they faced.For all its problems, Record of Lodoss War has a very timeless quality to it, a trait it tends to share with the best of the best in fantasy if not in media in general.  It\'s very earnest.  It feels natural.  It feels, I dare say, real.  Or perhaps more than real it feels like an actual legend.  In this day and age when so many works pillage their predecessors all the way back to the myths and legends of the world and end up feeling hollow or artificial it\'s somewhat astounding to see something, much less something with the fairly shallow roots of Record of Lodoss War (which clearly owes much to the 1974 genre-shaper Dungeons & Dragons) that feels like it could stand up alongside them.Part of that is because, I personally feel, that the people involved clearly wanted to tell this story and tell it well.  Another part I realize now might actually be the very flaws of the piece helping to propel it forward.  Few indeed are the myths and legends that are complete and self contained, so when Record of Lodoss War frays at the edges but manages to do so in a graceful manner it ends up invoking not dissatisfaction with what was missing, skipped, accelerated through, or seemingly riddled with plot holes or continuity errors, but rather it evokes the sense of those old tales that are generally told and retold through many sources, leaving them misty-edged glimpses of a tapestry that can never be beheld in a full and finished state.  Whether by design or by accident, it seems possible to me that the elements that make Record of Lodoss War technically weaker may be, in some ways, actually enhancing the emotional experience.And in the end, that\'s what Lodoss best delivers: an experience.  If you\'re going to come in to this like a health inspector setting foot in the kitchen of some old, beloved diner you\'re going to find problems here and there and you certainly won\'t enjoy yourself as would the patron soaking in the warm hues of the yellowed wallpaper and rich bread-and-grease aroma of the patty melt brunch on its way to them.  To an extent, that\'s true of any work of media.  Someone watching something as a critic can\'t be forced to get invested if they\'re too busy thinking and analyzing to feel.  But it\'s especially true for works like Record of Lodoss War that play more strongly to the viewer\'s emotions, rather than a mystery or think-piece that goes primarily for the intellect.

Some of them are place very akwardly and really make you go ""Eh Wait? was a part of the episode just cut out?"" Which makes everything feel very Choppy. One of the most notable example\'s of this is an assasination atempt inside a ballroom which instantly jump-cuts the main cast resting and the main character training with someone.

Nowadays it’s kind of most notable for being that thing Lisa Ortiz was in before Slayers, and that series that Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth was based off.  I only know two people who have seen Record of Lodoss War other than me, both only saw it once and...one saw it over 20 years ago.  Where I live, in the US, we have only received a handful of Lodoss properties but in Japan it’s quite a bit bigger with multiple novels and games in addition to the couple anime that were released in the 90s.  However the two anime are meant to stand on their own and the OVA series was the first of these two making it the entry point to the series for many people, such as myself.  Did it succeed in properly introducing and explaining the world of Lodoss Island to fresh audiences? Kinda.Lodoss is a by the books fantasy story.  What's the first thing that comes to your mind when I say “fantasy adventure party”?  The mental image you just got there is identical to the composure of the Lodoss group.  We get Parn, the warrior, his friend Etoh, the priest, Slayn, the wizard, Ghim, the dwarf, Deedlit, the elf, and Woodchuck, the thief.  None of them are really all that notable other than Deedlit, who is strikingly beautiful and has a personality that isn’t as easily summed up as just stating her character class.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Parn, who at times comes off as so empty he feels like an RPG player character still awaiting a player to come in and personalize him.  Parn is the main character.  The people in charge of the anime though clearly knew who you were gonna watch it for however.  Both the opening and ending heavily feature Deed, with the ending cutting all party members who aren't her.  Pretty artwork of a pretty elf to keep you going.  But other than the party make up what is Lodoss like? Pretty standard.The basic plot outline of Record of Lodoss War is that the party is on a quest to stop an invasion by the evil emperor of Marmo, Beld, and to take down his powerful ally, the witch Karla.  Ghim and Slayn are looking for Leylia the daughter of Ghim’s friend Neese who went missing seven years ago. If you want to know the particulars of why, read the novel.  An English copy currently has an asking price of around $70 so hopefully you got one while they were still in print. Salyn and Ghim get roped in with Parn and Etoh after they help them fend off some goblins attacking the town they live in.  They meet Deedlit when she shows up to warn them of the attack.  Woodchuck they meet in prison when the party is arrested for a miscommunication later in the series.  However this is not where Lodoss chooses to start. Instead the first episode is smack in the middle of their adventures when they are already on their way to meet the sage Wort.  Unlike some series, Berserk for instance, having the first episode set ahead then flashing back does not help establish a tone or foreshadow anything.  Instead it’s more akin to Violence Jack, just having one random episode out of order.  It’s odd and confusing because the viewer doesn't know any of these characters yet and they've just been thrown into the middle of the story.  In addition Parn’s first two lines are both negging Deedlit which doesn’t help endear him to you.  This weird out of order episode left one of my friends so confused it effected his ability to understand the story.  He told me “Yeah they were like ‘okay we’re gonna go see the wizard’ then the next episode they’re like ‘okay now that we saw the wizard’ and you never see them go there!” I had to tell him they did, they just did it in the first episode then flashed back for seemingly no reason. However this is not the biggest flaw of Record of Lodoss War.  It’s biggest flaw would be its pacing.The strength of any fantasy rests on the back of its lore.  From Lord of the Rings to Game of Thrones all successful fantasy franchises have had deep lore.  Record of Lodoss War is no different.  It opens every episode with a brief summery of the history of Lodoss’ creation.  However there are only 13 half hour episodes of the original OVA franchise, they were never going to be able to pack everything in.  This did not stop them from trying.  Things move at an absolutely break neck pace in Lodoss War.  In those 13 episodes alone there are 4 separate villains.  That means there are 4 separate climaxes.  You barely have time to rest on the end of one part before the series has moved on to the next.  Okay they’re fighting Beld, now they’re fighting Karla, now they’re fighting Ashram, now they’re fighting Wagnard.  Those last two take place during the final three episodes leaving them feeling even more rushed and crammed than anything that came before them.  Characters can be introduced and then made lifelong friends or bitter enemies in what seems like an instant because the show cannot slow down if it wants to get everything in there at once.  I’ve watched it multiple times and I can’t say for sure if Wagnard is possessed by Kardis, the god of destruction, or if he just remembers his evil scheme in the middle of a battle.  Personally I don’t think he should have been in the series and that they should have cut both his and Ashram’s battles using those last 3 episodes to slow the series down a bit and ending it with their battle against Karla.  She was the villain with the most connection to the main party and the battle against her felt the most climactic out of the 4 villain battles.  If, however, you can get past a level of pacing so fast it would pass an F-1 qualifier there are things to enjoy in the series.Lodoss has some genuinely good fantasy action and designs.  The dragons are huge and intimidating.  The sorcery, while standard at times, gives you that classic fantasy magic feel.  And the larger party means there’s more of an opportunity for individuals to use unique class abilities.  Not to mention for those into that sort of thing Deedlit is total eye candy.  Her ability to commune with the spirits of nature sets her magic apart from the type used by Slayn so it doesn’t feel like they just did the same character abilities twice.  And for those willing to put in the time and attention to detail there’s some pretty interesting lore behind the scenes. Such as how emperor Beld wields the demonic sword of the demon king that he previously felled and that it grants great power but in exchange will corrupt the user.  I also think the sword my crave blood and has a mind of its own but it is hard to tell given the speed at which this information is dumped and how easy it all can be to miss.  Ghim’s obsession with rescuing Leylia, while lacking in the motivation provided by the novel, ads a more personal component to the group’s questing beyond just “stop evil thing from destroying world”, a personal connection later echoed when Parn has his battle against Wagnard at the end of the series.  Karla makes for a fairly interesting antagonist.  Unlike many fantasy villains who’s motivation is “I am evil because I am evil” Karla is trying to strike a balance in the world.  She believes that the world can be neither fully good nor fully evil and will throw her weight and influence behind whichever side she deems weaker in the sake of maintaining a perfect balance.  If you’re willing to look past the under cooked characters and rushed delivery you can appreciate Lodoss on its aesthetics and world then later return and finish cooking the characters yourself with additional research. It’s a very standard fantasy, but that also means it’s not a poor fantasy.In the end it’s hard for me to recommend Record of Lodoss War, and this is entirely because of its insanely fast pacing. I personally enjoy it, and found that I liked it even more on my second viewing than on my first when I wasn’t all that impressed.  The more layers of the Lodoss onion I peel off the more I enjoy it.  However taken as a stand alone this OVA series is ridiculously rushed.  It bites off far more than it can chew and both story lines and characters suffer because of it. It would easily be a much stronger show if it cut down on a couple of plot threads and gave the others room to breathe.  The creators of the show don’t believe in pruning their trees however, and allow every tiny branch to suck away the energy of the whole rather than cut them off to allow the stronger ones to continue to grow and flourish.  If you’re the type of person who really loves fantasy stories, or this sort of pacing issue isn't a dealbreaker for you then I would say go ahead and give Lodoss a shot.  On the other hand if you're not big on fantasy and really need a strong, slow story to feel a deep connection with the characters then just go ahead and pass on this one, it’s not going to offer much for you.  I would say it is the stronger of the two Lodoss anime but that doesn’t mean its fantastic or that it is for everyone.  In the end its a heavily flawed work and the enjoyment is going to vary wildly by individual.  I like Lodoss, it’s not my favorite, its not going to be topping my chart of all time greatest fantasy stories, but it’s an enjoyable way to fill my time and is a world I can get into.  Maybe that will be how you feel, maybe not. But in the end the only way to really know for sure is decide if thats an adventure you want to take.7/10 one saw it over 20 years ago.  Where I live, in the US, we have only received a handful of Lodoss properties but in Japan it’s quite a bit bigger with multiple novels and games in addition to the couple anime that were released in the 90s.  However the two anime are meant to stand on their own and the OVA series was the first of these two making it the entry point to the series for many people, such as myself.  Did it succeed in properly introducing and explaining the world of Lodoss Island to fresh audiences? Kinda.Lodoss is a by the books fantasy story.  What's the first thing that comes to your mind when I say “fantasy adventure party”?  The mental image you just got there is identical to the composure of the Lodoss group.  We get Parn, the warrior, his friend Etoh, the priest, Slayn, the wizard, Ghim, the dwarf, Deedlit, the elf, and Woodchuck, the thief.  None of them are really all that notable other than Deedlit, who is strikingly beautiful and has a personality that isn’t as easily summed up as just stating her character class.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Parn, who at times comes off as so empty he feels like an RPG player character still awaiting a player to come in and personalize him.  Parn is the main character.  The people in charge of the anime though clearly knew who you were gonna watch it for however.  Both the opening and ending heavily feature Deed, with the ending cutting all party members who aren't her.  Pretty artwork of a pretty elf to keep you going.  But other than the party make up what is Lodoss like? Pretty standard.The basic plot outline of Record of Lodoss War is that the party is on a quest to stop an invasion by the evil emperor of Marmo, Beld, and to take down his powerful ally, the witch Karla.  Ghim and Slayn are looking for Leylia the daughter of Ghim’s friend Neese who went missing seven years ago. If you want to know the particulars of why, read the novel.  An English copy currently has an asking price of around $70 so hopefully you got one while they were still in print. Salyn and Ghim get roped in with Parn and Etoh after they help them fend off some goblins attacking the town they live in.  They meet Deedlit when she shows up to warn them of the attack.  Woodchuck they meet in prison when the party is arrested for a miscommunication later in the series.  However this is not where Lodoss chooses to start. Instead the first episode is smack in the middle of their adventures when they are already on their way to meet the sage Wort.  Unlike some series, Berserk for instance, having the first episode set ahead then flashing back does not help establish a tone or foreshadow anything.  Instead it’s more akin to Violence Jack, just having one random episode out of order.  It’s odd and confusing because the viewer doesn't know any of these characters yet and they've just been thrown into the middle of the story.  In addition Parn’s first two lines are both negging Deedlit which doesn’t help endear him to you.  This weird out of order episode left one of my friends so confused it effected his ability to understand the story.  He told me “Yeah they were like ‘okay we’re gonna go see the wizard’ then the next episode they’re like ‘okay now that we saw the wizard’ and you never see them go there!” I had to tell him they did, they just did it in the first episode then flashed back for seemingly no reason. However this is not the biggest flaw of Record of Lodoss War.  It’s biggest flaw would be its pacing.The strength of any fantasy rests on the back of its lore.  From Lord of the Rings to Game of Thrones all successful fantasy franchises have had deep lore.  Record of Lodoss War is no different.  It opens every episode with a brief summery of the history of Lodoss’ creation.  However there are only 13 half hour episodes of the original OVA franchise, they were never going to be able to pack everything in.  This did not stop them from trying.  Things move at an absolutely break neck pace in Lodoss War.  In those 13 episodes alone there are 4 separate villains.  That means there are 4 separate climaxes.  You barely have time to rest on the end of one part before the series has moved on to the next.

The story itself isn\'t anything special and plays out like a D&D campaign, and the characters are pretty much ripped out of a D&D session as well. But that\'s the charm of it, It\'s just a straightforward high fantasy story. I\'ll also admit the influx of the ""Isekai"" genre has influenced my review as the most generic fantasy plots are masterpieces compared to that garbage.Animation and sound wise it still holds up fairly well for something it\'s age, and the first episode in particular...had animation that puts some series today to shame in comparison. Story wise as I said before, it\'s pretty much a D&D campaign in animated format. Your enjoyment of it hinges on whether you like those kinds of plots, I did so I liked it. The characters are all pretty generic, but that\'s what makes them endearing. They aren\'t some ridiculous over the top anime trope like a lot of ""fantasy"" anime does these days. Parn the main character isn\'t a Japanese teenager who got killed by a truck and sent to this fantasy world where he\'s given a ridiculous OP power that\'s considered weak. He\'s just the son of a knight who starts off as a complete greenhorn, and by the end you see his progression both in his combat skills and his personality.All in all, it\'s a classic series that I\'d recommend anybody who loves Fantasy or those who are tired of the bland self insert Isekai genre to check out. had animation that puts some series today to shame in comparison.

Anime releases in North America back then were generally abysmal, favoring titillating shows or big productions over diamonds in the rough, and you usually were stuck with shows with low-budget dubbing, replacing passable or overacted Japanese acting with terrible acting by unknown actors or extras furiously trying to stay in sync with the animation.When I watched this in the university dorm (complete with so-so fan subtitles), I couldn\'t wait for the next episode. And the next. Great shows always leave you wanting more (terrible...shows leave you demanding a refund), and Lodoss War is probably the anime that, to me, sets the bar for quality.So, yes, the animation is dated. Well, think about the computers that were available in 1988-89. Apple IIs, greyscale Macs, an Amiga if you cared about graphic quality. None of these were used in the animation business at the time (that I know of, anyway-- graphical processing power just wasn\'t up to snuff). Anime was hand-drawn on cels, every single frame, 24 frames per second. Sometimes they will loop an animation and zoom out the camera to save a few yen, but that kind of shortcut breaks the illusion easily and was used sparingly. If the director or anyone in charge of production calls for a retake of a scene, it had to be redrawn, completely. If the colors were off, you didn\'t have color correction, you had to redraw it. Don\'t believe me? Watch Shirobako. They\'re not kidding when they say animation was extremely hard work in these days. Just as Steamboat Willie was state-of-the-art in its day, so was the animation in Lodoss War, and doubly so because OVAs allow a good production staff to take its time to make sure everything was right, unlike the mad dash of a weekly television series. Sure, showing the glint of the blade tip rather than the full animated swing is a shortcut, but it is undeniably effective (and no anime since has used this nearly as effectively). The animation staff knew exactly how to employ the imagination of the audience and draw them in. I\'m sorry to say, this is a lost art today largely because animators now have the tools to show us all the gory details, overload our senses, and leave plot and characterization in the dust.The soundtrack. Oh, yes, the soundtrack. The score\'s soaring battle themes evoke Carl Orff\'s Carmina Burana (which is fitting, because that was the soundtrack of the film Excalibur). The composer, while he\'s no Yoko Kanno (let alone Howard Shore, James Horner, or John Williams), nevertheless demonstrates his mastery of every section of the orchestra, from tracks that would probably evoke zombie apocalypses, to tracks that Vivaldi could\'ve written for a royal court, to tracks that could be the backdrop of Eomer\'s counterattack in The Two Towers. I usually don\'t remember anime soundtracks because they\'re totally unimpressive (or I remember them because they\'re terrible)-- I cannot say that about the soundtrack to Lodoss War.Adesso e Fortuna is the only anime song with a tango beat that I can remember (it\'s a slow tango-- listen to the bass line and the harp), and while romance isn\'t a particularly important part of the show until the final 3 episodes or so, it turns out to be a great match. The ending theme is good as well, but I never really got into it nearly as much.The voice acting is very well cast, written, directed, and performed. How do I know this? As another reviewer mentioned, there is chemistry. In the behind-the-scenes to Star Wars, we see that one reason why George Lucas cast (a very young and terrified) Carrie Fisher wasn\'t because of her Hollywood star parents, but because of her chemistry with Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill. If you want to see why casting matters, look at early deleted scenes of Star Trek: Voyager with a very different Captain Janeway. Poor casting (especially political casting) is never a benefit to a production, and thankfully here all the voices fit like gloves.Now, sure, it seems like an anime cliche-- fantasy theme, RPG party of a fighter, a mage, a healer, a dwarf, a thief, and an elf, now go and fight {dragon|evil warlord|wizard}. But you need to understand that you are watching the series that in my opinion set the standard for this genre. In fact, it probably did its job too well-- nearly every fantasy anime I\'ve seen since was either a cliched copy of this party, or a parody (intentional, in the case of Slayers, or otherwise, in the case of follow-up productions). Without a good script, the characters can\'t grow. Without good direction, the audience won\'t care about the characters. Here, the characters have depth, they don\'t remain who they are in the beginning, and they all have journeys, for good or ill. Good casting, great script, good direction.Part of me wishes that there are more episodes, and part of me dreads what happens when there isn\'t enough plot to go around. The pace is just right to me, and other than an introductory episode, there isn\'t much of ""jumping around"" to my recollection (which means I should rewatch the DVD). The story does meander a bit, and despite all the stuff happening, the show never loses its focus on the main cast. For all the liberties taken with the original RPG/novels, this is the best adaptation to animation, hands down.Am I biased in thinking this is the bar for all fantasy anime?

Damn straight I am, and proud of it too.', ""Record of Lodoss War is a basic high fantasy story that is carried by its gorgeous art, outstanding designs, and wonderful music.There's not much to say about the stories, characters, and themes. Your average RPG starter character Parn gets together with a group of RPG archetypes to go on a quest to stop a war orchestrated by some dark deity. The characters in the group are fine; they're not given much exploration, development, or backstory but they're each competent at what they do and their dialogue and interactions are fine. Deedlit falls into that category as well--- despite having an awesome character design that...suggests she would play a bigger role, she's just there to be the chick to Parn.The story opts to focus on fledgling hero Parn, who of course talks a lot about saving people and rushes into battle but doesn't have any of the fighting skill to back it up. He's pretty much a noob who tries to be a hero up until the very last episodes and it gets tiresome to watch him get bailed out by the other, much more competent characters in the group. The emphasis on Parn over the more capable and potentially more interesting members of the group severely hurts the story.Speaking of the story, the group also just doesn't do much in general; for the first 8 episodes or so they simply travel from place to place. There's nothing egregious about the plot (except for one thing), but it would have had some life if the battles that they fought were actually well animated. I understand it was 1990 and their budget was limited, but still the slowness and reliance on still frames for the action sequences limits their entertainment value. That's not to say the art is bad, though. The backgrounds and characters are beautifully drawn and really convey that classic fantasy setting.I was OK with the plot until they damseled Deedlit so that Parn could finally man up and save her. Not only did they damsel her, they also seemed to use this as an opportunity to sexualize her. This is a cardinal sin in my book- they took a character with a strong design and objectified her. When Parn saves her, they act like he's a big hero who's gone through a lot of development, but in reality he didn't learn much and his sword skills made an inexplicable jump from noob to master.Anyway, enough about the plot and characters. Let's talk about the art and design. Like I said, the art is gorgeous. The designs are some of the best I've seen in anime and in fantasy in general. Parn's suit is a great knight design and Deedlit's outfit, with its broad shoulder pads, is powerful and elegant. The face designs are among my favorite in anime. Each character's face is unique and handsomely constructed, achieving a perfect blend of anime beauty and realism. The male faces are actually handsome and not pretty in the feminine way that anime designs usually do it. Parn's eyes, in particular, do a lot to soften my dislike of him. The second series blindly discarded these face designs in favor of more generic ones.The music has an otherworldly beauty that capture the finest feelings of the fantasy genre, doing the job that the story and characters couldn't. The opening and ending songs feel like they embody the quintessential fantasy adventure aesthetic.The design and music alone make the series worth checking out, but don't expect too much from the actual story. suggests she would play a bigger role, she's just there to be the chick to Parn.The story opts to focus on fledgling hero Parn, who of course talks a lot about saving people and rushes into battle but doesn't have any of the fighting skill to back it up.

Not only did they damsel her, they also seemed to use this as an opportunity to sexualize her. This is a cardinal sin in my book- they took a character with a strong design and objectified her. When Parn saves her, they act like he's a big hero who's gone through a lot of development, but in reality he didn't learn much and his sword skills made an inexplicable jump from noob to master.Anyway, enough about the plot and characters. Let's talk about the art and design. Like I said, the art is gorgeous. The designs are some of the best I've seen in anime and in fantasy in general. Parn's suit is a great knight design and Deedlit's outfit, with its broad shoulder pads, is powerful and elegant. The face designs are among my favorite in anime. Each character's face is unique and handsomely constructed, achieving a perfect blend of anime beauty and realism. The male faces are actually handsome and not pretty in the feminine way that anime designs usually do it. Parn's eyes, in particular, do a lot to soften my dislike of him. The second series blindly discarded these face designs in favor of more generic ones.The music has an otherworldly beauty that capture the finest feelings of the fantasy genre, doing the job that the story and characters couldn't. The opening and ending songs feel like they embody the quintessential fantasy adventure aesthetic.The design and music alone make the series worth checking out, but don't expect too much from the actual story."", ""first anime I ever watched and i been hooked on the genre ever since!!!I just loved how it was basically an RPG come to life, tell me an epic story any day of the week!!! From start to finish character development/progression is prevalent in ALL characters, not just the main. even the villains have motivations for their actions. I honestly wish it was longer but even for 13 episodes it felt like an 'epic' tale without sacrificing the pacing at all.Depending on the time frame you pick this up, you may be off-put by the art style but for the early '90s this was gold,...pure animated goodness!!! though its been a while between this review and my actual watching of the show i can't recall the musical score being anything but appropriate. bass drops occurred in time with the action beats, not a whole lot of 'BIG EXPLOSION' moments but the fight choreography was impressive and well thought out between knights crossing swords with wizards chanting spells from the rear to assist everyone was in place where you would expect them to be and if they weren't... then things most likely didn't go well for the side that slipped up.All in all great work done well with lots of care and it shows. give it a view and see for yourself!!! pure animated goodness!!! though its been a while between this review and my actual watching of the show i can't recall the musical score being anything but appropriate. bass drops occurred in time with the action beats, not a whole lot of 'BIG EXPLOSION' moments but the fight choreography was impressive and well thought out between knights crossing swords with wizards chanting spells from the rear to assist everyone was in place where you would expect them to be and if they weren't... then things most likely didn't go well for the side that slipped up.All in all great work done well with lots of care and it shows. give it a view and see for yourself!!!"", ""This show is based on the first novel of THE classic Japanese high fantasy series. If you were born in the '60s or '70s (if you were Japanese) or '90s (if you were anywhere else) you must have heard of Lodoss at least once. The novel series was based on an actual TRPG playthrough of the series' writer Mizuno Ryou and his friends: the story involved was modified after the playthrough was done.This show cut down on almost every sidequest/filler within the novels, and some more: hence the story is abrupt, confusing, and not very well developed throughout the whole running time. The story has...a tendency to either jump between certain points in time, or not explain what happened between events. Notably, the transition from episode 5 to 6 was quite confusing, so much that I thought I'd turned on the wrong episode by accident. Also, no one gets any character development time, not even Parn, and if our protagonist is susceptible to this then no one is exempted. Deedlit is in love with Parn out of the blue because reasons, and everyone else are likewise cookie-cutter characters, such as the supportive wizard, the gruff dwarf fighter, the morally gray rogue, the mentor/father figure and king, the scheming advisor, etc. Expecting a well-woven, fantastic and complex story of a grand scale in a meager 13 episodes is the fastest way to disappoint yourself: Treat this show as an appendix to the novels, as a teaser video series of what a properly visualized Lodoss could have been, because the visuals, while a bit static (or borderline ridiculous) in a few key action scenes, are for the most part absolutely gorgeous and emblematic of the late 80's ~ early '90s aesthetics, with animators that worked on/would go on to animate incredible visuals from various works like Galaxy Express 999, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, RahXephon, Cowboy Bebop, and many more.This OVA series' greatest contribution to the otaku subculture is how they managed to perfectly animate Deedlit, arguably the most influential elf character in ALL of Japan--at least, in terms of character designs. Blonde, long and pointy ears, well-endowed with a slender frame, green clothing, nature something something, with a high chance of being a tsundere? That's from Deedlit. I can immediately think of five elf characters with similar hair and cloth color coding--and most of them originate from NSFW material. To say that Deedlit influenced EVERY female elf character in Japan since her creation might not be an overstatement. It's not just her character design though: Deedlit is probably the best 'character' (if anyone can properly be called so) in Lodoss, simply because she gets so much screentime even when it's not her turn to shine, in addition to having the best voice acting. Deedlit is strong and resourceful without being overpowered (unlike Parn), wise and composed (unlike Parn), haughty but not overbearing, compassionate yet level-headed, possesses unrivaled beauty, and, most importantly, has the power to significantly increase the budget of the sakuga and frames of every scene she's in while Parn stares at her or zones out into the distance. Truly the fantasy girl that every otaku wants.I talked more about Deedlit than the actual plot.

I like the theme of light/dark and balance. The characters are interesting, though not very complex. The art is really good. It has more detail than a lot of anime. And the music is really beautiful as well. I really wish there were more anime like this one out there, because in my...opinion, it truly is a masterpiece.If you have the choice, watch it subtitled. The dubbed version is pretty bad. I don't notice it much due to nostalgia, but when I pay attention to it, the dubbed version is noticeably bad in comparison.If you are looking for a good fantasy anime, one that isn't too complex, but also is quite enjoyable, I think this would make a really good choice. opinion, it truly is a masterpiece.If you have the choice, watch it subtitled.

It has a nostalgic appeal, but only because back in the 90s, we didn\'t have many options for medieval fantasy anime, and this scratched that itch.  It does have its good moments, but it is otherwise forgettable.Let\'s get this out of the way first: ""Record of Lodoss War"" is an adaptation of a D&D campaign run by the author.  No attempt is made to hide it.  The grand back story and world building by the DM/author are used for flavor and to motivate events, but...they otherwise have little connection to the story.  The characters are straight out of the early D&D manuals, and obvious choices at that: fighter, elf, dwarf, cleric, magic user, thief.  In episode 8, the group must have got their hands on a supplementary D&D manual, so they introduce a berserker.  The final battle is at the bottom of a multi-level dungeon, just as you expect.  Even villains seem to come straight from the D&D manual—you can pick out the chaotic evil and lawful evil villains the moment they appear on screen.In the end, what makes up the story?  A love story for the hero, training to become a better fighter, and a bit of a tragic love story in the background, all set in front of an eternal battle between light and dark.  This comfortable predictability makes it an excellent target for nostalgia.  The pacing becomes problematic as the series goes on—more characters, more stories, more viewpoints, and more exposition all slow things down towards the second half.  The story then lurches forward to meet an ending that it hasn\'t quite earned.  In the meantime, characters and plot seem to happen independently of each other.But it\'s not really that bad.  In spite of the cookie-cutter character concepts, the characters themselves are filled out and seem real.  We sympathize with heroes and villains alike.  The story treats its setting and characters with respect.  Finally, he animation and soundtrack are great—at least, much of the time.So if you can\'t get enough medieval fantasy, or if you\'re on a nostalgia kick, Record of Lodoss War is just what you need.

For what it was and when it was, it knocked it out of the park. Put on your nostalgia goggles for this one, folks.StoryDungeons and Dragons as an anime. All the classic stuff. Fighter, elf, dwarf, mage, cleric. They level up and fight stuff. Good vs. evil. There is a mirror evil team too.I believe that the story was a transcription of a D&D campaign so all the standard plot events were here. Gobins attacked our fighter's home village. He started adventuring, met allies, ran into enemies, and inserted himself in the middle of war between good and evil.Nothing...is new about this now. But I imagine it was groundbreaking material back then. It was for me when I first saw it.The real story took place in the first 7 or 8 episodes. The stuff that happened after seemed like an after thought. It was stakes and the conflict was resolved halfway through the season. Apparently, it was because the producers were adapting books couldn't find a good way to spread out the story over 13 episodes.In any case, the story is average at this point but really good in 1990 or if it is your first foray into the D&D world.CharactersThe characters were straightforward. Lodoss was actually my first dive into D&D. I liked fantasy things before then but never got the real D&D experience. As tropey as they were, they were new and fresh to me.Parn was our guy. He started as a low-level warrior and took his lumps as he leveled up. He made up for his lack of skill with his conviction to duty and honor. I found it refreshing that he got his ass kicked by just about everyone. He was a budding swordm and had to earn every inch of ground he got. In the first few episodes, he could barely hold his own against basic goblins and guards. He was the shonen protag.Deedlit is our gal. Waifu S-tier for sure. She just kind of showed up and fell in love with our guy. It was shallow, but how else were the producers going to maximize her screentime? I like that she acted like an elf. In the prologue, she haughty and a little childish, was at odds with the dwarf, and got distracted by random bling. She was madly in love with Parn for some reason. It seemed random, but I rolled with it just because it made for a good story. She was our original anime elf girl.The other members of the crew are basic but solid. My only gripe was that Etoh, the cleric, didn't really get to do anything cool until the last or second to last episode. And I thought he was a girl for most of the show.There was a mirror evil team too. Pretty cool group.ArtThe art was pretty good for the most part. The character designs were solid. The action was not good.The art seemed to focus on the faces. It's been a while since I watched it, but I remember the director zooming in on faces for dramatic reactions. The magic was cool. But the fighting was not well animated. The fighting used a lot of streaks of color and reused footage instead of showing the characters in motion. I remember hearing that it could have been a measure to conserve the budget. Who knows.The character designs were cool. I remember giant shoulder pads. Maybe this is where Warcraft got its inspiration.Deedlit is the character you're going to remember.SoundThe voice acting was good. Everybody sounded like they should. I wasn't sure if Etoh was a guy or a girl for most of it.The sound effects were okay. Nothing great but it was a professional production.I love the opening theme and visuals. It captured the epic fantasy romance feel perfectly. The OP is one of the best parts of the show.The ending theme was decent. Surprisingly, it was more upbeat than the OP. It was not as epic, sweet, or catchy as the OP but still got the fantasy vibe right. Decent song.EnjoymentLodoss was one of the first animes I saw.

Our characters do their character stuff complete with tension between the elf and the dwarf. It's cool as hell.But then after the first episode, things never get quite as good. The action isn't as good, the spells don't hit as hard, and the characters don't have their stereotypical moments. I mean, the rest of the show is still decent, but not as awesome as it could have been. They started on a high note but weren't able to keep it up with the art, action, or storytelling.Another thing is that the MC is underpowered for most of the show. It's a stark contrast to the OP MCs of modern isekais. I haven't seen too many isekais, but I'll say that being OP takes the piss right out of the story. If our guy is effortless, then what's it really all about? There's no tension. We are confident in our guy prevailing so I don't worry. I don't get invested. I like underpowered MCs because it makes the W feel earned.Parn got his ass kicked so much through the story. Toward the end, when he was finally making his way through the final castle, he was taking down normal baddies left and right and it felt good.  This was ROTJ Luke Skywalker handling shit.

The original material is beyond the scope of this review and is not a factor for consideration.Story: The story was well-executed with a solid grasp of promise, progress, payoff, and pacing. The yin-yang philosophy of the main theme of the show, that ""both light and darkness are essential"", was communicated in a very heavy-handed way because the narrator would continuously reinforce this point. The most egregious example of this being in the climax of the final episode when the narrator outright states that light and balance must coexist together and that the protagonist, Parn, must understand...this in order to become a true hero.Characters: The characters are generally well-written and distinctive, though some of them could really benefit from more growth and development. For example, the main male protagonist, Parn, never seemed to overcome his main personality flaw of being impulsive and so never developed as a character. Most of the antagonists also felt a little flat, though Ashram\'s character arc was very memorable and stands out form the rest.Visuals: Individual frames were extremely well-drawn - if one randomly pauses at any point in an episode, one would end up with a very well-illustrated still image (disregarding the lower resolution since it is an older show). The character designs exude personality and can be considered \'visually stunning\' even by today\'s standards - one could see exactly what type of person a character was just by the shapes of their faces and their facial features. However, the animation suffers in certain scenes and it is clear that the staff had to pull some budget away from certain scenes in order to fund climaxes: certain fights literally just amount a long shot of two characters standing still with the only motion in the frame being the awkward swinging of long swords, which is a real shame.Audio: The sound design was serviceable.

However, it is important to note that \'Lodoss-tou Senki\' was one of the very first series to introduce the Western fantasy genre to a Japanese audience. For this reason, I personally recommend all fans of the fantasy genre watch this show at least once, even though they might not like it. It is true that this show has not aged very well: The animation is somewhat stiff at times and the sound effects sound extremely dated.

For example, the main male protagonist, Parn, never seemed to overcome his main personality flaw of being impulsive and so never developed as a character. Most of the antagonists also felt a little flat, though Ashram\'s character arc was very memorable and stands out form the rest.Visuals: Individual frames were extremely well-drawn - if one randomly pauses at any point in an episode, one would end up with a very well-illustrated still image (disregarding the lower resolution since it is an older show).

However, while “Lodoss” has excellent music, nice artwork and character designs, every other aspect of this series, especially plot and character development, leaves a lot to be desired.The gist of the plot is that a wizard is trying to resurrect an evil goddess to rule and/or destroy the island of Lodoss, and a traditional party...led by a hero has to stop him. They are aided by a neighboring kingdom and a couple of rogue characters. On the villain’s side, there is some infighting, as a couple of characters don’t get along with the wizard. There’s also an “observer” whose alliance is left unclear, and seems to switch between the two sides. So, in essence, it’s a traditional good-versus-evil setup, which isn’t a bad thing, but the the narrative gets repetitive. It’s basically: fight the villain because they’re evil. Defeat them. Fight the next villain who is also bad just because. Rinse and repeat until you’re holding a half-naked elf woman in your arms.The plot sounds simple, but the story jumps around a lot, particularly in the first half of the series, so it can be difficult to follow. For instance, the first episode starts in medias res style, with events that chronologically happen around the middle of the series. Then from episode 2, it jumps back to the beginning, and there are also some flashbacks here and there that aren’t transitioned into well. In addition, the series mentions various kingdoms around the island, and we see characters traveling to and from these kingdoms, but we never get a sense of where these kingdoms are in relation to each other, or the distance between them. It would have been helpful if they had shown a map once in a while.The story does have a conclusive ending, but many key questions are left unanswered, especially regarding the fates of some of the main characters. One character, in particular, seems to have been forgotten by everyone else. A group of multicolored dragons is featured prominently in the opening sequence, and we start seeing some of them in the latter half of the series. However, one of them simply shows up and strikes a pose in the last episode, and doesn’t do anything after that. The significance of the dragons and their relation with the other inhabitants of the island are not explained well, if at all. We also never really learn much about the other races/species living on the island, or what lies outside of the island.As “Lodoss” was based off of a series of novels that were in turn based off of “Dungeons and Dragons” roleplaying sessions, the characters are about as archetypal as you can get. They don’t have any personalities beyond stereotypes, and we don’t get too much background information on them. Character motivations, particularly for the villains, are simplistic, contradictory or simply left unclear. There is a hint of development for two of the antagonists, but it’s too little, too late. It’s suggested at the end that the main protagonist has changed somewhat (as stated by the narrator), but we don’t actually see him change.As for technical aspects of this series, some of the artwork is good, particularly with regard to the character designs for Deedlit and the other female characters. The male characters, on the other hand, look rather plain to me. The backgrounds are also dull. The dragons have interesting designs, but due to the lack of animation, their fights are underwhelming. Regarding the animation, most of the time it’s not that fluid. Action scenes tend to rely on still shots and slideshow-type shots which use minimal animation. Occasionally, the characters appear to be off-model. About the only time the animation is actually good is during closeups of Deedlit’s face.As mentioned earlier, there is a lot of jumping around the timeline, and the scenes aren’t transitioned into very well, so the direction is not that great. The voice acting is decent, but due to the cliched dialogue, none of the actors really have a chance to shine here.The best thing about “Lodoss” is the music. I love the airy, ethereal feeling of the opening and ending themes; they really add to the atmosphere of the series. The insert song in the last episode, and all of the instrumental background music, are good as well.Regarding potentially objectionable content, this series is full of fighting (it’s called “Record of Lodoss *War*,” after all), and a couple of the many scenes in which people get killed or seriously injured are rather grotesque. There’s a slight bit of nudity in the last episode, and some implied nudity in the ending sequence. Also, it should be noted that most episodes of this series, especially around the beginning and end, have frequent flashing light effects, so caution is necessary while viewing this if you’re photosensitive.Overall, “Record of Lodoss War” is an important show that is watchable, but due to the confusing way the story is set up, as well as the lack of interesting characters, it’s not a particularly satisfying watch. The music and atmosphere of the series is nice, though, so if you don’t mind the lack of character development and having a bevy of key questions left unanswered at the end, you may enjoy watching this. led by a hero has to stop him.

Some things are a bit unclear that I don\'t think I missed yet go unexplained. The whole thing feels like a small part of a the novels it was adapted from. That said, you can follow along with what\'s happening for the most part so it could be worse. It\'s no Lord of the Rings but the story was absolutely fine for it\'s genre.Art - The art for me is really great, I\'m a sucker for the genre and this classic style. However, Deedlit and Pirotess\' ears really shot out...a bit too far. I guess they really wanted you to know they were elves. Just a small quirk of what otherwise is a pretty beautiful style, but may come off as ""boringly realistic"" to people who don\'t like that stuff. I however, loved it.Sound - So this is a real mixed bag. The quality ranges from poor to good. The sound effects are mostly actually quite good and never feel too stock. The music is also extremely hit or miss, and it\'s less about the writing of the music and more about the quality and whatever weird synth they used to make said music that sounds extremely fake for what\'s supposed to be a beautiful orchestral score. I think if it had a bigger budget this could have been ironed out. As it stands it\'s only ever distractedly bad a couple times and I\'ll forgive it.Character - I wish characters got fleshed out more, but the couple that did were pretty good. Parn is a decent MC if not a bit plain. Ashram was really cool as well as King Kashue. I wish they had more time to expand on the campaign characters as they feel largely glossed over and probably the anime was made for people who already knew the characters from the novel series. It doesn\'t make the story hard to follow but it just leaves me wanting in the character development department.Enjoyment - I actually quite liked this a lot. Some episodes are far better than others, sometimes the animation and budget really plummets and it gets unevenly cheap looking. However, I could see myself watching it again in the future. Easily one of the better series I\'ve seen lately. It left me a bit frustrated that it didn\'t have more episodes to expand on things or a bigger budget to really make the good ideas look better in execution. They did well with what they had I think.Overall - If you like that type of old school Swords and Sorcery through the lens of Japanese people you can hardly do better than Record of Lodoss War. It fulfills it\'s niche and if you don\'t fall into this western fantasy sort of fandom you may find it to be a dull or average watch. a bit too far.

The protagonist is a village-boy-turned-swordsman, his love interest is an elf, they’re joined by a priest, a wizard, a dwarven warrior, and a thief. They fight against evil wizards, dark elves, orc-like beastmen, and ultimately an evil kingdom, all of which are in service of resurrecting an evil god. They meet various allies throughout the series, including kings, lords, and mercenaries. They explore ruins and travel the land.If you’re a fan of fantasy novels or video games, all of this probably sounds fairly familiar. I don’t know what Japanese audiences would have...thought, but Lodoss is rather cliché. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing, of course. Cliché stories can be comforting (eg. in the form of nostalgia) or sources of easy entertainment. And even a bad story (cliché or not) can be saved by having exciting or complex characters. But this is where the first real problem with Lodoss’ writing emerges: the characters aren’t particularly great.Of maybe half a dozen major characters, only one, the protagonist Parn, sees anything resembling character development. Parn starts out as a reckless teenager who doesn’t know how to use a sword. Over the course of Lodoss, he learns how to use a sword, becomes less reckless, and appears to mature at least a little. However, these changes are rather superficial. Parn is fundamentally the same person at the beginning of the story, in the middle of the story, and at the end of the story. Likewise, Parn never seems conflicted or in doubt about his choices, nor does he ever despair in the face of evil. Parn’s entire personality and character arc could be summarized with one word: protagonist.The other characters don’t differ, really. They all fit into familiar archetypes, none of them demonstrate any hidden depths or complex motivations, and, unlike Parn, none of them have any kind of character growth. None of this is to say that there aren’t any likeable characters – Ghim, Woodchuck, and Ashram all stood out for me – but for every likeable character, you can probably find at least one or two who feel superfluous. For example, I can vaguely recall both Slayn the wizard and Etoh the priest doing things, but neither really felt integral to the plot, despite being two of Parn’s companions.A lot of these problems with characterization could be solved if Lodoss was better paced. Lodoss’ pacing is odd. The OVA was adapted from a series of novels; however at the time, only the first three of seven novels had been published, and only three more would be published by the OVA’s conclusion. And whilst those novels were, in turn, adapted from a DnD campaign run by the author and his friends, at best that would have only provided an outline to the production company. Whilst one can’t know for sure, I suspect that this had some impact on the production, pacing, and writing of the episodes.Lodoss’ first episode is in media res, taking place probably around the same time as episode six. It doesn’t really spare much time in introducing the characters. As a story about six companions adventuring in a dungeon, it’s pretty entertaining, but I admittedly found it hard to follow at times, especially when it cut away from our heroes to focus on conversations being had by various villains and supporting characters. The second episode is the true beginning of the story, and from there the series progresses normally. Lodoss is primarily about a war staged between the evil empire of Marmo and the various other kingdoms of Lodoss, and this war transpires over the course of the series. However, for the first eight episodes, at least some of the narrative focus is on Ghim’s quest to find a young woman, Leylia, who had disappeared some years before. These eight episodes are probably the best part of the series, and if the story told during them had been expanded to the full thirteen episodes, I suspect that many of my complaints regarding characterization would have been moot.Unfortunately, after episode eight, Lodoss’ story takes a nosedive. The last five episodes concern the bulk of the war against Marmo, and five episodes isn’t enough to tell the story of a war. Often times, I felt as I were missing something – as if, for example, the characters had decided something or come to some realization between episodes. I’ll admit that I had trouble maintaining interest by this point, so I may simply have missed something, but these final episodes definitely felt rushed when compared to the eight that preceeded them.If there is a bright spot to Lodoss, it is the fantastic art. The characters designs are all richly detailed and are an interesting blend of Eastern and Western art styles. Any one of the characters wouldn’t look out of place in a DnD manual from the eighties. On the other hand, the animation leaves something to be desired. I’m not the greatest judge of these kinds of things, but I suppose one expects a bit more fluidity from an OVA, whereas Lodoss – character designs aside – felt more like a television series in terms of quality. That’s maybe not the best way of putting it, but I’m not an art guy. The color palette is also more muted when compared to other fantasy anime (such as Slayers), though I think that’s fitting given how seriously Lodoss takes itself.As I mentioned before, I think that Lodoss would have been more enjoyable overall had the story arc of the first eight episodes been extended to all thirteen. However, as it is, I don’t think Lodoss is without it’s appeal. It is a solid, if predictable and cliché fantasy story, and I suspect those with an interest in the fantasy genre will find something to enjoy here, whether it be the nostalgia or the art. Likewise, I don’t know how faithful it is to the novels, but I imagine fans of the novels would appreciate the OVA, as well (and perhaps get a lot more out of it). Then again, fans of the novels might take issue with any deviations the OVA made, and given the OVA was being released before the series was fully published, I can imagine there were a few.However, you probably already know whether Lodoss is the kind of series that will interest you.

The characters are really what sell this show. The first few episodes are a bit slow and honestly felt like just another fantasy story, but those episodes really help with...the character development and get you invested in them, because by the end of this OVA at least there are things that happen that really make you appreciate those earlier episodes.Overall I had an absolute blast with this series.

Just to put it out there, I love High Fantasy, I love LOTR, Game of Thrones, Frieren: Beyond Journeys End, Berserk and so on. But this was awful. First issue is the series has to much ambition for 13 episodes which leads to way too much being skip over. Another issue is that none of the characters are likeable, especially Parn, and they receive zero development and their relationships feel hollow as a result. The world building is lacklustre as well. Decent music tho.If you care about characters and interesting world building, don't watch this show, watch the things I previously...mentioned. You might enjoy this if some switch your brain off and watch fantasy is what you're after, but it was not what I was after.The art did have that nice 90s retro feel tho, so thats a plus. mentioned.

Decided to give a shot fantasy type anime so here we go.Lodoss-tou Senki or Record of Lodoss war is you standard medieval high magic type adventure anime, you got your hero swordsman, elfs, dwarfs, wizard, evil warlods/witches/magicians trying to take over the world, orcs, goblins, kobolds, and most important dragons. Its inspired by a novel who also took inspiration from a tabletop game and it shows. With that out of the way lets dive into the...aspects of the  anime.Story: Parn is a not so good swordman from a village that got attacked by a group of goblins, after helping fend then off with the help of Deedlit the elf, and others.

She is elven royalty that really cares about her people, uses nature based magic, and she is very cute i guess.

Despite its brief 1-2 minute runtime, it masterfully tells a compelling story about a little shark girl named Kozame embarking on an adventure. Even then, the show has quite strong story building for each episode. The show itself is great to watch whenever you want a little ""kawaii""-ness to your daily life.Anyway, in this review, I\'ll try to score the show in 7 aspects:...story (80), character design (60), acting (50), visual-CGI (40), theme (30), sound-music (10), and enjoyment bias (30). The final score is weighted average based on the score I provided.Story & World Building: 9The show\'s limited runtime might seem restrictive for world-building around Kozame\'s adventures, but with a total of 60 episodes released, it\'s safe to say the show executes its story quite well. Despite its brief episodes, Odekake Kozame manages to develop a charming and engaging narrative.Personally, there\'s not much more to say about the story—it’s a typical Slice of Life + CGDCT-esque series instead.Additionally, keep your eyes on the ending song scene! You\'ll find some easter eggs that also kept progressing each episode. It is really a nice touch to give Kozame more personality, ngl.Character Design: 10It\'s Kozame, the little shark, of course she\'s cute. XDJoke aside, for its simple art design, the design of the characters appeared on the show did successfully made the show to give a cute, calming impression.Acting: 10I personally think that Kana Hanazawa did a perfect job to voice Kozame with her soothing, cute vibe... although Kozame talks nonsense lmfao. And yes, only humans can talk properly, shocker.Albeit that, seiyuu of side casts performed well done and matches to their respective character design.Visual & CGI: 9If you\'ve seen some special shorts (like in mini/chibi anime), this anime exactly have the same art style. While the previous statement is true, it\'s a perfect match for this SoL-Adventure-esque show.No need flashy art to lure newcomers, or adding unnecessary CGI to aid production, it did really great job to convey the vibe they want to share about.Theme Accuracy: 10Does this show is telling about Kozame\'s daily adventure/first errand? Yes, \'till the end. Was this show a SoL? Indeed. Is this show great to watch whenever you feel down or want something cute? Absolutely!Additionally, this score section was more an extended scoring from Story since I believed that Synopsis, Genres & Themes, and even PV can affect this score as first impression, so you can dismiss this score instead.SFX & Music, Theme Song: 8Did you ever heard a little shark singing in gibberish? If no, this show can give that impression! XDSFX wise, personally think that some factors need to be improve even more, so it can give watcher more ""depth"" to the show, not just with Kozame\'s ◯▲☆■～ (aka her gibberish) noises.Enjoyment Bias: 10It\'s a cute show where\'s the episode length is good enough to heal yourself. Heck, it already convinces me to rewatch this show whenever I feel wanted to, or when I feel down—it\'s not surprising it does help me to get back where I supposed to be cheerful. Plus, I listed this series and Kozame as my personal favorites already... So that\'s explains why it got 10/10 score in this section.It\'s recommended to watch this series 1 episode a day, so you won\'t feel missing something hopefully.Conclusion: ★10 (w: 9.53, avg: 9.43) story (80), character design (60), acting (50), visual-CGI (40), theme (30), sound-music (10), and enjoyment bias (30).

This is where the special came along just to give additional service in the series. The special doesn’t add up in the storyline but it does make some entertainment to the Pandora heart fans. The special is the complete opposite of the series because it focuses on complete comedy while using the former dramatic soundtrack which reminds to watch the show again. Pandora Heart has a small nostalgia for me but still I won’t be watching it again because I fear I may have a different view now than back when I was a happy go lucky watchers who doesn’t critically analyzes shows.Overall (4/10) Mediocrefor even Pandora’s Heart Specials is pulling the same gag that other short minute anime special provides. The only reason I didn’t give a rate between 2-3 is because of the nostalgia the soundtrack provides and how I like the characters back then. The art style is the same with the original. I highly recommend this to only to “pandora’s heart fan” that haven’t seen this episodes yet. This special is only good for fan service for the fans of this series. I won’t recommend it to others who haven’t finished the original series.Important Reminders for People who haven’t watched Pandora’s Heart:As I stated before the anime is incomplete so the mystery part is still questionable for there are still lots of mysteries unanswered and left you thinking. The anime is more like promoting the manga so if you want a forward story I highly recommend the reading manga for it surely continues what the anime left off and explain it more properly.The sole purpose of this review is to remind the “Pandora’s Heart fans” that there is a spin-off special they should watch and also to encourage the people who haven’t watch the anime yet better off to read the manga since the anime is incomplete.I hope this review is a great help to you guys Gilbert Nightray to uncover the truth and discover how alice is related to the dark history the novel families hides.

Pokemon Movie 02: Maboroshi no Pokemon Lugia Bakutan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1117/Pokemon_Movie_02__Maboroshi_no_Pokemon_Lugia_Bakutan,"[""Honestly I find this to be the best of all of the Pokemon movies. And after this, well, they just steadily got worse and worse.The story was gorgeous, and the music was gorgeous!I'm giving it 10/10 because, well. That's how I feel about it.I'm not one to give away spoilers but let's just say this one has to do with the legendary birds and gets really heated and epic. Plus, who doesn't love Lugia? AND LUGIA'S VOICE. Might as well have been Morgan Freeman (in the dub, that is. And I'm not one who usually even likes dubs. Of course I was a...kid when I first watched this...)Amazing. kid when I first watched this...)Amazing."", 'Probably one of the best Pokémon movies out there. The story was brilliant, an amazing job for Lugia’s voice (dubbed), the art was cool, and all in all, this is one of my favorite movies in the entire series!And then there’s the Guardian’s song. It made my neck hairs stand, and all I could do was gaze at the television screen. Absolutely majestic.POKEMON!!!! ', 'I remember it was my 5th birthday and I was staying at a hotel. (17 now) but I had seen the commercials for this movie and played the pokemon monopoly game along with all the video games. When my mom handed me a gift that was wrapped in normal newspaper. I had received the first movie for my birthday along with the 2nd one for Christmas the next year. I was the happiest person than anyone in the world and I really loved looking at the cover art. But my favorites would definitely have to be this one and the third one.Even though they...have started changing the way the movies look by adding 3d backgrounds and its getting kind of ridiculous with the number of movies they have come out with. You gotta admit the first couple of movies were the best. I had always supported this series since the day it came out and I know a lot of people hold this series deep in their hearts because they grew up with it and we will probably watch them with out kids. But I just have to say that I love pokemon forever and always. have started changing the way the movies look by adding 3d backgrounds and its getting kind of ridiculous with the number of movies they have come out with.

But I just have to say that I love pokemon forever and always.', 'For those of you who weren\'t around in \'00, or were too young to remember, Pokemon\xa0was still at an early point. Before there were a billion games including spin-offs and enough merchandise to bankrupt an entire nation.\xa0And we were all eagerly anticipating Silver & Gold\xa0in 2001. What\'s that? You got those games considerably earlier? Well, in the EU we got them in early 2001. In any case, we were all gathering every scrap of information we could and this film promised us a first look at Lugia, even though the games were already out elsewhere and we\'d seen her image on the Internet. Regardless, a...lot of people were excited to see this film in theatres. I wasn\'t allowed to because we were poor and theatre tickets for me and all three of my siblings were pricey. But I do remember what a big deal this was for a lot of people my age. I\'m still not going easy on it.Story:We open with a collector, we\'ll call him Kivas Fajo, in his advanced aircraft base. He\'s after the legendary birds, Moltres, Articuno and Zapdos. He hopes to acquire them and draw out Lugia so he can capture it as well. Then he\'ll make them all wear their outfits, sit in their chairs and entertain his guests. Little does Kivas realise that capturing the birds will throw the planet out of balance causing upheavals and, possibly, the end of the world. It\'s naturally up to Satoshi and his companions to deal with the situation.Now, I\'m not going to worry about spoilers too much since the Pokemon anime is kind of predictable and formulaic. Plus this film is around twenty years old if we\'re going by the original Japanese release. So, moving on to the first problem with the narrative. Kivas suffers from a serious case of ""dumb villain."" This dude accidentally brings Satoshi and his group aboard his airship, then he leaves them alone so they can easily interfere with his operation and foil his plans. Another problem is that the film has a lot of pointless moments. All the Pokemon converging on the islands for the confrontation and then doing fuck all, the scenes with Professor Ookido & Satoshi\'s mum, they just don\'t seem to contribute anything.You might argue that the Pokemon converging is to illustrate the importance of taking action even when things look bleak, but they actually do nothing so it doesn\'t really work.The best thing I can say for the narrative is that it has some pretty neat action moments. The whole fight sequence with the birds is pretty amazing. The Lugia reveal is also nicely done. The film shows a lot of bubbling underwater and uses a bunch of other tricks to obfuscate Lugia\'s appearance before finally bringing it out at the climax in a massive jet of water. It\'s a strong, well-paced reveal.Characters:The characters are kind of under-written and not very interesting. Satoshi does whine too much for my taste. One thing worth mentioning, however, is that Satoshi\'s companions are basically useless while Team Rocket acts heroically. Which is a weird decision. You wouldn\'t expect a children\'s work to give the spotlight to the petty villains.But it does. Kasumi & Kenji help pull Satoshi out of the water once and that\'s basically it. Aside from that they stand around picking particles out of their anuses. And Pikachu was already working on getting Satoshi to shore. So, if Pikachu had thought to grab Lapras\' pokeball from Satoshi\'s bag, they would have been completely pointless. They don\'t even bring out their Pokemon to try to free Zapdos & Moltres from their cages. Musashi and Kojirou bring out Arbok and Weezing. They also go to Satoshi\'s rescue when he comes to an impasse and things look hopeless. Then they dodge attacks from legendary birds to get him to the artefact he needs to save the world. And they very nearly sacrifice themselves so the world can be saved.Art:The artwork looks fine. Kivas\' airship looks a bit out of place when compared to the rest of the art. There\'s also a fail with Doctor Uchikido\'s completely ambivalent facial expression while she talks about the potential end of the world. The action sequence with the birds is the highlight in terms of art. And seeing Lugia use Aeroblast is really cool. The whole sequence with Musashi and Kojirou taking an inflatable raft up through a bunch of caverns looks cool even if it does not follow proper laws of physics. The sequence with a speed boat going up stairs is the same way, except not nearly as cool looking.Sound:The acting is pretty good, actually. Hayashibara Megumi is always great. Miki Shinichiro does a good job. Hiramatsu Akiko & Matsumoto Rica are both good. If there\'s a weakness it\'s Kaga Takeshi as Kivas. And that\'s not so much his fault as it is a natural result of him getting a boring character who isn\'t very expressive. The music works decently enough.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any. It\'s not like the Pokemon franchise is going to toss in an Utena reference or something.Areas of Improvement:Make the villain basically competent. If our heroes had to actually sneak aboard and make their way to his collection, it would make for a more interesting sequence than him just letting them loose without watching them. You could even have Kasumi & Kenji create a distraction so they can actually do something of value.Either have all those Pokemon try to interfere with the battle or leave them out. Like I said, the sequences with all of them converging just end up being pointless since they just watch and lick their own genitals.Have Doctor Uchikido show some emotion. If the world is ending, you aren\'t going to look vaguely bored like it\'s a situation you get every Thursday. There\'s a difference between composure and just not giving a shit and her reaction is very much not giving a shit.Final Thoughts:If I were watching this as a youngster back when it first came out, I\'d probably enjoy it in the moment and quickly forget all the details. Watching it now, however, it does not hold up very well. While it has some good moments and the basic artwork and acting generally work well, the antagonist is forgettable and overly stupid. There are too many ""plot points"" that do nothing and too many characters who sit around scratching their asses. Ultimately, I\'ll give it a 5/10. It\'s one of those mundane children\'s films that has quite a few obvious issues because the writing staff didn\'t really care or think kids would really notice. lot of people were excited to see this film in theatres.

The beginning, which lay out the basis of the story, also seemed a little short/incomplete. It simply could have had... more in it.Of course this movie...also lacked the emotional charge of the first one. A decent movie, better than some of the episodes, but when it's put into comparison with something better, it is easy to see they could have put more effort into storytelling and add a little more depth.Also, I've never really found the Pokémon's telepathic voices to fit them. I don't know why. They just seem odd, especially Lugia's in this one.Not a bad movie, though. Very watchable. also lacked the emotional charge of the first one.

Very watchable."", 'The second movie in the mighty franchise and once again throws the hero Ash into a deep story revolving around Legendary Pokemon.The story revolves around the 3 main characters of the second series of Pokemon - Ash, Misty and Tracey. The three heroes are joined by the energetic captain Maren and her sister Melody.The main storyline of this film is fufilling the prophacy which was laid down from generation to the next and stopping the great pokemon collector Lawrence III from stealing Lugia, Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres.The art was decently good as expected from the series and the soundtrack is very well made and...is quite extensive.Unforutnatly as with the rest of the Pokemon Series, the characters are quite plain and two dimensional. Though this can be overcome by the wide variaty of characters in it. Even including another talking psychic pokemon which provides and humorous touch to the series along with the useless bumbling Team Rocket.The Movie itself is quite enjoyable and his overall is great but it can be held back by the lack of character personalility but other than this it is quite a good film to watch.

Any Pokemaniacs will want to see this film', 'The second Pokemon movie is a step down from the first one in almost every way. This doesn\'t have to be a condemnation in and of itself, but when your movie doesn\'t have enough new elements to replace watered down or missing older ones, then problems appear.The most obvious difference between the first and the second movie is the setting. The first movie was set inside a bulbeous lovecraftian castle shrouded by a terrifying storm. There was no attempt at topping this and while bigger doesn\'t always equal better, this time the setting of the movie ends up underwhelming. It revolves around a generic tropic...archipelago. Still, while the location is unremarkable, the movie does toy with viewer\'s expectations by using the plot to turn this tropical paradise into a cold wasteland.When discussing Pokemon movies, symbolism, foreshadowing and subtle set ups and payoffs don\'t generally come to mind. Neither does scientific accuracy nor explanations of any kind. This is because latter movies utilize magic by default, ushering in the age of ""anything goes"". This isn\'t the norm early in the series, although the first glimpses of this trend are being set in this movie, which will be discussed further on. Still, all is not bad. As plot progresses and natural disasters strike, we get a wonderful scene of Professor Oak improvising an explaination of the shifting ocean currents to journalists using a notebook and a pen. Scenes like this give the movie unique flavor and let us immerse ourselves in the world easier. I wish we got more like this in later movies. Here they let us understrand the threat and which exact things are at stake. Due to moments like this we can believe the Pokemon world is a tangible alternate reality instead of a bog-standard fantasy rollercoaster experience.Unfortunately, we also get a flat villain with a magical castle that makes no sense and the movie is happy to just not bother explaining anything. Used as a plot necessity (that\'s really not neccesary), the flying castle is one of the low points of the movie. Fortunately, its design is nice to the eyes. Seeing the villain, Lawrence, quickly characterized as a member of wealthy nobility (grand European art and arhitecture included), really pulls these elements out of the gutter even if it acts as duck-tape.The first movie featured some nice references for adults. For example, the clone production machine\'s shape was clearly inspired by the Fibonacci squence, implying the universal likeness of all life in its conception. I haven\'t noticed any lofty nods to the audience in this movie, which is a shame.While there was some interesting subtext among character interactions, there was no payoff in the end. Any complexities characters could\'ve had were ultimately played for laughs, while conclusions and follow ups were not bothered with. This, along with some points raised previously, grounds the movie firmly in the mindless action camp.With the movie not bothering to make characters and locations interesting, its plot would need a miracle to end up written well. And so it wasn\'t. Fortunately for the movie, action was good and the high stakes were communicated successfuly. The action scenes were where real care went and it shows. Some credit should also be given to the atmosphere. The strength of nature and wilderness were successfuly communicated, pushing the bland sections into enjoyable territory with some good visual theming.Considering this movie\'s budget was the same as the previous, but the movie achieved much less in pretty much every area, it can be considered a disapointment. It was eclipsed by the vastly more complex and emotionally gripping predecessor and marks a point where we can safely say that Pokemon movies decided to settle for less, never to recapture the qualities of the first one.Still, was it a bad movie? I\'ll have to go with a firm no. While the complexities were done away with, the stakes, action and setting were different enough to stand out as their own adventure. ""The Power of One"" is watchable without many frustrations, but also devoid of ambition. Even if you\'re not a Pokemon fan you could have a mildly fun time with this one. archipelago.

Everyone knew what it was, your mom, your teacher, your boss, everyone. While the first movie was already a worldwide success, it's with the second one that the staff seemed to become aware of the fact that the franchise is a big deal even outside of Japan. As a result, unlike the eccentric and culturally-rooted Mewtwo Strikes Back, Revelation Lugia is more culturally independent and safe. Instead of a dark story about a Atom-Godzilla-Tetsuo hybrid letting out its existential wrath over humanity, we got a more...conventional action-oriented movie in the spirit of a hollywood blockbuster.The second movie takes place during the Orange Archipelago journeys in the TV series and as such the location is much more naturalistic compared to the first film. Despite this, the movie still manages to bring back some of the weirdly futuristic technology in the form of the main antagonist's flying aircraft castle thingy. While the first movie was almost entirely carried by Mewtwo, the second movie's main villain is just an excuse to get a conflict going. The actual replacement for Mewtwo is Lugia, who's supposed to be the star of the film, but ends up being a big disappointment by comparison as its role is highly limited. Instead of being a pivotal player to the resolution of the conflict, its main purpose is to carry Satoshi around as the plot decided he's very important for collecting the dragon ba-- I mean, the three sphery thingies that bring balance to the world or whatever. Lugia is barely even a character, especially when compared to the ambitious characterization that Mewtwo received, and as such there is not much to it besides the fact that it was a nice teaser for the upcoming second generation of pokemon games at the time (RIP Ho-oh).Speaking of games, this movie's story could be from a videogame as there is barely any logic to how the conflict is ultimately resolved, unless of course you're familiar with videogame logic. Just like Link can gain access to the master sword after collecting three mcguffins and playing a song on his ocarina, so do the birds stop their fighting after Satoshi collects three mcguffins and Furuura plays a song on her flute (that looks like an ocarina; go figure). This wouldn't be too bad if it resulted in a fun adventure-type story but it doesn't. Satoshi finds two of the mcguffins by coincidence and then only has to collect one last one, for which he surfs along the ocean for like half an hour dodging bird attacks nonstop. So really, there is no point to collecting three spheres other than trying to stay as true to the videogame convention as possible.This is overall the biggest issue with the movie: It's just one long-ass bird fight. There is very little variety to the action. Sure, Team Rocket does help at one point, but they are not changing the direction of the plot in any way. Satoshi is still surfing on the ocean dodging what is essentially beam attacks. The first movie wasn't known for its exciting action sequences either but at least there was variation, a point and a sense of progression to every action scene. We got Mewtwo's battles for Giovanni, the opening battle with Satoshi, the battle of three starters and then the final showdown. What can I say about the second movie's fights? There is bird vs bird and bird vs bird and two birds teaming up against a bird and all birds teaming up against Lugia... it all just merges together into one long-ass bird fght.The dramatically lowest point of the story, where everything seems lost, is when the villain suddenly intervenes and tries to catch Lugia and both Satoshi and Lugia lose consciousness. This is supposed to mirror the dramatically lowest point of the first film, where Satoshi gets hit by Mewtwo's and Mew's attacks, but it's just pathetic by comparison.If there is one aspect this movie does better than the first then it's in getting across a sense of world-shattering stakes due to the effects on the environment and the people and creatures being shown, yet when it comes to the micro-interactions between the key players in the story it's all superficial. What is the relationship between the main antagonist and the main characters? There is simply nothing, just one scene where they tell him to at least use pokeballs. What is the relationship between Lugia and the other birds? They just hate each other because, and Lugia acts like a mediator because. So as a result, all the tense moments fall flat because there is nothing that connects the two opposing factions. How come the first movie had such an ambituous concept for the villain's motifs yet the second movie barely cares about the reason and resolution behind the conflict? I think this comes down to what I said in the beginning. This is a pokemon movie for a worldwide audience. Similar to how certain japanese videogames get dumped down for the western release because they would be too difficult for us western scrubs, so seemed to be the attitude when approaching the design of this movie. Anything as ambitious as the conflict of the first movie would’ve been too much to appeal to a worldwide audience, and as a result, it became a mindless movie for a mindless audience.If you are a diehard pokemon fan and wanna see a braindead pokemon action-flick then this one does the job far better than the other braindead action flicks in the franchise's movie series. Otherwise there is very little content in it compared to some of the other films and you might get bored as a result. conventional action-oriented movie in the spirit of a hollywood blockbuster.The second movie takes place during the Orange Archipelago journeys in the TV series and as such the location is much more naturalistic compared to the first film.

The actual replacement for Mewtwo is Lugia, who's supposed to be the star of the film, but ends up being a big disappointment by comparison as its role is highly limited. Instead of being a pivotal player to the resolution of the conflict, its main purpose is to carry Satoshi around as the plot decided he's very important for collecting the dragon ba-- I mean, the three sphery thingies that bring balance to the world or whatever. Lugia is barely even a character, especially when compared to the ambitious characterization that Mewtwo received, and as such there is not much to it besides the fact that it was a nice teaser for the upcoming second generation of pokemon games at the time (RIP Ho-oh).Speaking of games, this movie's story could be from a videogame as there is barely any logic to how the conflict is ultimately resolved, unless of course you're familiar with videogame logic. Just like Link can gain access to the master sword after collecting three mcguffins and playing a song on his ocarina, so do the birds stop their fighting after Satoshi collects three mcguffins and Furuura plays a song on her flute (that looks like an ocarina; go figure). This wouldn't be too bad if it resulted in a fun adventure-type story but it doesn't. Satoshi finds two of the mcguffins by coincidence and then only has to collect one last one, for which he surfs along the ocean for like half an hour dodging bird attacks nonstop. So really, there is no point to collecting three spheres other than trying to stay as true to the videogame convention as possible.This is overall the biggest issue with the movie: It's just one long-ass bird fight. There is very little variety to the action. Sure, Team Rocket does help at one point, but they are not changing the direction of the plot in any way. Satoshi is still surfing on the ocean dodging what is essentially beam attacks. The first movie wasn't known for its exciting action sequences either but at least there was variation, a point and a sense of progression to every action scene. We got Mewtwo's battles for Giovanni, the opening battle with Satoshi, the battle of three starters and then the final showdown. What can I say about the second movie's fights? There is bird vs bird and bird vs bird and two birds teaming up against a bird and all birds teaming up against Lugia... it all just merges together into one long-ass bird fght.The dramatically lowest point of the story, where everything seems lost, is when the villain suddenly intervenes and tries to catch Lugia and both Satoshi and Lugia lose consciousness. This is supposed to mirror the dramatically lowest point of the first film, where Satoshi gets hit by Mewtwo's and Mew's attacks, but it's just pathetic by comparison.If there is one aspect this movie does better than the first then it's in getting across a sense of world-shattering stakes due to the effects on the environment and the people and creatures being shown, yet when it comes to the micro-interactions between the key players in the story it's all superficial. What is the relationship between the main antagonist and the main characters? There is simply nothing, just one scene where they tell him to at least use pokeballs. What is the relationship between Lugia and the other birds? They just hate each other because, and Lugia acts like a mediator because. So as a result, all the tense moments fall flat because there is nothing that connects the two opposing factions. How come the first movie had such an ambituous concept for the villain's motifs yet the second movie barely cares about the reason and resolution behind the conflict? I think this comes down to what I said in the beginning. This is a pokemon movie for a worldwide audience. Similar to how certain japanese videogames get dumped down for the western release because they would be too difficult for us western scrubs, so seemed to be the attitude when approaching the design of this movie. Anything as ambitious as the conflict of the first movie would’ve been too much to appeal to a worldwide audience, and as a result, it became a mindless movie for a mindless audience.If you are a diehard pokemon fan and wanna see a braindead pokemon action-flick then this one does the job far better than the other braindead action flicks in the franchise's movie series. Otherwise there is very little content in it compared to some of the other films and you might get bored as a result."", ""This is another nostalgia inducing movie. The good old days of Pokemon before it started going through extreme changes. It has many old favorites, many legendary Pokemon, and good villains. I cannot remember it in extreme detail, but, if you haven't watched this Pokemon movie yet, I highly recommend it. It is pure enjoyment and overall will likely just make you feel good. If you are highly critical or dislike childish things, maybe this isn't for you, but if you just like to sit back and relax at something without a horribly complex plot, this is really good for that. Thanks for reading. "", ""This is my favourite pokemon movie :) i love lugia's song, beautiful music "", ""hands down this is my favorite pokemon movie ever. i know that again like most pokemon movies, they don't have a direct tie to the show but that's just fine with me. i liked the whole idea of this movie and it gave me the familiar feel that i got when watching the old pokemon show. i liked the original voice of the characters and the new ones along with the music that goes along with it, i have some of it on my ipod to prove that ^^ i really enjoyed this movie for the use of the legendary birds and the role lugia...was able to place into it. lugia will always be the guardian to the seas in my eyes was able to place into it. lugia will always be the guardian to the seas in my eyes"", 'The world of Pokemon can be a strange, wonderful, and often terrifying place.  Along with humans and a select few diminutive and unimpressive animals, this world is inhabited by a race of peculiar creatures known as, of course, Pokemon.  These creatures come in all shapes and sizes, from tiny moles and worms to giant whales and rock-snakes, and while some of the smaller ones might make good pets, almost all of them are capable of devastating feats.  It’s understandable that some people may give Pokemon a wide berth, avoiding them at all costs, but there are a few brave souls among us...who dare to encounter them up close and personal on a regular basis, bettering themselves in order to overcome any obstacle the world’s Pokemon might put forth.  We call them Pokemon Trainers, and the very best among them, who’ve captured or at least owned one sample out of every known Pokemon, are considered Pokemon Masters!  Of course, realistically, there can only be one Pokemon Master, as a select few Pokemon are one-of-a-kind, and capturing just one of them destroys the chances for anyone else to achieve said accolade.  Seriously, what’s up with that?Among these unique creatures are the legendary birds, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.  These Titans of unimaginable elemental power live on a series of islands near Shamouti in the Orange Islands region, engaged in an ancient stalemate over their territory, unknowingly guarding the dormant beast of the sea.  Should any one of those three be captured and removed from the scenario, that beast will roar to life and throw the world into chaos.  This legend has attracted the attention of Lawrence III, a Pokemon collector with a hunger for the rare and valuable.  Using his incredible technology, he has every intention of capturing these titans in order to lure out the beast of the sea...  Who he believes to be the legendary Lugia.  Unfortunately for him, an old prophecy states that when the balance of power taming the beast becomes perturbed, a chosen one can step in and make things right again!  And as it just so happens, Ash Ketchum and his friends are passing through the area on the way to their next Orange Islands gym battle, when they wind up getting dragged into the conflict.  When the world turns to ash, will one of these brave souls step up and take the world’s fate into their own hands?  Or will humanity become the next one-of-a-kind species?Remember in my review of the first movie, how I said it struck the right balance between CG and 2D animation, and that the balance would get progressively worse with each passing movie?  This is where it starts, and oh boy does it get off to a noticeable start.  Right off the bat, we’re shown Lawrence’s Castle in the Sky, a giant floating base somehow kept in the air by slowly turning propellers.  If this movie had come out a few years later, it would probably be paired with Feel Good Inc as it’s pop song BGM.  Anyway, this thing is the most obvious, out of place computer-generated construct since the tongue beasts in the first Resident Evil movie, and two dimensional characters appearing in the same shot look about as real and natural as paper dolls taped to a very expensive child’s toy.  It’s also pretty obvious how much money went into this thing, because about half of this movie’s animation is about as low quality as the show, with talking heads moving and freezing on still canvases, and barely any background movement in shots that have lots of people on them.If that’s not bad enough, there’s a scene very early on where the team is travelling by boat, and they’re hit by a storm that causes some turbulence.  There is a shot where Pikachu is standing nervously on the rocking boat in a close-up, and I swear to Arceus they just took the still image and shook it around to give the illusion of movement.  Characters often seem to freeze into the background whenever they’re not talking, some of the scenes are very poorly shot(like Ash’s arrival on Shamouti), and a lot of the movie is distinctly out of frame, due to 4Kids’ decision to convert the film from widescreen to fullscreen.  Another obvious CG effect is an entirely pointless scene where hoards of Pokemon are stuck on an ice sheet staring out into the water, but can still be seen moving from a mile away, including Kangaskhan doing her little sumo stomp.  The only moments where the CG and 2D elements blend nicely to the tune of a decent budget, and thus the moments that differentiate it from future movies, are the action scenes, most notably when the legendary birds are fighting either Lawrence’s devices, each other, or both.  The animation for these moments are breathtaking, fast paced, and over-all a joy to watch, to the point that I’d actually say it’s worth sitting through the rest of the movie’s animation to get there.The music, however, is a step up from the first movie.  The score is powerful and epic, particularly with the music that accompanies the action set pieces.  Rather than a Danny Elfman sound, like the first movie utilized, this one has more of a John Williams sound, which is equally appropriate.  Where the first film had a dark and ominous tone, this one plays out more like a grand, sweeping adventure, so the music has to be a lot bolder and, well, for lack of a better term, bigger.  This does unfortunately result in a lot of the tunes sounding a bit homogenized, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as this type of movie kind of calls for it.  It only tends to get annoying when it comes to what I can only describe as the musical motif of the film, a certain wind tune that a new female character introduces us to.  She never states what she’s playing, and I can’t identify it by ear, so we’ll just call it an Ocarina.  It’s important to the plot, so I can’t harp on it too much, but suffice to say it gets old pretty quick.  Thankfully, with Lugia’s Song as an example, it rarely ever plays in the background without evolving into something far more awesome.The soundtrack in this movie is nowhere near as embarrassing as the first one, as it seems to have been put together with a much better focus than it’s pop-song grabbing predecessor.  The Ocarina motif that I mentioned before gets expanded into a full song by Donna Summer, which was based off of one of this movie’s three names, The Power of One.  It’s a pretty great song, not gonna lie, but it’s very nature carries one of the most unfortunate problems with the english version of the movie, which I’ll get to later.  The pop version of Pokemon World is also pretty awesome, even though it’s being sung by two nineties bands that haven’t been mentioned by living people for over ten years.  Yeah, the song itself is fun, but it only really becomes cringeworthy if you watch the two bands performing it onstage, which is totally a thing on the DVD extras.  Those poor teen bastards.  Even the actors from Pokemon Live came away more dignity than that.  Flying Without Wings by Westlife is a pretty decent song...  well, at least the cut the movie used...  And for a bit of unexpected weirdness, Weird Al actually pops up in the credits to combine the Pokerap with his own Polka trend.It’s not what I’d call a perfect soundtrack, but at least they tried to keep things relevant this time around.  But much like the first movie, there are tunes on the CD that didn’t make it into the movie...  Dreams by Alysha Antonino has the makings of a pretty good song, but the production features the absolute worst flavor of the late nineties.  The lyrics themselves are almost poignant in their message, but the orchestration is just butt ugly.  The Extra Mile by Laura Pausini is really generic, and could easily be placed in the credits of almost any film without feeling out of place.  I hate to get mean over a song that’s been lost in time, but when I buy a CD and load the songs to Itunes, this is the kind of song I leave off.  The same could be said by One Heart by O-Town, which probably the most memorable forgotten band in existence, and With All Your Heart by Plus One.  The only songs present that are as entertainingly bad as the last CD are Chosen One by The B-52s, which almost seems to be making fun of the movie’s prophecy, and They Just Don’t Understand, a song by a bunch of twelve year olds called Dream Street about their love of the franchise.  This one also appears on the DVD in all it’s cringy glory, you’re welcome.For the most part, there isn’t much I can say about the english dub without talking about the series, as the acting in this movie is pretty much the same as the series at it’s best.  I’ve always felt that the acting was the best part of the 4Kids dub, with the writing always being more hit-or-miss, heavy emphasis on the miss.  I will concede that Ed Paul as Tracey is slightly less annoying than Eric Stuart as Brock.  That, and while it might just be my imagination, Addie Blaustein was putting forth a bit more effort than usual as Meowth.  Another performance of note comes from Veronica Taylor, who we’ve all gotten used to hearing as Ash, but also gets to play Ash’s mother in this film, and she gets a really heartfelt exchange with him later in the movie.  Eric Rath was a bit on the forgettable side in his turn as Lugia, and despite having just as little voice acting experience, Neil Stewart was quite a bit better as Lawrence.  Nathan Price, who’s done a bit more than those two, does a great job as Slowking, making the character sound like a slow, dim-witted person who’s somehow come upon great intelligence but still speaks like he used to.The worst thing about this dub are the changes it made to the material, of which there are far too many.  There was at least one plot point that I hoped was a rewrite, but no, it wasn’t...  The rewrites that do exist are way worse.  The relationship between the Legendary Birds and the Beast of the Sea is given a much better explanation in the Japanese, although it’s still a work of fantasy, so it’s not THAT much better.  There was originally a moment when Tracey was allowed to shine by helping his friends to science their way out of a jam, but that got cut, so he’s basically as useless as his Venonat was in the opening short.  Much worse than these, and probably much more shocking to westerners who’ve never seen both versions, is the fact that the whole “Power of One” idea was entirely a dub-only concept.  In the Japanese, not only was there no such thing as a ‘chosen one,’ but from what I’ve been told, there was no prophecy, either.  The film actually had a heavy emphasis on teamwork, which makes more sense considering how much help Ash needs throughout.  Much like the pacifism of the first movie, this just goes to show how confused 4Kids can get when it comes to teaching western-friendly morals.  If you can, stick to the sub.If you knew me around the turn of the century, you’d know that I was a huge Pokemon fanatic.  If you were also a member of the Pokemon fandom, you probably also knew that I was a huge fan of the Orange Islands arc.  To this day, it’s still my favorite season of the original series, and the only season that I own on DVD.  It was just so different from anything that came before, or that’s come out of the series since.  As far as I’m aware, it was the only season to not be connected to the games, although I did at least attempt to run the fan-made Pokemon Orange-version on my piece of crap MacIntosh.  I loved how much creative freedom it had, as it wasn’t tied down to the formula of the Kanto region, as they didn’t have to dedicate each episode to revealing a new Pokemon, and they could just write episodes revolving around new concepts of older, already established Pokemon.  Some very popular iconic Pokemon got to take center stage, like Lapras and Snorlax, and the battles didn’t have to be actual battles, and there was a lot more material for Pokeshippers.  It was a breath of fresh air, and the news of an upcoming movie finally got my ass into theaters.So how did it hold up?  Well, you hardly need me to tell you how popular it is.  While the critics were notoriously tough on it, giving it only a one point advantage over it’s predecessor, it is one of the most common fan favorites among the actual Pokemon fandom.  It’s lowest review score on Myanimelist is a 6(until now), and none of those reviews lasted more than a single page(until now).  It’s not hard to see why, because this was the first Pokemon movie to feel like an actual movie.  It had a more epic, theatrical feel to it, with higher stakes and arguably a more ambitious story than most other Pokemon films.  It introduced two Generation 2 Pokemon, not counting Elekid in the opening short, and the ones it did introduce in the main story were actually important to the plot, not cannon fodder in a random opening battle.  It’s not often considered the best movie in the Pokemon line-up, that honor often goes to the Entei and Lucario movies, but it is a generally respected and highly regarded movie...  Which is why it might surprise you to hear me say that it really isn’t THAT much better than the first film.Now, credit where credit is due, it does a much better job following the traditional three act structure.  In the first act, we meet the villain.  We learn about who he is, what his plan is, and what will happen if said plan comes to fruition.  We also get introduced to the main character, why he’s in the area, and how he gets drawn into the conflict.  We get all the backstory we need, and then some, as well as intros of basically every single plot point that’s going to matter.  In the second act, the plot picks up, and we see the main character set out to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible, even though the conflict is way bigger and more dangerous than he initially thought, and his inability to solve the problem leads him into a worsening situation, where things basically hit rock bottom.  Finally, in the third act, the worst case scenario happens, the main makes a much grander stand, and it all builds to a climax that delivers on everything that set it up.  Power of One follows the three act structure so well that it’s almost like the writers made a conscious effort to do so, and it’s ultimately the reason that the movie feels so much more like, well, a movie.Having said that, a three act structure doesn’t guarantee the movie will be good, and for all of it’s grandeur and epic nature, this movie has just as much stupid, lore and continuity breaking material in it as the last one.  First of all, harping on the English dub, the prophecy is completely pointless.  Not only does it feel mind-numbingly stupid that some ancient prophecy knows who Ash is and decides that only he, one of the most incompetent heroes in anime history, can possibly set the world back to right, but there was nothing in the prophecy about Lawrence starting all of this conflict.  It also doesn’t work in terms of the story, because Ash doesn’t need a prophecy to tell him to go into action and save the world...  He’s a good person, he’ll do it anyway!  Hell, I wouldn’t even make that point if it wasn’t for the fact that (mild spoilers in this sentence) Team Rocket, the show’s signature antagonists, decide all on their own to turn over a new leaf and act heroic for the sake of saving the planet.  Ash needed a prophecy to call him out by name(In an oh so clever pun that fooled absolutely nobody), but Team Rocket are the altruists in the scenario?  Bull to the motherfucking shit!Going right back to act one, not only does Lawrence have a Pokemon trading card...  Which just throws all kinds of logic out the window, because this isn’t Digimon Tamers we’re watching...  But the exposition he gets from his computer makes no sense.  It identifies the prophecized Titans as the legendary birds, which means he likely didn’t know that yet, and since the prophecy mentioned nothing about Shamouti, how the hell is he already in the area?  And why are Ash and friends taking a ferry, when they usually just ride on Lapras’s back?  It would make sense in a Pokemon game, but they never had random encounters on her back before.  Also, how did Lawrence and Ash move into position on the exact annual day that the island was expecting this exact catastrophe to occur?  Then in the second act, we get such gems as Tracey being useless, a flying sailboat, Ash trying to tackle an electrified cage, and to top it all off, there’s a strong implication that in order to catch all existing Pokemon...  Or to “Catch’em All,” which is explicitly the catch phrase of the series, you would have to destroy the world as we know it in the process.  I don’t think they really thought this through.Then the third act happens, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it damn near justifies everything.  In the first movie, the “third act,” if you could call it that, is where it failed hardest, as it used it’s climax to crawl right up inside it’s own ass.  This, however, is what a third act is supposed to be.  Every single plot point, even the worst ones like Misty bantering with Melody over her crush on Ash, comes to a satisfying conclusion.  Even though there’s well-animated action scenes throughout the movie, this part of the story upstages all of them, as it should, with Lawrence being largely written out of the story so the birds themselves can fight among themselves, and it’s as awesome as it sounds.  That’s not to say nothing stupid happens...  Bulbasaur and Squirtle are shown to run as fast as Charizard flies, in a scenario when he really should have tried to call out Lapras, and the dialogue between Melody and Misty ends in an exchange that doesn’t make much sense...  I’m assuming only one person in that group has any idea how to play the Ocarina...  But it doesn’t matter, because every moment leads to something great.  Does that make all the stupid crap that we had to sit through to get to that point okay?  No, not really, but at least there’s something at the end worth sitting through it all for.  It’s not much, but it’s something.Pokemon the movie 2000, also known as The Power of One and Revelation Lugia, is available from Viz Media in both single format and a three-pack with the first and third films. .  You can also find the out of print original DVD from Warner Home Video, albeit at a much more expensive price.  Unlike the first movie, you can also find the soundtrack and score on the same CD, although brand new copies are quite a bit more expensive.  Netflix generally has about four or five different Pokemon movies available for legal streaming at any given time, and this is occasionally one of them.Despite my criticisms, this is my favorite Pokemon movie, and it’s the one I have the most nostalgic feelings for.  There are at least two scenes in it that make me cry...  One involving Team Rocket, the other involving Ash’s mom...  And that’s something no other Pokemon movie can say.  It also expands upon the lore in a lot of interesting ways, such as giving a few characters first names for the first time.  Of course, just because it’s my personal favorite doesn’t make it one of the best ones.  I wouldn’t even call it one of the top five.  Looked at as a sequel, it just barely surpasses the first movie in terms of scale and execution, but the story is still based on coincidence, there’s still a lot of dumb and inaccurate material, and it breaks the fourth wall more than any Pokemon movie should.  It doesn’t fall into the trap of pushing a confused and hypocritical moral, but it only pulls this off by not trying to push ANY moral...  Which is probably the smart way to go, but it still doesn’t convey the kind of growth that a sequel should go through.  It’s sense of pacing, structure and emotional resonance, as well as it’s killer third act ultimately saves it from receiving a score as low as the first film, but it still doesn’t earn it a good score, as much as I may love it.  I give Pokemon the Movie 2000 a 5/10. who dare to encounter them up close and personal on a regular basis, bettering themselves in order to overcome any obstacle the world’s Pokemon might put forth.

Nathan Price, who’s done a bit more than those two, does a great job as Slowking, making the character sound like a slow, dim-witted person who’s somehow come upon great intelligence but still speaks like he used to.The worst thing about this dub are the changes it made to the material, of which there are far too many.  There was at least one plot point that I hoped was a rewrite, but no, it wasn’t...  The rewrites that do exist are way worse.  The relationship between the Legendary Birds and the Beast of the Sea is given a much better explanation in the Japanese, although it’s still a work of fantasy, so it’s not THAT much better.  There was originally a moment when Tracey was allowed to shine by helping his friends to science their way out of a jam, but that got cut, so he’s basically as useless as his Venonat was in the opening short.  Much worse than these, and probably much more shocking to westerners who’ve never seen both versions, is the fact that the whole “Power of One” idea was entirely a dub-only concept.  In the Japanese, not only was there no such thing as a ‘chosen one,’ but from what I’ve been told, there was no prophecy, either.  The film actually had a heavy emphasis on teamwork, which makes more sense considering how much help Ash needs throughout.  Much like the pacifism of the first movie, this just goes to show how confused 4Kids can get when it comes to teaching western-friendly morals.  If you can, stick to the sub.If you knew me around the turn of the century, you’d know that I was a huge Pokemon fanatic.  If you were also a member of the Pokemon fandom, you probably also knew that I was a huge fan of the Orange Islands arc.  To this day, it’s still my favorite season of the original series, and the only season that I own on DVD.  It was just so different from anything that came before, or that’s come out of the series since.  As far as I’m aware, it was the only season to not be connected to the games, although I did at least attempt to run the fan-made Pokemon Orange-version on my piece of crap MacIntosh.  I loved how much creative freedom it had, as it wasn’t tied down to the formula of the Kanto region, as they didn’t have to dedicate each episode to revealing a new Pokemon, and they could just write episodes revolving around new concepts of older, already established Pokemon.  Some very popular iconic Pokemon got to take center stage, like Lapras and Snorlax, and the battles didn’t have to be actual battles, and there was a lot more material for Pokeshippers.  It was a breath of fresh air, and the news of an upcoming movie finally got my ass into theaters.So how did it hold up?  Well, you hardly need me to tell you how popular it is.  While the critics were notoriously tough on it, giving it only a one point advantage over it’s predecessor, it is one of the most common fan favorites among the actual Pokemon fandom.  It’s lowest review score on Myanimelist is a 6(until now), and none of those reviews lasted more than a single page(until now).  It’s not hard to see why, because this was the first Pokemon movie to feel like an actual movie.  It had a more epic, theatrical feel to it, with higher stakes and arguably a more ambitious story than most other Pokemon films.  It introduced two Generation 2 Pokemon, not counting Elekid in the opening short, and the ones it did introduce in the main story were actually important to the plot, not cannon fodder in a random opening battle.  It’s not often considered the best movie in the Pokemon line-up, that honor often goes to the Entei and Lucario movies, but it is a generally respected and highly regarded movie...  Which is why it might surprise you to hear me say that it really isn’t THAT much better than the first film.Now, credit where credit is due, it does a much better job following the traditional three act structure.  In the first act, we meet the villain.  We learn about who he is, what his plan is, and what will happen if said plan comes to fruition.  We also get introduced to the main character, why he’s in the area, and how he gets drawn into the conflict.  We get all the backstory we need, and then some, as well as intros of basically every single plot point that’s going to matter.  In the second act, the plot picks up, and we see the main character set out to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible, even though the conflict is way bigger and more dangerous than he initially thought, and his inability to solve the problem leads him into a worsening situation, where things basically hit rock bottom.  Finally, in the third act, the worst case scenario happens, the main makes a much grander stand, and it all builds to a climax that delivers on everything that set it up.  Power of One follows the three act structure so well that it’s almost like the writers made a conscious effort to do so, and it’s ultimately the reason that the movie feels so much more like, well, a movie.Having said that, a three act structure doesn’t guarantee the movie will be good, and for all of it’s grandeur and epic nature, this movie has just as much stupid, lore and continuity breaking material in it as the last one.  First of all, harping on the English dub, the prophecy is completely pointless.  Not only does it feel mind-numbingly stupid that some ancient prophecy knows who Ash is and decides that only he, one of the most incompetent heroes in anime history, can possibly set the world back to right, but there was nothing in the prophecy about Lawrence starting all of this conflict.  It also doesn’t work in terms of the story, because Ash doesn’t need a prophecy to tell him to go into action and save the world...  He’s a good person, he’ll do it anyway!  Hell, I wouldn’t even make that point if it wasn’t for the fact that (mild spoilers in this sentence) Team Rocket, the show’s signature antagonists, decide all on their own to turn over a new leaf and act heroic for the sake of saving the planet.  Ash needed a prophecy to call him out by name(In an oh so clever pun that fooled absolutely nobody), but Team Rocket are the altruists in the scenario?  Bull to the motherfucking shit!Going right back to act one, not only does Lawrence have a Pokemon trading card...  Which just throws all kinds of logic out the window, because this isn’t Digimon Tamers we’re watching...  But the exposition he gets from his computer makes no sense.  It identifies the prophecized Titans as the legendary birds, which means he likely didn’t know that yet, and since the prophecy mentioned nothing about Shamouti, how the hell is he already in the area?  And why are Ash and friends taking a ferry, when they usually just ride on Lapras’s back?  It would make sense in a Pokemon game, but they never had random encounters on her back before.  Also, how did Lawrence and Ash move into position on the exact annual day that the island was expecting this exact catastrophe to occur?  Then in the second act, we get such gems as Tracey being useless, a flying sailboat, Ash trying to tackle an electrified cage, and to top it all off, there’s a strong implication that in order to catch all existing Pokemon...  Or to “Catch’em All,” which is explicitly the catch phrase of the series, you would have to destroy the world as we know it in the process.  I don’t think they really thought this through.Then the third act happens, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it damn near justifies everything.  In the first movie, the “third act,” if you could call it that, is where it failed hardest, as it used it’s climax to crawl right up inside it’s own ass.  This, however, is what a third act is supposed to be.  Every single plot point, even the worst ones like Misty bantering with Melody over her crush on Ash, comes to a satisfying conclusion.  Even though there’s well-animated action scenes throughout the movie, this part of the story upstages all of them, as it should, with Lawrence being largely written out of the story so the birds themselves can fight among themselves, and it’s as awesome as it sounds.  That’s not to say nothing stupid happens...  Bulbasaur and Squirtle are shown to run as fast as Charizard flies, in a scenario when he really should have tried to call out Lapras, and the dialogue between Melody and Misty ends in an exchange that doesn’t make much sense...  I’m assuming only one person in that group has any idea how to play the Ocarina...  But it doesn’t matter, because every moment leads to something great.  Does that make all the stupid crap that we had to sit through to get to that point okay?  No, not really, but at least there’s something at the end worth sitting through it all for.  It’s not much, but it’s something.Pokemon the movie 2000, also known as The Power of One and Revelation Lugia, is available from Viz Media in both single format and a three-pack with the first and third films. .  You can also find the out of print original DVD from Warner Home Video, albeit at a much more expensive price.  Unlike the first movie, you can also find the soundtrack and score on the same CD, although brand new copies are quite a bit more expensive.  Netflix generally has about four or five different Pokemon movies available for legal streaming at any given time, and this is occasionally one of them.Despite my criticisms, this is my favorite Pokemon movie, and it’s the one I have the most nostalgic feelings for.  There are at least two scenes in it that make me cry...  One involving Team Rocket, the other involving Ash’s mom...  And that’s something no other Pokemon movie can say.  It also expands upon the lore in a lot of interesting ways, such as giving a few characters first names for the first time.  Of course, just because it’s my personal favorite doesn’t make it one of the best ones.  I wouldn’t even call it one of the top five.  Looked at as a sequel, it just barely surpasses the first movie in terms of scale and execution, but the story is still based on coincidence, there’s still a lot of dumb and inaccurate material, and it breaks the fourth wall more than any Pokemon movie should.  It doesn’t fall into the trap of pushing a confused and hypocritical moral, but it only pulls this off by not trying to push ANY moral...  Which is probably the smart way to go, but it still doesn’t convey the kind of growth that a sequel should go through.  It’s sense of pacing, structure and emotional resonance, as well as it’s killer third act ultimately saves it from receiving a score as low as the first film, but it still doesn’t earn it a good score, as much as I may love it.  I give Pokemon the Movie 2000 a 5/10.', ""This Movie Brings Back Memories From When I Was A Kid I Was Obsessed Over This Movie Because Lugia Is My Favorite Pokemon Out There And This Movie Is Perfect For An Epic Battle And An Epic Story With The Best Story I've Seen In A Pokemon Movie Also How They Introduce The Story Is The Way To Do It I Give It 10/10 Good No Wait Awesome No Wait Epicnessiawsomenoogoods "", ""I remember it being tugging on my heartstrings even as a child when we saw the three legendary birds - especially Articuno for me which has been my favorite since this came out.I watched this for the first time as a child at the age of 6 in the Cinema.

This is the second feature-length Pokemon film. This film, like the first one, does have a fair share of filmatic moments, as in it actually feels like a film (which funny enough is not the case for a lot of the later Pokemon films starting in the Diamond and Pearl time frame onwards).However, while you can chalk up a lot of the issues in the first film as ""hey it was their first stab at it"", there are A LOT of issues in this second film. The biggest issue I have with the film is the absolute failure...of the villain. They try to pass him off as a bad guy for bad guy\'s sake (which sometimes is the best path for a film). However, he just doesn\'t have any stopping power. Also for large chunks of the film, he remains quite absent from the film. In a way, the three original legendary birds play the role of the chaotic evil ""villains"".The pacing of the film is honestly not too bad although the intro sequence (with the villain and how Ash and company end up on ""plot island"") goes on a bit too long. The problem is that...there really isn\'t a whole lot of interesting things thrown into the film. It is literally ""hey go to this island, pick up X item, go to the next island and repeat"". There are also a lack of set-pieces, something that films like this need to motivate the audience.The dialogue is quite simply, omega cringe. Like, yeah sure the target audience for this film is younger children but even then, tell me why Pixar films, for the most part, end up appealing to all audiences?Overall, if you watch it in the right setting, it can be enjoyable. However as a film, it is quite boring. Still it is miles better than a number of the Pokemon films.Enjoyment: 3.8/10Overall: 4/10 of the villain.

Continuing the events of the anime, we find Ash and Pikachu back for another adventure. How does it fare? Pretty well actually.Story: We follow Pokémon trainer Ash Ketchum, his Pikachu, and friends, Misty and Tracey, as they continue their adventures on the Orange Islands. However, things take a turn for the worst when a mysterious Pokémon collector disrupts the balance of the world by forcefully capturing three elemental Pokémon: the fire-type Moltres, lighting-type Zapdos, and ice-type Articuno in hopes of luring out the legendary...sea Pokémon, Lugia. The story plays out like your typical ""save the word"" affair where Ash must collect three ancient balls and restore order to the world.The plot was predictable and formulaic, but was pretty entertaining. The characters were good for the most part. Misty, Tracey, and Team Rocket were great, though I can\'t say the same for the new characters and villain, who were all forgettable by the way.Presentation: The second movie is a huge step up from its predecessor, despite being a year old. The character and background designs were detailed; as well as the vibrant colors, which were fitting of the sea-based setting. That being said, the 3D models no doubt have aged like crap and as a result, clashes with the 2D art. The voice acting (dub) is great in my opinion, as I found everyone delivering good performances. The soundtrack was good, though nothing really stood out to me.Overall: I really had a lot of fun watching Pokémon the Movie 2, more so than The First Movie. Sure the story and characters weren\'t the greatest, but it was a enjoyable watch nonetheless.

How many films aimed at 6-year-olds explore such difficult themes as biological determinism, nature vs nurture and the lasting trauma of being denied personhood, let alone with such mythic scope behind them? Time and time again, this franchise has proved that it can go above and beyond the call of duty, pushing its toyetic critters and characters into works of genuine artistry. Pokemon’s first ever movie could have easily just been a dull lice of tie-in filler and it still would have raked in...cash hand over fist, but the team at OLM decided to turn it into something really special. It’s that kind of dedication that made Pokemon take over the world, not just distracting kids with flashy colors but giving them something real and enduring to carry with them. And as long as it keeps proving capable of reaching those heights, I’ll have very little problem sticking with it for the long haul.Unfortunately, just because Pokemon usually goes the extra mile doesn’t mean it’s completely immune to phoning it in. And Pokemon’s second movie, The Power of One, is every bit the mindless franchise vehicle that Mewtwo Strikes Back fought so hard to avoid being.The story takes us back to the middle of the Orange Islands arc, with Ash, Misty and Tracy once again caught up in a potentially world-ending catastrophe related to a legendary Pokemon threatened by human malfeasance. This time, it’s the trio of legendary birds- Articuno of ice, Zapdos of lightning, and Moltres of fire, who in this continuity hang out on a trio of islands right in the middle of the archipelago. Normally there’s balance between them, but a preening Pokemon thief has shown up and started capturing them, throwing that balance into chaos. The birds are rising up to try and conquer each other’s territory, and weather around the world is going wild as a result as their fierce battle rages. The only thing that can calm them down is Lugia, the guardian of the sea, who swims deep in the waters below the islands and acts as the last line of defense to its inferiors. Unfortunately, Lugia’s also exactly who the Pokemon thief is after in the first place, the ultimate prize whom the legendary birds are just a means to an end for catching. Thus, Ash and friends must team up with some native islanders to set things right, island-hopping to fulfill a mysterious prophecy that will awaken Lugia and give it the power it needs to save the day.There’s a lot of potential in that set-up for a tale just as resonant as Mewtwo Strikes Back. Unfortunately, whatever creative juices inspired the Pokemon team to make Baby’s First Francis Galton are not present here: The Power of One is the most bog-standard, generic Chosen One story you can possibly imagine. The prophecy is every prophecy you’ve ever seen in movies like this, and it casts Ash as the chosen one for no other reason than he’s this franchise’s nominal protagonist. The villain is so generic and meaningless that I don’t think we ever learn his name; he’s just some asshole who shows up, minces, and gets his ass kicked. There’s no effort to have our heroes naturally enter the story; they’re just dragged in by dopey convenience before they even realize the full extent of what they’re dealing with. And unlike Mewtwo Strikes Back, there’s no greater meat on the bones to give the story deeper meaning, so there’s nothing to distract from just how asinine some of this gets. At one point the bad guy just lets the heroes out of the cage he’s imprisoned them in and then leaves them behind, with nothing stopping them from pulling their Pokemon out and rescuing his other captives. Seriously, that’s phenomenally stupid, coincidence-laden writing.Perhaps I am being too harsh in some respects; it’s not like Mewtwo Strikes Back was perfect itself, after all. It meandered in the midsection with a few too many side distractions before getting to that killer final act. But without that film’s genuine gravitas, all The Power of One has is those lesser elements. Instead of powerful emotional themes and plot turns that actually mean something, we’re left with Ash being told he’s The Only One Who Can Save The World through powers completely out of his hands and a groan-inducing subplot that pits Misty against another girl in competition for Ash’s affections and ugh, have I mentioned how much I dislike this kind of trite “romantic drama?” Thankfully, the animation team at OLM still knows how to pull off a hell of a spectacle, so we still get the super-impressive animation and background art that Mewtwo Strikes Back had. The world still feels epic, every shot is still intricately detailed, and whenever we’re just focusing on the epic storms whipping up on sea or the explosive battles between the legendary birds themselves, the chaos is truly beautiful to behold. It’s a shame that ugly CG also rears its head at points, which really does some damage to the otherwise great aesthetics; the bad guy’s flying castle, in particular, is basically just a low-rent PS2 Evil Laputa. And it really sticks out in a bad way when the hand-drawn stuff is still so genuinely impressive to behold.Ultimately, Pokemon 2000 isn’t a disaster. It’s still an impressive animation showcase, and I think it utilizes Team Rocket better than Mewtwo Strikes Back did (their arc is the one genuine improvement over this film’s predecessor). But compared to everything that made this franchise’s first film so special, this is a major step down in every way.

Poputepipikku TV Special,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37596/Poputepipikku_TV_Special,"[""Hoshiiro Girldrop finally got an OVA and it's everything you'd expect and came to love from these cute girldrops.While it may seem like a rethread of previous episodes, this new OVA in fact does bring in some new plot points you may not have anticipated before, effectively recreating the emotional roller coaster that was the original series. The charm and humor are still there, but what's most impressive is that since it's luring in you with a false sense of security, Hoshiiro Girldrop hits you hard with the cruel twist just right in the beginning and leaves you not knowing what to do. Indeed, the...moment Sosogu literally rips herself in half is a defining moment for the Spring 2019 season.Hoshiiro Girldrop est vraiment une marque de maîtrise. C'est la marque de hors-la-loi que vous connaissez et aimez. Et qu'est-ce que ne pas aimer? Et comme toujours, la rediffusion change juste assez de choses pour rendre les choses intéressantes une seconde fois.And so, the Pretty Candle Star shines ever so brightly in the deep abyss of the skies above...8/10Thank you bkub.

You magnificent shitposter you."", ""Hoshiiro Girldrop was one of my favorite animes of last year, and I went into the second season with the expectation that it would be similarly meaningful. And when it started off, I had every reason to believe that it would be. Needless to say, every episode was easily the highlight of its week, and I watched each one at least 28 times (maybe twice that for episode 10, which I’m sure other viewers will understand). But looking back on this season now that it’s reached its conclusion, it doesn’t fit together as neatly as I would have hoped. It sacrificed cohesion in favor of...maximizing the bombast of every individual episode, and while I’m sure will appeal to some viewers, it fails to capture the magic that made the first season so special to me.A major factor in this is that Daichi’s role in the story has been significantly reduced. I think that this likely because Daichi became a rather controversial topic in the fanbase after he broke up with Sosogu midseason, and that many fans were only interested in content related to the Drop Stars. However, Daichi’s motivation for his actions (insecurities over feeling that he was getting in the way of Sosogu’s growing career) resonated deeply with me, and it was the resolution to this arc that made the show so personally affecting. But I know that not everyone is a Daichi apologist like I am, so I can understand why they chose to handle him how they did.Still, I can’t help but wonder if the writers were a bit too concerned over catering to their audience. The first season had some bold choices that definitely risked alienating parts of the audience, and everything in this season felt sterilized in comparison. Many of the moral complexities that had been previously introduced, such as Korona’s connection to the Yakuza or Erika’s custody battle with her ex-husband, seem to have been dropped without explanation. This gradually reduced my investment in the characters as the season went on, though I think the writers more than made up for it in the homestretch. I wasn’t expecting an anime to have such a nuanced take on the role of social media in our lives today, and I found the climax of the season to be both engaging and informative.In conclusion, the Pop Team Epic Special is a delightful showcase of experimentation with different mediums. Nearly every art form explored over the course of the main series makes a reappearance, along with the new addition of clay work. I don’t think any of the segments are going to have the same longevity as some of the highlights from the main series, but I also don't think that's the point. All I care about is that the staff were able to have fun making something that they thought would be interesting, and on that front, this is a huge success.Fall in love again next week~ maximizing the bombast of every individual episode, and while I’m sure will appeal to some viewers, it fails to capture the magic that made the first season so special to me.A major factor in this is that Daichi’s role in the story has been significantly reduced.

Our main caste duo is prefect for this kind of anime, they are weird and shown in all kinds of animation styles and still remain funny and relevant which is not easy feat to pull in my opinion. Sometimes papuko acts weird and other times its pimimi who acts...weird, and their are times when everything is weird, from characters to the premise of the joke, but that is the beauty of this anime.I really like how they use different animations styles to tell a joke and its unique to that animation style.

Pretty much everything Pop Team Epic is about, just slapped into a special episode, longer than the rest. It follows all the same gimmicks, that is surreal humour, memes, exaggerated story, and many more from the weird and wonderful mind of Jun Aoki.I suppose I could speak about the story, but there isn't anything unique here to go on about. I don't know what you...could expect other than a full outrage like something out of those crazy Asano Naoyuki shorts.

Rekka no Honoo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/238/Rekka_no_Honoo,"[""The most prominent precursor to the ever popular Naruto, Flame of Recca is essentially, Dragon Ball, Rurouni Kenshin, Naruto, and Kaze no Stigma all rolled into one package.  Of course, in terms of originality, it deserves a high commendation, but that's about all the praise I can muster for this series.The story is lethargic.  It follows a very formulaic approach.  The main protagonist, Recca goes through a sequence of ordeals to realize his true strength and then manages to win over enemies with his never say die attitude.  Banal.  Seen that a million times.  But that doesn't mean it's...not enjoyable.The animation is fair, to be honest, I feel that the studio started pumping more money into Yu Yu Hakusho (which was being released at the same time), and the later episodes suffer from a marked decline in quality.The sound is nothing spectacular, nothing memorable.The characters are moderately well designed, but again follow cliched &quot;five-guy-superhero-team&quot; stereotypes.  There are, of course, some deliciously sinister villains, some with more character than our 2-D heroes.  But the anime doesn't really explore them.I really can't give this a high grade.  In it's time, yes it was a classic, and sparked of future work such as Naruto, but now it's a dated and overused concept and there are many more worthwhile series out there.However, I highly recommend the manga.  The anime only follows upto volume 16 of the manga series and by itself leaves many questions unanswered.

It only focuses on 2 or 3 story arcs and I feel that if you&rsquo;re at all a fan of the original manga, you&rsquo;re certainly going to be cheated because it only offers a true fraction of what this series truly has to offer. But for this anime as a whole, it covers enough ground to give the viewers an introduction to the characters and offers excellent development. A majority of the main cast starts out as Recca&rsquo;s rivals such as Domon and Fuuko, but eventually bigger circumstances such as...saving the world unites them to become an unstoppable team. The anime itself is decently paced and the characters share equal time and develop sensibly for what this series has to offer and individually have their own use to the overall development of the story. The villains are also unique and have their own personalities that truly stand out and have their own back-story and goals to why they became to be. So you&rsquo;re getting an excellent cast in which you can relate to or feel out.Well, the character design is faithful to the manga for the most part. When the manga started out, the art was pretty ugly, but Anzai further evolved and improved his art style to the point that when they made this anime, they used the improved art style thank god. The art style is basic, but still excellently detailed with the costume designs and the diversity of the character designs. I also like how the weapon&rsquo;s are drawn and have really nifty designs.The action is very high octane and breath taking. It&rsquo;s very technique based and well played out. Characters have fighting styles in which they contrast and I have always believed in an old saying of styles make fights and this anime also proves that. In addition, the fights also have a Yuu Yuu Hakusho like feel to it where it&rsquo;s based on tactics and strategy, and you get that in this anime as well. In comparison to Naruto, you get a better overall feel of the ninja authenticity to the action and art design.The music is very addicting and very high spirited. A perfect example is the opening theme Nanka Shiawase by Oysters. It has good control with the guitars and the delivery of the lyrics is very true to the atmosphere of the series. I also can&rsquo;t deny that the ending theme Love is Changing by Nishida Hikaru also exemplifies this, but more on the romantic side of the series. The background music has a fighting game esque feel to it and is very well diverse in that sense in which it portrays all kinds of moods and personalities.I can&rsquo;t say much about the dub since I&rsquo;ve never seen it and have no intentions of watching it just because I don&rsquo;t want to, but the Japanese voice cast I feel is satisfying enough. I was very shocked to learn that Tobita Nobuo, who is most famous amongst Gundam fans such as myself as Camille Vidan from Z Gundam is the voice of Domon. He does a great job of not recognizing it&rsquo;s the same voice, but still makes the character convincing as a tough guy who has a soft spot, but overall true use is comic relief. And Okiayu Ryotaro as Kurei and Midorikawa Hikaru as Mikagami are probably the reasons why I can never watch this series outside of the Japanese language. These two reputable seiyuus do a great job in bringing their characters to life and make them very believable.Well, if you want to see the rest of Flame of Recca as anime, the closest thing you&rsquo;re going to get is if you get the PS2 game, Final Burning. The same studio animates the cut scenes and they got the same seiyuus back. Plus, you get to see the manga ending in anime form. saving the world unites them to become an unstoppable team.

It was produced by the huge Studio Pierrot and even directed by the same man whom directed Yu Yu Hakusho, Noriyuki Abe. Needless to explain that when it came to shounen anime, this combo does it right.Even the plot reminds any shounen anime fan of what they could be watching instead. Flame of Recca focuses on the main character by the name of Recca Hanabishi. He is the last living member of a ninja clan famous for their use of crazy weaponry. The weaponry becomes a huge plot point soon enough when...the story gets into a saving the world through an elimination tournament with our main character fighting the ultimate bad guy at the end. All extremely similar to Hakusho. Before the tournament arc, Recca confronts in “ninja-like” battles against people that will later become friends with him. Along the way, we meet the murdering antagonist, and Recca stumbles across a girl whom has the power to heal. This girl would then become the entire backbone of the story as Recca and friends must do their best to save her.As for the animation, it is very sub-par even for the late 90’s. It suffers from typical shounen budget stretch due to the length of the show. Even during this same time shows such as Gundam X and Rurouni Kenshin were experiencing the same thing with still shot action scenes, and action being cut away way too often. Too bad the music is not very memorable, but there were times during some emotional back stories and fight sequences where it was done right.The worst aspect of the show would have to be near end. When the show is at its’ peak aspect in the action and story, the budget clearly took another hit because the animation is even worse and at times the viewer is subject to minutes on end of nothing happening on the screen. Plus, the show ends at a point where there leaves way more questions than answers. There is more to the manga if every inclined to continue where the anime left off.Basically, Flame of Recca is a typical formulaic action 5-man-group anime. If a total sucker for shounen, than this is worth a fun ride, but when it is all said and done maybe should have been watching something better like Yu Yu Hakusho. the story gets into a saving the world through an elimination tournament with our main character fighting the ultimate bad guy at the end.

As an anime series it really is spectacular in the sense that it is one of the predecessor of the big 3 that we have today. Which are Naruto, Bleach and FT.Before Natzu Dragneel there was Recca Hanabishi...the graphics may turn off some viewers but the over all concept is really amazing. It greatly resembles 2 legendary shounen anime (Dragon Ball Z) and (Yu Yu Hakusho) because of the tournament format and the batlle to save humanity and the GIRL context.To make it short this anime came after DBZ and YYH and before Naruto, Bleach FT. It\'s unique art in fighting, character development and overall enjoyment deserve its own credit and it doesn\'t owe any anime for its overall success.

', 'if you\'re a fan of the following animes u will enjoy flame of recca: yu yu hakusho,naruto,fairy tail,mebbe even a lil dbz. lots of times i could see how this anime might\'ve possibly inspired some of the newer animes. i could also see a lil ""borrowing"" from older animes too. its a typical good vs evil fight, a hero who has something to protect, with friends to support and depend on. sound familliar? the characters felt pretty cookie cutter standard.it has a fighting tournamanent with a whole bunch of interesting  weapons and difficult enemies. there are adorable furi referrees and lil bits...of dark fanservice as well as some successful and unsuccessful attempts at comedy.all in all a very good anime to keep u busy. the elemental powers were pretty cool and i really liked the bad guy. however i felt cheated by the ending, no sense of closure. possibly an anime u would want to read the manga for. of dark fanservice as well as some successful and unsuccessful attempts at comedy.all in all a very good anime to keep u busy. the elemental powers were pretty cool and i really liked the bad guy. however i felt cheated by the ending, no sense of closure. possibly an anime u would want to read the manga for.', ""This show tells the story of a young ninja who wants to be a Hokage. He relies on elemental attacks and ninjutsu. This is probably the kind of story you already know.But it doesn’t match the benchmark of Naruto. It is not as diverse or complicated. Plus, it's not even finished. The show fails to generate sufficient tension as it lacks seriousness. For instance, the main character belongs to history and is moved to the present-day. This generates a sense of bewilderment.The show only lasts for 42 episodes. But that is not enough time to care about the characters or the story. The show was...stretched too thin by all the characters. They cannot be properly developed within the given time. The show focuses too much on fights or training. This leaves little room for character development. The characters become one-dimensional.All the characters are alike. They are trained, fight and make enemies into friends and start the whole process over again but with tougher adversaries. Nothing is solved when the show ends. It leaves you feeling disappointed.The show was not so good in the first place. Now it seems even more horrible due to the antiquated style of animation. Music and character designs are rather bland. It is also interesting to note that Studio Pierrot, the same studio which has made Naruto, developed this show.At the same time, there were better shows such as Dragon Ball and Hunter X Hunter on TV. The show was later cancelled before it could be wrapped up. It was like Yu Yu Hakusho, which ended up in the same way. Flame of Recca is basic and common. Naruto is a better choice.The show simply recycles old ideas without bringing anything new to the table. Watch it if you are curious as to how straightforward the genre can be.

In fact my favorite music is ""Love is Changing"" 1st ending. Art is given a 6 and music is given a 8.The plot is so generic and boring. The first half of the anime starts off with Kurei kidnapping Yanagi and the team Hokage had to rescue her. Oh my not another damsel in distress! Then the second half is the tournament whereby Team Hokage have to beat the opposing force in order to save the world.Yanagi Sakoshita is the team healer of the team but is very vulnerable to situations...and is also a big crybaby. Too bad I am being sarcastic. If she cannot fight, why must she be here in the tournament in the first place? Is it because she is so obsessed with Recca? Yes.Yanagi Sakoshita starts off with being badass but then reduced to damsel in distress. Wait no, I take that back. She is totally a damsel in distress throughout the anime and she needs people to protect her. She is completely affecting the plot. I just really hate damsel in distress because this plot is so overused.If you like this anime, that\'s cool. and is also a big crybaby. Too bad I am being sarcastic.

I haven't read the manga, so my review is based off the anime solely. However, I think Flame of Recca was a fast-paced, action-based, easy to understand story. All the different opposing groups from Team Hokage were explained fairly well, given the style of the series. The story was very easy to understand and was smooth in delivery. I liked the art, it was reminiscent of 90's style, which I've always liked. The sounds were great, although since I watched the dubbed version, some of the...characters voice overs were gyrating to the ears.. The characters were nicely developed throughout the series. Although, the ending was a little abrupt. Overall, it was a very good, enjoyable series I'd recommend to anyone who likes action & ninjas. characters voice overs were gyrating to the ears..

I was scrolling on the internet for pictures of Kenshin for my next Sword Technique review, and came across a site in where someone had collected Kenshin look-a-likes. One of them was Tokia, a character from Flame of Recca. I was bored anyway, so without having any knowledge of what I was going to get I decided to give it a shot.After watching the first few episodes, I was getting into it, but the following part was almost too much to comprehend, and not in a good way.Recca\'s character was devoid of any development beyond...three or two episodes. He\'s a fast, witty guy with ninja skill. And he MUST. ALWAYS. PROTECT. HIS. PRINCESS. NO. MATTER. WHAT.Almost insulting is the morality the show teaches: If your friend is dying, just let them! Don\'t interfere because that would damage their ego too much.Tokia was the ""calm, logical""-type of guy, yet he only once called this out and it lasted just few moments. Afterwards, the narrator referred to it as a ""debating over something meaningless"". Also, the weirdest comic relief scene ever: When Recca takes some flying glass on him, protecting his princess, the removal of the glass and following bloodburst is played for laughs. Which, honestly, shocked me.Maybe best character is Domon, who at first seems like a school bully, since he\'s bullying someone at school. Later, that\'s not adressed. He\'s just a tough, muscular guy. And his every second of glory is ruined every time.The main powersource in this series are the madogus, gems that have various superpowers that are all cliche\'d. These gems can be used together, apparently, be swallowed to increse effect or destroyed by a punch! These things are more frail than my mind after sitting through this series.There are some good things in this anime, let\'s not forget those. To call the best, iintense action scenes and really nice imagination behind the powers.The finale was... mediocre. There were good things in it, though the improvement of Recca\'s friends disappointed.The villain, Kurei\'s father, was designed the best. He was scary, yet real. The motivation he had was real, but Kurei\'s one was rushed in and I didn\'t end up understanding it.This show could have had:A better pacing: There\'s too much things happening all the time.Better logic: Sometimes the characters do really stupid things that don\'t feel like them at all, some fights have no meaning or purpose and why are the narrators in DEATH TOURNAMENT all scantily clad furry girls?! Tournament that is the final epic showdown and takes up majority of the show\'s entire showtime!?Also, take about half of the fighting off and the series would rejoice, rest of them would be interesting and have a little meaning.The character development is always left for few moments if there\'s any and all the moments Recca and Yanagi share together are shattered by some jerk interfering. To be honest, all the moments where anyone is having romantic stuff with someone are.If the pacing was better, characters more real, superpowers better used and the show\'d dare to let in more serious and hard stuff, Flame of Recca would shine brighter than the candle it is right now. three or two episodes.

It is a shounen, martial arts, adventure and superpower anime. It tells the story of Recca Hanabishi a boy that has been sent 400 years into the future after his mother Kagerou used a forbidden technique in order to rescue him from getting wiped along with the Hokage ninja clan. In modern day times Recca has grown up to become a troublemaker promising foes that he will become their loyal ninja if they can beat them at a one on one fight, one day he encounters Sakoshita Yanagi...a girl with the power of healing in danger at a construction site, he then saves her and then after that Recca's world starts delving into a whole new direction going forward. At it's core Flame Of Recca is a average shounen at best. The story is mediocre and the characters are not well developed and fleshed out enough, but aye that's what you expect from a shounen anyway, since you don't watch Shounen anime or read shounen jump for the story or the characters, you read or watch it for the epic fight scenes, the power-ups and the out of these world supernatural powers that the characters do end up possesing. Flame Of Recca is not all that different despite being made in the 90's it has the generic let's infiltrate the enemies base, and a tournament arc as well for crying out loud, now granted the genre wasn't that big in the 90's except for Yu Yu Hakusho and DBZ, but both of those shows contained those exact same arc concepts that this show follows. These exact same arc formulas have been adapted by Shounen anime to this day, so Flame Of Recca in theory did contribute as one of the OG 90's anime in a sense, so it has that going for it at least. These are some things that I did enjoy from this show tho, the first OP and ED were really good and I listened to them constantly and that is why it sucks that the second ED was ass since the first one was a banger but it is what it is, next up the fight scenes were pretty good tho even tho most of them were won by the classic power of friendship that I must protect my nakama cliche but at least the fight scenes were good enough to entertain me, after that the madogu were actually fairly interesting they each have their own power and drawbacks even tho most of those drawbacks were because of the user plus if you break them they lose their power, but for the most part the madogu felt unique as powers to me since shounen powers tend to be bland and boring or overpowered for no reason whatsoever most times, the madogu are actually fairly weak but are still equally dangerous, to top that off they were interesting as well for me. Finally the characters were decent enough that despite not being relatable or realistic they are still not that bad as characters, if anything I actually fairly enjoyed them on their journey and rooted for them in most cases, that said unfortunately there is no getting around the fact that they are still generic shounen characters made for a generic shounen manga or anime.Pros:-Banger OP and ED-Interesting power known as madogus-Entertaining-Fight scenes are decent enoughCons:-Mediocre story-Bland shounen characterization-Some scenes start up with good animation then get cut or panned out to a different scene in order to not look as bad , but to no avail since it just ends up looking like they ran out of budget for their animation-Uses generic shounen troupes, cliches and arcs such as power of friendship overcomes everything, and the classic tournament arc-Is dated in terms of production qualityOverall Flame Of Recca is a generic shounen anime made in the 90's adapted from a shounen jump manga, it utilizes generic  characterization, cliches and arcs that the genre has recycled for multiple years now, but it is surprisingly entertaining with its decent fight scenes and it's interesting powers that it introduces. If you're looking for a old school shounen anime to watch then Yu Yu Hakusho or Flame Of Recca might be you're go to watches.  I give it a 6/10 for my overall anime rating.

Well when Vizio Free Watch came on I saw the Retro Crush Anime channel and saw some of Flame of Recca and fell in love with to. So I took my laptop out and went on 9ANIME.to and began watching Flame of Recca. I loved the series so much that I binged watched the show in almost a week despite having school. I really enjoyed how the anime was...really entertaining from characters to plot. The story was amazing I enjoyed how Recca was a boy who lived with his adoptive dad who made fireworks, to meeting his princess Yanagi,  to finding out a shady woman who lived for over 400yrs was his mother, to finding out his brother was a villain, to working with his brother to beat the most corrupted man who wants immortality. Overall the anime is really good if you like Naruto or MHA you might really enjoy this anime and all. Though it blows my mind that this anime ain’t super popular however this anime is one hidden gem that’s a masterpiece in the anime and manga world! really entertaining from characters to plot.

The episode 21 and real anime of ""Rekka"" is the is good as all FUCK and is the best anime material of all, yes better than ""EVANGELION"", ""HUNTER X HUNTER"" (of course), FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST"", ""JOJO"" (of course) and any anime or anime material you could thing. WHY? well that thing... IS SO SATANIC... That is good, yeah, many people knows that ""Rekka"" is satanic and its episode 21 is not free from being satanic but its satanism makes...it a pretty good watch and even if you are a fanatic catholic/christian you will love and recognize its quality and you will watch episode 21 of ""Rekka"" a lot of times just don`t turn satanic cuz we all know satanism is bad (thank you) it a pretty good watch and even if you are a fanatic catholic/christian you will love and recognize its quality and you will watch episode 21 of ""Rekka"" a lot of times just don`t turn satanic cuz we all know satanism is bad (thank you)', 'What\'s the best way I can describe this? A Yu Yu Hakusho fandub.Why do I say that? It\'s cringy but it\'s to the point where it\'s funny, it\'s a mixture of the voice acting, script, and just the overall nature of it. I\'m not sure if it\'s intentional or not but I kinda like it that way, it\'s ironic.I dabbled in both the sub and dub, thinking there had to be some sort of reason for all this nonsense such as translation errors but they are both equally cringy. I mean Recca calls Yanagi ""My Princess"" every time he refers to her which gets pretty...annoying but just as fun to make fun of. Recca\'s voice even sounds like the guy who plays Sonic in Snapcube\'s fandub of Sonic \'06. Not to mention how they need to tell each other the same stuff over and over again.Villain: ""I\'ve attached my strings to you, you\'re my puppet.""Fuuko: ""I can\'t move."" she says cluelessly as she attacks Recca and Domon.Recca and Domon: ""Fuuko why\'d you do that?""Villain: ""Weren\'t you listening? I said I\'ve attached strings to you,you\'re my puppet.""Fuuko:""Ahh I can\'t stop.""Recca and Domon: ""Fuuko, stop it.""Fuuko: ""I can\'t.""This is a literal scene, I can\'t make this up.Back to the Yu Yu Hakusho similarities. This is almost a parody, I mean the main character practically dies (almost) in the first episode, has to form a team, has a character with a similar design to Kurama, has the first arc basically the same as the Spirit Beast arc from YuYu while going to a castle/mansion to save a girl with healing powers which is literally the Yukina arc. The second arc is a tournament (Dark Tournament). I can keep going but it\'s just hard to look at this anime seriously when there are other anime that have done the same thing before and better.The animation is kind of old, I have to admit, you\'ll see some random stuff like a person go from socks to shoes to socks within a few frames but it\'s fluid, the movement is really good. There\'s this one move Recca did in the very first episode and I can\'t get it out of my head where he was lying flat on the ground then gets up with no effort at all and does a half spin then flips, you\'ll know it when you see it. Then this part where Fuuko looks like she\'s ice skating but on air. I dig that kind of stuff.I\'m not sure why Domon is there, I took him as that one off character for Recca to tease but no, just like how Kuwabara was Yusuke\'s rival, Domon is Recca\'s which means he\'s reoccurring and a full member of the team which if I\'m honest, he \'s really annoying and not in the charming way that Kuwabara was, I really like Kuwabara, he has a use, Domon is just there. He has a powered up nose ring that bothers the crap out of me along with that stupid haircut. I would have to say him and Kage have the worst designs.The music is actually pretty decent, not going to lie.They introduce the ""Madogus"" which are weapons that basically provide a source of power, like how Recca\'s can help control fire. To me, it\'s fine to introduce this as ""What might this villain have as a madogu?"" especially since it\'s only 42 episodes, as long as it doesn\'t pander and run out of ideas then use that as bait to keep people entertained then come up with an infinite amount. I don\'t think that this anime really does that since it\'s only 42 episodes but I\'m not sure about the manga.It\'s initially pretty ironic to watch but that novelty wears off because it seems more like a chore during the second half because of all the filler, if you\'re watching it for the actual story and not the way it\'s delivered then it\'s probably best to read the manga so you can get a more fleshed out version. This is why I stopped watching during episode 25, it just wasn\'t going to get any better. I looked up the ending to both the anime and the manga, the anime ends half way through the manga (because they were running at the same time) and where I ended off was actually only chapter 56 in the manga (there\'s 300+). I guess you could technically see the anime and then ease into the manga to get the rest but I really would go the full manga route if you\'re that interested. It has potential but it\'s like it can\'t quite reach it because the some of the concepts are pretty cool but are they worth it? Have you already seen Yu Yu Hakusho? That\'s up to you. annoying but just as fun to make fun of. Recca\'s voice even sounds like the guy who plays Sonic in Snapcube\'s fandub of Sonic \'06.

I dig that kind of stuff.I\'m not sure why Domon is there, I took him as that one off character for Recca to tease but no, just like how Kuwabara was Yusuke\'s rival, Domon is Recca\'s which means he\'s reoccurring and a full member of the team which if I\'m honest, he \'s really annoying and not in the charming way that Kuwabara was, I really like Kuwabara, he has a use, Domon is just there. He has a powered up nose ring that bothers the crap out of me along with that stupid haircut. I would have to say him and Kage have the worst designs.The music is actually pretty decent, not going to lie.They introduce the ""Madogus"" which are weapons that basically provide a source of power, like how Recca\'s can help control fire. To me, it\'s fine to introduce this as ""What might this villain have as a madogu?"" especially since it\'s only 42 episodes, as long as it doesn\'t pander and run out of ideas then use that as bait to keep people entertained then come up with an infinite amount. I don\'t think that this anime really does that since it\'s only 42 episodes but I\'m not sure about the manga.It\'s initially pretty ironic to watch but that novelty wears off because it seems more like a chore during the second half because of all the filler, if you\'re watching it for the actual story and not the way it\'s delivered then it\'s probably best to read the manga so you can get a more fleshed out version. This is why I stopped watching during episode 25, it just wasn\'t going to get any better. I looked up the ending to both the anime and the manga, the anime ends half way through the manga (because they were running at the same time) and where I ended off was actually only chapter 56 in the manga (there\'s 300+). I guess you could technically see the anime and then ease into the manga to get the rest but I really would go the full manga route if you\'re that interested. It has potential but it\'s like it can\'t quite reach it because the some of the concepts are pretty cool but are they worth it? Have you already seen Yu Yu Hakusho? That\'s up to you.']"
Saber Marionette J,https://myanimelist.net/anime/573/Saber_Marionette_J,"['Man~ it sure is good to re-watch some old anime sometimes, too much 720p-1080p is bad for your health (hehe). Specially if its Sci-fi, Comedy and Romance... well the action is not bad either.Story:The story revolves around Otaru Mamiya and his three Marionettes named Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry, but they are not just an ordinary ordinary marionettes, they have a system called ""Maiden Circuit"" that act like the source of their emotion thats why they can laugh and cry. A futuristic setting in a planet named Terra - II in the country of Japones where there are no female and all male are born from...cloning. Female was replaced by Female machine called Marionettes. Thus begin their wacky adventure under one roof. The gags are old but still funny specially when the punchline is hanagata. The story is not always about humor, there is drama also, its the main point of the story on how the three marionette grows emotionally thru happiness and hardship. The anime\'s story is slow pace but not boring so you will have time to enjoy how the it will develop.Character:Meet Otaru a normal boy who live a normal life, kind and hard working . One day he accidentally activated a Marionette named Lime. Lime a marionette with a cute and childish personality, always eat and play around and loves Otaru a lot. She\'s my favorite marionette because whenever she\'s around the surrounding become cheerful. Next is Cherry the second marionette Otaru awakened. She always give a maiden aura, in cuteness i think its in par with Lime. She loves to cook and more importantly loves to daydream about his master Otaru.The third was Bloodberry, she\'s a how should i say it... a muscle woman? Well she\'s not as cute as the first two but she emits an older woman aura, she has the biggest breast among the three and loves to seduce Otaru. For side character, let see, hmm... Hanagata hes a loser so lets forgot about him (Hanagata: What did you just say?) just joking, he always introduce himself as Otaru\'s bestfriend, a pesky character who appears anywhere near Otaru.Art:Otaru, his design is quite simple, passable for a normal character.For the character design of the three marionettes, Lime, since she loves to move around designing loose costume fits nicely with her character. Cherry, she\'s loves doing housework so the cutely designed pink kimono si looks good in her. Bloodberry with the blood on her red suits her best, well only her hair is red, she got the most daring design because of her nicely proportioned body and big-sister like character.Sound:The Opening song is good, you will like it the more you listened to it. Same goes for the Ending song, with a great visualization it will make you listened to the song as well. For The Seiyuu\'s, I really like the japanese voice for Lime, Megumi Hayashibara. It match perfectly with Limes personality, cute and playful. I dont like the english dub, it gives a kind of feeling that its not Lime-like. Same goes with Cherry, i like her polite voice. When u talk about Bloodberry, that means Power, power in the voice but with a sweetness of an older women and the seiyuu deliver it nicely.Enjoyment:After many years of not seeing this anime (10 years +) it give me a nostalgic feeling and with that i enjoy it a lot. I laughed in the funny scenes and got teary in those touching moment. I couldn\'t ask for more... :Dif u read some weird grammar, its my bad haha, ore ningen da mono~ cloning.

I couldn\'t ask for more... :Dif u read some weird grammar, its my bad haha, ore ningen da mono~', ""I heard about this anime way back when I was in high school, but I was never able to check it out until about a week ago. And well, I must say I don't regret watching this anime. I really enjoyed it.Story:A boy named Otaru Mamiya awakens three marionettes called Lime, Cherry, and Blood Berry, who are all different from other marionettes on Terra 2. What makes them different from all the other female robots/androids? Well, Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry have this thing called a Maiden Circuit, which acts like their heart. And that means they get to experience emotions. Basically, this story is about...Otaru's daily life with the three mechanical girls and of course throw in a plot about an evil ruler from a German-inspired country/kingdom that wants to conquer Japaness (Otaru's Japanese inspired homeland) with his own Marionettes with Maiden Circuits, and you got one hell of a story.Of course, all the episodes had me hooked. I enjoyed watching the crazy antics of Otaru's marionettes as they fought for his affections (Tenchi Muyo style might I add) all the while of learning about the daily lives of humans. The first half of the season is mostly about Otaru adjusting to life with the girls, with him teaching them about various human experiences such as life and death, and the second half of the series delves more into the reason for Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry all having Maiden Circuits and why there are only men on Terra 2, oh and the war against the German-inspired country of Gartland.At first glance, this might seem like another sci fi-ish harem that's trying to be like Evangelion and Tenchi Muyo but honestly, it's not. It's not as goofy and lighthearted as TM but at the same time it doesn't try to be all that serious like Neon Genesis Evangelion, but the similarities are still there. Each episode, believe it or not, carried the story on, adding onto the characters and their own little arcs. This series wasn't afraid to slow down and make you cry over something as trivial as Lime's pet squirrel dying (Ugh, yes there was an episode where Lime learned first hand about death...) or learning about the past of the antagonist, Lord Faust. There's also plenty of action scenes as well.Art:I'll admit that the art style of the characters all looked a little weird to me at first but I quickly got used to it. Everything looked great, even albeit a bit dated. The character designs really showed off the personality of all the characters, from the intimidating Lord Faust to the cute adorable Cherry. The action sequences were really fluid and the characters were really well done and expressive. And the scenery. There was a lot of pretty scenery.Sound:So, I watched the English dub and not the Japanese dub, and well, eh, I will say that the English Dub isn't bad, I mean it's not the best out there. But I liked it. I especially liked Lime's VA. But all of the actors brought life to their characters and the music, the opening theme got stuck in my head while I watched this. The ending song was pretty catchy. All the sounds overall were pretty good, from the cracks of plasma lightning(?) being heard in the sky, to the cute squeaks of the weird Ponta creatures in the forest, and the punches and kicks that Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry dealt out when protecting Otaru.Characters:Ah yes, I will say that while the story did feel a bit awkward, the characters are really what makes Saber Marionette J shine. We have the serious yet kindhearted Otaru Mamiya, the cheerful and childish Lime, the soft-spoken and modest Cherry, and the tough badass yet flirty Bloodberry. There are other characters but I don't really wanna spoil anything. All I gotta say is that I loved these characters, especially Lime, she was really adorable and I actually cried whenever Lime cried. All the characters all added something to the overall plot of this anime. From Lime learning about life and death to Bloodberry being conflicted over possibly liking another character who was similar to Otaru.Enjoyment;I had a lot of fun watching this series though I will admit that there were a few episodes that were sad but they didn't evoke any emotions out of me at all, except for the one about Lime and her pet squirrel and possibly another one that I'm not gonna say anything about. Let's just say I was hooked on this series until the end.Overall:Overall, I'd say give this series a watch because while it seems like it's trying to be another Tenchi Muyo or another Neon Genesis Evangelion, it isn't.

I found this series by pressing the “random anime series” button on a website, and honestly I'm glad I did.The premise of the series is that sometime in the future, a group of 6 explorers made an emergency crash onto the Planet of Terra. There was the inconvenient problem that they landed without any females. Rather than wither off on this distant planet, the six decided to make clones of themselves, and thus...repopulated the planet, but without females. The compensation for the lack of females is the development of female-appearing robots called marionettes, who can function like a human, but can't experience feelings of their own, except, that is, for a few special marionettes whom our intrepid protagonist discovers, leading to ever more grand adventures until the fate of the planet is at stake.A few complaints with this show are that it has a very obvious plot, most of the jokes aren't funny, an irritating worm put in for comic relief really degrades this series, and a lot of the story is patronizing. I think this series is made especially for kids. The OP & ED are quite catchy, the animation is bad by today's standards, and the characters are a bit flat. It's still good clean fun though, worth watching with popcorn and friends. repopulated the planet, but without females.

The story is about Otaru, three female androids called Marionettes, and there struggles to cope in a world without actual women.It came to be this way because of an accident on a colonization ship that left six men alive on the surface, and they use genetics to populate the planet of Terra II. The direct clones of the six survivors rule the six nations that exist on the planet, Otaru being from Japoness which looks like feudal Japan.Otaru tries to grow the personality of...the three Marionettes throughout the series while having to deal with Gartland's (Germany during World War II) ruler Faust and his own set of three Marionettes. The story is alright if you don't have a problem with small details that could be considered giant plot holes with a lot of thought.The art is dated even for a show from 12 years ago. The marionettes look vibrant, but completely out of place. The backgrounds of the other nations seemed to have been picked because they are easier to depict. Action scenes look merely average. It's not horrific, but it would be hard to call it good.Characters are a much stronger point. Otaru is not your typical male harem lead. The marionettes show diversity in character as the series progress from one-dimensional to something more.Overall, Saber Marionette J is a solid, if not spectacular, series.

NO REAL WOMAN !!!!This would sond like a gay anime, but it is not !!! Because of this premise it is rather natural that men end up coupling with others... i mean... other men.So the anime starts with Otaru (the protagonist) finding himself not interested at all in other men, and get interested in human female androids.

Sabage-bu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20709/Sabage-bu,"['I never had any expectations for Sabagebu. It was never given any attention when I made that ""season previews are worthless"" post sometime before the summer season aired. I just saw that it was one of those ""girls using weaponry"" anime, remembered how I didn\'t give C3-bu much of a chance when it aired a year ago, noticed that it was the first thing to air in the season (even though it was due to being a pre-air), and gave it a shot. Was kind of surprised at how fast-paced and violent the premiere was, so I watched the second episode. And then the third....And now I\'ve finished the entire series.- Watch out Witchcraft Works, because I think you\'ve got competition for the best ""hidden gem"" of the year. And considering how fucking insane you turned out to be, that\'s saying more than America\'s word that West Africa will be ebola-free within the next five years.What the advertisements for this show failed to get across to me is that Sabagebu is a black comedy, a genre that\'s kind of rare in anime and even rarer in shoujo. Sure you have plenty of 90s-era John Hughes slapstick knockoffs getting produced every season, but in terms of comedies where the humor deliberately comes from the characters being assholes (on purpose) in the vein of ""the only good sitcom airing right now"" It\'s Always Sunny In Philadelphia? With no attempts at being heartfelt, and whenever it does, it pulls the rug from under you? I don\'t think even Milky Holmes at its peak was this cruel.And whilst the other characters contribute their fair share to the proceedings, the main reason this show works is because of the main character: Momoka. Why? Because she\'s just so impossible a character to sympathize with to the point that she becomes extremely interesting. While not exactly on the level of great British assholes like Blackadder or Bernard from Black Books, I don\'t think I\'m exaggerating when I say that Momoka is quite frankly the biggest asshole you\'ll ever see in any other anime this year, and quite possibly the last few. Nothing about her is kind. She\'s not someone you\'d ever want to be with in reality. If this was a romantic drama, she\'d be that character that single-handedly ruins the series with forced conflict and a deal with the devil.- Thankfully, Sabagebu is a skit-based comedic series that actually has a ""reset button"" license. Oh, one of the girls caused a helicopter to crash and killed two pilots in the process, sending them to meet the devil? Eh, nobody cares about those extras, so let\'s not turn her over to the police and just publicly humiliate her for the fact that she couldn\'t flush a toilet.Once Momoka\'s behavior grounded me into the series, all the writers had to do was create short scenarios that exploited her, as well as the rest of the cast, for comedy and creativity. There\'s quite a few gags that don\'t really work (the fat stuff, the stalkers on the mountain, the school president thing that went on twice as long as it should have), but each episode always had one that was really great and it\'s paced quick enough so that you don\'t stare at a skit for too long trying to extract a laugh from your dirty ugly mouth.- The punchlines get a little predictable as time goes on because it\'s pretty obvious before too long that someone\'s going to suffer by the time a skit ends. But it\'s done cleverly enough, again similar to Sunny, that it never really grows stale.- And even if the jokes don\'t satisfy you, at least you can\'t deny that Sabagebu has great action chops. I haven\'t actually seen Aldnoah Zero\'s fight choreography despite the praise for it, but I\'d be surprised to hear that it was of much higher quality than this show\'s ""old people riding jeeps whilst shooting at youngsters"" action.- This ain\'t like the shitty ""punch one spot multiple times and use stills for dramatic effect"" stuff that Akame ga Kill seems to think qualifies for action. It isn\'t unstylized powerpoint like Tokyo ESP. It\'s not the utterly incompetent ""couldn\'t hit the broadside of a barn"" crap that Jormungand indulged in. No, this is hands-down expert gun stuff that isn\'t quite as good as Black Lagoon, but is worthy enough to stand in its shadow. And that\'s better than most gun action we get in Hollywood these days (fuck you shaky cam!).There\'s not really much more I can say about Sabagebu considering it\'s a plotless comedy that never takes itself seriously. I do urge people to give it a shot if what I said appeals to you, because I don\'t think it deserved the low amount of attention it received whilst airing. Just be aware that the first episode is a little rocky and the second is when it starts to find its footing. If you\'re not hooked by the third - you monster - then the rest probably won\'t appeal to you. I definitely don\'t consider it the best anime of the year (Space Dandy, Tiger and Bunny: The Rising, maybe Terror in Resonance but I need to see how it ends first). Has a few too many ""mehs"" for me to really rank it too high, let alone consider it my favorite ""cute girl"" anime.- That said, barring some explosion of quality next season, it\'s definitely going into my top ten anime for this year.

Has a few too many ""mehs"" for me to really rank it too high, let alone consider it my favorite ""cute girl"" anime.- That said, barring some explosion of quality next season, it\'s definitely going into my top ten anime for this year.', ""'I know what the title says, but don't go expecting real survival games!'Do you enjoy an anime where girls battle out with guns? Well, there have been a lot of anime that fit that category such as C3 and Strike Witches. I know I've seen a few, and this anime is one.There's nothing much to say about Sabagebu honestly. It revolves a hig-school club called the 'Survival Games Club' and we look into the crazy shenanigans these high-schoolers are put up into. Momoka, the character focus of the group, transferred to this high school and is forced into the club by its president, Miou. From...there, she leads her own not-so-ordinary life.Now, what's good about this anime is the hilarious comedy. It never failed to make me laugh every episode. From the characters to the main story, it just brightens your day. The anime takes in many forms of comedy, whether dramatic or just plain stupid. Sometimes it just became Nichijou, but with a bit more understanding.'This is all in the girls' imaginations. You can't die in a real survival game, so don't worry!'I must really give props to the narrator. You probably never seen a lot of narrators in anime, so this kind is not wasted. He is definitely an awesome person whom I will never stop laughing at.The characters are sweet and have nice personalities which has some similar tropes for a typical comedy anime. Momoka has a two-sided personality, Miou is rich and loved, Maya is a beauty who always die first out of the rest, Urara being a masochist always wanting to be near Momoka, and Kayo is a cosplay fanatic who doesn't talk much.But I feel that there is some character development in Momoka, as she has a liking into the club and make many memories with it.There are other supporting characters whom I find are always very funny in their own ways. Some of them reappear in different episodes and they love to create chaos or just fun to the club, or Momoka.In the end, the characters are a funny bunch in their own aspects.I'm not quite fond with the art in this anime. The character designs are quite stale, with weird hairstyles and body shapes, despite some of the characters have weird body shapes for the sake of comedy. The scenery is a bit bland and nothing interesting to see. The gun battles can be fun and exciting to look at, but the damage done seems a bit boring.But still, facial expressions are amusing. I quite like the designs of the guns the characters have. The opening and ending visuals are nice with a taste of action and comedy.The opening song, sung by Momoka's VA, Ayaka, has a great energy feel along with the beautiful vocals. The ending song, sung by the cast, has taken a more funny approach with the lyrics, along with nice dancing music. Honestly, I can't stop grooving at the ending song.The background music varies a lot. Sometimes, in special occasions, they may play an interesting theme that matches. Otherwise, it has nice relaxing music that sounds like it come out from a typical slice of life anime. Nothing wrong, really, but it is good to listen. The voice acting is great, with a lot giving emphasis to their thoughts and feelings for comedy sake. There are some recognisable voice actresses in the anime.No one should take Sabagebu seriously. It is definitely worth the laughs from the viewers like me. I enjoyed this anime very much and it brightens my day a lot.Certainly, I would never see girls running around a battlefield wielding guns ever again, unless a season two arrives. there, she leads her own not-so-ordinary life.Now, what's good about this anime is the hilarious comedy.

A place where we imagine battles with fake guns and take comedy to the extreme!The anime was something I was unsure to watch, with it's bright palette it didn't seem to suit the military genre and I didn't know what to expect. After watching the entire series I can safely say it's something that I enjoyed from the start to finish. The anime was hidden due to the strong Summer line-up such as SAO 2, Glasslip and Barakamon. It didn't get as much justice as it should have in my opinion.With the anime following the comedy route, you...see a lot of interactions between all the characters to make retorts and scenes as hilarious as possible. The story follows Momoka, a transfer student at a new high school and she gets roped into joining the Survival Game Club. The rest of the series follows Momoka meeting the members and their antics as the year progresses in the club.They have games where they battle as if it's a real war and use their imagination to show blood and action scenes. With that being said, the battle scenes are something that I find really interesting. They take the normal scene and add special effects, slow motion, and music to make it different from the norm. The stunts and tricks they do amazed me due to the fact that it's something you don't expect from an anime like this one.A big point that got me interested in this show, was that it wasn't only about survival games. With the show really making it emphasized that the anime would be about the club and their interests for survival, the anime has some episodes that stray away from that and bring out new concepts. You get an episode where Momoka gets a little too fat and has problems dieting, an episode where Maya tries to get over her dislike of natto, and an episode about modeling. The show isn't focused on one main idea and it does a great job showing that.Characters are a big factor that can be a hit or a miss for almost anyone. The characters in this anime were unique to say. You're given someone who loves cosplay and solely joins the club for that reason, a girl who turns into a masochist, a model, and a senior held back due to misconduct. The cast seems pretty diverse and it adds for some really interesting interactions from them all.Momoka is a character that really drives this anime from her facade and interesting personality. On the outside shes introduced as a sweet person, but is actually sharp-tongued and easily angered. She loves to get revenge and is the complete opposite of how people view her. She's someone you can't really connect with since her personality is all over the place and it really catches the viewer to see what she'd do next.The other main characters all have unique personalities to keep some puns and jokes coming along the way, but some are obvious and you'll catch on right away. You get character develop for once in an anime with no story or plot to follow, surprising I know. You see change in the way Momoka views the club at first and towards the end. Her personality changes a little and you can see all the events that she went through did affect her in some way.Art is something that i'm generally picky about, but this got me right away. With the bright palettes you get a sense that the anime isn't dark and it fit the mood of the anime right away. The scenes where the battles take place and the imagination of the characters make the battles much better and fun to watch. The background for each scene is top quality, the detail in the forests, backdrop and school are really on point. The guns are all really nicely drawn and has details that each one specifically only has and brings a sense of realism to them.The sound is something that really brings out the anime and supports it greatly. With a wonderful opening to begin each episode, it's catchy and is one of the few that I never skip. Then you get an ending sung by the whole cast that gives a nice closure to each episode. The background music always fit each scene. With the anime having serious scenes and more mellow scenes, you get background music that fit each one and brought out the feelings that the characters are trying to give off. The voice actors in this anime are great. They all gave each character life and made it much more enjoyable to watch. Even the side characters have great voice actors and they all stepped it up to show emotion and comedy.All in all I feel this is one that was over shadowed by the hype and praise that some anime got. I recommend anyone who just wants to watch a comedy and laugh till their sides hurt to check this out. It has great characters, wonderful art and a nice soundtrack to go along with it.

It's not perfect, but it does a great job working with what it has."", ""Plain and simple. That's the name of the game with this show. Sabagebu is a solid comedy that had surprisingly great potential early on, and then somewhat dips a bit below later. It never gets bad nor does it ever become amazing, but it does suffer from a few problems here and there. I was hoping for something akin to a successor to Yuru Yuri (I believe the director of both shows might be the same person, but I am not sure) and it was not quite that. Of course I cannot fault it for it not being something that it was not setting out...to be.What I can fault it for are things like its music. One thing that drove me insane with this show was its extremely small soundtrack. All the songs are fun enough, but it is honest to goodness something akin to only two or three songs that just keep getting played over and over again, multiple times an episode. I'm sure plenty of anime do this (especially comedies), but never has it been so blatantly obvious to me.The cast and voice acting are top notch however. Even the strange perverted otaku Lemon ends up being a ton of fun and always a pleasure to have around. The protagonist is definitely unique among your typical ones too and her cruel nature becomes the butt of most of the game's gags. Every now and then the show would remember the airsoft theme, but it feels odd how rarely utilized it actually is. From the getgo it tells you not to take it seriously, but even for comedic effect the shootings can be somewhat rare. That being said, what this show does best is shake things up. The circumstances and setting for each episode vary so greatly that you sometimes can question if the writer was changed constantly. It's a lot of fun too since it will refer to things like Predator, Alien, Chuck Norris, Arnold, and Otaku culture. It's a mix of a lot of different things so some episodes will feel familiar while others will be completely out there.And despite the cast being so strong, I felt that most of them got no real time to shine, especially the cosplay fanatic and the model. I certainly never got tired of the show and always enjoyed every episode, but I wouldn't really say it's something I'm going to miss now that it's over. It's just your solid seasonal comedy.

Sabagebu! is a lighthearted story about a group of girls who belong to the Survival Game Club. As you may know, there have been several other shows that have played around with this plot (for example, C3), but I\'ll tell you why Sabagebu! did it the right way.First of all, this anime is pretty episodic. The pattern I\'ve noticed is that the episodes typically consist of two or three short story arcs that each last for part of the episode. Sometimes the stories are...more geared towards action, and sometimes they\'re geared more towards school life, or whatever other random events may happen.The cool thing about this series is that it has at least one thing that most people can enjoy. For me, it\'s the action and the actual ""Survival Game"" portion of the show. I love guns, anime girls, but especially anime girls with guns. However, this is where it gets a little different: the guns are actually air soft guns, and all the blood and death that is shown is part of their imaginations. This way, the show can cater to viewers like me who want to see guns and blood, but they also keep it cute, and actually pretty funny, and sometimes features a narrator who occasionally throws in an entertaining commentary.I\'ll admit that the character development is nothing to brag about, though. A lot of the characters are just your standard run-of-the-mill anime archetypes, but a few characters such as the main protagonist have a unique personalities that definitely carry the show. Great art, OST and EST, and is a simple show that definitely entertains.TL;DRA cute and simple show with some guns and blood (part of their imaginations), and a good sense of humor all for a good, entertaining anime.

You love it? You hate it? Because your enjoyment depends on it.First 5 episodes are great!We got interesting, funny situations. Sadistic, masochistic characters with little bit of  schizophrenia. Who doesn\'t love that, right? Humor is great in this show, so surprising and unexpected. And it mix up some serious themes in between jokes like bullying, stealing, rejection. You can even learn some stuff from this anime with a help of narrator who involves viewer...in the show. And because this anime is self conscious it makes everything even more funny. And i love rule ""never judge a book from its cover"" when it comes to character (remember schizophrenia? yea the good stuff). Anime got tons of action, because it makes parody\'s of action movies.Sounds like an awesome anime right? Well this is when the plotless part kicks in.After 5 episodes you get used to crazy characters, jokes gets repetitive and expected. All the awesomeness from first episodes disappears. And it becomes just a random parody, of different movies. Still some episodes are funny from time to time, but ecchi and fan service didn\'t help at all.So in the end i would say, if you like episodical anime and have no problem with it, then you will have some good time with this anime.But if you are just like me, who cant stand repetitiveness and lack of development, then 5 episodes are all that you need too watch to have good fun. in the show.

Believe it or not! An anime about airsoft!The comedies in this show made me laugh occasionally I nearly broke my table in half. Probably because of how weirdly stupid the show was with its overreactions. The narration also kept breaking the 4th wall. It's fucking hilarious.I was depressed but this show cured my depression entirely. With all of the silly things this show offered to me. I now no longer feel an inch of sadness within my heart. Sabage-bu! is a highly cliche anime where everything is pretty much over the top. The story is not strong at all. The characters...are weird. It's just...

Just something you can have a good laugh with. Something that'll make you feel content regardless of how many cliches it throws at you. Sabage-bu!Oh and there's Yuri.

At first glance, you’re probably thinking Stella Jogakuin Koutou-ka C³-bu, a series that aired in Summer 2013. And of course, you’re not wrong either. Both series are about cute girls attending an all-girls school with the new girl transferring in from another school. However, there is an incentive about Sabagebu that invites more attention. No, it’s not just about the girls or ‘cute girls doing cute things’ gag. It’s more of the ‘girls kicking ass while having fun...while doing so.Animated by Pierrot+, the studio has been focused on a variety of projects in recent years. Their latest work, ‘Baby Steps’ is also about a group of people in a club competing in a sport they enjoy. But for Momoka, it’s a bit different. She isn’t entirely fond of handling a gun, let alone compete in it with others. In fact, she “joins” the Survival Game Club after a little trickery by its founder Miou Ootori. And now as part of the club, there are the daily misadventures that Momoka becomes part of.For starters, the series follows a standard premise. It’s about the misadventures of the Survival Game Club. The emphasis is perhaps on the prefix as the club often gets into trouble, sometimes among themselves. This is evident in the first episode when Miou gets into trouble with the law at a subway station. The creativity behind the scenes for the series is inevitable though. From start to finish, each episode transits from a fresh start with its “survival” genre and turns it into a cultural pop comedy with its gags and gimmicks. What’s more noticeable is the fake violence that is aimed to be imaginative. The “fake” violence is surprisingly more graphic as “blood” is spilled but played off as imaginary. The shows’ purpose for perhaps adapting this gimmick is the emphasize ‘survival’. Because let’s face it, a show about girls carrying guns invites nothing more mischief. For the Survival Game Club, mischief is part of their daily vocabulary.The series offers a variety of characters despite most of their mischievous personalities and the energy they bring. As a club about survival, each of them possesses skills in various firearms. But more importantly, it’s the dynamic relationship the characters build with others that highlights the appeal of the show. However, just be aware that the show does not take itself seriously. Characterization isn’t its main goal as back stories are relatively non-existent. Instead, it focuses on more humorous and lighthearted relationships. Some even comes with yuri-undertones such as Urara’s borderline yandere attraction towards Miou (formerly) and Momoka. In one way, the show does this well with wit, energy, and doses of wackiness. It creates a feeling of sensation and makes you want more. However, it can also be repetitive and lacks creativeness. It doesn’t expand beyond its usual clichés and gimmicky concepts. The comedy is also die-hard with senseless commitment to characterization. None of the characters gets developed in any way. And while the show’s gimmicks can be entertaining for laughter, it falls under a line with dull drama rather than allowing it to speak for itself.Individually, each character stands out in their own way despite all of them having skills in handling firearms. Each of them also wield a different firearm and holds a different position within the club. The most prominent member would be the President, Miou. Not only is she from a prestigious family of fortunes, her position at school also makes her a school idol as even girls have the hots for her. However, she also serves an anti-thesis as an idol with her behavior. In essence, she is not a good role model as a member. Perhaps as a person though, she could be respected since for her incentive to aid her friends in need. The other main character, Momoka would be somewhat of a contrast. She doesn’t stand out at school and often wears a poker face. The similarity between Miou and Momoka would be perhaps their innate nature – to be vicious as they need to be. This is often exaggerated but not for truly malevolent intentions. The show presents it as comedy with fantasy-like fan service. Who draws those the most? Perhaps Miou and Momoka. However, their relationship is dyed as dry. They aren’t very compatible with Miou’s popularity and Momoka social awkwardness. Putting them as two peas in a pod would not work well. Most of the other characters stand out with their personalities but lacks the highlight moments that Miou and Momoka receives. The only other character that perhaps can steal the show on occasions would be Urara, a girl of dangerous nature. Call her the classic bitch-in-sheep skin as she is no pushover when it comes to pursuing her targets. After all, have you always wondered why the club has so few members?Plot-less with no direction of its story. The show is episodic in nature with no connection between each consecutive episode. In retrospect, don’t expect an angle to develop in the form of a complex story or arc. Instead, take the comedy as an over-the-top antic in order to appeal to the fans. As it displays a lack of realism for the club or its members, it tries to make it up with its meek action. Nonetheless, the action itself feels lifeless despite the energy poured in. It has puns and gimmicks wedged into situations that doesn’t create a spellbound story. The cosmetic touches often mixes in the wrong way with the characters with awkward situations that expands beyond the club such as with Momoka’s parents. However, if you enjoy out of the world comedy, Sabageou could be a ride for intimate laughter.The effort put into the animation is sloppy and amateurish. It seems like on most occasions, the show gives up with its quality. The action has its cosmetic style with the gimmicks and is fast paced with surprisingly features of “gore”. However, the overall artwork lacks interest with the over-saturation of its energy and bits of fan service. Character designs looks goofy with cardboard quality. Even Miou can’t save the show despite her beauty. The only praise I give for the art would be the creativeness of its OP and ED songs. Shame though. The show’s artwork could have done some justice when it comes to design.Soundtrack is moderate although gives attention to its already noticeable energy. Indeed, the hyper energetic show needs an enthusiastic soundtrack and surprisingly, it works out quite well. Similarly, characters’ voice mannerisms reflects the nature of the Survival Club well. In essence, they give off the feeling of playfulness. Because let’s face it, in the end, the club wants to have fun. Miou in particular has a noticeable voice with her trollish personality. Uraha’s contrast between her cute and aggressive personalities has a good switch between her voices. And finally, the OP and ED songs that is musically weird and alluring at the same time.Sabagebu is a show that isn’t meant to be taken seriously. Despite the girls wielding firearms in a survival club, the series deconstructs itself with misadventures and its characters. Here, we have a whiff of silliness fused with mischievous deeds in a directionless plot. And with our peculiar cast of characters, you can expect some real zaniness going on. Just be aware that the comedy can go over the board though with its gimmicks. Development of its characters also suffer with a lack of characterization or focus on them at a more credible level. It trades this for comedy that could be a hit or miss. It’s 2014 and girls are still doing cute things. Only this time, they get firearms, attitude, and a whole lot of ‘what the hell’ moments. while doing so.Animated by Pierrot+, the studio has been focused on a variety of projects in recent years.

The emphasis is perhaps on the prefix as the club often gets into trouble, sometimes among themselves. This is evident in the first episode when Miou gets into trouble with the law at a subway station. The creativity behind the scenes for the series is inevitable though. From start to finish, each episode transits from a fresh start with its “survival” genre and turns it into a cultural pop comedy with its gags and gimmicks. What’s more noticeable is the fake violence that is aimed to be imaginative. The “fake” violence is surprisingly more graphic as “blood” is spilled but played off as imaginary. The shows’ purpose for perhaps adapting this gimmick is the emphasize ‘survival’. Because let’s face it, a show about girls carrying guns invites nothing more mischief. For the Survival Game Club, mischief is part of their daily vocabulary.The series offers a variety of characters despite most of their mischievous personalities and the energy they bring. As a club about survival, each of them possesses skills in various firearms. But more importantly, it’s the dynamic relationship the characters build with others that highlights the appeal of the show. However, just be aware that the show does not take itself seriously. Characterization isn’t its main goal as back stories are relatively non-existent. Instead, it focuses on more humorous and lighthearted relationships. Some even comes with yuri-undertones such as Urara’s borderline yandere attraction towards Miou (formerly) and Momoka. In one way, the show does this well with wit, energy, and doses of wackiness. It creates a feeling of sensation and makes you want more. However, it can also be repetitive and lacks creativeness. It doesn’t expand beyond its usual clichés and gimmicky concepts. The comedy is also die-hard with senseless commitment to characterization. None of the characters gets developed in any way. And while the show’s gimmicks can be entertaining for laughter, it falls under a line with dull drama rather than allowing it to speak for itself.Individually, each character stands out in their own way despite all of them having skills in handling firearms. Each of them also wield a different firearm and holds a different position within the club. The most prominent member would be the President, Miou. Not only is she from a prestigious family of fortunes, her position at school also makes her a school idol as even girls have the hots for her. However, she also serves an anti-thesis as an idol with her behavior. In essence, she is not a good role model as a member. Perhaps as a person though, she could be respected since for her incentive to aid her friends in need. The other main character, Momoka would be somewhat of a contrast. She doesn’t stand out at school and often wears a poker face. The similarity between Miou and Momoka would be perhaps their innate nature – to be vicious as they need to be. This is often exaggerated but not for truly malevolent intentions. The show presents it as comedy with fantasy-like fan service. Who draws those the most? Perhaps Miou and Momoka. However, their relationship is dyed as dry. They aren’t very compatible with Miou’s popularity and Momoka social awkwardness. Putting them as two peas in a pod would not work well. Most of the other characters stand out with their personalities but lacks the highlight moments that Miou and Momoka receives. The only other character that perhaps can steal the show on occasions would be Urara, a girl of dangerous nature. Call her the classic bitch-in-sheep skin as she is no pushover when it comes to pursuing her targets. After all, have you always wondered why the club has so few members?Plot-less with no direction of its story. The show is episodic in nature with no connection between each consecutive episode. In retrospect, don’t expect an angle to develop in the form of a complex story or arc. Instead, take the comedy as an over-the-top antic in order to appeal to the fans. As it displays a lack of realism for the club or its members, it tries to make it up with its meek action. Nonetheless, the action itself feels lifeless despite the energy poured in. It has puns and gimmicks wedged into situations that doesn’t create a spellbound story. The cosmetic touches often mixes in the wrong way with the characters with awkward situations that expands beyond the club such as with Momoka’s parents. However, if you enjoy out of the world comedy, Sabageou could be a ride for intimate laughter.The effort put into the animation is sloppy and amateurish. It seems like on most occasions, the show gives up with its quality. The action has its cosmetic style with the gimmicks and is fast paced with surprisingly features of “gore”. However, the overall artwork lacks interest with the over-saturation of its energy and bits of fan service. Character designs looks goofy with cardboard quality. Even Miou can’t save the show despite her beauty. The only praise I give for the art would be the creativeness of its OP and ED songs. Shame though. The show’s artwork could have done some justice when it comes to design.Soundtrack is moderate although gives attention to its already noticeable energy. Indeed, the hyper energetic show needs an enthusiastic soundtrack and surprisingly, it works out quite well. Similarly, characters’ voice mannerisms reflects the nature of the Survival Club well. In essence, they give off the feeling of playfulness. Because let’s face it, in the end, the club wants to have fun. Miou in particular has a noticeable voice with her trollish personality. Uraha’s contrast between her cute and aggressive personalities has a good switch between her voices. And finally, the OP and ED songs that is musically weird and alluring at the same time.Sabagebu is a show that isn’t meant to be taken seriously. Despite the girls wielding firearms in a survival club, the series deconstructs itself with misadventures and its characters. Here, we have a whiff of silliness fused with mischievous deeds in a directionless plot. And with our peculiar cast of characters, you can expect some real zaniness going on. Just be aware that the comedy can go over the board though with its gimmicks. Development of its characters also suffer with a lack of characterization or focus on them at a more credible level. It trades this for comedy that could be a hit or miss. It’s 2014 and girls are still doing cute things. Only this time, they get firearms, attitude, and a whole lot of ‘what the hell’ moments.', 'You ever just have that one anime? The one you want to come into your life, the perfect anime.

Sabagebu! or Survival Game Club is absolutely fantastic. Pure comedy gold I tell ya. A great cast of characters with a plot about absolutely nothing! Slice of life with super cuties and guns! BB guns that act like real guns because of the power of imagination, how cool is that!!!!!!!!!!!Following the super cuties Momoka Sonokawa, Miou Ootori, Maya Kyoudou, Urara Kasugano and Kayo Goutokuji. All of them are extra cute and pretty, the inclusion of guns works surprisingly well in Sabagebu. Favorite is definitely Momoka with Urara and their reactions to one another, the masochist and sadist angle is so funny!A...lot of great little stories per episode, I feel a little guilty not doing this anime in an episode by episode type of review, since there is so much to talk about. Some episodes were really crazy, especially the pantsu episodes later on; it came out of no where but the fan service was amazing, totally not necessary, but most definitely amazing.The action scenes in Sabagebu! are incredible too. The ""imaginations"" the girls have is pretty spectacular and the animation with nice colors really lends itself a huge 5/5, 100/100, big thumbs up from me. I loved the little animation scenes of the girls getting into pose before a battle, it was like watching a magical girl henshin, but not a henshin, more like a total bad ass let\'s fight transformation! A whole lot of good comes from watching the battles and just the general aesthetic that Sabagebu! has, for sure.Music, OP and ED\'s! All top notch stuff, especially the audio. Sure the guns don\'t sound like it\'s from Battlefield or anything, but it\'s explosive, strong and sounds soooo gooood~~~. OP and ED\'s are great fun to listen to and the music, when it\'s used throughout the anime, is fantastic too, especially the last episode, most definitely the last episode!!!!Biggest surprise is Momoka\'s mom, I should have seen it coming, but I didn\'t, so it was fun seeing her get involved multiple times.I\'m probably going to have to watch this one again, just because there is so much content available to remember, it\'s really freaking good.Sabagebu! gets a 10/10 from me! Most definitely recommended if you\'re looking for a super funny slice of life involving girls and guns!!

CheckDuck? Indeed!(Yes, these are the boxes)An anime with a half-duck-half-platypus that becomes friends with a crab can only be 10/10. The jokes land, the animation, for what it is, is well done and the story never fails to surprise. The characters are relatable and this anime teaches us a lot about making friends and maintaining meaningful and healthy relationships. It really makes you think about what is really import in live... Friendship, ducks, yuri... This was all in all a life changing experience. Almost... religious. Unlike many other Animes, this one did not leave me feeling...empty and emotionless. Instead, it motivated me to become a better person!To put it all in a nutshell:It smaccIt reccBut most importantly it quacc empty and emotionless.

This is ""cute girls doing cute girl stuff"" SoL anime done right. Well, not exactly right, but definitely better than most of those generic ones out there.Most of the other anime embodying this trope are definitely decent but can sometimes get boring and cringe-y because of all the generic cliches and friendship skits and all that generic shit. It can get funny at times but most of the time they just fall flat.But then I found Sabagebu. A school SoL of cute girls together in a club, yes. But not just any club, a...survival club where everybody wields guns. What makes it more interesting though is we see people getting shot like they were actually shot (in reality they are just pellet guns and there\'s no blood).Most interesting though and what carries this show the most is the protagonist, Momoka. She\'s a full-fledged asshole. She is willing to get other people inconvenienced for her own desires, she is goddamned blinded by money more than anyone else, she cheats and uses underhanded tricks to win. She is a main character unlike most other main characters. Most mains are good and kind at heart, some outward and some mostly hidden. Momoka is a person who will shoot her conscience and the evil in her heart just to make sure they don\'t get a part of her own happiness. And she really makes it work because the anime is a school life SoL comedy.I think the art could have been better, there are a couple of great designed characters but most of the others are just budget cute girl characters. Doesn\'t really take away from the greatness of the anime because the comedy is awesome and the action scenes are well animated.The OP and ED are cute enough, not that special but it\'s fine. The sound effects used in the anime are on point, though. Really accentuates what is happening in a scene. I think they\'ve done really well in this aspect, stuff that are funny are even made funnier usually because of the background music.Overall, I really enjoyed this. Definitely one of the best comedy animes I ever watched, this anime\'s main character is a hilariously diabolical character unlike any I\'ve ever seen. If you\'re looking for a comedy that would really make you laugh then you must try Sabagebu. survival club where everybody wields guns.

Completely irreverent, totally absurd and doesn\'t give a shit about anything except making you laugh. The gags are funny, the characters are awesome and the humor is the kind that makes fun of itself. It breaks the 4th wall constantly and it continues to be hilarious every time.If you like YuruYuri or Himouto! Umaru-chan, you\'re almost guaranteed to like Sabagebu. The humor is somewhat similar, though several levels crazier than the above mentioned shows.A quick synopsis:This is yet another story that revolves around a high school club. This one being a survival game club where...they play with soft guns. But in the show, the soft guns are treated like real guns. As the narrator keeps reminding us, all the characters share the same delusion. And we see the battles through their eyes. So when someone is shot with a soft gun, there\'s blood and bullet wounds.There\'s no reason to say much more about it than that. It\'s the premise of the show and it\'s the basis of most of its gags. At the same time you really get to like the cute girls who populate the show and who are all batshit insane in various dark ways.I could easily watch many more seasons of this. It\'s one of the best ""cute girls doing cute things"" shows I have seen. Especially because the ""cute things"" in Sabagebu involves using others as human shields to save yourself and other messed up stuff like that.And that\'s why the humor works for me. The dichotomy between the cute girls and their brutality. At the same time there\'s also a lot of bizarre side character and a whole lot of poking fun at itself.I also absolutely love the ending song. they play with soft guns.

There aren\'t any ""deep"" themes or complex messages that the crew of Sabagebu! are trying to make you consider. While it may not be doing anything outstanding enough to be remembered decades in the future, Sabagebu! is still an excellent experience for anyone who simply wants to relax and have a few laughs. It doesn\'t bombard the viewer with melodrama or degrade its characters through fanservice, but instead focuses on being as funny as possible. And that\'s good enough...for me to give it a wholehearted two-thumbs up and recommendation.Story: B-The story is centered around transfer student, Momoka, being roped into joining one of the strangest school clubs of all-time, the Survival Game Club! A episodic Shoujo comedy, that follows Momoka’s various escapades with the other members of the survival game club.So basically, it\'s your typical slice of life comedy anime, just with a lot more guns involved.There’s never a dull moment in Sabagebu, and it’s this fast pace and over-the-top comedy that keeps the anime rolling along. The writer’s also do a great job of varying up all the different sketches that each of the 12 episodes are composed of, so the jokes don’t become stale and over-used. They do a good job with references and playing up certain things for comedic effect. There’s a Yakuza movie parody sketch that’s absolutely hilarious and they do a great job of shifting the focus on different characters and character dynamics with each different sketch so that you’re getting something new out of everyone.It reminded me a lot of the other great anime comedies I’ve seen in the past like Gintama and Beelzebub, so if you enjoyed those shows, then you’ll more than likely enjoy this one as well.Characters: BThe entire cast plays their roles extremely well, and they all provide a bundle of laughs. I’m not sure if it’s because I haven’t watched much Shoujo yet, but all of the characters seemed fun and several them had fairly distinct personalities I hadn’t very many times in anime.Sonokawa, Momoka might be one of my favorite main characters to come out of 2014. Whereas the trend seems to be going towards protagonist who are built up to be perfect in every way, selfless and the Moral Compass of their respective series, righting every wrong and defeating every villain, Momoka goes in the completely other direction. She has a two-sided personality, She initially kept an appearance of a polite and kind schoolgirl but is actually sharp-tongued, merciless, and easily angered. She is prone to taking revenge, often disproportionately. She’s a vengeful, spiteful, jealous, petty, ruthless, and selfish person who has no problem betraying her fellow club members or allies, and has no qualms about pointing and shooting down anyone that gets her way. Cute little children, elderly people, cute animals, Cat-Aliens, her Mom, or even her own conscious! There’s no one she won’t turn her gun on in order to win or get what she wants, and this sort of ruthlessness is played upon to great comedic effect. It’s absolutely hilarious when someone’s tries to play upon her mercy or how cute and harmless they are, and then she puts a bullet right through their brain. It’s this sort of flawed character that makes her more relatable, and in the case of this comedy, the star of its humor. Her antics provide for tons of laughs.Of course, she’s not necessarily that vicious, since they’re just paintballs, but she has no problem using others as a human shield, leaving people behind so she can get away, or any other dirty underhanded trick. She does have her tender moments though, that show she’s not so bad, but those usually come around to bite her in the ass at one point or another and at least once an episode she gets what’s coming to her for underhanded schemes and tricks. Seeing her get one upped by the other characters is always very funny to see and it sort of balances everything out for her rude behavior throughout the rest of the series. Well the other members of the cast are solid characters that provide for many, many hilarious moments, Momoka is definitely the high point in the character department and it\'s from playing off her brilliant characterization that the other characters are able to be so outlandish and funny.Animation: CThe weakest aspect in the entire anime. There’s nothing animation or character design wise that really wows you at all, and well the fight scenes are well done every now and then, there’s nothing else that stands out at all. The art style is pretty standard, and doesn’t really make the characters pop at all. It’s pretty much average in this department, but that’s alright since this show isn’t about gorgeous animation or character designs and the way shots are presented and the use of quick cuts throughout the show are able to translate the humor from the pages of the script and through the screen well.Sound: B-The voice acting in this is absolutely phenomenal. All of the voice actors do a great job of showcasing the character’s spectrum of emotions and can change the tone of their voice at the drop of a hat and showcase they’re range in spectacular fashion. Everyone fits they’re character’s personalities perfectly as well. A special shout-out has to go out to Urara’s VA, who can go from high-pitched cutesy voice to dangerously low and ominous voice extremely quickly.Both the opening and ending are extremely catchy and fit the mood of the show perfectly. It probably helps that both are performed by the voice actors of the characters in the show, and it really gets you ready and excited for each episode when you hear them.The only problem in the sound of the anime was the fairly limited and repetitive tracks that played in the show. There didn’t seem to be a large selection to pick from, and while everything fit what was happening in the show, none of it was great and made you want to go listen to it on your own.Personal Enjoyment: B+ grade.I had a blast watching this show and every episode kept me in good-spirits and laughing throughout the entire 20 minutes. I never left an episode without a smile on my face, and the show did its primary job of keeping me entertained and giving me a fun half-hour every time I turned it on. By far one of the best comedies I watched in 2014, and it’s made me more interested in the Shoujo genre as a whole. for me to give it a wholehearted two-thumbs up and recommendation.Story: B-The story is centered around transfer student, Momoka, being roped into joining one of the strangest school clubs of all-time, the Survival Game Club!

By far one of the best comedies I watched in 2014, and it’s made me more interested in the Shoujo genre as a whole.', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When you think of high school, or college for that matter, what comes to mind is education, parties, and extra curricular activities. But for the girls of the Survival Game Club, it\'s less about these things and more about just having fun, with a gun or two thrown in for good measure.STORYSomewhat generically, the story begins with our new transfer student, Momoka, enrolling in a new high school. Upon entering, she discovers the ""Survival Game Club"", a group of girls dedicated to fake-gun battles.Much in the same vein as Nichijou, Sabagebu! takes the approach of smaller mini-episodes to...convey what plot it has. Naturally, there is no over-arcing goal to the whole show; its all about what is happening in the moment. And for a show like this, it works great. Since it doesn\'t have to worry about an actual narrative, it can take its time creating these crazy yet interesting scenarios that the girls are put through.As an example, one of the best mini-episodes features Urara and her unfortunate time in the bathroom. It showcases many of the shows strong points: cultural references, nostalgic music, running gags, great comedy, and light-hearted fun. Many of the episodes early on are like this. They would always present these hilarious situations that the girls would be faced with, from fighting a master light-gun shoot-\'em-up player to Momoka facing in a death-match against her mother.Personally, I felt that the first half of the show was strong but got pretty weak by the second half. It felt as if they were re-using the same jokes a lot of the time. Again, running gags and similar comedy are always good fun, but it felt as if the writers were running out of ideas. That isn\'t to say that there weren\'t strong mini-episodes here and there, just that the quality seemed to trail off.However, one of the things that never faltered was the show\'s use of a narrator. He would constantly make ""appearances,"" letting us know what the situation entailed or how the characters were thinking. I always found his interjections to be hilarious, simply because his fourth-wall breaking was always nicely timed.ANIMATIONSabagebu\'s art style is somewhat plain or rather dull looking. Many of the locales are simple backdrops that don\'t elicit any feelings of wonder. The color palette as well utilizes softer colors (light purple, baby blue, pink, etc.) that coincide with the plainness of the show.The animation itself isn\'t anything amazing. I was never taken aback by how the characters moved or what was happening on-screen. There are some nice acrobatic stunts that are pulled off, but nothing too out of the ordinary.I will say that, as part of the comedy, I loved their excessive use of the fake blood. We all know that the games they are playing are fake, but I would always chuckle when I saw their bodies lying in a pool of red paint.CHARACTERSHonestly speaking, even for a show like this, the characters are pretty one-dimensional. There is the proud captain, the pretty girl, the otaku, the masochist, and the sadist. All of the girls stick to their character quirk and don\'t budge much from it throughout the entirety of the season.To clarify, this doesn\'t mean the characters themselves are not enjoyable. In fact, it\'s part of what makes the show so funny to watch. Maya always getting killed first, Urara taking bullets for Momoka, Kayo\'s cosplaying, and Miou\'s optimistic attitude. But the star of the show is Momoka. She is pretty ruthless, willing to do whatever it takes to win the game or get by in her daily life. Her antics were always the most fun to watch, because seriously, she does not care about anyone or anything as long as she gets her way.In this type of show, there isn\'t going to be much character growth to be had. And that was the case here. Even so, I would have liked to have seen their characters at least diverge a bit from what they normally would do. But part of the appeal is liking the character trope they are portraying. If you don\'t like tropes, then you won\'t like the characters.SOUNDI actually found the OP to be fine. It gives off this happy vibe that pretty much fits the show. There isn\'t any drama or emotions at play within Sabagebu!, so the OP works. For the ED, I quite liked it. It has a wonderful beat that I would always find myself bobbing my head to. Plus, it sounds kind of crazy, which fits perfectly with the show.The soundtrack\'s most memorable moments were definitely its use of famous pieces of music. You would definitely recognize the pieces, since they are used in pretty much every other medium. They were used in just the right situations for good comedic effect and were always a blast to listen to.The voice acting is nicely done by all the members of the cast. No amazing performances, but Momoka\'s VA did a nice job in the cast lead.ENJOYMENTSabagebu! is a pure comedy show. It\'s quite funny early on, and the laughs persist throughout the whole season, even if it isn\'t as strong in its second half. Part of the enjoyment from the show comes from the absurdity of what they are doing. Being ""normal"" high school girls who shoot bullets at old men and women in a cross-country derby race is as hilarious as it sounds.Again, a lot of the fun is generated by the way the characters interact with one another. Whether that be Momoka shooting an innocent Kayo or Miou dragging everyone to a candy-decoration shop, you have to like the way in which these characters ""get along"" in order to have any fun with the show.And that\'s what the show does so well. Everything in it just ""works."" Even when things are getting as crazy as they do, it\'s Sabagebu!, so there is nothing to be worried about.SUMMARYStory: Fine, funnier first-half with weaker second-halfAnimation: Bad, plain and dull with generic art styleCharacters: Fine, fun characters if a bit trope-ySound: Good, OP and ED are nice with interesting soundtrackEnjoyment: Good, lots of laughs about a silly premiseFinal Score: 5/10 convey what plot it has.

Its an anime that not everybody likes but i found it quite interesting and fun. The ending was really good and it finished the story. Sabage-bu is basically airsoft but they just use their imagination but that doesnt mean its bad. In the the survival club they have all sorts of troubles that they are trying to fix or just chill and fight in their imagination. its kinda saiki style because its not one big story its 7minute videos put into...a one episode just like saiki a one episode just like saiki', ""This anime is about cute girls not doing cute things and it is hilarious!Story- The story of Sabagebu was simplistic and didn't really have any progression past the first couple of episodes. The progression doesn't take away from the show what so ever having girls just do stupid gun battles and what not is the best thing i think i have seen. The best part is that they are just using BB guns for there battles but there imaginations make it look like a actual scene from terminator. The ending did come back to the statement that President said at the start of the...show which was nice but the best would have to be the crab riding the helicopter and the platypus shooting a machine gun. What more do you need.Characters- With characters we don't really get any backstories or any information about them except there personalities which is fine regarding this show is episodic and doesn't need progression to do what it sets out to do. Sabagebu doesn't just have the typical female tropes and MC stuff like other anime these girls literally give no shits about one another and will throw each other under a bus just to get what they want and it totally works for the comedy it presents. Side characters were also really funny and brought some variety to different characters. Lemon(fat gaming nerd) brings out the worst in Momoka and she gives no fucks. She literally killed good and evil! The student council president even brings out some fun comedy for the president of the survival games club because in my opinion she was lacking the most. The mother is crazy motherfucker and it is nice to see a parent in anime actually have a purpose. Urara was the punching bag for a lot of comedy and was the brought out the best comedy in the show. Maya had funny boob jokes and Kayo was a weird Otaku girl which was funny at times. The narrator was even a character is was funny to see him as a guy from G.I. JOE. Kamo the platypus had a episode just to himself and he owned ass... it was golden!Animation- The show looked good it wasn't the best and it wasn't really detailed but the colors did set the tone of cute girls not doing cute things. it was fluid in what it was presenting even when you see characters in slow motion flipping in the air it looks nice.Sound- Sound is probably the weakest of everything the OP was great but just the music in the show wasn't memorable.Overall i do think the comedy is one of the best i have seen and i couldn't stop laughing at some scenes. it is a must watch if you are looking for comedy. The characters do a good job at not be stereotypical people and you don't know what will come next with them. I cant stress enough how this show has some of the best comedy i have seen. show which was nice but the best would have to be the crab riding the helicopter and the platypus shooting a machine gun.

However, upon forcing myself to sit through just one episode, I was met with some rather saddening disappointment.The Bad:Nothing really drew me in. The story is uninteresting, the characters are shallow and stereotypical, and the non-main characters in this world feel less alive than Skyrim NPCs. Everything just makes me want to cringe, from the dialogue between characters, to the hardcore airsoft larping. Maybe it\'s just a personal gripe since these kinds of people in real life leave a bad taste in my mouth. Airsoft can be fun and all,...but fantasizing it as real combat with real guns is just silly and childish. Either way, I don\'t find this kind of stuff enjoyable to watch. Also, the characters feel incredibly half-assed, as they can be summarized into ""big tiddy bitch with blue hair"", ""big tiddy bitch with purple hair"" ""loli with pink hair"", and ""main character flat chested pink hair bitch jealous of big tiddy bitches"". It\'s like the creators know how shallow their characters are and desperately try to cram totally unique never before seen features in anime like wacky hair colors.The Good:The firearms in this show are the best I\'ve ever seen in anime. Almost every little detail is consistently there, spanning the feature of dozens of firearms. Despite all the characters using airsoft guns, they\'re often drawn with features real firearms would have, such as rifling in the barrel. Sadly, this is the only good thing I can personally say about this show.All that said, the creators knew they were making something wacky that needs some suspension of disbelief to enjoy. Narration interrupts certain scenes and at the beginning/end of the episodes telling the viewer that what they\'re watching isn\'t in any way reality and is portrayed through the eyes of these girls who enjoy fantasizing and playing around. So while it explains the wackiness of the show, it doesn\'t make it any more enjoyable to me. Maybe some enjoyment is found in this show, but it isn\'t some /k/ incarnate gem. but fantasizing it as real combat with real guns is just silly and childish.

It\'s also a masochist wet dream too and a gun fanatic paradise. But with all the craziness mixed in this series stands out above others in being pretty unique.Story: 3Well, this series doesn\'t really have an actual story, unless you consider 3 different random shorts per episodes as a story, then go for it. The score is low due to not having a story, not cause it was bad. Each episode has the similarity of an American cartoon, focus more on episodic episodes rather than...a story-wise series. So not much to explain. Other than this series focus on a girl who transcend past demon and angel, she is Momoka Sonokawa, who was forced into joining the Game Survival Club, by Club President and Gun fanatic Miou Ootori. Each episodes have Momoka going through crazy, odd, and weird antics in her daily life. Each time showing how sinister Momoka really was.Art: 8The art was really well done, it had an adorable je ne sais quoi type of style to it. The coloration were a bit too bright, but it blended with the quality of the show being light-hearted (Meaning it wasn\'t a type of show focused on heavy/dark-elements). The distortion of the character were also cute. Its an animation that is pleasing to the eyes.Sound: 8Ost and OP & ED were all catchy, the voices, were well-done. Nothing really went wrong with this part, it was well done through and through.Characters: 9This part is where \'Sabagebu!\' really shines. I will explain each character of course:Momoka Sonokawa- The main, main character of the series. Oh boy this one, this one is a special one, every masochist out there would love to have her, and those who value their life, I would recommend to stay away from her as far as possible. Sinister is not even enough to tag her personality. From the outside she looks like a cute, innocent, and decent girl, but in-reality a darkness so evil lives within her. She lives by this code ""An eye for an eye"" meaning nothing you do to her that anger her, will slide, she will get you back in the most destructive matter. I can go on and on, but you all should understand by now. Also she\'s a very deadly accurate sniper. (She uses a pistol).Miou Ootori- The club\'s President and the one that forced Momoka to join. She\'s a bourgeoisie, meaning her family, is very wealthy, enough to have a squad of helicopter at her disposal. She is and eye-candy as every girl in the highschool literally adores her, and want to either be praised or noticed by her, can you say ""please notice me senpai"" much? She\'s the only member that can buy an actual gun, due to being an adult, since she was held-back a year. She\'s very dense about stuff that isn\'t about gun or survival, meaning alot of things get passed by her.Urara Kasugano- She\'s a masochist through and through, she\'s an odd-ball, and in that club that says alot. She\'s extremely strong too, however she plays the whole cute girl facade to fool her classmates, but only the clubmates knows her true self.Kayo Goutokuji- She joined the club, not cause she\'s a fan of survival game, she\'s an otaku who loves to cosplay, she mostly joined because they allow her to cosplay. She plays as Momoka\'s rival.Maya Kyoudou- She is a young gravure model, who even has her own lesbian... I mean fan club. She\'s a major airhead of course, and has the best body out of all the members. This of course strikes jealousy in Momoka for being flat.Enjoyement: 8I was going to rate this 9 but that\'s a bit too high, while this series indeed was nothing but pain in the stomache, tear jerking laughter. It still lack some form of entertaiment, such as a story, but if you can look pass it, this show is very enjoyable. It will make you laugh one way or another. It\'s fun, weird, and just has no sense in it.Overall: 7Overall, a pretty decent series, if this flew under your radar, you can try it out, if you want a change of pace and want something, in a more happy mood. Just remember there is no story so if you\'re a story-based person this show won\'t be that enjoyable, but for those who like randomness then this would be up your alley, so it\'s a give or take from your perspective.*This review ended up sounding like I\'m favoring this series, but honestly I just couldn\'t find anything negative in this show, the animation team really did a good job with this one.* a story-wise series.

It\'s not just their running gags but how the running gags actually evolve with the skits they do. Individually, Momoko Sonokawa voiced by Ayaka Ohashi has be one of the more erratic main characters, as she has that ""cute girls who isn\'t cute on the inside"", has a hot temper trigger and doesn\'t want ANYONE try to one up her (well except Miou) and she obviously has the majority of the focus as we see the anime in her perspective. Miou Ootori voiced by Yumi Uchiyama is the mysterious yet wealthy sempai to the rest of the Survival Game Club members and is the president of the club, there isn\'t much to say other than her mysteriousness and outright quirkiness and unpredictability of her can easily drive the skits to her focus or she\'ll be the catalyst to how all the skits starts out as, she is also LA\'s favourite character in the series because of this. Next is Maya Kyoudou voiced by Lynn, a part time model and one of the butt monkeys of the club due to her *ahem* bust size annoying the other club members and is one of the more normal and kind character in the series, Urara Kasugano voiced by Rumi Ookubo is at first a sadist and an utter fan of Miou, not until Momoko arrived to the club where she then turned into a masochist and craves for Momoko\'s ""punishments"". Finally we have Kayo Goutokuji voiced by Nao Touyama, a vastly knowledgeable deadpan yet die-hard cosplayer otaku...aside from her skit moments...she actually had the least presences in the club besides Platy a platypus? and the mascot character for the anime and occasional deadbeat at Momoko\'s house. Really these core members really have chemistry together and how the comedy flows quite smoothly with these core members and clashing (not in personalities though it happens sometimes for comedic reasoning, as in literally clashing with their gun battles) and rather wacky personalities. Interestingly the Survival Game Club core members for the most part break the convention of typical shoujo club genre most blatantly from their character archetypes, the best manifestation of this statement of this being the main protagonist Momoka.The minor characters, the only three characters that have ""recurring characters status"" become Ena Sakura voiced by Yui Horie, the ditzy club adviser, Lemon Karaage (yes..really his name is Fried Lemon Chicken) voiced by Souta Arai, a shooting game otaku and later on Momoka fan like Urara and Kazue Sonokawa voiced by Kikuko Inoue, Momoka\'s mother and BADASS mother who\'s more than Momoka realizes. The rest of the characters becomes really ""red shirt mooks groups"" that take on the Survival Game Club and no it\'s not just highschoolers, we got grade schoolers to the elders to heck the student council president become villains of the episode, with the student council president Yayoi Isurugi voiced by Eriko Matsui being a highlight gag ""villain"" for Miou.LA has been talking lots about the characters dynamics and genre-""breaking"" and their great chemistry but how about the meta-direction and the comedy in general?, well the meta-direction has a narrator in this anime (and is actually has a physical presences as the manager of the shop by the name of Tenchou voiced by Tessyo Genda where the Survival Game Club buys their guns), this narrator can be a double-edged sword, as he constantly (but not always) spouts what we already knew the first time he said it (the biggest one being ""it\'s in the girls imaginations"" during the battles and it can easily be grating in which we can easily say back to the narrator WE KNOW ALREADY) but the narrator is one of those snarky narrators and while still saying the obvious can be funny that even the narrator jabs at the characters, especially Momoka and some of the actual facts the narrator (and the occasional Kayo) says actually adds to the punchline to the skit. The meta-direction just isn\'t the narrator, as Platy and Momoka has ""some"" self-awareness what genre their in and Momoka especially due to her LITERAL trigger-tempered personality can easily make Platy, Momoka and the narrator bounce off their comedic timing with one another with the three changing jobs between boke and tsukommi ALOT. Rounding the meta-direction of Sabagebu!, LA can say that the comedy goes both ways, as once again comedy is subjective, if you don\'t like the narrator, well good luck as he\'s in ALL the episodes, LA at the first 3 episodes, thought that the narrator got annoying with the CONSTANT reminder that he repeated the same thing, but that died down before the halfway point. The comedy in Sabagebu! quickly for LA anyways from the character chemistry to the varying degrees of good to nearly-repetitive annoying meta jokes but it also has subtle to blatant movie to anime references peppered throughout the anime which worked in it\'s favor, the comedy was overall strong, it was the wacky anti-cliche characters and their chemistry together that definitely worked in it\'s favor for LA so Sabagebu!\'s comedic strengths definitely outweighed it\'s weaknesses.In terms of animation by Pierrot Plus, the animation for the most part uses the bright colors with their character designs and even the varies survival game locales are bright and poppy even if it\'s a ""imaginary battlefield"". The comedic moments do go into chibi to blank eye reactions at times but that is only solidifies it\'s comedy and disguising the ""cute girls with guns"" but defying convention of it taking the mickey of the moe genre but still have still laughing happily all the way through...yeah the animation overall is ""limited and moe"" but even the animation knows to defy your expectation that this is just your typical moe girls with guns anime.In terms of voice acting, well for the majority of voice actors, they REALLY sticked to their ""playing against the type"", the easiest example being Ayaka Ohashi voicing Momoko, her erratic, fake-cute and brutish sadistic nature really gave Ayaka given her a wider vocal range LA didn\'t expect from Ayaka (as the only anime LA took notice of Ayaka was in The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls as the shy yet genki Uzuki Shimamura). Nao Touyama voicing a deadpan snark isn\'t the first time LA heard her like this, Yumi Uchiyama voicing the mysterious Miou Ootori was more or less perfect for her and her diverse vocal range but the MVP for Sabagebu! HAS to go to Rumi Ookubo in voicing the sadist turned masochist Urara Kasugano, Rumi\'s instant flipping the switches from moe-moe vocals to outright pissed off vocals (and vice versa) were an utter laugh and her vocal meshed quite well with Ayaka Ohashi\'s ""playing against the type"" vocals as well.The final episode, well what can LA say but the final episodes 2 segments are what you expect from Sabagebu! and a nice reference to past episodic/recurring characters and BOTH of the ending punchlines from both segments caught LA off guard, but still funny as hell how unconventional-yet-""that escalated quickly"" it went.Sabagebu! is one of those ""cute girls with guns"" anime that fully embraces it\'s comedic aspects and runs with it going into crazier and wackier scenarios that simultaneously builds on the character chemistry jabbing all with ""Survival Game where girls shoot each other"" mentality in mind (the meta-comedy will depend on your taste really and how it blends with comedy in general, but LA will note that it DOES GET better by the halfway point, utilizing and timing the meta-comedy). Stella Jogakuin Koutou-ka C3-bu may have a similar premise to Sabagebu! but lost it\'s way halfway through with it\'s needless and pointless drama, but LA feels like that Sabagebu! nailed it what it wanted to be and executed itself quite nicely and crazily all the way through with it\'s heads held up high with gun in tow. So LA very early in the review said if Sabagebu! broke the mold from it\'s genre or is another typically cliche anime from it\'s genre. Sabagebu!, LA without a doubt can say that Sabagebu! breaks the mold from it\'s genre bandwagoners and if you want to see a refreshingly comedic gun totting ""cute girls with guns""...then Sabagebu! is a perfect target. it\'s core it\'s all about the comedy in both meta-jabbing and character-jabbing under the setting of an all-girls survival game club.The plot is about Momoka Sonokawa voiced by Ayaka Ohashi who through some unprecedented circumstances landed herself at first forcibly into the Survival Game Club by the mysterious Miou Ootori voiced by Yumi Uchiyama, Momoka later on joins officially and what with the wacky club members along with Momoka\'s quickly adapting into the Survival Game Club, well then hilarity and later on crazier scenarios ensues.In terms of characters, the core Survival Game Club members and their comedic chemistry makes them a unique group outright. It\'s not just their running gags but how the running gags actually evolve with the skits they do. Individually, Momoko Sonokawa voiced by Ayaka Ohashi has be one of the more erratic main characters, as she has that ""cute girls who isn\'t cute on the inside"", has a hot temper trigger and doesn\'t want ANYONE try to one up her (well except Miou) and she obviously has the majority of the focus as we see the anime in her perspective. Miou Ootori voiced by Yumi Uchiyama is the mysterious yet wealthy sempai to the rest of the Survival Game Club members and is the president of the club, there isn\'t much to say other than her mysteriousness and outright quirkiness and unpredictability of her can easily drive the skits to her focus or she\'ll be the catalyst to how all the skits starts out as, she is also LA\'s favourite character in the series because of this. Next is Maya Kyoudou voiced by Lynn, a part time model and one of the butt monkeys of the club due to her *ahem* bust size annoying the other club members and is one of the more normal and kind character in the series, Urara Kasugano voiced by Rumi Ookubo is at first a sadist and an utter fan of Miou, not until Momoko arrived to the club where she then turned into a masochist and craves for Momoko\'s ""punishments"". Finally we have Kayo Goutokuji voiced by Nao Touyama, a vastly knowledgeable deadpan yet die-hard cosplayer otaku...aside from her skit moments...she actually had the least presences in the club besides Platy a platypus? and the mascot character for the anime and occasional deadbeat at Momoko\'s house.

Anyhow, lot of non-sensical comedy,...but I wasn\'t fond of because of it\'s ""4chan"" feel. Hard to explain, but probably easiest answer would be that this type of comedy didn\'t really ""click"" with me.

Gunpowder lingers heavily in the air, tension is at an all time high. Your only thought is how you\'re going to get out alive. After a not-so-thorough examination, you dash towards the fire, shooting your shot. You are shot in several locations, your stomach, shoulder, and leg. You lie on the ground, bleeding profusely.Who\'s going to save you?You snap out of it, realizing all of the gunfire and wounds were in your head. You have but a pellet gun, and so do your opponents.This, in essence, is...the entire show.Story - 3/10Sabagebu! follows a format of various skits in each episode, which usually have no real connection in a greater plot for the entire show (think Nichijou). Differing from Nichijou, there\'s more of a ""story"" for each skit, and it had grabbed my attention better than Nichijou did.Due to the lack of plot or story, this show doesn\'t require a big dedication of focus, if anyone is looking for something to mindlessly watch without losing too much context to understand the series.Art - 7/10One of the categories that I felt this show did good in was in its art-style. In normal scenes of square dialogue, the overall art is pretty average, with the over-the-top facial animations. But in the ""action"" scenes, with all of the cute-anime-schoolgirl-gun-acrobats,There\'s also several references to magical girl transformations whenever the Survival Club whips out their guns, really adding to the experience.Sound - 8/10Both the OP and the ED matches well with the series as a whole, and I especially like how the character voices also sing in the ED. I guess I’m just a sucker for it. The overall soundtrack of the series does a decent job of portraying the overall tone of any select scene, though that isn’t something I’m really looking for given this show’s genre. Perhaps if it were a drama or some other “deeper” anime, I would be a bit more critical about it.Moving from the music, the overall sound effects were also great, from the cathartic gunshots to the voices of the characters. I particularly enjoyed the performance done by both Momoka and Urara’s CVs. Whenever either of them got out of their “good girl” act, they devolve into a much deeper voice than the average anime girl would be expected to have.Character - 7/10As far as characters go, there weren’t any super-outlandish ones. You’ve got your square MC, who for some reason hates nearly any minor inconvenience, masochistic loli girl who’s got the hots for MC, plus a couple others that I can’t be bothered to describe. There’s some cohesion between the entire group and their crazy antics, making it more fun to watch and see what dumbass mistake is gonna happen next.Enjoyment - 10/10Disregarding the absolute lack of story, this series was fun to watch through-and-through. While each skit had its own little mini-plot between the characters, they all happened in linearly, so we could see the growth (not saying there’s a really big character growth, but some nonetheless) of the characters. This plus all of the surreal firefights with cute anime girls made Sabagebu! such a good viddy. the entire show.Story - 3/10Sabagebu! follows a format of various skits in each episode, which usually have no real connection in a greater plot for the entire show (think Nichijou).

Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10464/Seitokai_no_Ichizon_Lv2,"['Seikotai no Ichizon Lv 2: A Closing Chapter On 5 Amazing CharactersI will come out and say as someone that\'s watched both seasons that Seikotai no Ichizon had the most interestingly diverse lead cast of characters. From the beginning stretching back to the first season, it was a fun ride seeing their adventures over these past two seasons. You had Ken the hopeless harem junkie Vice President, Kurimu the childish Student Council President, Chizuru the dark and sadistic Secretary, Minatsu the athletic and ambitious VP, and her BL video game loving sister Mafuyu the Treasurer. You throw these five together and you have a half-hour...of pure hilarity every week.It is unfortunate to say this but despite the cast of characters being amazing, I don\'t think AIC ended it on the strongest of notes. While I can say that this was still a good series, it didn\'t capture the same magic the original series did. The first season of Seikotai no Ichizon wasn\'t only brilliantly written from a comedy perspective, but there were moments in that series where we experienced Ken\'s heartfelt interactions with each one of them at one time or another. Lv 2 seemed to be lacking in that department. I\'m not sure if it was due to only having nine episodes to work with (excluding episode 0), but the series felt as though it had a lack of great character interaction toward the end.It was pretty evident what this series lacked and it was the writing. One thing that the original Seikotai no Ichizon series was able to do was not only write great laugh-out-loud, crazy comical moments, but also able to connect the audience to Ken\'s character and the importance the four other student council members meaning to him. Studio Deen was able to capture both of those styles perfectly while not letting the comedy or the drama outdo each other. While AIC did do a commendable job of capturing each character\'s personality, it really felt like the chemistry was a bit off between the Student Council members and in particular, with Ken. I was really disappointed with how they ended the series because it felt as though Ken\'s connection with the Student Council was more distant than it was in the original series and AIC seemed to try and dump all of it in the last 5 minutes of the show. As I said earlier, it felt REALLY rushed and in comparison to the first season, didn\'t seem to capture that same chemistry between the characters.Perhaps it was due to legality, but I also found the sketch writing to be a little odd. One thing that made the original series so great was it\'s pop culture references, in particular to other anime series. This series, on the other hand, took a different route and didn\'t reference ""other"" animes per se, but rather itself. It treated itself like it was a popular anime/manga and would occasionally reference that in the series. While I do give AIC some credit for trying something different than it\'s predecessor, I didn\'t necessarily like that angle. It didn\'t make for as funny of moments and it took away the feel that Seikotai no Ichizon is its own entity. It\'s not every day that you see an anime try and break the 4th wall, but to be honest, I wish they wouldn\'t have.If there is one thing the writers did do pretty well, it was the introduction of new characters and the rollover of existing side characters. Satori, Lilica, and Elise made a return from last season and I found the additions of Asuka, Ringo, and Luna to be welcome additions in their own right. I did get a good impression that if this series does continue, AIC did do a nice job of setting up Asuka, Ringo, Luna, and Lilica to be potential Student Council members if the series decided to take that route. Considering the personalities of those characters, I think that would make a pretty interesting series if AIC does decide to go that route.As for the production values, I can only say it was good, but not great. There were some minor changes in the animation from the first series, but they weren\'t very noticeable. I can\'t really say they were better or worse. The music and for the most part, the voice acting is about the same with a casting change with a few characters. Although, even with a few minor casting changes, it did throw off the chemistry slightly. The original VAs had such great chemistry together and while the changes weren\'t ""terrible"", they were still noticeable and made it a little difficult to adapt. I can\'t really fault it too much since the VA changes were to just Chizuru and Mafuyu, but like I said, it did mess up the chemistry between the VAs a little bit.Overall, I cannot say that this season was bad. It was still an okay series in my book, but when you put the Seitokai no Ichizon name on something, you\'re competing with an already established franchise that is considered one of the better anime comedies to come out in the last 5 years. AIC just couldn\'t match what Studio Deen was able to do in 2009 and as a result, seemed to put out a lackluster conclusion to a great anime comedy. A fair anime in its own right, but unable to live up to its predecessor. of pure hilarity every week.It is unfortunate to say this but despite the cast of characters being amazing, I don\'t think AIC ended it on the strongest of notes. While I can say that this was still a good series, it didn\'t capture the same magic the original series did. The first season of Seikotai no Ichizon wasn\'t only brilliantly written from a comedy perspective, but there were moments in that series where we experienced Ken\'s heartfelt interactions with each one of them at one time or another. Lv 2 seemed to be lacking in that department. I\'m not sure if it was due to only having nine episodes to work with (excluding episode 0), but the series felt as though it had a lack of great character interaction toward the end.It was pretty evident what this series lacked and it was the writing. One thing that the original Seikotai no Ichizon series was able to do was not only write great laugh-out-loud, crazy comical moments, but also able to connect the audience to Ken\'s character and the importance the four other student council members meaning to him. Studio Deen was able to capture both of those styles perfectly while not letting the comedy or the drama outdo each other. While AIC did do a commendable job of capturing each character\'s personality, it really felt like the chemistry was a bit off between the Student Council members and in particular, with Ken. I was really disappointed with how they ended the series because it felt as though Ken\'s connection with the Student Council was more distant than it was in the original series and AIC seemed to try and dump all of it in the last 5 minutes of the show. As I said earlier, it felt REALLY rushed and in comparison to the first season, didn\'t seem to capture that same chemistry between the characters.Perhaps it was due to legality, but I also found the sketch writing to be a little odd. One thing that made the original series so great was it\'s pop culture references, in particular to other anime series. This series, on the other hand, took a different route and didn\'t reference ""other"" animes per se, but rather itself. It treated itself like it was a popular anime/manga and would occasionally reference that in the series. While I do give AIC some credit for trying something different than it\'s predecessor, I didn\'t necessarily like that angle. It didn\'t make for as funny of moments and it took away the feel that Seikotai no Ichizon is its own entity. It\'s not every day that you see an anime try and break the 4th wall, but to be honest, I wish they wouldn\'t have.If there is one thing the writers did do pretty well, it was the introduction of new characters and the rollover of existing side characters. Satori, Lilica, and Elise made a return from last season and I found the additions of Asuka, Ringo, and Luna to be welcome additions in their own right. I did get a good impression that if this series does continue, AIC did do a nice job of setting up Asuka, Ringo, Luna, and Lilica to be potential Student Council members if the series decided to take that route. Considering the personalities of those characters, I think that would make a pretty interesting series if AIC does decide to go that route.As for the production values, I can only say it was good, but not great. There were some minor changes in the animation from the first series, but they weren\'t very noticeable. I can\'t really say they were better or worse. The music and for the most part, the voice acting is about the same with a casting change with a few characters. Although, even with a few minor casting changes, it did throw off the chemistry slightly. The original VAs had such great chemistry together and while the changes weren\'t ""terrible"", they were still noticeable and made it a little difficult to adapt.

A fair anime in its own right, but unable to live up to its predecessor.', 'I\'d hate to parade on an unfinished anime, however, it is extremely disappointing.The change, as stated, have really gone for the worst:Story: It\'s the same old story; none. That\'s fine, it\'s the reason I got into the first season, however the anime\'s directions was bland and poorly executed, and even when they do get some ideas, they pre-maturely cut it off. Hell, even that detective episode felt like this; introducing 2 new characters and making no use of them.Art: It\'s decent, but hey, there\'s not much to draw. Though I do prefer season 1\'s comical style of presentation; it made up 30% of the show...in the first season; setting the pace and the feel of the anime. Of course, don\'t take that figure to a literal sense.Sound: Change of VA, dialogue that is long and boring, lack of soundtrack, music is not quirky enough, can\'t say much here aside from ""whelp, they dun goofed.""Character: The characters are not bouncy enough. The lack of jabs at the characters\' personality really damaged the show; Ken only got two jokes about his perverted side, and none about his hardworking self that the girls came to love. The closest we had to that was the return of Elise when Ken\'s just saying yes repeatedly to her questionable questions.Enjoyment: During the first season, in 30 seconds, you would be blazing through 3 jokes and 4 references; that had been slowed down to 1 joke every 30 second. It would\'ve been fine if they built up the jokes with plentiful of laughs and meanings, but even that\'s absent. Infact, it is even debatable that the first show had more ""huge jokes"" in any single episode then all 3 combined.Overall:I hate to say, but the sequel I was so so excited for was nothing more then your regular harem. As much as I appreciate studios putting effort into it, sometimes stuff like these have to be noted and changed. Needs alot of effort and funding, yes, but there should be an efficient way to do everything. For future sake, I hope they take this into account and actually do better for their next project. in the first season; setting the pace and the feel of the anime.

For future sake, I hope they take this into account and actually do better for their next project.', ""It is advisable to read this review after seeing the first season of Seitokai no Ichizon.Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2 is a very enjoyable anime with a good comedy and some heart-warming moments. But let’s see if it is different from the first season.Student Council's Discretion, Seitokai no Ichizon, has the following genres: comedy, parody, school and harem. The anime is based on the light novel by Aoi Sekina and Kira Inugami; the show was produced by AIC and it aired between October 13, 2012 and December 15, 2012. The anime has 10 episodes in total.Story-line (7/10)Just like in the first season of Seitokai no...Ichizon, the second season doesn’t have the story-line, because all episodes aren’t connected and the events of one episode don’t add much to the next episode. But unlike the first season, most episodes of the second season have more scenes taking place outside of the student council’s room, which was made in an attempt to make the second different from the first. The story-line continues from where the first season ended with only 6 more months until the graduation day, with Kurimu and Chizuru graduating, and Minatsu and Mafuyu moving schools, leaving Ken with the task of creating his harem much harder to accomplish. So, throughout the second season, Ken tries to make the four girls happy and to show them how much he loves them. The comedy part in the second season was somewhat weaker than in the first season; yet, the character development received much more attention than in the first season. But for some reason the interaction between the characters felt forced and unfeasible.Art (8/10)Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2 uses a very similar art style to the first season, with the only noticeable change being the use of brighter colors and a smoother look to the animation, which made the show more attractive to the viewer. Another difference was that the student council’s room was different from what it was in the first season. In Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2, more time was given to the scenes outside the student council’s room, which was interesting, since they showed other places, including Ken’s room. This gave the viewer something new, instead of keeping them just in the student council room and in that room only, which the first season did most of the time. This also allowed the viewer to see other parts of the characters’ lives outside the student council room. All in all, the characters still look well-designed and pleasing to look at, just like in the first season.Sound (8/10)Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2 captured the same feeling with the music like the first season did. The new opening for Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2 gave a nice feeling, with its soft and cute vocals, while the ending, unlike in the first season, was sung by the female singer. The background music was well-made and each musical piece fitted the mood of what the characters were taking about. The voice actors/actresses did one hell of a job voicing their characters; their characters felt to be real and I did like it.Characters (9/10)The anime follows five members of the student council at Hekiyou Academy.--Kurimu Sakurano, voiced by Mariko Honda (Yuuko Aioi from Nichijou and Mazinger Z from Robot Girls Z.) She is a child-like president of the student council, who acts somewhat childish and loves sweets. At the beginning of nearly every episode she writes briefings on a white board. In season 1, Ken revealed that he met Kurimu in the spring, while helping her carry boxes.--Chizuru Akaba, voiced by Mina (Yuuto Amakawa from Omamori and Sohara Mitsuki from Sora no Otoshimono) She is a sadistic secretary, who loves Kurimu and is always trying to cuddle and abuse her. Ken met her in the autumn, when he was suffering from a broken heart by the two girls he loved.--Minatsu Shiina, voiced by Misuzu Togashi (Origami Tobiichi from Date a Live and Yukiteru Amano from Mirai Nikki.) She is a tomboyish vice-president, who loves shounen to a point that most of her suggestions are based upon them. Ken met Minatsu in the summer.--Mafuyu Shiina, voiced by Iori Nomizu (Zuikaku and Shoukau from Kancolle and Nymph from Sora no Otoshimono). She is Minatsu’s little sister and the club’s treasurer. She is addicted to video games and loves BL novels. Ken met Mafuyu in the winter in an online chat room.--Ken Sugisaki, voiced by Takashi Kondou (Hibiki Laytis from Fairy Tail and Takumi Kaizu from _Summer.) She is the valedictorian, or “blue chip” seat of the student council, because of being the highest scoring student in his group. He loves to play eroge and bishoujo games. He dreams and plans to make the rest of the student council members his harem.Enjoyment (8/10)Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2, did feel to me weaker than the first season, but it is still enjoyable to me. The story was interesting and it had some funny moments, but in comparison with the first season, it had a more serious feel to it, whereas the first season was more focused on the comedy. The art was pleasing and the sound delivered the same feeling, apart from the two things: firstly, most of the ending songs didn’t give me the same feelings like the ones in the first season and secondly, Chizuru’s new voice actress couldn’t give me the same feeling that the old one did, especially in the sadistic scenes. But aside from that, it was a very good watch.Overall (8/10)Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2 suffers from what sometimes happens in some sequels: the prequel overshadows the sequel. While Seitokai no Ichizon Lv.2 was still enjoyable to watch, it just wasn’t able to match with the first season. This desire to spend enough time on the characters’ development only ruined the second season. Did they want to make a good comedy, or perhaps did they want to make something more than a romantic comedy? That is the question I can’t answer.All in all, if you didn’t like the first season, there is no reason for you to watch the second. It is not an eye-candy, it is a show, which will help you to chuckle and just to kill your free time. Give it a try!

Sakurada Reset,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34102/Sakurada_Reset,"['Don\'t let the scores this show received on previews deceive you. this show is actually a Hidden gem among all the anime between this and spring season. is sad that this show received such a harsh treatment from many people with different opinions, like the show being slow, emotionless, boring, uninteresting, etc. but when it comes to its own merits, Sakurada Reset shines for being an Anime that does things well, yeah that\'s right, you won\'t see that many anime having a great plot without forgetting things they said and then doing otherwise. in Sakurada Reset case, it manages to stick to its own Idea...and expand it and manages to explain at least almost everything within time, the main problem is that the first half is a bit slow and the characters lacks a bit of emotions (well that\'s a kuudere for you) yet, that ""main problem"" is called development and slow pace, so that pretty much sums up for the things that scared people away, because its seen everywhere, you will see inpatient people that wants things to be fast, but when they get their explanation they either call it bullshit or probably gave up on the show a while ago. it makes me think that they would insta drop a long run Anime of more than 100 episodes just because the main character doesn\'t develop like they wanted in 4 episodes. even tho that some of these anime that goes further than 200 might end up sucking or transforming into the Dragon Ball formula of seeing who has the biggest dick. but judging an anime within the first episodes of a show that has more than 12 episodes is just plain nonsense, there are special cases where it can be right to bash over an anime in the beginning, for example a Generic Anime that you would know from the very beginning how will it end. but we are not here to talk about when to or when to not give up on a show so lets get started. there might be spoilers ahead, better be warned than get spoiled.TL;DR: Overall SectionStory: The story of this anime happens on a City that goes by the name of Sakurada, which is special because the habitants of Sakurada hassupernatural abilities, and very unique ones I must say, at least, there are somes that I consider unique. now, if people leaves the town ofSakurada, they will forget that they had an ability and everything related to abilities inside of Sakurada. (even though it might seem otherwise, this has an explanation)We get to meet our main Characters: Asai Kei, Haruki Misora and Sumire Souma. they have powers that may be great if the three of them worked together, Asai Kei has the power of remember everything he sees and hear, Haruki Misora has the power to get back in time to a point where she saved. her power has some restrictions: she has to ""save"" a ""moment"" in time, once she reset, she is not able to save again unless 24 hours has passed from the last save point (preventing you from abusing this power) and in order to reset, she used to activate her power when she saw someone crying, but this changes later on. and we have Sumire Souma, her ability is a bit painful actually, since she can foresight things that might happen. by using this power, she made Kei and Misora meet each other, because she knew that they would make a good team/couple, mostly because Misora will not remember anything when she resets, she and every Sakurada Reset ability user that isn\'t Kei (and other exceptions), this way Kei would be the master key in order to fix the problem that made Misora reset. but even knowing what was the problem, that doesn\'t mean it will be easy to fix.on the first half our duo will help people in need while they find answers on why Souma Died, they also will try to find more about them as persons (because them being almost emotionless, were one of the reasons why people gave up on this show so easily) this while confronting other ability users (I can feel the Influence of JoJo on this anime by the hands of David Productions, there are abilities that reminds me of some parts of the JoJo series) now, on the second half, is where this show goes all in revealing most of Sakurada\'s secrets, developing their characters on a really great way while solving certain cases that are very philosophical (one of the strongest things on this anime) as you might have noticed this anime requires very deep thinking, otherwise you would feel very lost if you don\'t pay attention. Because of how great Sakurada Reset manages to pull all together within the 2nd half and how great it manages to develop everything at the end, I\'ll give story an score of: 8.5/10I\'ll combine Art and the Soundtrack into one section since there isn\'t much to say here. The animation is quite good overall, there are scenes that has a really deep impact while having a good harmony with the soundtrack, the show successfully manages to give you the right atmosphere on certain scenes that manages to hook you even more, mostly on the second half. tho it is completely worth it  because involves the characters while they are developing and showing how worth their development is. so for Art and Soundtrack, both goes by the score of: 8/10Lets head into one of the strongest things on this anime, the Characters. Even if they show themselves quite emotionless, they manage to develop really well in a very surprising way. they start getting more emotional within time while dealing with very philosophical and psychological events that will help them understand more about themselves, the story of Sakurada and the ability users. Asai Kei is a Mastermind when it comes to plans, even if his development sacrifices the development of the other characters (this since the resets of Misora will erase the development of the other characters that aren\'t Kei) he manages to go 7 steps ahead of everyone, he never ceases to amaze me when it comes to his risky but successful plans. Certainly, I wouldn\'t want him as a Villain, would be as smart as Aizen from Bleach. the other characters are still good, they will still develop, even if their progress get reset\'d a couple of times. at least that development doesn\'t go to trash like for example in re:zero, where Subaru instead of growing into the right side, he lost his mind and pretty much destroys any development of everyone and himself (that until a blue haired person that I don\'t remember gets him some doses of ""Ubicatex"" (this is a spanish play word that means ""snap out of it"") so for the great development of these characters and their events, I\'ll give the charactersa Score of: 9.5/10as for Enjoyment, if you aren\'t into a slow paced story with characters that will develop quite slowly, this show certainly might not be for you. but if you are patient enough, certainly this anime will keep you hooked and will reward those that sticks to the end. The more weeks I spent waiting for this show, the more worth it became. so within all that this show had to offer, my Enjoyment will be a score of: 10/10Overall 8.8/10 (9): an Anime that rewards those that explores deeply into the secrets this show has, Characters that develop greatly, and events that will keep you hooked with Philosophical and psychological touchs. quite underrated and overlooked by unpatient people. and expand it and manages to explain at least almost everything within time, the main problem is that the first half is a bit slow and the characters lacks a bit of emotions (well that\'s a kuudere for you) yet, that ""main problem"" is called development and slow pace, so that pretty much sums up for the things that scared people away, because its seen everywhere, you will see inpatient people that wants things to be fast, but when they get their explanation they either call it bullshit or probably gave up on the show a while ago. it makes me think that they would insta drop a long run Anime of more than 100 episodes just because the main character doesn\'t develop like they wanted in 4 episodes. even tho that some of these anime that goes further than 200 might end up sucking or transforming into the Dragon Ball formula of seeing who has the biggest dick. but judging an anime within the first episodes of a show that has more than 12 episodes is just plain nonsense, there are special cases where it can be right to bash over an anime in the beginning, for example a Generic Anime that you would know from the very beginning how will it end. but we are not here to talk about when to or when to not give up on a show so lets get started. there might be spoilers ahead, better be warned than get spoiled.TL;DR: Overall SectionStory: The story of this anime happens on a City that goes by the name of Sakurada, which is special because the habitants of Sakurada hassupernatural abilities, and very unique ones I must say, at least, there are somes that I consider unique. now, if people leaves the town ofSakurada, they will forget that they had an ability and everything related to abilities inside of Sakurada.

If you believe that anime, as a genre, should be solely about unadulterated entertainment of the most vulgar degrees, little girls fighting each other to the death, cow-titted, blonde onee-sans snuggling up to virginal heroes of godlike powers, or whatever the fuck you people see in those Eromanga-senseis and whatnot, then you\'d do best avoiding this series, you will only be disappointed and will possibly whine about it being boring, confusing and seriously lacking in infantile erotic tension.If you, however, think that this is one of the greatest mediums to give an experience equally stimulating visually and intellectually, capable of opening your eyes to completely different points of view, then I highly recommend the series.The story itself is about presenting the numerous way the people of Sakurada relate to other\'s and their own abilities, and how encounters with one another influence personal growth. It\'s not a world-changing great adventure or a hard struggle between embodiments of good and evil, even the larger scale events are given a personal grasp, as they are significant to the individual, but only mere episodes for the world in which those individuals exist.And that\'s where the main focus lies, the characters. Again, if you are looking for the usual character tropes and typical over-the-top voice acting you get from My Little Tsundere Princess Sister And The Magical Academy Of Lightshow Battles, then you will most definitely find all the characters boring and empty. Each and every member of the cast is constructed in a layered fashion, first only providing the means for a surface-level understanding of their personalities (and that\'s the point where most viewer gave the series a 2/10 and quit), only to open up for us as our eyes into their world, Kei, begins to unravel the circumstances that lead them to this point in their lives, our encounter with them changing their views significantly, later appearances showing glances of their growths by the end of the series.In tandem with the aforementioned narrative focus, the characters of Sakurada Reset all act and emote in very human ways, they show subtle expressions while talking with normal tonality, the same way as any of us would in given conversations. Hell, one of the main point of the series is how the characters develop as they interact with others, the dialogues\' unfolding nature serves this purpose perfectly, especially in Haruki\'s case, who goes from an extremely cold and emotionless presentation to become one of the most vibrantly expressive characters of the series.Spoken lines do tend to be somewhat slow-paced and very philosophical in their nature, the characters often discuss thought experiments and theories in detail, and that too might be one of the reasons for the hasty abandonment of the series by those who mainly use philosophy books (provided that they ever held one in their hands) to find every single mention of a phallus, but in my opinion, they work in context, expand the narrative and fit the more contemplative tone of the series.Another complaint aimed at the show was its visuals. Without going on a rant or a needlessly long-winded analysis (like I kinda did in the last section), it seems to me that these arguments could be connected to, yet again, the large masses\' expectations. This is neither the diabetic world of moe animes, neither the visual orgies of a Shinkai Makoto or ufotable project, the colour scheme is a very relaxing one and the designs are in no way flashy or complicated. Despite all that, I can state with all honesty that the visuals are perfectly satisfactory. They don\'t draw attention away from the dialogues, are pleasant to look at and even without jaw-dropping animation, the proficient work of David Production often manages to create captivating imagery through the simplistic beauty found in the carefully composed frames.There are many more to talk about when it comes to this series, but I don\'t think my dreary essay here is not the right way to approach the matter. Rather than that, I would like to encourage every single person who took their time to read this review to join the conversation and discuss this anime. I\'ve been tastelessly positive in these (not so) brief paragraphs, there are many positives and negative to be found here, far more than I ever cared to mention, but I believe that all of that should be said and seen by many more than the few who humoured this narcissistic nerd for the time of a review.If I could ask one thing from you, dear reader, I would like you to look beyond the premature denouncement and check out this anime, form your own opinion about it based on what you actually get and not on the popular trends that exist on an entirely different side of the medium!Give Sakurada Reset the chance it never got, the chance to give its audience the experience it meant to! reality, the show is not the second coming of your local salvation-based deity, it is definitely not for everyone.

If you do, try to remember what Monogatari is like for a second. It\'s a show which is full of dialogues. It\'s a show which has most of its big moments resolved through dialogues. It\'s a show that was able to focus both on telling and showing at the same time, proving to many that ""show don\'t tell"" really isn\'t the be all end all for visual media like anime. Now take every person from the staff that worked on it, anyone that had any creative input in it, and give it to people who can\'t comprehend...how to make it interesting at all. Oh, and don\'t forget to also get Takayama Katsuhiko to do the series composition. You know, the guy who wrote the script for Boku No Pico, and whose last big project was Big Order.I have no legitimate idea who thought that this is the team that can be creative enough, to turn a light novel story, that\'s really heavy on exposition, slow and hard to consume on its own for sure, into a story inside of a visual medium, but let me tell you, they were wrong in all the worst ways imaginable.Ladies, gentlemen, I present this review which I humbly wrote about a series, that I\'m pretty sure had less passion while being developed, than I had while writing this analysis.*Spoilers past this section*Superpowers aren\'t a new idea, neither is one of them being controlled by the government, but there are titles coming out each year that are able to do some good with such topics. My Hero Academia, Captain America: Winter Soldier and the X-Men comics are just a few that immediately come to my mind. All of them have found a way to create worlds around such ideas and adapt their plot to play to its strengths. Sakurada Reset attempts to do it, but it fumbles at every point and every corner, creating a huge jumble of ultimate nothingness.The story takes place in Sakurada, that has been a place where all sorts of powers have sprouted out of nowhere and have been taking the place by storm. The things have been calmed down and controlled by the Administration Bureau, that has been controlling and ministering over the area. Thanks to that, Sakurada is able to continue with its everyday flow and the abilities become a common thing, a part of everyday life. However, the trick is, the abilities do not spread, they\'re contained within Sakurada and everyone who walks outside of its boundary immediately loses all memories of them even existing.One day, a boy by the name Asai Kei enters Sakurada, and it turns out that his ability is ultimate memory, which allows him to remember everything no matter how his memories are altered. Years pass, and one day, during school, he meets a girl - Haruki Misora - that can reset the world to the state at the time when she has last ""saved"". Combined, they are able to do great things, as Kei is able to plan out and fix problems that arise due to his perfect memory. Their story leads them to a lot of pain, a death of a friend, a fight against those who despise powers, but also the joy that they see through helping the community and the happiness they find in each other.This show\'s problems are somewhat weird, especially pacing-wise. It begins two years before the actual events, when Kei, Haruki, and Sumire Souma meet and solve their first case together, which later one becomes a basis for them helping other people out. The pacing in those first episodes is extremely fast and unapologetic, it doesn\'t care if you didn\'t catch something, you\'re just supposed to have understood everything in between the stupidly fast transitions. Considering that those beginning moments of the show are supposed to introduce you to the concept of powers and set up the entire drama later on, I don\'t think I need to say much more about why that is a bad thing.But to add salt to the injury, every problem that the show struggles with in general is present this early on as well, which is both weird and sort of funny at the same time.That\'s because despite the fast transitions and scenes generally passing by like flies, the show is surprisingly slow in the delivery of each line. You can spot awkward pauses everywhere, there are those empty, 5-10 seconds breaks during dialogues. They really become apparent in the third and fourth arc, but they\'re there from the beginning, and they\'re quite hurtful to the flow of the conversation and the general pace of the anime. It feels like they\'re there to sort of fill out the time instead of doing something meaningful. You might ask ""How is it possible that the early scenes go by so fast if the scenes themselves are so slow?"". It\'s simple, the scenes are slow, but they\'re just short early on, and it\'s only later that it becomes a serious issue, as they start becoming longer. And what makes it worse, there\'s a distinct lack of anything interesting going on with the show\'s visuals.At the very beginning of this review, I mentioned Monogatari, and I did that for the purpose of making you, the reader of this review understand something. If you\'ve watched Monogatari you\'ve obviously noticed its style, its distinct way with visuals and how it enhances dialogue that would normally feel dreadful and boring. There are tons of visual gags, characters screw around in the background, the art style changes on a lot of occasions, most metaphors are visualized and generally, the show is just interesting to look at, even though most of the information you get is through the characters talking. Despite the silliness, however, it\'s still able to maintain the seriousness and groundedness that Sakurada tries so hard to achieve with its ""serious conversations"" or the ""focused visuals"". Do you know why that is? Because its writing is good enough so that it\'s able to create those serious scenes whenever it wants to. Sakurada Reset feels like it doesn\'t believe in its writing or characterization enough for the viewer to continue following them through if there\'s something else going on on the screen. That wouldn\'t even be that bad, but the show looks horrendous. Everything is plain, the designs are boring and have absolutely nothing to them, the background art is often nonexistent or cut out due to the camera placement. The animation for what I\'d say is over 60% of the show consists of still shots and characters with their moving mouths.If the show\'s so boring to look at, my question is: why is it an anime? Why did this story have to be recreated in this medium? If the director has no inspiration to add any personality, humanity or individuality to the show, if the background artists are doing only what\'s necessary, if the show doesn\'t have anything special going for it visually, then what\'s the point of LOOKING at the show? Hell, this adaptation goes even further, as it HURTS the plot with the previously mentioned awkward, soundless pauses, the lack of emotions on character\'s faces, and the mostly uninspired designs of everything you look at. It just throws you off from the start and never draws you in again.But those are technical things, those don\'t matter, right? Let\'s talk about...NO!People! Stop undervaluing the influence of the things you look at in anime. If the thing you\'re looking at does nothing to even attempt to adapt to the medium that IT CHOSE, then why should you, as a viewer, adapt to the way it\'s presented to even digest it? Goddamn Mobile Suit Gundam from 1979, freaking Serial Experiments Lain from 1998, name any other show from god knows how long ago, and all of them, despite looking like they\'re drawn in Microsoft Paint at times, are able to create style, atmosphere, and designs that integrate into the experience, creating a distinct feeling to them. Sakurada Reset is content with being the most limited and basic version of itself imaginable. It\'s fine with the bare minimum if it just means it can tell a story. Where\'s the passion? Where\'s the love for the project that you\'re working on? This show feels like it was more of a chore to make rather than something that anyone wanted to work on. It\'s disgusting, repulsive even. While watching, you can basically feel as if nobody wanted this project to work out. Well, maybe there\'s someone...I\'d argue that if someone feels like they tried it\'s the original creator. This is light novel writing through and through, and every amateur mistake is there. The lazy exposition where Kei or others go out of their character to explain things to the viewer; the lack of proper explanation of the powers, that leaves up countless possibilities, which end up feeling like conveniences; and the clear struggles of the author as he tries to get from point A to point B, desperately setting things so his vision can finally take place. He clearly had ideas and did some research, but he\'s just not a good writer. He lacks subtlety and understanding of the people he\'s catering to. He believes that if he didn\'t understand something before writing about it, then we also won\'t, so he forces explanation into the plot, be that either some storytelling term or a psychological one. He doesn\'t use those dialogues to contextualize the world or the characters, the most you\'ll get is that Kei reads philosophy, apparently. The author also ends up making the characters, especially the side cast, feel like devices to fit the finale rather than the fully realized ones. He gives them those mini-arcs that, he thinks, are enough to justify the characters\' existence, but that\'s not true. It\'s hard to say if it\'s a case of lackluster experience, lack of time, or anything else, but even though the plot is a mess, you can\'t say it lacks ideas or creativity in what it ended up being. It\'s just the execution that sucks. Nobody thought about working out those issues.Let me go back a little bit and talk about the way this show uses its characters. What I mentioned is unfortunately true to the core. Characters end up feeling like they exist just so that their power can be in the story, and the writer gave them interactions and moments so they won\'t be considered as plot devices. Bad news: they are still plot devices.Despite quite a few characters that the show attempts to get through something, there are pretty much no implications for them before, during, or after they\'re done with the things they need to do. Their shown only when they\'re absolutely needed, in situations where it\'s necessary for them or their powers to exist. When Haruka needs to express emotions that she can\'t show to Kei, she talks with the cat girl that she met before. She never really seems to have any internalized monologues, none of the characters do, they have to express it out unless it\'s something that has to be explained to the viewer. Most lack stances on the world, they lack personalities and reasons to exist, it\'s impossible to see them actually live inside that world, outside of the events that the show presents. They\'re puppets, moving when they are picked up and put down when another puppet has to step in. Can you tell me what life does Ukawa lead? Can you tell me what personality does she showcase in conversations? What about Murase? Oka Eri? You can\'t. As I said, they are puppets, they\'re not characters, but the show pushes in this bullshit narrative and character arcs for each of them as if they were meant to be. They exist so that their powers can be used in the finale, that\'s it.I said that the characters don\'t feel like they couldn\'t fit in casual situations, but are there situations like that in this show? To be honest, not at all, but the show tries to hide that fact. The problem is, it does it really poorly. I\'d compare it to someone who\'s really fat trying to hide behind a pole. There\'s obviously a large part of his body sticking out. same goes for those ""casual"" conversations in Sakurada. They try to showcase those dialogues between Kei and Haruka, but all they or anyone for that matter talk about are psychological scenarios and terms. Let me show you two supposedly laid-back conversations from this show:""Hey, what are you thinking about""""Have you heard of the Swampman?""""No, what is that?""Proceeds to explain the entire idea of the Swampman""Your notebook was new today""""Yeah""""It\'s almost like as if a new world was born today""""You mean like the Five-minute Hypothesis?""""Yes. It\'s a thought experiment....""Both of them are clear and lazy attempts at explaining the viewer a concept that will appear or has already appeared in the story, NOT casual conversations that those two characters would have. I heard so many times that this show is good at foreshadowing or that it requires lots of thought to understand, but I can\'t fathom anyone thinking that this is well written in. The main character explains everything before you can even think, like that time when a monster appeared representing some character, and the MC just, straight up, explained his design. That design was probably the most creative thing that happened in this show ever since they introduced the concept of powers, but nope, you don\'t get to understand it, the show understands it for you. It\'s aggravating to me as the viewer, the show doesn\'t have to implement those explanations into the narrative, nobody needs to hear about what they\'re called unless the characters can develop perspectives on them, which in turn can lead to several narrative uses or make for interesting character studies. Of course, this show doesn\'t use them that way. Ever.So if the casual conversations are ruined, and you can\'t enjoy thinking about the show since it\'s done for you, can you at least follow the mystery properly? No. The powers haven\'t been explored or given enough room for that to be available. Can you at least look at the things as they uncover, since the plot has some heart? Well, seems like you forgot that looking at it isn\'t fun at all too. Well, I think I can say this show is worthless now.I said all that I needed to about Sakurada Reset in the last paragraph alone, there\'s very little that I can add to it. If something, I guess I have to commend it that it capitalizes off of the characters and lets them grow with the story, but again, that\'s only noticeable because the show decides ""Oh well, they\'re different people now"", not because it\'s something that comes naturally, that you can see for yourself through their choices and interactions. There\'s nothing in their behavior or thought process that changes, even though they underwent this ""big"" change. The same tone, the same facial expressions, the same mannerisms, the same thinking process, all remains just as it was. It\'s just that now, they apparently have a different opinion on something.Overall this show lacks any sort of real value, both as an experience and as a piece of art.And I\'m done.As always this is purely my opinion, but I can\'t encourage you to develop your own. Watch at your own risk. how to make it interesting at all. Oh, and don\'t forget to also get Takayama Katsuhiko to do the series composition. You know, the guy who wrote the script for Boku No Pico, and whose last big project was Big Order.I have no legitimate idea who thought that this is the team that can be creative enough, to turn a light novel story, that\'s really heavy on exposition, slow and hard to consume on its own for sure, into a story inside of a visual medium, but let me tell you, they were wrong in all the worst ways imaginable.Ladies, gentlemen, I present this review which I humbly wrote about a series, that I\'m pretty sure had less passion while being developed, than I had while writing this analysis.*Spoilers past this section*Superpowers aren\'t a new idea, neither is one of them being controlled by the government, but there are titles coming out each year that are able to do some good with such topics. My Hero Academia, Captain America: Winter Soldier and the X-Men comics are just a few that immediately come to my mind. All of them have found a way to create worlds around such ideas and adapt their plot to play to its strengths. Sakurada Reset attempts to do it, but it fumbles at every point and every corner, creating a huge jumble of ultimate nothingness.The story takes place in Sakurada, that has been a place where all sorts of powers have sprouted out of nowhere and have been taking the place by storm. The things have been calmed down and controlled by the Administration Bureau, that has been controlling and ministering over the area. Thanks to that, Sakurada is able to continue with its everyday flow and the abilities become a common thing, a part of everyday life. However, the trick is, the abilities do not spread, they\'re contained within Sakurada and everyone who walks outside of its boundary immediately loses all memories of them even existing.One day, a boy by the name Asai Kei enters Sakurada, and it turns out that his ability is ultimate memory, which allows him to remember everything no matter how his memories are altered. Years pass, and one day, during school, he meets a girl - Haruki Misora - that can reset the world to the state at the time when she has last ""saved"". Combined, they are able to do great things, as Kei is able to plan out and fix problems that arise due to his perfect memory. Their story leads them to a lot of pain, a death of a friend, a fight against those who despise powers, but also the joy that they see through helping the community and the happiness they find in each other.This show\'s problems are somewhat weird, especially pacing-wise. It begins two years before the actual events, when Kei, Haruki, and Sumire Souma meet and solve their first case together, which later one becomes a basis for them helping other people out. The pacing in those first episodes is extremely fast and unapologetic, it doesn\'t care if you didn\'t catch something, you\'re just supposed to have understood everything in between the stupidly fast transitions. Considering that those beginning moments of the show are supposed to introduce you to the concept of powers and set up the entire drama later on, I don\'t think I need to say much more about why that is a bad thing.But to add salt to the injury, every problem that the show struggles with in general is present this early on as well, which is both weird and sort of funny at the same time.That\'s because despite the fast transitions and scenes generally passing by like flies, the show is surprisingly slow in the delivery of each line. You can spot awkward pauses everywhere, there are those empty, 5-10 seconds breaks during dialogues. They really become apparent in the third and fourth arc, but they\'re there from the beginning, and they\'re quite hurtful to the flow of the conversation and the general pace of the anime. It feels like they\'re there to sort of fill out the time instead of doing something meaningful. You might ask ""How is it possible that the early scenes go by so fast if the scenes themselves are so slow?"". It\'s simple, the scenes are slow, but they\'re just short early on, and it\'s only later that it becomes a serious issue, as they start becoming longer. And what makes it worse, there\'s a distinct lack of anything interesting going on with the show\'s visuals.At the very beginning of this review, I mentioned Monogatari, and I did that for the purpose of making you, the reader of this review understand something. If you\'ve watched Monogatari you\'ve obviously noticed its style, its distinct way with visuals and how it enhances dialogue that would normally feel dreadful and boring. There are tons of visual gags, characters screw around in the background, the art style changes on a lot of occasions, most metaphors are visualized and generally, the show is just interesting to look at, even though most of the information you get is through the characters talking. Despite the silliness, however, it\'s still able to maintain the seriousness and groundedness that Sakurada tries so hard to achieve with its ""serious conversations"" or the ""focused visuals"". Do you know why that is? Because its writing is good enough so that it\'s able to create those serious scenes whenever it wants to. Sakurada Reset feels like it doesn\'t believe in its writing or characterization enough for the viewer to continue following them through if there\'s something else going on on the screen. That wouldn\'t even be that bad, but the show looks horrendous. Everything is plain, the designs are boring and have absolutely nothing to them, the background art is often nonexistent or cut out due to the camera placement. The animation for what I\'d say is over 60% of the show consists of still shots and characters with their moving mouths.If the show\'s so boring to look at, my question is: why is it an anime? Why did this story have to be recreated in this medium? If the director has no inspiration to add any personality, humanity or individuality to the show, if the background artists are doing only what\'s necessary, if the show doesn\'t have anything special going for it visually, then what\'s the point of LOOKING at the show? Hell, this adaptation goes even further, as it HURTS the plot with the previously mentioned awkward, soundless pauses, the lack of emotions on character\'s faces, and the mostly uninspired designs of everything you look at. It just throws you off from the start and never draws you in again.But those are technical things, those don\'t matter, right? Let\'s talk about...NO!People! Stop undervaluing the influence of the things you look at in anime. If the thing you\'re looking at does nothing to even attempt to adapt to the medium that IT CHOSE, then why should you, as a viewer, adapt to the way it\'s presented to even digest it? Goddamn Mobile Suit Gundam from 1979, freaking Serial Experiments Lain from 1998, name any other show from god knows how long ago, and all of them, despite looking like they\'re drawn in Microsoft Paint at times, are able to create style, atmosphere, and designs that integrate into the experience, creating a distinct feeling to them. Sakurada Reset is content with being the most limited and basic version of itself imaginable. It\'s fine with the bare minimum if it just means it can tell a story. Where\'s the passion? Where\'s the love for the project that you\'re working on? This show feels like it was more of a chore to make rather than something that anyone wanted to work on. It\'s disgusting, repulsive even. While watching, you can basically feel as if nobody wanted this project to work out. Well, maybe there\'s someone...I\'d argue that if someone feels like they tried it\'s the original creator. This is light novel writing through and through, and every amateur mistake is there. The lazy exposition where Kei or others go out of their character to explain things to the viewer; the lack of proper explanation of the powers, that leaves up countless possibilities, which end up feeling like conveniences; and the clear struggles of the author as he tries to get from point A to point B, desperately setting things so his vision can finally take place. He clearly had ideas and did some research, but he\'s just not a good writer. He lacks subtlety and understanding of the people he\'s catering to. He believes that if he didn\'t understand something before writing about it, then we also won\'t, so he forces explanation into the plot, be that either some storytelling term or a psychological one. He doesn\'t use those dialogues to contextualize the world or the characters, the most you\'ll get is that Kei reads philosophy, apparently. The author also ends up making the characters, especially the side cast, feel like devices to fit the finale rather than the fully realized ones. He gives them those mini-arcs that, he thinks, are enough to justify the characters\' existence, but that\'s not true. It\'s hard to say if it\'s a case of lackluster experience, lack of time, or anything else, but even though the plot is a mess, you can\'t say it lacks ideas or creativity in what it ended up being. It\'s just the execution that sucks. Nobody thought about working out those issues.Let me go back a little bit and talk about the way this show uses its characters. What I mentioned is unfortunately true to the core. Characters end up feeling like they exist just so that their power can be in the story, and the writer gave them interactions and moments so they won\'t be considered as plot devices. Bad news: they are still plot devices.Despite quite a few characters that the show attempts to get through something, there are pretty much no implications for them before, during, or after they\'re done with the things they need to do. Their shown only when they\'re absolutely needed, in situations where it\'s necessary for them or their powers to exist. When Haruka needs to express emotions that she can\'t show to Kei, she talks with the cat girl that she met before. She never really seems to have any internalized monologues, none of the characters do, they have to express it out unless it\'s something that has to be explained to the viewer. Most lack stances on the world, they lack personalities and reasons to exist, it\'s impossible to see them actually live inside that world, outside of the events that the show presents. They\'re puppets, moving when they are picked up and put down when another puppet has to step in. Can you tell me what life does Ukawa lead? Can you tell me what personality does she showcase in conversations? What about Murase? Oka Eri? You can\'t. As I said, they are puppets, they\'re not characters, but the show pushes in this bullshit narrative and character arcs for each of them as if they were meant to be. They exist so that their powers can be used in the finale, that\'s it.I said that the characters don\'t feel like they couldn\'t fit in casual situations, but are there situations like that in this show? To be honest, not at all, but the show tries to hide that fact. The problem is, it does it really poorly. I\'d compare it to someone who\'s really fat trying to hide behind a pole. There\'s obviously a large part of his body sticking out. same goes for those ""casual"" conversations in Sakurada. They try to showcase those dialogues between Kei and Haruka, but all they or anyone for that matter talk about are psychological scenarios and terms. Let me show you two supposedly laid-back conversations from this show:""Hey, what are you thinking about""""Have you heard of the Swampman?""""No, what is that?""Proceeds to explain the entire idea of the Swampman""Your notebook was new today""""Yeah""""It\'s almost like as if a new world was born today""""You mean like the Five-minute Hypothesis?""""Yes. It\'s a thought experiment....""Both of them are clear and lazy attempts at explaining the viewer a concept that will appear or has already appeared in the story, NOT casual conversations that those two characters would have. I heard so many times that this show is good at foreshadowing or that it requires lots of thought to understand, but I can\'t fathom anyone thinking that this is well written in.

Watch at your own risk.', ""Every season has its crop of shows that just simply aren't up to snuff, and Spring 2017 is no different. Sakurada Reset, however, manages to blow all the other bad shows out of the water with just how awful it is. It attempts to lure you in with a fairly interesting gimmick about time travel and super powers, but once you actually start watching it's all downhill from there.Episode 1: Right away you can tell that something is wrong with this show. For one, the characters do not feel like actual people. You can count the amount of time that the MC blinks on a...single hand, and all camera shots are static without any feeling or depth to them. The way the characters robotically say their lines as if reading off of a script provides no entertainment for the viewer. The episode drags on endlessly due to its slow pacing and massive amounts of just dialogue. However, the first episode is just the tip of the iceberg.Episode 2: Reset was fairly mediocre during its first episode, with the concept of different abilities carrying the show quite heavily. But even an interesting concept can't carry the show through the absolute garbage it's about to slog through. The previous problems of the first episode only intensify, and often there are moments where absolutely nothing happens and the two characters are just staring at each other in silence. Two new characters are brought in whose powers are extremely plot convenient and lazy. Logic that no human would ever think of is used to solve the episode's problems, all while the main characters stare blankly into space with no hint of emotion. The convoluted plot progression is extremely hard to follow and makes for a confusing watch. Not to mention that the episode is horribly paced and drags on like the previous episode.Does Reset have the potential to pick itself back up? Honestly at this point it's extremely hard to tell. Even as someone who has begrudgingly followed the show for the past four weeks, I still don't know what exactly this show is and what it wants to do.At some points you will start laughing not because of what's happening in the show, but rather the absurdity of the character's decisions and the irregularity of the show's art and animation. As such, I'd only advise watching this show if you're extremely starved for a series about time-travel and/or you're a masochist who likes watching bad shows. If my thoughts on this show change in the coming weeks I'll come back and revise my opinion, but that possibility is extremely unlikely.Episode 6 edit: Hasn't been as garbage as the first two episodes, but still has not  improved enough to change my opinion. single hand, and all camera shots are static without any feeling or depth to them.

The complexity in the first episodes was the escape route for a lot of individuals. Gladly, I decided to continue with the story, and I am not disappointed.I consider this story very complicated, and you need to pay extra attention to the details. That is the reason why at first in the building, several users complained about the pacing and the boredom.The...story. All the persons in a city (Sakurada or Sagrada) were born with some power. Kei Asai has a particular power, he can remember everything and with the help, Haruki Misura that can restore the time back to some days, work as a team to help the persons of the city with complicated matters and situations that affect their world. If a person leaves, the city will forget that has power, but it isn\'t the case of Kei. He can\'t forget anything.In the development of the story, there are several changes, conspirations, situations, actions, a twist of the story, unexpected correlations, new powers, cats, etc. I decided not telling more because the most positive aspect of this animation is the story,The characters. The complexity of each character is great. In this story, we don\'t have a generic nature. All of them are needed in a certain way to maintain the balance in the whole story. Each character has different powers, but not in the way that are OVERPOWERED. They have a single power that could affect the environment but needs the support of other characters to do it. In other words, a simple being can\'t alter the story. The personality of them is flawless. Each character has needs, and take decisions based on that needs, has doubts and ideas. The building of each person that appeared in the story could be complex, but it is in a right way. Each arc will affect a group of characters, but you need to pay attention to the details because in the next episodes all that information is going to be needed.The art maybe is considered average. It is passable, and I am sure that the art group didn\'t care about it because they focused on the story.The sound is good. All the ED (1, 2) and OP (1, 2) are good. However, I liked the first OP and the second ED. The sound mix is standard. They don\'t need a complex mix here, so they did good work.Finally, I understand that the first episodes are complex. The story could seem tedious, but after some episodes, all start changing. We will know the reason for all the details. Sakurada is like Charlotte, and we won\'t understand what is happening until the end. If you like good stories that aren\'t predictable, then this anime is a good option. If you are seeking fights, several actions and excessive use of powers, then you should just skip it. This animation isn\'t for everyone. story.

Episode 4 is where it starts to get real, the characters seem lifeless but they will get better.Story: (9/10) (it only says 10/10 because that 6.66 is bs)Sakurada is a town that is disconnected from the rest of the world where everyone living their openly show their powers yet no one outside knows about this.It starts of with Haruki a girl who can turn back time for 3 days but is useless since her memories revert back as well, Kei...the guy who has picture perfect memory and is able to affect Haruki\'s reset. If it seems interesting now stick to that feeling cause you\'re in for a really shitty first few episodes.While it is a super power anime it more so focuses on out smarting you opponent rather than blasting him to pieces and the way their powers interact with one another and how they use it to their advantage is something to note.The story telling while it may seem very poor at first it gradually improves over time and at a certain point everything that takes place will make sense, especially everything that Souma has been referencing up to this point.The main reason why everyone has been dropping this anime is because of the atrocious first few episodes. Feeling rushed and unpolished, leaving no room for logical thinking cause they literally straight up tell you what their powers are and what the specifics are instead of determining that for yourself and also these random ass quotes (that will make sense in the future) that try too make it sound cool.I as well felt that the story telling was trash almost even dropping it. But it makes up for the next few episodes where they tie things up.Character: (8/10)The characters seem lifeless with no emotions, speaking in monotones and a boring personality it\'s very obvious.But their character do develop, it might not be a very drastic (like Midoriya from BNHA) but you know they are improving you just have to look closer, in how they speak in how they interact with one another and their gestures.They may not break down crying when their sad or clench their teeth and grip their fist when their furious but you can still feel them.Like Haruki\'s motionlessness and slight pulsing of the eyes when she felt extreme sadness or Kei\'s, when he\'s sad is a bit more submissive and speaks his mind less and is lost in thought. These slight nuances make their character.Their development while kind of obvious some people miss, like when Haruki\'s is in complete distrust with Kei due to the fact that he can use her ability to his advantage and eventually instead of not trusting she doesn\'t follow anyone but him. There\'s a lot more to talk about, but then I\'d be spoiling it.Art & Sound:The art is beautiful and the VA\'s and SFX do a great job. Even while speaking in monotones they never seem ""unlike"" the character and the slight nuances to the way they speak also shapes the characters really well.You can really tell they spent a great deal of time in this, especially to the animation (even more specifically to that wave scene, must\'ve taken half their budget for that)ConclusionWhile it may seem like shit at first they really fix things up in the later episodes. This is also quickly becoming one of my favorite Mystery anime of all time (maybe even better than Another, Shiki, Hyouka).What you have to do is stick to that synopsis and how good it sounds, but most important of all is keep an open mind because even a piece of gold is shit if you keep perceiving it like shit. the guy who has picture perfect memory and is able to affect Haruki\'s reset.

But it may not be a master piece, and I also have to wait for the rest of the four episode.This anime is plot heavy, it involves a lot of dialogues but not very much action scenes. It has a large amount of dialogues because it needs them to explain the motivation of each character and how the abilities are working together to create the result. I was not...paying full attention when I watched the first three episodes and already feel falling behind the plot, therefore I go back and re-watched the first three, and never put my attention on other things when I watched the later episodes. Even with my full attention I still need to pause the anime to let the plot digest a bit from time to time, and so far everything is making sense to me, and sometimes even trigger me to think about the philosophy it is trying to express.To avoid each part of the story being stretched too long for the audience to keep track with, the anime separate itself into different ""small"" stories or events. This is the first time I\'ve seen an anime presented in this style, and for me it works pretty well. At the beginning of each new story, it will tell you how many episodes this story will last, and therefore give you an overall sense of how complex this story is going to be. Normally telling the audience when the current event is going to end won\'t work very well, because most of the stories in anime are not very deep. However, this design works well with this particular anime because the plot is deep already, and telling the audiences how long the story is going to last will keep the entire season at a steady pace. And even you already know how long this story is going to last, you still won\'t guess what will happen in the last episode, so knowing which episode is going to be the end of the current event actually make me more exciting and anticipating for the final showdown.Right now, too many animes are filled with service scenes for both male and female audiences, and the stories are often too boring to be bothered. A lot of people are complaining about this phenomenon yet here is an anime with a real story and people are giving it a low score because they didn\'t really use their brain to watch it? It just makes me feel like we deserve all those trash animes because when there is finally a great anime, we are not appreciating it.Last word: if you don\'t understand a thing, don\'t rate it. paying full attention when I watched the first three episodes and already feel falling behind the plot, therefore I go back and re-watched the first three, and never put my attention on other things when I watched the later episodes. Even with my full attention I still need to pause the anime to let the plot digest a bit from time to time, and so far everything is making sense to me, and sometimes even trigger me to think about the philosophy it is trying to express.To avoid each part of the story being stretched too long for the audience to keep track with, the anime separate itself into different ""small"" stories or events.

The plot twist that happened in order to explain the connection that everything had was just plain fenomenal.This show started really slow but it suddently improved a lot by keeping this mystery alive, Soma Sumire had to be one of the best plot triggers I have ever seen in an anime.The main caracter Asai...Kei is just plain smart and has a really nice line of thought in the whole series. The other main caracter, the girl ""Haruki Misora"" comes off as the plain type of girl but i do feel things will change as the series goes on.Right now im very satisfied with the whole developtment of the series so far and i hope things will keep on getting more and more interesting.I\'d rate an 8 overall but things might change for better or worse as time goes by.If you\'ve dropped this series be sure to pick it back up cause i\'m sure you won\'t regret it. And if you still didnt watch Sakurada Reset at all be sure to give it a try. Kei is just plain smart and has a really nice line of thought in the whole series.

And if you still didnt watch Sakurada Reset at all be sure to give it a try.', 'After the first 3 episodes of this show, I was ready to pick apart every single flaw and problem that this show had. I was so enraged at the lack of quality that had made up the first three episodes. This was going to be my magnum opus review where I shredded apart this show and exposed it bare for the lack of quality that it was.But then something happened. It suddenly stopped sucking. Maybe it was Amazon treating the subs better or maybe it was the show having a clearer idea of what it was doing. Either way it got better. Not good,...but better.And then came the last arc in which finally Sakurada Reset finally knew what it was doing and turned itself into an enjoyable and actually good show.For one arc.The sad fact is, besides the one arc the show is still overall sub par. Even in its best arc the direction is still lacking and the art is so bland and featureless that it adds nothing to the show. Often times it looks like they aren\'t even trying as there are no real directing cues, or moments with more than bland featureless art. It\'s all the same dull looking and unexpressive views that don\'t add anything over and over again. The voice acting as well as too monotone and while it does lead to a certain atmosphere, it also hinders the emotional impact of the work, and also conflicts with one of the shows biggest problems: Convolution.Sakurada Reset is a fan of Convolution. It likes to make nothing simple. If there ever where a simple answer, Sakurada Reset would find some way to go around it. There is one lady whom one has to phone 5 times just to get her to pick up and talk. Why is this done? Convolution. They talk in metaphors and in psychology more than they talk one on one. And while that can be interesting at times. When done too much it gets overdosed and ends up saturating the show with too much of that. It makes the connection between the characters feel less human and feel less realistic. It makes the characters themselves feel less realistic They don\'t feel like humans anymore rather like machines or some other entity. It makes the show fall apart.Added to that is a script that is awful at best. The line ""If you ask me, I\'d say I\'m on the talkative side, and I\'m pretty expressive. My name is Kei Asai."" sums up its problems very well. First off that\'s a lie. He\'s not expressive, and if the show thinks he is then they\'ve failed at expressing that. Second off, no one talks like that. The formatting is all wrong and doesn\'t make much sense. Third off he\'s telling this to one of his best friends (whom promptly matters very little afterwards) not a stranger. It comes off as a poor attempt to explain the characters to us even though it makes no sense in context. Characters are best built by actions not poor explanations like this. The worst of the lot was when a character said, ""I\'m not sad. You\'re the one who\'s sad., I\'m crying because you\'re sad."" after an event that was very impactful on their own life. It was so completely out of left field and unnatural that it was hard to take the show seriously after that. If someone is really going to play that card after the serious event that happened, then that person is lacking in humanity.And because of these traits the characters don\'t really develop until the end. Even then the development is quite confusing. The characters are so convoluted themselves that it\'s hard to take anything at face value. Sometimes I feel like simplicity is underrated. One can get across clear strong messages easily by going for something simple, clear, and definitive. But since Sakurada doesn\'t like any of that. It makes a game of trying to figure out everything from the statements that are made and the ways that the characters talk to each other. Not to mention a lot of what actually is there isn\'t anything that interesting. Most of it ends up in characters that love the MC, which isn\'t really well written. One character is defined by her love for the MC and basically does everything for him and because of him. It\'s shallow characterization and it\'s annoying to see a one-dimensional character devoid of development even throughout 24 episodes. While it does actually get put in depth later and does have some merit, for most of the show it\'s shallow and boring.Even with all of the information that Sakurada Reset gives and among all its conversations, it\'s very boring and hard to follow due to those convolutions, a lack of directness and a lack of expression in the art, direction, and sound. It takes a lot of effort to watch for no real reward and overall it just isn\'t any good. The worst of which is episode 11 which has to be one of the worst episodes I\'ve ever watched, due to how boring and frustrating it was.However, that last arc does work well. The script did get a bit better over time, and as soon as it shifted into mindgame time the show actually worked. It was still confusing but at least there was a pay off for its confusing moments. There was a reason to follow their lines of logic and there was a reason for the characters to code their messages more. While there were mindgames before none were as direct as they were in the last arc and they never worked as well as in the last arc.While the last arc worked well, sadly a final arc can\'t save a show. For the most of it\'s run it wasn\'t any good and was a pain to watch. Just because the last 5 episodes are decent doesn\'t make the first episodes worth it anymore. Even though I did like those last episodes I still wouldn\'t recommend it to others because to get to them one would have to wade through a lot of crap. And frankly, it\'s not worth it. If you like overly convoluted and dialogue heavy works you might like this.

'who' is ultimately responsible ?there is also a sort of 'absurdism' in sakurada reset that reminds me of kafka's 'die verwandlung'. the salesman in 'die verwandlung' simply accepts his strange mutation without looking deeper. simiarly, in sakurada reset, once again, many of the characters just sort of accept some very strange circumstances or people's behaviours without looking deeper, as though it were somehow 'obvious'. furthermore, often the characters in sakurada reset speak completely openly and plainly, without any hint of self-protective evasion or pretense -- even when doing so would quite obviously place them in danger -- which adds to the absurdist feel. all of this serves to create a mood which is sometimes very strange, but also charming, in its own way.also like the other anime i mention, the main story acts as a vehicle for a philosophical viewpoint [which i won't spoil here... ;) ]. it's unfortunate that there typically isn't a 'philosophical' category in the genre listings, these would all most likely have that tag.although there is a superficial similarity to other anime where the characters have extraordinary powers [such as 'charlotte', for example], that's really about as far as that goes. instead, i get a distinct surrealist vibe woven intricately into a long story with many apparent contradictions that aren't resolved until much later.speaking from a technical standpoint, there's nothing earth-shattering here ; both the art and sound are respectable, and about what you should expect. or action scenes, then this anime may appeal to you. since the progress of the anime is driven almost exclusively by dialog, you may get bored if you prefer anime that are action-driven, but you'll most likely enjoy it if you get into character interaction.like the other anime i mention above, sakurada reset involves a level of intellectual abstraction that leads to a certain mood. the characters' dialog, plot development, even the visual composition tend away from the concrete and toward the symbolic and metaphorical, following methods similar to those commonly used in existential and surrealist literature. indeed, many times in sakurada reset, i was reminded of kafka's 'der prozeß' -- not from the way the plot developed, but rather due to the interactions of the characters ; often, they simply accept at face value what is happening to them [or the answers others give their questions] -- never really fighting it, or even questioning deeply at all, but rather blindly going along, surrendering their own power to vague, ambiguous, anonymous forces hidden from us behind amorphous names like 'the bureau'. even people who work for the bureau are doing this, so we are left wondering ...

Can someone accept my translation of the official synopsis that I submitted a few days ago? Because I feel like with that description, being what many people see before they watch the show, really screws up people\'s expectations on it.So, the premise of this story is that a friend (Sumire here on) of our protagonist(s) (Kei and Haruki) has set up a mystery, and they are going to figure it out because that friend killed herself, and solving that mystery eventually (sort of) resurrects her. NOT ""guy uses superpower to overthrow the authority in a town of...superpowers"", or ""club solves problems issued by the authority""!First three episodes are focused on setting things up, showing the world to the viewer, and establishing a reason to care about Sumire\'s death in ep3. The rest of the first half is where some seemingly random things happen, and they end up having a chance to sort of resurrect Sumire.Second half explores what Sumire\'s plan actually was, and more and more things clear up about her, and probably Kei\'s past as well.The story requires people to have enough interest to stay until they realize Sumire is able to see the future and munipulate it to some point. And that everyone apart from Kei and Haruki has vivid emotions.The animation is at times quite dull though. Really, there are a few 5+ second still frames of just, say, Kei\'s face. Sure that shot is still, but they could\'ve at least added a bloody blink or a bit of wind or even a slight camera movement.Overall. in my opinion, music is nice, story is great and would be agreed if it wasn\'t a weekly show, characters are interesting if you\'re willing to think a bit, and I enjoy it a lot. superpowers"", or ""club solves problems issued by the authority""!First three episodes are focused on setting things up, showing the world to the viewer, and establishing a reason to care about Sumire\'s death in ep3.

Sakurada Reset; episode 16""Thank you, I wouldn\'t want the ice cream to melt."" Sakurada Reset; episode 18""Grab her by the p*ssy"" Sakurada Reset; episode 25Sakurada Reset is an anime that grabbed my attention months before it started airing. The story\'s main gimmick- the reset ability- is an interesting concept that has been explored well in literature and other anime but with this anime promising a young duo using clever tactics and wit...in conjunction with the reset ability, it looked to be a good addition to the string of bad thriller anime that have been pervading the last few years. It was very unfortunate, then that I carelessly ignored checking up on the staff on this anime. And I payed for it.WARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE ANIMESakurada Reset is a flat, shallow, farcical anime that whole-heartedly thinks its a serious show. It\'s a tragic example of a good idea done completely wrong. Sakurada Reset\'s problems go way beyond simple bad writing and bad direction- it\'s a mix of so many terribly done aspects that it\'s actually possible they have no connection to each other. In other words, everything is individually bad and not becasue one part of the anime affects the other. It\'s an additively, not multipely, bad anime. This makes it more annoying than normal bad anime since those at least have things tied together to the point one bad thing affects everything.Fist off, the characters. All the characters are boringly written with very little to actually develop them. Their dialogue is bad (more on that in a latter paragraph) and all of them except the main characters merely exist as plot conveniences whenever the main character needs a handy ability around. The main character himself- Asai Kei- is an omniscient and omnipotent God who simply cannot lose because he\'s always right. Not my words, mind you, the other characters all treat him like he\'s the Messiah coming down from heaven in a wave of majesty. He\'s incomprehensible. His entire backstory is incomprehensible. The other characters are just bland as heck. Most of them are introduced in small arcs in the 2nd act (eps 3-12) of the anime and all of them suck. The arc has them play as minor villains who, in the end, become allies for the main character in the final arc of the show. Damn this anime make them incomprehensible. I\'ll try and explain the main arcs in order.The first arc had the character- Murase Youka- have a terrible excuse in that she wanted to save a cat and you can clearly see the anime pad out the runtime with pointless dialogue and events that make no sense. But its climax was where she literally tried to kill Kei. She has literally zero reason to kill him but the anime was written to have her be crazy and stupid enough to do so. Not one character talked any sense during this confrontation or even before. In the end, she just pisses off until she is needed again by the show. Next arc we have Oka Eri as our Scooby Doo villain of the week. She\'s a character who for some reason holds antagonistic feelings towards our hero and wants to ""beat"" him. That would be great if the anime actually showed us any motivation for her. It\'s offhandedly explained in some throwaway dialogue but this girl has no reason to be as bitchy as she is. The arc also has her do F*CKING NOTHING at all. Seriously, she just shows up, bitches about things, and pisses off to wait until the anime needs her again. Also in this arc there\'s something about a Witch and shit which I\'m sure is important but was so boringly done I forgot most of it. Oh yes we are also introduced to some bloke who can transfer abilities from one to another through touch. He\'ll be a super important bland character later. Oh yeah, we also have WhatsApp guy. I mean Tomoki. He\'s a friend. I think. The anime doesn\'t exactly show him unless it needs him. Funny...I\'m seeing a trend here...Anyways, the main problem with all these characters is that they\'re just so boring. The main characters (Kei and Misora) have the exact personality of an unpainted brick wall. I don\'t get how anyone can get behind their relationship because, unique as it is in anime, it\'s a very poorly handled relationship. There\'s a fair bit of emotional scenes in this anime and all of them fail due to the fact that these are badly written characters. Much of the development is rushed (ironically in such a slow show) and ham-fisted and the emotional scenes get in the way of much of the show instead of weaving itself closely. This is done much better in the final act of the show where I could see the anime sort of trying to give proper development but its let down by bad pacing and direction.The only character I was even half impressed with was Souma Sumire- the only character to carry this show from ""unrelentingly horrendous"" to simply being ""really terrible"". She\'s a walking plot device. Not kidding, she even describes herself as such. She is, however, the only character with even half-reasonable motivations and explanations for what she does. She has an actual interesting character arc and sees more development than all other characters combined. She\'s also the only character we see being subtle in her methods and you can see faint threads throughout the story that she leaves behind- meaning she has a genuine presence within the show (for example, setting up the McGuffin so that Kei can meet up with Youko. I think that was one of the reasons. Though it still doesn\'t give any reason for Youko to be so bitchy about things). Helped A LOT that she was voiced by a top form Aoi Yuuki who puts everyone else to shame (not too difficult though since they\'re all as engaging and relatable as sandpaper). All other characters in this show do not matter. They\'re all plot conveniences used by the main character to look smart and show his omniscience.Then finally, we have our villain- introduced in the second half of the show and wants to erase all abilities from Sakurada town. He\'s a villain so bad he puts the villains from ERASED, Chaos;Head and Guilty Crown to shame. I literally know nothing about him. The anime does such a poor job of building him up as a character and thinks flashbacks and sinister smiles are enough to make him imposing in any way. The anime tries so hard to tell you he\'s a smart guy with an excellent plan that they fail to actually show him being smart and doing excellent things. All he really does is get driven around in a badly rendered CG car, writing notes and talking about how angsty his childhood was. The anime does a sloppy job giving him any motivation to why he wants to erase abilities from Sakurada. This creates a problem in the main conflict of the show. There\'s supposed to be this grand conflict of ideologies in this show about how Kei wants to keep abilities (also very poorly shown) and direclty opposes bad guy\'s desire to erase abilities. For all the anime trying to sound smart it doesn\'t give us anything tangible as to why we should support any of these characters. The themes that run through the arcs are poorly carried over and lost in the bad dialogue near the end of the show. This anime has very little to offer in challenging the viewer\'s views as it can\'t even present the opposing viewpoints of the characters very well. Also, the 2 side goons of the main villain have no personality at all. But that\'s not surprising.The story is about as incomprehensible as the characters. It\'s mostly all over the place with numerous plot holes that pop up whenever a character opens their mouth to explain something (which is frequent).The show also tries to do these really ""clever"" twist showing Kei\'s intelligence but these twist are shown in such an infuriating way its impossible to take seriously. The anime gives us so little information up until the twist that when it does come we\'re just left standing confused at what is going on. This mostly happens near the end of the show when they\'re wrapping things up but a good example would be in the penultimate episode with the bad guy in the car talking with Kei (btw episode 23 is one of the worse episodes of the show which says something). It\'s revealed that KEI ACTUALLY HAD A TALK WITH THIS GUY IN THE OTHER TIMELINE WHEN THERE WERE NO ABILITIES. What a cop-out. We got shown none of this nor was anything done to allude to the possibility that this happened, Kei just kind of says ""Yeah. So I got you to talk in that timeline. Now I know everything because I\'m the main character."". Not all the twist are as badly done as that but it definitely contributes to the overall incomprehensibility of the story. If you want more details of plot holes from Sakurada Reset pm me and I\'ll find some (its such a bad anime I have to research into why it is so bad). For the most part the story is only about as bad as the characters get though due to much of it being people sitting around talking about stuff.Now we go on to the crux of this show\'s problem. Every problem this show has traces back to one thing- the dialogue. The dialogue in this anime would make M Night Shayamalan proud. Its terrible. I can\'t begin to describe how badly written the dialogue is. It\'s like it was written by a robot who doesn\'t know how normal human interactions are like. This makes the writing feel mechanical. Too flowing. Too unnatural. The show is pervaded by this kind of dialogue. Every character, with no exception, speaks in parables, Aesops, thought experiments or metaphors. I thought it was only the 2 main characters but no its everyone. There\'s so many examples I could show you but I\'ll take one from near the end of the show. Kei goes back to where he was born and raised and meets his mother who has had her memories rewritten so Kei can stay in Sakurada. A simple dialogue between a mother and her son whom she has forgotten about should be an emotional gripper with subtlety. But no. They speak like robots. The dialogue is so unfitting of the real emotional music played around it its jarring. This is an extreme example of where the dialogue messes up but this ENTIRE SHOW has dialogue like it. The quotes in the beginning of this review are mere dabs of taste of what this show actually does. I watched it subbed like everyone but I know a fair bit of Japanese so I can safely say the subs are actually less silly than what the poor voice actors had to say at some parts. It ruins every interaction, makes everyone bland and shows how little the main characters develop (even in the personal monologue scenes.). It\'s dialogue that doesn\'t make them sound anything human. I know the point of the show is to show how detached many of the characters are but when everyone speaks like Shakespeare all the time its unnerving. It boggles my mind to think how anyone could approve of this sort of writing. The director and writer must have both agreed to have dialogue like this to be in the anime. You honestly have to watch the show to hear some of the dialogue that is being said. Its the main reason the story and characters are incomprehensible. They cannot express themselves naturally. The show has obviously done this to sound more mature but it only serves to disengage and confuse the viewer. I stress with no small experience that Sakurada Reset has the absolute worse dialogue I have ever seen in anime. Some of it is self-destructive to the story. Much of it is pointless. And all of it is  brain-melting. I repeat THE DIALOGUE SUCKS.The last thing in this review is something that is not as bad as the dialogue but much more annoying- the direction and art and animation. The director isn\'t particularly well known but has directed stuff like Non non boyori and Kokoro Connect. Sakurada Reset has a slow pacing with many stills like those anime but its so...boring. Nothing of interest happens in the shots, the lighting is undramatic for much of the show, the shot composition and angles are bland and uninspired and there is no subtle changes in things like character expressions or body language. It really is just people standing around and talking to  a flat, level, mid-shot camera position. Its one of the most boring directed anime I\'ve watched. Art direction is also flat with the aforementioned lighting but also has crappy colour design, bland backgrounds, unexpressive character designs (except Souma Sumire and maybe even Chiruchiru), REALLY BAD CGI and a general blandness in the settings. There\'s such and overuse of white and light colours in the show that SJWs might protest it. So many scenes could have been directed better and therefore made better. There\'s a scene in episode 16 where  the show has very real potential to build up on a romantic relationship between Kei and Misora where Kei ask Misora in a message to meet him on the roof. The scene was directed blandly with unnecessary cuts of Misora WALKING to the roof. It would be far more effective to simply focus on Misora herself with some slight change in expression and body language to just display some of her thoughts and inner turmoil (its episode 16, she should be at least somewhat developed by now) and have the camera linger on her from a high angle show framing her in the bottom right or left. But no. I guess walking is more important to show.Other problems I have with this show...They almost ruined KanaHana\'s and Ishikawa Kaito\'s careers by forcing them to do bland deliveries of bad dialogue. The anime has terrible sense of time and location. In one instance a month had passed from the beginning of an episode but it really felt like a few days at most. The Bureau is a rubbish organisation on par with the Orbital Knights from Aldnoah Zero and Daath from Guilty Crown. The other characters I didn\'t mention like Ukawa and the teacher being completely stupid and changing motivations on a dime for reasons I fail to understand. The abilities being poorly explained or shown in general with few exceptions and the fact that the only actual abilities being shown are only shown to become tools for the main character to use (Except for the ghost girl thing. That was entire pointless and will take a team of scientist at least 5 years to understand why the writers even included it). The anime looks rubbish even though its the same studio that made Jojo. Things I liked? Ehhhhhh the music was pretty?Sakurada Reset is an anime that had suckers falling for it with its supposed intelligence. What it really is is Kami sama no memochou except that it sucks. The characters are so badly written and bland its difficult to see any meaningful development. They\'re so unexpressive it makes me cry. If you want to see a show that is actually smart with clever dialogue and narrative twist as well as being well directed and beautiful to look at, watch Kino\'s Journey. If you want a show that does a mystery thriller better, Gosick is your answer. The Raildex series are infinitely superiour in terms of a place with abilities and using abilities to save people (as well as being a much better in-depth character piece). All in all, avoid watching this show and if you have watched it for fun and not for academics like me, I feel so bad for you since there\'s just so much better stuff out there. in conjunction with the reset ability, it looked to be a good addition to the string of bad thriller anime that have been pervading the last few years. It was very unfortunate, then that I carelessly ignored checking up on the staff on this anime. And I payed for it.WARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE ANIMESakurada Reset is a flat, shallow, farcical anime that whole-heartedly thinks its a serious show. It\'s a tragic example of a good idea done completely wrong. Sakurada Reset\'s problems go way beyond simple bad writing and bad direction- it\'s a mix of so many terribly done aspects that it\'s actually possible they have no connection to each other. In other words, everything is individually bad and not becasue one part of the anime affects the other. It\'s an additively, not multipely, bad anime. This makes it more annoying than normal bad anime since those at least have things tied together to the point one bad thing affects everything.Fist off, the characters. All the characters are boringly written with very little to actually develop them. Their dialogue is bad (more on that in a latter paragraph) and all of them except the main characters merely exist as plot conveniences whenever the main character needs a handy ability around. The main character himself- Asai Kei- is an omniscient and omnipotent God who simply cannot lose because he\'s always right. Not my words, mind you, the other characters all treat him like he\'s the Messiah coming down from heaven in a wave of majesty. He\'s incomprehensible. His entire backstory is incomprehensible. The other characters are just bland as heck. Most of them are introduced in small arcs in the 2nd act (eps 3-12) of the anime and all of them suck. The arc has them play as minor villains who, in the end, become allies for the main character in the final arc of the show. Damn this anime make them incomprehensible. I\'ll try and explain the main arcs in order.The first arc had the character- Murase Youka- have a terrible excuse in that she wanted to save a cat and you can clearly see the anime pad out the runtime with pointless dialogue and events that make no sense. But its climax was where she literally tried to kill Kei. She has literally zero reason to kill him but the anime was written to have her be crazy and stupid enough to do so. Not one character talked any sense during this confrontation or even before. In the end, she just pisses off until she is needed again by the show. Next arc we have Oka Eri as our Scooby Doo villain of the week. She\'s a character who for some reason holds antagonistic feelings towards our hero and wants to ""beat"" him. That would be great if the anime actually showed us any motivation for her. It\'s offhandedly explained in some throwaway dialogue but this girl has no reason to be as bitchy as she is. The arc also has her do F*CKING NOTHING at all. Seriously, she just shows up, bitches about things, and pisses off to wait until the anime needs her again. Also in this arc there\'s something about a Witch and shit which I\'m sure is important but was so boringly done I forgot most of it. Oh yes we are also introduced to some bloke who can transfer abilities from one to another through touch. He\'ll be a super important bland character later. Oh yeah, we also have WhatsApp guy. I mean Tomoki. He\'s a friend. I think. The anime doesn\'t exactly show him unless it needs him. Funny...I\'m seeing a trend here...Anyways, the main problem with all these characters is that they\'re just so boring. The main characters (Kei and Misora) have the exact personality of an unpainted brick wall. I don\'t get how anyone can get behind their relationship because, unique as it is in anime, it\'s a very poorly handled relationship. There\'s a fair bit of emotional scenes in this anime and all of them fail due to the fact that these are badly written characters. Much of the development is rushed (ironically in such a slow show) and ham-fisted and the emotional scenes get in the way of much of the show instead of weaving itself closely. This is done much better in the final act of the show where I could see the anime sort of trying to give proper development but its let down by bad pacing and direction.The only character I was even half impressed with was Souma Sumire- the only character to carry this show from ""unrelentingly horrendous"" to simply being ""really terrible"". She\'s a walking plot device. Not kidding, she even describes herself as such. She is, however, the only character with even half-reasonable motivations and explanations for what she does. She has an actual interesting character arc and sees more development than all other characters combined. She\'s also the only character we see being subtle in her methods and you can see faint threads throughout the story that she leaves behind- meaning she has a genuine presence within the show (for example, setting up the McGuffin so that Kei can meet up with Youko. I think that was one of the reasons. Though it still doesn\'t give any reason for Youko to be so bitchy about things). Helped A LOT that she was voiced by a top form Aoi Yuuki who puts everyone else to shame (not too difficult though since they\'re all as engaging and relatable as sandpaper). All other characters in this show do not matter. They\'re all plot conveniences used by the main character to look smart and show his omniscience.Then finally, we have our villain- introduced in the second half of the show and wants to erase all abilities from Sakurada town. He\'s a villain so bad he puts the villains from ERASED, Chaos;Head and Guilty Crown to shame. I literally know nothing about him. The anime does such a poor job of building him up as a character and thinks flashbacks and sinister smiles are enough to make him imposing in any way. The anime tries so hard to tell you he\'s a smart guy with an excellent plan that they fail to actually show him being smart and doing excellent things. All he really does is get driven around in a badly rendered CG car, writing notes and talking about how angsty his childhood was. The anime does a sloppy job giving him any motivation to why he wants to erase abilities from Sakurada. This creates a problem in the main conflict of the show. There\'s supposed to be this grand conflict of ideologies in this show about how Kei wants to keep abilities (also very poorly shown) and direclty opposes bad guy\'s desire to erase abilities. For all the anime trying to sound smart it doesn\'t give us anything tangible as to why we should support any of these characters. The themes that run through the arcs are poorly carried over and lost in the bad dialogue near the end of the show. This anime has very little to offer in challenging the viewer\'s views as it can\'t even present the opposing viewpoints of the characters very well. Also, the 2 side goons of the main villain have no personality at all. But that\'s not surprising.The story is about as incomprehensible as the characters. It\'s mostly all over the place with numerous plot holes that pop up whenever a character opens their mouth to explain something (which is frequent).The show also tries to do these really ""clever"" twist showing Kei\'s intelligence but these twist are shown in such an infuriating way its impossible to take seriously. The anime gives us so little information up until the twist that when it does come we\'re just left standing confused at what is going on. This mostly happens near the end of the show when they\'re wrapping things up but a good example would be in the penultimate episode with the bad guy in the car talking with Kei (btw episode 23 is one of the worse episodes of the show which says something). It\'s revealed that KEI ACTUALLY HAD A TALK WITH THIS GUY IN THE OTHER TIMELINE WHEN THERE WERE NO ABILITIES. What a cop-out. We got shown none of this nor was anything done to allude to the possibility that this happened, Kei just kind of says ""Yeah. So I got you to talk in that timeline. Now I know everything because I\'m the main character."". Not all the twist are as badly done as that but it definitely contributes to the overall incomprehensibility of the story. If you want more details of plot holes from Sakurada Reset pm me and I\'ll find some (its such a bad anime I have to research into why it is so bad). For the most part the story is only about as bad as the characters get though due to much of it being people sitting around talking about stuff.Now we go on to the crux of this show\'s problem. Every problem this show has traces back to one thing- the dialogue. The dialogue in this anime would make M Night Shayamalan proud. Its terrible. I can\'t begin to describe how badly written the dialogue is. It\'s like it was written by a robot who doesn\'t know how normal human interactions are like. This makes the writing feel mechanical. Too flowing. Too unnatural. The show is pervaded by this kind of dialogue. Every character, with no exception, speaks in parables, Aesops, thought experiments or metaphors. I thought it was only the 2 main characters but no its everyone. There\'s so many examples I could show you but I\'ll take one from near the end of the show. Kei goes back to where he was born and raised and meets his mother who has had her memories rewritten so Kei can stay in Sakurada. A simple dialogue between a mother and her son whom she has forgotten about should be an emotional gripper with subtlety. But no. They speak like robots. The dialogue is so unfitting of the real emotional music played around it its jarring. This is an extreme example of where the dialogue messes up but this ENTIRE SHOW has dialogue like it. The quotes in the beginning of this review are mere dabs of taste of what this show actually does. I watched it subbed like everyone but I know a fair bit of Japanese so I can safely say the subs are actually less silly than what the poor voice actors had to say at some parts.

But what made me like this pacing has to do with the characters. It’s immediately clear that something is off about them; the pseudo-philosophy, static demeanour and emotionless voices- this is what got me interested.One of the questions presented in the first episode is if a machine with human aspects should be considered a human. At first, I thought it was just trying to shoehorn in as much philosophy in its 24-minute runtime, but as I got further into the series I started to realise what they meant by it.You should not see these people as real humans. That will only leave you with disappointment. Instead, you should see them as characters, and it’s your job to pick out the human parts to latch onto.This may just sound like a bad excuse for badly written characters, and yeah, maybe it is. But for me, it’s something special, something I can look forward to every week.Now that I’m done with my little soapbox speech, I’ll start with the more objective aspects of the show.The art is good, about what you’d expect from anime in 2017, but the lack of movement may be a deal-breaker for you if the dialogue isn’t enough to keep you watching. And some characters were off-model in the last episode (13).The sound is excellent for what it is. It’s used very conservatively, and that works in its favour.Thanks for taking the time to read my ramblings. I’m not good at putting my thoughts into words, and this was my first attempt at writing a review, so please do not hesitate to tell me your criticisms. address the other two complaints.This show is an incredibly slow-burn, and it’s easy to see how this puts off a lot of viewers.

Not only is it more boring than watching paint dry, it is trying to become a new level of trash, and each episode just keeps one-upping the previous in doing so. Every single character in the show is extremely boring, lifeless and robotic, has absolutely no human emotions, and makes illogical decisions for no reason. The characters have had zero character development over the last 13 episodes I have seen, even less than Sword Art Online, which as far as I'm concerned, takes a mastermind to pull off. The plot is inconsistent, makes no sense,...and many important things are not explained properly. The forced melancholy mood on top of everything just serves to make the show more painful to get through.1/10 and many important things are not explained properly. The forced melancholy mood on top of everything just serves to make the show more painful to get through.1/10"", 'This is my first review of any anime I have ever watched because I felt, it deserves it.The series questions morality, philosophy and human nature, in a detached way, leaving aside human emotion and being based only on logic. (or that is my take on what I saw, where some may say I am giving too much depth to how things are in reality)Only to observe how feelings emerge from the ""heartless"" characters.It\'s not your typical anime, it doesn\'t lack emotion, it\'s not for everyone, it makes you think about life, death, love (love triangle), morality.Characters are, as some people say, ""robotic"" at first, where...they seem to lack emotion, maybe have a riddled way of speaking. I personally think no one can empathize with any of them, but here is my take on it, that is the best part of the show. This creates characters that speak in a weird way for their age, that no normal teen would use, and gives freedom to the questioning of human problems in a detached way.The transformation of their personality and the way their emotions begin to arise is what got me hooked.The story is interesting, but the way it is told may get confusing because of so many special powers, timelines etc...Music was ok, did not pay too much attention to it, maybe it did not spark my interest, but I can say it stayed in form with what was happening around, meaning it did not feel out of place, unlike truly awfully other examples I saw in different anime.

Literally no one talked about it when i aired, and six years later it\'s still not known. And it\'s a shame, because it is a unique anime, in terms of ambiance. Are you sick of the over-the-top reactions and surreal battles with the world at stake? Good! Because SR has none of that. It\'s a very grounded story, with down-to-earth characters like we rarely see in the anime industry.STORYThis is a world with magical powers. A girl has the ability to reset time, but she can\'t alter anything because she loses her memory when she...uses it. A boy has the ability to keep his memory no matter what, even if Time is reset. A common friend of them puts them in relation so they can work together and save people from tragedies before they even happen.But they are all young, and they are all human. So even though they have a perfect combination that can save a lot of lives, things don\'t go so smoothly.And while they live through these conflicts, they may be tangled with an even bigger one involving the Bureau, the organization that tries to manage superpowers.Sakurada Reset could be described as a ""Sherlock Holmes with magic and drama"". Although there is no genius like Holmes, the anime shows several investigations surrounding characters with superpowers. The stories are clever, the way they use the powers to move the plot is brillant. This is by far the best story involving time travel I\'ve ever seen. On par with Stein\'s Gate.Another thing that is worth praises is the fact that each power has its limitations. Like Code Geass or Death Note, Sakurada Reset describes its supernatural side with rules that serve the scenario as the characters must acknowledge those limitations and work despite them. The perfect power doesn’t exist, but every power has a perfect use case!And it’s not just the scenario and the powers that is clever. The dialogues are brilliant too! They’re very philosophical: the show aims to make you ponder. About a lot of things. It brings up a lot of typical philosophy themes, like the Swampman (similar to the Ship of Theseus), or the matter of self-preservation, or the Trolley Problem, and so on.One problem I noticed: many things are explained much later in the series. For example, why does Time act exactly the same after a Reset? That question isn\'t even asked before it is answered during the second part. Or, at some point I was wondering why Kei didn\'t realize that someone was resetting Time even though it is said Haruki had been doing it for a while; well it turns out he did notice it, it\'s just never brought up until much later.My point is you will find inconsistencies from time to time, but in fact the author did think about it, they just bring up the explanation later!RHYTHMSakurada Reset moves at a very slow pace. You have been warned. Even though I loved it, I did find a few episodes boring. But it’s all worth it!CHARACTERSAlthough all characters are likeable and relatively complex, I do have one complaint here: most secondary characters are useless most of the time. I still don\'t understand why Michiru got so much screentime. I also wish we had seen more of Minami and Nakano.So my only complaint with the characters is we don\'t see them enough! Let that sink in.MUSIC AND SOUNDSThe OST is pure. I just can\'t describe it otherwise. This is one of the highest points of this show. While the composer doesn\'t have any special musical identity (I mean, you can recognize Kajiura or Takahashi because they have definite styles ; not this one), the music doesn\'t need it to be beautiful!VISUALSWhile SR is nothing ground-breaking, it also doesn\'t have any major flaws. It\'s gorgeous overall, my only minus point will be for Haruki\'s short hair, they look pretty bad from face, lol.CONCLUSIONSakurada Reset is a unique anime show, and one I much needed to see. There’s so many anime with overacting and battles, and I like that, but I need something else too, and that is what Sakurada Reset brings! Characters are civilized humans despite their superpowers and their grand goals. They solve their issues through investigation and discussion, not through punches and fire. How many anime shows do that!Although it can feel boring at times, if you think you can handle it, I highly recommend it! uses it.

Or, at some point I was wondering why Kei didn\'t realize that someone was resetting Time even though it is said Haruki had been doing it for a while; well it turns out he did notice it, it\'s just never brought up until much later.My point is you will find inconsistencies from time to time, but in fact the author did think about it, they just bring up the explanation later!RHYTHMSakurada Reset moves at a very slow pace. You have been warned. Even though I loved it, I did find a few episodes boring. But it’s all worth it!CHARACTERSAlthough all characters are likeable and relatively complex, I do have one complaint here: most secondary characters are useless most of the time. I still don\'t understand why Michiru got so much screentime. I also wish we had seen more of Minami and Nakano.So my only complaint with the characters is we don\'t see them enough! Let that sink in.MUSIC AND SOUNDSThe OST is pure. I just can\'t describe it otherwise. This is one of the highest points of this show. While the composer doesn\'t have any special musical identity (I mean, you can recognize Kajiura or Takahashi because they have definite styles ; not this one), the music doesn\'t need it to be beautiful!VISUALSWhile SR is nothing ground-breaking, it also doesn\'t have any major flaws. It\'s gorgeous overall, my only minus point will be for Haruki\'s short hair, they look pretty bad from face, lol.CONCLUSIONSakurada Reset is a unique anime show, and one I much needed to see. There’s so many anime with overacting and battles, and I like that, but I need something else too, and that is what Sakurada Reset brings! Characters are civilized humans despite their superpowers and their grand goals. They solve their issues through investigation and discussion, not through punches and fire. How many anime shows do that!Although it can feel boring at times, if you think you can handle it, I highly recommend it!', ""There's so much contradictory reviews of this anime. Anyways, i will be giving my take on it.This anime is for kinda experienced viewers, & i don't mean mature, but experienced. If u have watched tons of anime, & by this time its hard to find good anime which can keep you entertained, without you guessing whats gonna happen in next/last episode by watching the 1st/more episodes , or even after that watching all of it cause it was just that good/fun/entertaining, then this anime might be worth your time.As for light viewers, watch it when u have some time in your hand,i think this will...be worth it & it might just give u a different taste u will like, opening a door for future/existing different genre of anime.Story will keep you entertained. It might take a little time reading, pausing & going back to read it again at 1st, but after u get the basics done of this anime's world (might take like 3 episodes), its fun to watch.Also this is 1 of those very few anime which actually has tons of content in each episodes, not like many anime where there's few min worth of content & rest is fluff , not that there's anything wrong with it, making quality content takes lots of time & effort. There's lots of content in this because most are in dialogues.p.s- it might be better to binge watch 3-5+ eps at once, or it might be a little hard to understand unless u have good memory. be worth it & it might just give u a different taste u will like, opening a door for future/existing different genre of anime.Story will keep you entertained.

When a show is surrounded by people trying to block its light, building  a gate of shadow in front it with a sign telling other to stay away 6/10, someone else have to do something to justify what they think is a masterpiece, an oasis into a desert, I grow a flower near the go away sign, maybe someone will wonder, why is that flower is there, I am telling you to don\'t let the sign scares you.And while everyone has the right to tell their opinion and judging other people may seems wrong, but in reality it is not wrong, I dare...you to say about someone ""its their opinion"" when they rate a Picasso art with 1/10 because it ugly for them.And when I always remember the rating an anime like One punch man have, I have to slap myself in a hope that I would wake up from this world, but I guess I am still sleeping in this generation where a mere action and a fancy look character is enough to call something an art, and before the incoming fullstop I have to say I am not stating my opinion about one punch man, I am just using it as an example of how unsatisfied I am when a plain anime is being glorified over an a hype, I guess Madara\'s plan has worked.Back to Business: And while Sakurada Reset was not meant to target everyone, and not as anything in this world was meant to target everyone beside maybe religion, Sakurada comes to build a building against earthquakes and any meteor that is targeting the earth, It an ark to save you from this season flooding if you come to believe on it.And while I am asking you to ignore the rating that use the number 1 2 3 and even 4 5 from someone that has already watched more than 6 episodes, I am not telling you to trust a rating from someone that use the number 10, but believe me if you have a spot for that, I am not so generous to give the number 10 for an anime every season.Now the real Business: Sakurada asks you to give every minutes its ""80"" seconds duration, and while I am a person that may skip a minute or more while watching an anime that annoys me with some of its scene, giving 10/10 to Sakurada means I gave every minute more than it stays for, The story so far is really interesting, the episodes offer a mixed type of what suppose to be called good feeling, if you are someone that is looking for a plain action or thriller then Sakurada is not the right option, Sakurada like any Art or Music, is for someone that can feel it, likes its characters because of what they are and not because of an ideology you plant for yourself, and anything other than it is inedible.My rating: And while the rating system can sometimes turns into a soccer match, someone comes with a troll 1/10 rating to downvote as much as they could, someone would change their 8/10 to 10/10 to help a little bit, My 10/10 is not to help the scale, Sakurada is an anime that I already suggested to some of my friends because it shouldn\'t be left unchecked unless you are not in the genre, and while 10/10 is an overall rating, the story is 10 for me, the art is decent so its 7, the sounds oh how much do I like the ending, and the opening is so good too 9, the characters are loveable and each has their own flavour I just wish they have a longer spot in the episodes 9, and enjoyment take a 10 because so far I enjoyed every episode, and for a 24 ep anime there may come an episode where I don\'t enjoy it, but so far they managed to keep me enjoyed for 8 episodes, and if someone wonders why I am at 8th episode for an an anime that I give 10, two reasons A: I always tend to keep the best for the last, when I love a game I want to keep on ""enjoying"" it longer, the seconf reason B: I am a slow watcher I don\'t have time to watch animes all the time, I play games on many consoles and I watch other things beside anime.Highlight for what I dislike in general: As a person that ""hate"" dancing theme, I don\'t go a dancing anime and watch 3 eps and rate it 1/10, I just move on, I don\'t want to ruin the

Sakurada reset and while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there will some spoilers within character analysis.Sakurada Reset is based off a popular light novel of the same name and introduces a rather interesting setting that puts a unique take on the powers genre. The overall premise of Sakurada Reset is twofold. On the surface Sakurada Reset is a power based anime that also feature heavy elements of human drama, mystery and school genre elements but it also features a unique play on the traditional powers anime. Because of...both western influence and a need to make an anime stand out power based animes tend to feature either heavy combat or feature powers that are flashy to look at. Because of this it’s a popular misconception among anime fans and general viewers that superpowers or in this case abilities are always flashy and powerful and has the potential to strike a guy a mile away. Sakurada Reset introduces its own take to this by going along an entirely different route.In the case of setting Sakurada Reset takes place in a large town of the same name of which what is noteworthy is that the town houses a substantial amount of people who live in the town that have access to various types of abilities.  As noted before these abilities are not as flashy and destructive as what one would see in other forms of media. For example, the ability to send pre-recorded messages to one another via telepathy that can be delivered on a date and time of your choosing may seem normal to us and indeed may sound like it’s similar to an email but this is a good example of what abilities in the anime are like. In that while they are not as flashy or powerful they are still able to provide to their users a means to enjoy their lives better and help others that may be less fortunate than them. This take on the traditional powers anime I felt was interesting as I felt that not all superpowers should be destructive or flashy and indeed some can be subtle and still have a powerful effect on people and society. The fusion of a traditional powers anime with human drama and mystery is also something that I quite liked about the premise and one that was rather unusual as well.Now that the premise is done let’s move onThe overall story for Sakurada Reset follows the lives of Kei Asai and Misora Haruki two teenagers that live in the town of Sakurada that met each other on the prompting of Kei’s old school friend Sumire Souma. The two of them because of living in the town of Sakurada the town where ability users live are both ability users and each have powerful abilities that help complement each other. The overall story common with modern animes features several different story arcs that are combined into the main plot while also having a number of sub plots as well. In the town of Sakurada both Kei and Haruki while still students on the surface use their powers to help the members of the bureau help maintain order within the town and solve ability related incidents. While solving problems with their powers is part of the overall plot that’s not the only one as the growth and development of Haruki and Kei’s relationship also forms it as well. As the series goes on and they encounter more characters and events Kei and his friends and allies soon discover that their involvement with the bureau will link them to much larger events that had in its roots in the towns mysterious past that can also affect the lives of everyone in the present.  Common with most modern anime Sakurada Reset features a number of plot lines that are bundled into the overall plot as story arcs each of I felt was unique.KeiKei Asai played by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Owari no seraph and Occultic Nine fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the main protagonist of the show. A teenage boy that lives in the town of Sakurada Kei is a somewhat normal looking guy from initial appearances but beneath his somewhat mundane appearance Kei’s personality is what defines him and allows him to be effective at countering the enemy. Personality wise Kei is a level headed, kind and caring person and as a result can understand the views of others quite easily which I felt was important for his job with the service club.  At the same time Kei, due to his level-headed nature is able to easily get to the heart of a problem by understanding the crucial parts of an event and come up with a means to solve it showing that he also has impressive deduction and analytic skills as well. However, while agreeable and pleasant to talk to when Kei is in his normal mode Kei has shown to have a more devious and cunning side to him when creating plans to deal with his opponents. In this state Kei while still bring his trademark cautiousness to the table is also willing to place himself and his friends at risk so as to allow his plan a higher chance to succeed.However, Kei’s most prominent skills that allow him to stand against powers greater than him in the overall plot is undoubtedly his intelligence and his skill at strategy both of which allowed Kei and his friends to outsmart the series main enemy faction the bureau on multiple occasions. Although still a teenager by all accounts Kei has shown himself to very adept at strategy especially with regards to both anticipating the enemy’s moves and outsmarting them by moving events in motion before the enemy does which I found to be pretty amazing considering his opponents in the story are all adults. When combined with Kei’s unique ability as a character Kei is someone that can be seen to be a cunning and devious opponent for the bureau that while still impressive in his own right is more so when he’s working with allies that agree with his plans and aims.As the series goes on Kei’s personality changes a great deal as a result of both meeting the series main female leads and his interaction with a number of different characters that reside in the town. In the beginning of the series Kei while still having his trademark calmness was rather quiet in the beginning and rather indifferent to the plight of others that meant that he at this time only had a small circle of friends. However, as the series goes on and especially after Kei meets Haruki Kei’s personality starts to gradually change becoming more understanding of others and their situations and more importantly learning to place more trust in his friends and allies as well. As a character, I thought that Kei was a pretty well-designed character that showed that despite his young age that good planning and strategy combined with good analytic and deduction skills can easily frustrate opponents that have larger numbers of assets at their command. Watching Kei direct his friends in demolishing the enemies plans that he gleaned using his skills was a joy to see. I thought that Kaito Ishikawa really did an excellent job portraying the character of Kei.Sumire SoumaSumire Souma voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuuki is one of the main characters of the show and can be considered the second main female lead after Haruki. A old school friend of both Kei and Haruki when they were still in middle school Souma was the one that ultimately started the friendship between the two and with that create the foundation that will create the strong bond that both of them share as the series progresses. In the beginning of the series Souma behaved very much like a childhood friend of Kei’s and looked rather normal which I believe was part of her character design as one would never assume that such a girl would become so important to the overall plot.Personality wise Sumire is a positive and cheerful girl that at the same time is also rather bold and brave at times. Her relationship with Kei in the beginning of the series did seem to be rather close which she uses to her advantage by teasing him often and being mischievous around him.  However even at this point Sumire’s mysterious nature is still prevalent and forms a part of her personality that only adds to her mystique. Like Kei Sumire as an inhabitant of Sakurada knows of the existence of abilities within the town.Unlike Kei and Haruki Sumire herself is a character that’s tied in rather closely to the overall plotline and such her character actually changes quite a bit as the series goes on due to plot related events. In the beginning of the series Sumire while retaining her positive, cheerful and mischievous and teasing nature also retains a level of mystery about her that indicated that she was anything but a normal character.  As the overall plot progresses and events happen that bring grief to Kei and Haruki Sumire’s nature gradually changes. While still retaining her initial personality traits Sumire becomes smarter and more adept at thinking ahead which is helped greatly by her ability. At the same time Sumire also becomes somewhat manipulative though in this she always puts the interests of Kei first and foremost. While Sumire for the most part is allied with Kei and co her true goals and objectives in the plot are as mysterious as she is which makes seeing what decisions she makes in the plot even more interesting.  As a character, I felt that Sumire was a pretty well-designed character that made great use of her mysterious nature, fluid personality and her abilities to both keep Kei and the bureau guessing her intents while at the same time helping those that are dear to her while not being obvious with her true aims. I felt that this character was not someone that can easily be played but I felt that her seiyuu Aoi Yuuki really did an excellent job portraying her despite the challenge of this role.Misora HarukiMisora Haruki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Mahouka Koko no Rettosei and Psycho Pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main female lead of the series. A teenage girl that lives in the town of Sakurada Misora is initially a fellow student of both Kei and Sumire though they were actually in different classes. The three of them met as a result of the machinations of Sumire as part of her plan. In the beginning of the series Misora was someone that was somewhat of an outcast within the school as a result of her quiet nature and because she seemed to prefer solitude than anything else. In the beginning of the series it can be seen that Misora had a rather limited personality in her which made trying to converse with her difficult for both Kei and Sumire. At this point in time it can be seen that Misora is a quiet, reserved but at the same time perceptive person traits of which allow her to live life well enough until she met Kei.As the series progresses and as her relationship with Kei improves Misora’s personality and attitude begins to gradually change. While still retaining her core personality traits Misora gradually starts to open up to Kei first then to their increasing number of allies. The gradual evolution of Misora’s personality is actually part of the overall plot of the series and I felt that this aspect was done particularly well. As the series progresses Misora gradually becomes more confidant in herself and gradually starts to break out of the shell that she herself created to protect her. This is best seen in her talks with Nono. And indeed, by the latter half of the series Misora’s personality had changed so much that she was almost a different person that she was before.  Although Misora and Kei did not have the best of first encounters their relationship gradually improves over the series and more so after they were paired together for their work with the service club.In terms of relationships the relationship between Kei and Misora can also be considered to be one of the main points of the overall plot. In the beginning of the series after they met each other their relationship can be seen to be similar to that of a teacher and a student as at this point in time Haruki was still learning what a personality is and how it will benefit her. This gradually evolves as the series goes on as the two become friends and partners. Though they met in the most unusual of circumstances I felt that the relationship between Kei and Misora was done pretty well and linking the personality changes with the developing bond between the two of them was a smart move. Apart from her bond with Kei what sets Misora apart from others is her ability itself which I found to be rather unique and one that I felt suited Misora a great deal due to her nature. As a character, I felt that Misora was a really interesting character that was well designed and seeing her gradually start to develop her own personality while bonding with Kei and his allies was something that held my attention on this show. I felt that Kana Hanazawa really did a great job portraying the character of Misora.Seika NonooSeika Nonoo voiced by veteran seiyuu Sachika Misawa of Accel world and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kei and Misora’s main allies. A fellow student of Misora and Kei Seika is a quiet, well-mannered and kind and caring girl that seems to have a love for animals. In terms of personality Seika is very similar to Misora in that both are quiet and have trouble expressing their opinions of things. However unlike Misora Seika actually has her own unique personality and things that she likes and dislikes. While the series itself had a large number of abilities that were unique in their own right each of these abilities was paired with the personality of that person in question. In the case of Seika her affinity with cats was related to her powers and I felt this was a pretty good combo as it allowed her to use her beloved pets to help and aid her when needed.  Her ability in question was something that I felt was well suited to her. Though Seika and Kei met several times and can be considered to be acquaintances her relationship with Misora is perhaps the one that was the most important to the plot. While both Seika and Misora are quiet by nature it was interesting to see both learn from each other and bond over this shared trait of theirs. Watching Misora make her first friend with Seika I felt was a nice thing and did well to develop Misora’s personality.EriEri Oka voiced by veteran seiyuu Yuuka Aisaka of Ange Vierge and Active Raid fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kei’s opponents/ally. A old acquaintance of Kei’s that he seems to have known when he was in middle school Eri is someone that Kei has a rather complicated relationship with though in no fault to his own. Personality wise Eri is a smart, fast thinking and cunning girl who’s not above using deception to achieve her goals. However, it is in her relationship with Kei that Eri’s more unique personality traits come out. Eri’s personality when she deals with Kei can be best described as that of a Tsundere.  This personality trait of hers I felt was actually pretty cute since she always ends up helping Kei in some way or form.  In fact, I find Eri’s constant attempts to act as Kei’s nemesis and be evil to be more amusing than ever. Of particular note to Eri’s character is her name which when said in full actually means welcome back which I thought was appropriate for her character.MasamuneMasamune Urachi voiced by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Bungou Stray dogs and Buddy Complex fame is one of the main support characters of the series and serves as the main villain of the series. A high-level member of the Bureau Masamune true to his role and rank is a calm, composed and intelligent person that’s also devious as well. Masamune’s most prominent trait is twofold firstly it’s his careful nature in which he will evaluate a given situation thoroughly before committing to any action and secondly his habit of recording every last bit of detail in his trusted notebook.  These two traits combined with is other personality traits make Masamune a tough opponent for Kei and Haruki and one that tests their intelligence to the limit.However what sets Masamune both as a great villain and makes him such a threat to the story and its characters is his motivation and what caused him to have such an extreme view. As a member of the bureau Masamune knows that the town has many people that has access to many different kinds of abilities but should these abilities really exist in the first place. Should man not strive to achieve what they want by their own efforts by themselves. These are questions that truly define the type of character that Masamune is as they help define his reasoning and the ideology that caused it and help in understanding why he is that dangerous. As a character, I felt that Masamune himself was a pretty well-designed character as in addition to having all of the assets that someone of his rank is entitled to call upon he also has something that a lot of villains in other animes lack which is conviction and a good origin story that created such a conviction in the first place. As someone that works with ability users as part of their duties Masamune’s views which ultimately resulted in the creation of his ultimate plan was really surprising and even more so after looking at his backstory. As a villain, I felt that Masamune really did a great job in his intended role as he was as a result of his intelligence, personality traits and abilities was able to frustrate and surprise Kei and his allies on a regular basis and seeing them clash over their opposite views in a discussion rather than in a brawl was a welcome sight.Arts and animationThe character designs for the characters that appear in this series I felt was pretty well done and designed with my favorites being Haruki, Nono and Eri and Souma.  The uniform designs for the characters I felt were also pretty well done. The animation for the ability effects was also well done with the dream world created by Honoka being especially interesting.MusicThe anime as one that has a whole season makes use of two opening and ending themes. The first opening is Reset which is sung by Yui Makino and conveys a welcoming feeling to the town helped by the visuals that show each of the main and support characters. The ending theme for the first half of the season is Tonari Au sung by the Oral Cigarettes. The second opening theme that plays from ep13 and the start of the second half of the season is Dakara Boku Wo Tebanasu sung by Weaver. This opening helped convey a sense of revelation and truth to me.  The scene music for the series I felt was really good with a pretty large variation of instruments and music used to convey the different types of emotions and situations that each scene conveyed.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series I felt was strong with particular praise going to Kana Hanazawa who voiced Misora and Aoi Yuki who voiced Sumire Souma. Both I felt were able to convey to the audience the many changes and emotions that their characters experienced on the show as their characters were developed and improved upon as the show went on. Kana I felt had a much harder job since the initial stage of her character was very quiet and very different to the character that we see in the end but im glad to see that she could portray the character of Misora successfully. The show also had a number of support characters that I felt also did a great job despite their roles not being important with the best examples being Maaya Uchida who voiced the character of Honoka, Rikako Aida who voiced the character of Sera and Kana Uetake who voiced the character of Sakuin.Overall conclusionIn overall Sakurada Reset’s strong points that made it stand out to me was its strong story, interesting premise, complex characters, excellent voice acting and its unique take on abilities. The insight into human emotion and the relationships between characters was I felt another of its strongpoints. Story wise I liked the contrast between the two halves of the series as they were quite different but yet linked rather well with the series overall plot. In the first half, the story focused on the club activities of the two main leads Misora and Kei and I liked the fact that in this first half in addition to seeing how each case played out we also get to see how they develop their friendship and bond. Each of the cases that was featured here I felt was pretty interesting and evoked a number of emotions in me when I saw them. The fact that each of the methods that were used to solve these cases was focused on negotiation and observation rather than rash action which is used in other animes was also refreshing and matched well with the atmosphere of this series. The second half of the series I felt was very different to the first as it was more focused on specific events and saw a lot of revelations and surprises both for the story and for individual characters as the main enemy plot was revealed.  The teamwork that the main characters exhibit with others was also something that I felt was done nicely and seeing them combine their abilities for Kei’s plans was fun to see.  The characters that were in the series I felt were also pretty well designed and pretty complex with each having interesting backstories and motivations especially the main villain Masamune and the character of Sumire Souma. The unique take on the abilities that serves as one of the shows main premises I felt was interesting and it was nice to see abilities that are neither flashy or destructive but yet still are different enough to define them as abilities. Seeing the main cast use this to change the world and stop the main villain was really entertaining. While I do agree that the story can be hard to follow by some due to the amount of twists and revelations it’s not as hard to follow as some others animes I seen. In the end while the views of both sides were both interesting I felt that I agreed more with what Kei and his allies were fighting for which is another good point for this series in that the reasons themselves were also good.In terms of score I would give it a 9/10 due to its unique premise, excellent story, well-designed characters and a unique take on abilities plus its focus on human emotion. both western influence and a need to make an anime stand out power based animes tend to feature either heavy combat or feature powers that are flashy to look at. Because of this it’s a popular misconception among anime fans and general viewers that superpowers or in this case abilities are always flashy and powerful and has the potential to strike a guy a mile away.

The fusion of a traditional powers anime with human drama and mystery is also something that I quite liked about the premise and one that was rather unusual as well.Now that the premise is done let’s move onThe overall story for Sakurada Reset follows the lives of Kei Asai and Misora Haruki two teenagers that live in the town of Sakurada that met each other on the prompting of Kei’s old school friend Sumire Souma. The two of them because of living in the town of Sakurada the town where ability users live are both ability users and each have powerful abilities that help complement each other.

As the series goes on and they encounter more characters and events Kei and his friends and allies soon discover that their involvement with the bureau will link them to much larger events that had in its roots in the towns mysterious past that can also affect the lives of everyone in the present.  Common with most modern anime Sakurada Reset features a number of plot lines that are bundled into the overall plot as story arcs each of I felt was unique.KeiKei Asai played by veteran voice actor Kaito Ishikawa of Owari no seraph and Occultic Nine fame is one of the main characters of the show and serves as the main protagonist of the show. A teenage boy that lives in the town of Sakurada Kei is a somewhat normal looking guy from initial appearances but beneath his somewhat mundane appearance Kei’s personality is what defines him and allows him to be effective at countering the enemy. Personality wise Kei is a level headed, kind and caring person and as a result can understand the views of others quite easily which I felt was important for his job with the service club.  At the same time Kei, due to his level-headed nature is able to easily get to the heart of a problem by understanding the crucial parts of an event and come up with a means to solve it showing that he also has impressive deduction and analytic skills as well. However, while agreeable and pleasant to talk to when Kei is in his normal mode Kei has shown to have a more devious and cunning side to him when creating plans to deal with his opponents. In this state Kei while still bring his trademark cautiousness to the table is also willing to place himself and his friends at risk so as to allow his plan a higher chance to succeed.However, Kei’s most prominent skills that allow him to stand against powers greater than him in the overall plot is undoubtedly his intelligence and his skill at strategy both of which allowed Kei and his friends to outsmart the series main enemy faction the bureau on multiple occasions. Although still a teenager by all accounts Kei has shown himself to very adept at strategy especially with regards to both anticipating the enemy’s moves and outsmarting them by moving events in motion before the enemy does which I found to be pretty amazing considering his opponents in the story are all adults. When combined with Kei’s unique ability as a character Kei is someone that can be seen to be a cunning and devious opponent for the bureau that while still impressive in his own right is more so when he’s working with allies that agree with his plans and aims.As the series goes on Kei’s personality changes a great deal as a result of both meeting the series main female leads and his interaction with a number of different characters that reside in the town. In the beginning of the series Kei while still having his trademark calmness was rather quiet in the beginning and rather indifferent to the plight of others that meant that he at this time only had a small circle of friends. However, as the series goes on and especially after Kei meets Haruki Kei’s personality starts to gradually change becoming more understanding of others and their situations and more importantly learning to place more trust in his friends and allies as well. As a character, I thought that Kei was a pretty well-designed character that showed that despite his young age that good planning and strategy combined with good analytic and deduction skills can easily frustrate opponents that have larger numbers of assets at their command. Watching Kei direct his friends in demolishing the enemies plans that he gleaned using his skills was a joy to see. I thought that Kaito Ishikawa really did an excellent job portraying the character of Kei.Sumire SoumaSumire Souma voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Aoi Yuuki is one of the main characters of the show and can be considered the second main female lead after Haruki. A old school friend of both Kei and Haruki when they were still in middle school Souma was the one that ultimately started the friendship between the two and with that create the foundation that will create the strong bond that both of them share as the series progresses. In the beginning of the series Souma behaved very much like a childhood friend of Kei’s and looked rather normal which I believe was part of her character design as one would never assume that such a girl would become so important to the overall plot.Personality wise Sumire is a positive and cheerful girl that at the same time is also rather bold and brave at times. Her relationship with Kei in the beginning of the series did seem to be rather close which she uses to her advantage by teasing him often and being mischievous around him.  However even at this point Sumire’s mysterious nature is still prevalent and forms a part of her personality that only adds to her mystique. Like Kei Sumire as an inhabitant of Sakurada knows of the existence of abilities within the town.Unlike Kei and Haruki Sumire herself is a character that’s tied in rather closely to the overall plotline and such her character actually changes quite a bit as the series goes on due to plot related events. In the beginning of the series Sumire while retaining her positive, cheerful and mischievous and teasing nature also retains a level of mystery about her that indicated that she was anything but a normal character.  As the overall plot progresses and events happen that bring grief to Kei and Haruki Sumire’s nature gradually changes. While still retaining her initial personality traits Sumire becomes smarter and more adept at thinking ahead which is helped greatly by her ability. At the same time Sumire also becomes somewhat manipulative though in this she always puts the interests of Kei first and foremost. While Sumire for the most part is allied with Kei and co her true goals and objectives in the plot are as mysterious as she is which makes seeing what decisions she makes in the plot even more interesting.  As a character, I felt that Sumire was a pretty well-designed character that made great use of her mysterious nature, fluid personality and her abilities to both keep Kei and the bureau guessing her intents while at the same time helping those that are dear to her while not being obvious with her true aims. I felt that this character was not someone that can easily be played but I felt that her seiyuu Aoi Yuuki really did an excellent job portraying her despite the challenge of this role.Misora HarukiMisora Haruki voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Mahouka Koko no Rettosei and Psycho Pass fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main female lead of the series. A teenage girl that lives in the town of Sakurada Misora is initially a fellow student of both Kei and Sumire though they were actually in different classes. The three of them met as a result of the machinations of Sumire as part of her plan. In the beginning of the series Misora was someone that was somewhat of an outcast within the school as a result of her quiet nature and because she seemed to prefer solitude than anything else. In the beginning of the series it can be seen that Misora had a rather limited personality in her which made trying to converse with her difficult for both Kei and Sumire. At this point in time it can be seen that Misora is a quiet, reserved but at the same time perceptive person traits of which allow her to live life well enough until she met Kei.As the series progresses and as her relationship with Kei improves Misora’s personality and attitude begins to gradually change. While still retaining her core personality traits Misora gradually starts to open up to Kei first then to their increasing number of allies. The gradual evolution of Misora’s personality is actually part of the overall plot of the series and I felt that this aspect was done particularly well. As the series progresses Misora gradually becomes more confidant in herself and gradually starts to break out of the shell that she herself created to protect her. This is best seen in her talks with Nono. And indeed, by the latter half of the series Misora’s personality had changed so much that she was almost a different person that she was before.  Although Misora and Kei did not have the best of first encounters their relationship gradually improves over the series and more so after they were paired together for their work with the service club.In terms of relationships the relationship between Kei and Misora can also be considered to be one of the main points of the overall plot. In the beginning of the series after they met each other their relationship can be seen to be similar to that of a teacher and a student as at this point in time Haruki was still learning what a personality is and how it will benefit her. This gradually evolves as the series goes on as the two become friends and partners. Though they met in the most unusual of circumstances I felt that the relationship between Kei and Misora was done pretty well and linking the personality changes with the developing bond between the two of them was a smart move. Apart from her bond with Kei what sets Misora apart from others is her ability itself which I found to be rather unique and one that I felt suited Misora a great deal due to her nature. As a character, I felt that Misora was a really interesting character that was well designed and seeing her gradually start to develop her own personality while bonding with Kei and his allies was something that held my attention on this show. I felt that Kana Hanazawa really did a great job portraying the character of Misora.Seika NonooSeika Nonoo voiced by veteran seiyuu Sachika Misawa of Accel world and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kei and Misora’s main allies. A fellow student of Misora and Kei Seika is a quiet, well-mannered and kind and caring girl that seems to have a love for animals. In terms of personality Seika is very similar to Misora in that both are quiet and have trouble expressing their opinions of things. However unlike Misora Seika actually has her own unique personality and things that she likes and dislikes. While the series itself had a large number of abilities that were unique in their own right each of these abilities was paired with the personality of that person in question. In the case of Seika her affinity with cats was related to her powers and I felt this was a pretty good combo as it allowed her to use her beloved pets to help and aid her when needed.  Her ability in question was something that I felt was well suited to her. Though Seika and Kei met several times and can be considered to be acquaintances her relationship with Misora is perhaps the one that was the most important to the plot. While both Seika and Misora are quiet by nature it was interesting to see both learn from each other and bond over this shared trait of theirs. Watching Misora make her first friend with Seika I felt was a nice thing and did well to develop Misora’s personality.EriEri Oka voiced by veteran seiyuu Yuuka Aisaka of Ange Vierge and Active Raid fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of Kei’s opponents/ally. A old acquaintance of Kei’s that he seems to have known when he was in middle school Eri is someone that Kei has a rather complicated relationship with though in no fault to his own. Personality wise Eri is a smart, fast thinking and cunning girl who’s not above using deception to achieve her goals. However, it is in her relationship with Kei that Eri’s more unique personality traits come out. Eri’s personality when she deals with Kei can be best described as that of a Tsundere.  This personality trait of hers I felt was actually pretty cute since she always ends up helping Kei in some way or form.  In fact, I find Eri’s constant attempts to act as Kei’s nemesis and be evil to be more amusing than ever. Of particular note to Eri’s character is her name which when said in full actually means welcome back which I thought was appropriate for her character.MasamuneMasamune Urachi voiced by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Bungou Stray dogs and Buddy Complex fame is one of the main support characters of the series and serves as the main villain of the series. A high-level member of the Bureau Masamune true to his role and rank is a calm, composed and intelligent person that’s also devious as well. Masamune’s most prominent trait is twofold firstly it’s his careful nature in which he will evaluate a given situation thoroughly before committing to any action and secondly his habit of recording every last bit of detail in his trusted notebook.  These two traits combined with is other personality traits make Masamune a tough opponent for Kei and Haruki and one that tests their intelligence to the limit.However what sets Masamune both as a great villain and makes him such a threat to the story and its characters is his motivation and what caused him to have such an extreme view. As a member of the bureau Masamune knows that the town has many people that has access to many different kinds of abilities but should these abilities really exist in the first place. Should man not strive to achieve what they want by their own efforts by themselves. These are questions that truly define the type of character that Masamune is as they help define his reasoning and the ideology that caused it and help in understanding why he is that dangerous. As a character, I felt that Masamune himself was a pretty well-designed character as in addition to having all of the assets that someone of his rank is entitled to call upon he also has something that a lot of villains in other animes lack which is conviction and a good origin story that created such a conviction in the first place. As someone that works with ability users as part of their duties Masamune’s views which ultimately resulted in the creation of his ultimate plan was really surprising and even more so after looking at his backstory. As a villain, I felt that Masamune really did a great job in his intended role as he was as a result of his intelligence, personality traits and abilities was able to frustrate and surprise Kei and his allies on a regular basis and seeing them clash over their opposite views in a discussion rather than in a brawl was a welcome sight.Arts and animationThe character designs for the characters that appear in this series I felt was pretty well done and designed with my favorites being Haruki, Nono and Eri and Souma.  The uniform designs for the characters I felt were also pretty well done. The animation for the ability effects was also well done with the dream world created by Honoka being especially interesting.MusicThe anime as one that has a whole season makes use of two opening and ending themes. The first opening is Reset which is sung by Yui Makino and conveys a welcoming feeling to the town helped by the visuals that show each of the main and support characters. The ending theme for the first half of the season is Tonari Au sung by the Oral Cigarettes. The second opening theme that plays from ep13 and the start of the second half of the season is Dakara Boku Wo Tebanasu sung by Weaver. This opening helped convey a sense of revelation and truth to me.  The scene music for the series I felt was really good with a pretty large variation of instruments and music used to convey the different types of emotions and situations that each scene conveyed.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series I felt was strong with particular praise going to Kana Hanazawa who voiced Misora and Aoi Yuki who voiced Sumire Souma. Both I felt were able to convey to the audience the many changes and emotions that their characters experienced on the show as their characters were developed and improved upon as the show went on. Kana I felt had a much harder job since the initial stage of her character was very quiet and very different to the character that we see in the end but im glad to see that she could portray the character of Misora successfully. The show also had a number of support characters that I felt also did a great job despite their roles not being important with the best examples being Maaya Uchida who voiced the character of Honoka, Rikako Aida who voiced the character of Sera and Kana Uetake who voiced the character of Sakuin.Overall conclusionIn overall Sakurada Reset’s strong points that made it stand out to me was its strong story, interesting premise, complex characters, excellent voice acting and its unique take on abilities. The insight into human emotion and the relationships between characters was I felt another of its strongpoints. Story wise I liked the contrast between the two halves of the series as they were quite different but yet linked rather well with the series overall plot. In the first half, the story focused on the club activities of the two main leads Misora and Kei and I liked the fact that in this first half in addition to seeing how each case played out we also get to see how they develop their friendship and bond. Each of the cases that was featured here I felt was pretty interesting and evoked a number of emotions in me when I saw them. The fact that each of the methods that were used to solve these cases was focused on negotiation and observation rather than rash action which is used in other animes was also refreshing and matched well with the atmosphere of this series. The second half of the series I felt was very different to the first as it was more focused on specific events and saw a lot of revelations and surprises both for the story and for individual characters as the main enemy plot was revealed.  The teamwork that the main characters exhibit with others was also something that I felt was done nicely and seeing them combine their abilities for Kei’s plans was fun to see.  The characters that were in the series I felt were also pretty well designed and pretty complex with each having interesting backstories and motivations especially the main villain Masamune and the character of Sumire Souma. The unique take on the abilities that serves as one of the shows main premises I felt was interesting and it was nice to see abilities that are neither flashy or destructive but yet still are different enough to define them as abilities. Seeing the main cast use this to change the world and stop the main villain was really entertaining. While I do agree that the story can be hard to follow by some due to the amount of twists and revelations it’s not as hard to follow as some others animes I seen. In the end while the views of both sides were both interesting I felt that I agreed more with what Kei and his allies were fighting for which is another good point for this series in that the reasons themselves were also good.In terms of score I would give it a 9/10 due to its unique premise, excellent story, well-designed characters and a unique take on abilities plus its focus on human emotion.', ""To begin with, this show is, well, it is not for the average watcher who expects pew pew boom boom kind of action. I, myself, loved the show, but it is because I understood everything that was said and done in it. For other people, it was a hard time understanding it, thus such a low score on MAL. You need some brain to keep up with the show.The story is very well-knit. I have to admit, it's been a while since I've watched a show that is this well-written. For me, it was a very good time because at times, I even foreseen what...some things meant, which gave me an easy time watching. The show very well follows the principle of progression and you have to admit that by the mid-end there is some intense action that keeps you interested and curious to see the ending soon, because you can feel the tension and atmosphere of it coming to an end. Story development, culmination etc. is well done.Art: Well, if I'm being honest, I'm watching D.Gray-man and Sakurada Reset at the same time. Since I finished Sakurada Reset, I watch D.Gray-man. To compare both, Sakurada Reset looks way better and well-drawn, executed, than the opposite is, and D.Gray-man is an action anime, so you can pretty much worry about art the least.Sound: Okay, this is the part where I want to cry, because the anime so well got me interested and intrigued that I couldn't even really take a notice onto the music. It was there, but it went straight to my emotions instead of my brain, so I'm literally just listening to the music after watching the anime. That means it is definitely not lacking.Character: Now character development is something that I liked. Yes, change on supporting characters wasn't the main objective, but I really liked the development in Haruki, Kei and even Soma. Even some supporting characters can be seen changing. Despite even the character development, you could see visual development in general, which is also great.Enjoyment: Overall, I'm giving this a 10 just because I enjoyed it to its fullest. The characters were relatable, I really loved their behaviour. I couldn't help but notice the differences between them, and despite Kei and Haruki, I especially liked Soma. Her speech manner is rather lazy, or relaxed, as if she knew everything, but at the same time everytime she talked, it's as she is absolutely sad, despite being bright. And at times, she talks the same way again, as if being lazy, but that speech feels as of someone's who has seen a thousand years of experience, of life, of everything. When she speaks to Kei, it seems as if they're both some kind of higher beings, but Soma is someone who knows more, knows better, knows right and in a way, leads Kei's way, lectures him, when they casually discuss some things over. That is where I see the issue, that even the strong ones need help.Enjoy the show, make sure you don't have any misunderstandings, and don't listen to those who tell it's a bad anime. Do not mistake a bad anime to a something that you don't like, it is rude and incompetent. some things meant, which gave me an easy time watching.

This anime delivers a deep, nuanced plot that takes time to fully grasp and comprehend, but which makes it much easier to appreciate the nuances it includes. It appears incredibly elitist to claim that this anime is only really for those ""with brainpower"", as many others have said before me, but Sakurada Reset truly is a more thought-provoking anime than most.The story is, for the most part, well presented, almost like a mystery as various elements are gradually presented, each with their own importance. Many details that may seem trivial or irrelevant often...are revealed to have a deeper significance: the show does an amazing job at subtle foreshadowing, sometimes far in advance of when it is eventually used.On the other hand, the art could need some improvement. There is little animation within scenes, resulting in a decent amount of time passing without any significant change, and characters may somewhat awkwardly hold their poses for unreasonable lengths of time. Even so, the drawing is clean, and nicely captures the environment of Sakurada.With regards to sound, Sakurada Reset does a great job on its soundtrack. It manages to perfectly capture the ambience of each moment, which amplified the enjoyment I was able to get out of it. The OPs and EDs also include some pretty good music, which are composed in a way that doubles down on the themes seen in the anime.A criticism I\'ve seen a decent number of times is that the characters are like ""robots"", without emotions. This claim has its merits, but it doesn\'t tell the whole story. There are people, in real life, who do tend to approach things calmly and rationally; these characters can simply be seen to be the same, and can keep their cool, unlike the characters of many other anime, even under pressure.In the end, for me Sakurada Reset was a quite enjoyable anime, as the depth of the story and its excellent presentation more than made up for the flaws in art and character expression. I hope you, as a watcher, will be able to look past some of the surface flaws to discover the rich world within. are revealed to have a deeper significance: the show does an amazing job at subtle foreshadowing, sometimes far in advance of when it is eventually used.On the other hand, the art could need some improvement.

I found every episode to be much more enjoyable than the last, even the first few episodes that others have claimed to be slow. The way the story brought everything together was so interesting. It did not leave anything out, and carefully explained every detail til the end of the final episode. Nothing ever felt boring to me, even the discussion between Nono and Haruki (pointless yet pleasant, as they've...said in the episode).The characters was the best element of the show to me. They were very realistic, each with their own ideals and emotions. Kei, the main male character, was such an awesome character. He is so unpredictable, and will do just about anything to prove a point or achieve his goals (like in episode 4, that was just brutal). Haruki and Soma, the two main female characters, were both great too, but I don't think my explanation is good enough to do them justice. Also, Haruki is best girl, sorry Soma!The music were all amazing, but the ending by Oral Cigarettes tops everything (I started checking them out because of this, and they are my favorite band now).Hopefully the score for Sakurada Reset will get much higher, and I hope those who dropped this will give it a go again.

On top of that, out of the people who have started the show, over 25% have dropped it. However, in my opinion, and to my surprise, this turned out to be one of the best written stories of this year.---***REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*** This is more about outlining why I enjoyed this show despite its unpopularity and high drop rate.---One of the things I liked most about the series was the way the story progressed. In the beginning, the characters are rather closed-off and almost...seemed dull. Much of the communication between characters is done through riddles, thought experiments, or metaphorical stories. Over 1/4 of viewers quit watching the show just because the characters were ""boring and emotionless."" However, as Ive said before, the characters were intentionally made this way, and in that respect they are very well written. The characters at first seem to be static, but in the second half, they turn out to be dynamic characters with internal changeHaruki is a very timid and unambitious girl with zero self confidence. She lives strictly by her own set of rules, but she also has a high dependency upon others. However, in the second half, she slowly realizes her own desires and preferences; and eventually, she is able to act on her own accord. Haruki also begins to feel resentment and jealousy towards Soma, sensing her as a threat of being replaced as Kei\'s partner.Kei is a very level-headed character who is able to develop a plan for any situation. Soma, having the ability of clairvoyance, is naturally several steps ahead of Kei\'s plans and uses him; however, she also depends on Kei in her shortcomings. Kei and Soma are very similar characters in that they both act out of selfishness, but their selfish desires also coincide with the interests of the people who are dear to them. Kei does everything in his power to stop Urachi from erasing abilities from Sakurada for selfish reasons; however, he also wants to rescue Soma from her internal conflicts. Soma goes as far as killing herself and using Kei for her plans to selfishly escape her fate of being captured by the Bureau and becoming the second Witch; however, at the same time she chooses her actions with the desire to fulfill Kei\'s happiness. Soma is deeply conflicted because she wants to be the one that Kei loves; but she knows he will choose Haruki, not her. In the very beginning of the show, Soma brings Kei and Haruki together for the sake of both her plans and Kei\'s happiness, knowing that it will ultimately damage their relationship. Soma acts for Kei\'s happiness even though it pains her.---Another aspect of this series that is really well-done is the use of abilities. This isnt just some shounen anime that shows off flashy supernatural powers; and it isnt a repeat of Charlotte\'s trainwreck. The series is good at defining both what the ability can do, and what limitations the ability has. The show also focuses on how different abilities can be used together in complex ways to achieve the characters\' goals.Right up front, we are told Haruki\'s Reset ability has 3 limits: she can only Save once every 24 hrs; and that save only lasts for 72 hours; and like everyone else, she loses memories after a reset. However, with Kei\'s Perfect Memory ability, together they are able to circumvent Haruki\'s memory loss flaw and effectively change the past. Kei instructs Haruki to Save immediately before a pivotal point in time; then he uses the next 72 hours to discover the events that happen; then instructs Haruki to Reset before the Save expires, so he can change the past. Because Haruki can only Save once every 24 hours, Kei only has one chance to change what happens in the first day after a Reset; however he effectively has 3 chances to change the events that happened in the final 24 hours of the 72 hour window.Urachi\'s ability first seems like it can only remove people\'s memories; however, he actually has the ability to turn back the time for one specific object. He uses his ability to frequently turn back the time for his own mind, thus intentionally losing memories. This can be used to circumvent Sakuin\'s lie detection and Soma\'s clairvoyance, which depends on conversation. Kagaya\'s ability first seems like it can only be used to lock/seal doors; however his ability permanently seals objects in space and time, and can be used to petrify people, or freeze the exact current condition of an object. Object that are sealed with Kagaya\'s hand do not change even after a Reset. Therefore, Urachi uses Kagaya\'s ability to seal notebooks that contain his memories; that way he can later remember the things he intentionally forgot.There are also a couple occasions where several abilities are used together to accomplish a goal. There were 5-6 (i forget) people and abilities involved in reviving Soma. Another number of abilities were used together to bluff the Bureau and kidnap Urachi. And these are just a few examples. In fact, there aren\'t many instances where only one ability alone is used to do something significant. The well-defined structure of abilities and the ways abilities are used are what makes the supernatual aspect of the story interesting. seemed dull. Much of the communication between characters is done through riddles, thought experiments, or metaphorical stories. Over 1/4 of viewers quit watching the show just because the characters were ""boring and emotionless."" However, as Ive said before, the characters were intentionally made this way, and in that respect they are very well written. The characters at first seem to be static, but in the second half, they turn out to be dynamic characters with internal changeHaruki is a very timid and unambitious girl with zero self confidence. She lives strictly by her own set of rules, but she also has a high dependency upon others. However, in the second half, she slowly realizes her own desires and preferences; and eventually, she is able to act on her own accord. Haruki also begins to feel resentment and jealousy towards Soma, sensing her as a threat of being replaced as Kei\'s partner.Kei is a very level-headed character who is able to develop a plan for any situation. Soma, having the ability of clairvoyance, is naturally several steps ahead of Kei\'s plans and uses him; however, she also depends on Kei in her shortcomings. Kei and Soma are very similar characters in that they both act out of selfishness, but their selfish desires also coincide with the interests of the people who are dear to them. Kei does everything in his power to stop Urachi from erasing abilities from Sakurada for selfish reasons; however, he also wants to rescue Soma from her internal conflicts. Soma goes as far as killing herself and using Kei for her plans to selfishly escape her fate of being captured by the Bureau and becoming the second Witch; however, at the same time she chooses her actions with the desire to fulfill Kei\'s happiness. Soma is deeply conflicted because she wants to be the one that Kei loves; but she knows he will choose Haruki, not her. In the very beginning of the show, Soma brings Kei and Haruki together for the sake of both her plans and Kei\'s happiness, knowing that it will ultimately damage their relationship. Soma acts for Kei\'s happiness even though it pains her.---Another aspect of this series that is really well-done is the use of abilities. This isnt just some shounen anime that shows off flashy supernatural powers; and it isnt a repeat of Charlotte\'s trainwreck. The series is good at defining both what the ability can do, and what limitations the ability has. The show also focuses on how different abilities can be used together in complex ways to achieve the characters\' goals.Right up front, we are told Haruki\'s Reset ability has 3 limits: she can only Save once every 24 hrs; and that save only lasts for 72 hours; and like everyone else, she loses memories after a reset. However, with Kei\'s Perfect Memory ability, together they are able to circumvent Haruki\'s memory loss flaw and effectively change the past. Kei instructs Haruki to Save immediately before a pivotal point in time; then he uses the next 72 hours to discover the events that happen; then instructs Haruki to Reset before the Save expires, so he can change the past. Because Haruki can only Save once every 24 hours, Kei only has one chance to change what happens in the first day after a Reset; however he effectively has 3 chances to change the events that happened in the final 24 hours of the 72 hour window.Urachi\'s ability first seems like it can only remove people\'s memories; however, he actually has the ability to turn back the time for one specific object. He uses his ability to frequently turn back the time for his own mind, thus intentionally losing memories. This can be used to circumvent Sakuin\'s lie detection and Soma\'s clairvoyance, which depends on conversation. Kagaya\'s ability first seems like it can only be used to lock/seal doors; however his ability permanently seals objects in space and time, and can be used to petrify people, or freeze the exact current condition of an object. Object that are sealed with Kagaya\'s hand do not change even after a Reset. Therefore, Urachi uses Kagaya\'s ability to seal notebooks that contain his memories; that way he can later remember the things he intentionally forgot.There are also a couple occasions where several abilities are used together to accomplish a goal.

The well-defined structure of abilities and the ways abilities are used are what makes the supernatual aspect of the story interesting.', 'This is probably one of the most boring anime I have ever sat through.The plot is almost completely told through dialogue, with characters doing little but sitting and conversing, making me wonder what the point is of even having animation. The plot jumps all over the place, making it hard to follow as well. The characters are flat and unrealistic and respond to things that would be shocking with almost no feeling at all. The art style is not bad, but a majority of the animation includes little to no movement or action. Overall, this anime is very slow and I would recommend it...to people with a patience for lengthy and sluggish storytelling. to people with a patience for lengthy and sluggish storytelling.', ""This anime is a book of poetry. You will not find any brawls here, and there are no special effects for powers. They're usually very powerful though. The atmosphere is peaceful. Overall, this is more for a mature audience in general. You won't see fan service and it's best not to expect any.The biggest reason I'm writing this review is just to tell people to go to Reddit after each episode so that they can read the comments to understand important details in each of the episodes.I hear that it is all slow until episode 6, but it's definitely all worth it if...you're looking forward to the story and if you like the poetry behind the thinking experiments.I personally did not mind the pacing at all, and was just a very curious individual that really couldn't wait to see the story unfold. It also made me feel somewhat smart for keeping up with the episodes, but at the same time dumb, since I can't understand everything they're talking about on my own. But again, that's what Reddit's for.So I write this review as an individual who feels this is in the best interest of normal people who just want a good thinking anime. Think of it like those book gatherings: After reading a book, you meet up with friends that read the book and converse among yourselves about all the things the book had to give, and end up appreciating the book more.Story: 10I've never seen an anime made this way. It feels like every episode was necessary in completing the story it was trying to tell. I would like to think the main catch of the anime is the thinking experiments, as they tell you how they work, then they get involved in the story in some way at some point. I'm not sure what else I can tell without ending up summarizing the story tbh so I leave it at that.Art: 7I heard the anime was a budget anime, but for a budget anime, the artwork is pretty well-done. Imo it's like a polished version of Diomedea's recent anime Fuuka in terms of character design and animation. The animation is very smooth, probably because there's no super crazy fight scenes to animate. The camera angles are just right as well. I do feel this anime would get a lot more praise if it was made by SHAFT or Kyo Ani. SHAFT would be using a lot of crazy transitions while Kyo Ani could make it the way they made Hyouka.Sound: 7For the most part, the music is very simple. Everything about the anime is watered down, actually. The only things that aren't watered down are those OPs and EDs. Those have so much emotion put into them. As long as the music is fitting, I don't see a problem. But they aren't astounding either. They do their part and it does help with the atmosphere.Character: 9There's a reason Kei is the way he is. Haruki was just born the way she was. And there's a reason Souma is the way she is as well. But of course, they're not normal people either. People complain about how they're not relatable, but that's exactly what the story needs to be the story that it is. Kei doesn't want to solve things with violence, but how is a person supposed to be able to do that? Kei is a character that shows you how to be someone so intelligent, they can solve problems without violence. We have OP characters all the time, and I've seen people love the MC of Aldnoah Zero, so there's no real complaint to be made here. At the very least, Kei has more reason to be who he is than that kid. Souma is easy to take in, that's why people love her. Haruki though, not as many will like her, simply because she's like a robot. But her being born that way is definitely a human reason. There can be people like that in the world. Not impossible at all when there's over 6 billion people in the world. All the side characters get their bit of shine too. The antagonist is also pretty well done, imo. Although it's not to the death, you can think of this as a watered down version of Light and L's mind battles. But watered down means less hostile and more civil, which is a closer means to a better world.Enjoyment: 9Now this is the part where this is completely my own enjoyment. Whether you enjoy it or not is really up to you as a person. If, even after the reddit suggestion, you do not like the anime after 3 or so episodes, it's simply not for you. The enjoyment of the anime will usually be very low or very high. I cannot say if there is an inbetween, but that is what I've seen of people. Perhaps because I feel most people won't like it, the enjoyment should objectively be around 4.Overall: 8Pros:-Great Characters-Great Story-Poetic-Thinking Experiments-Solutions to conflicts without violence-Life Lessons-Great understanding of how people work (Very vocal about it)-Like reading a book-If you get through all of it and enjoy it, you're definitely an intelligent person! And I bet you're quite positive in general as well! :)-Very few, if any at all, plot holes.-Almost everything, if not everything, gets explained.Cons:-Too much talking (Of course, that's what this show is about. Keep in mind I'm basing this on audience opinion and not my own. This is ironic and that's the point. btw this is exactly how they are in the show.)-Not enough visuals to help with explanations and conversations.-It's like reading a book. People who watch anime don't usually read books as a hobby. (Though I have to say this is my perfect book)-Characters can be uninteresting to most people.-Even if the story is one of the best out there, it still has a very slow start-upAs I've somewhat mentioned before, this anime would garner much more people if it were made by Kyo Ani or SHAFT. The writing, planning, and execution of the anime were excellent in my opinion, but under objective views, the execution could've been much better. People cannot get past around 6 episodes because there's not much visual spark. I also heard the translation wasn't all too well done, but even then, it'd still be confusing for most people. Again, that is why I recommend going to Reddit after each episode to understand them better.As well, because this is such a confusing premise for a first watch, it's obvious that once you finish the show, you can rewatch it to then be able to completely understand everything. Indeed it is one of those shows you'd have to have the time for. I cannot recommend this to people with busy lives, unfortunately.This is my unbiased review of the anime. In my heart though, it is a 10/10. Please give it a watch if you'd like to see a peaceful anime that's very real in its own way, have the time on your hands, like feeling smart (you'll definitely be more enlightened by the end of it, I assure you), like to think, like poetry, and like a good story.If everybody in the world liked the anime more than not, I feel we'd definitely be living in a better world. In that sense, it's a very romantic anime.

This may sound weird at first, but as this review goes on, I hope to make it clear to why I wrote that starting sentence. There are factors that I thought the show did really well, while there were others that ruined the show for me and caused the low average score and the large drop count.The first half of the show was pretty much character introductions and build up. We learn about the town of Sakurada and the gifted people that live in it, following the lives of two high...school students. Misora Haruki is a quiet girl who has the ability to save a moment in time for 3 days and reset everything back to that certain point, causing everyone to forget what had happened after she used her ability, including herself. Kei Asai is a quick thinking problem solver who has the ability to remember everything he has experienced, even stuff that happened during a reset. With the compatbility of their abilities, they go through each arc solving a new case and problem, introducing a new character and learning about their ability and personality. This is where the problems start. The personalities of each character feel incredibly empty. Most of them rarely show any sign of emotions, and the way they speak feels boring and monotone. The dialogue also manages to throw in philosophical questions like the Swampman and the Ship of Theseus. It feels unrealistic that a bunch of high school students are talking about these kinda topics, and it really takes you out of the anime. The fact that the characters are pretty much emotionless androids ruin any kind of drama that the first half tried to create, even though the drama itself was quite interesting and the way they used their abilities to solve them were quite clever. There are also quite a few scenes that feel pretty pointless to the overall story, and some characters that are introduced but having no real importance to offer. All these factors make the first half an incredibly tough ordeal to get through.The second half is where the story really kicks in. To be more specific, the part where it really starts to pick up is the Eden arc. Old characters start to show a little more emotion, although not that much, while the painful dialogue slowly becomes more tolerable, even though they continue to use philosophical questions and monotone voices. I don't know if this is because the show's script got better or if I just got used to the way Sakurada's characters talk, but I could actually enjoy the anime more than I previously could. The drama feels more genuine as characters struggle to come to terms with the way others use their abilities, truly making it worth investing my time into this show. More characters are introduced and are still slightly unrealistic, but they also feel significantly better compared to the introductions in the first half, especially with the appearance of Masamune Urachi. Urachi is the director of the Administration Bureau's Management Department and becomes the main antagonist of the show. He has one simple goal he wants to achieve, to remove abilities from Sakurada. The show really lets you understand exactly why he wants to do this, and you slightly sympathise with him. Of course, our MC Kei wants to prevent this, and the clashing of their opposing ideals is what the show had been building up to. This is where the show really shines as both characters attempt to outsmart their opponents so they may reign triumphant. The ending is truly amazing as they use the abilities of their teams to solve the issues that had been made apparent in Sakurada.In the end, I can't say for sure if I'd recommend Sakurada Reset to anyone. I'm glad I finished this show, but if I had to choose between rewatching it or forgetting it, I'd probably never be able to come to a decision. If you think you can endure the dialogue and characters and see what the story has to offer, I would definitely tell you to give it a shot and see if you like it or not. It's sad knowing if these things had been different, the anime would have been more well received and might possibly have become one of the best to come out of this year for me.Thanks for reading, send feedback if you have any! school students.

Every character of this show.Sakurada city. The city which is full of people with special abilities. Kinda mediocre premise, right? Right. Though, it\'s far off from being something like a mediocre shounen but that doesn\'t cancel a mediocreness of the show.I\'ve watched 12 episodes. There were a lot of info. What I\'ve got from it? Some pretentious pseudo philosophical phrases. Lots of meaningless dialogues which made me think about one thing: please, someone teach them how to communicate. One robot talking to another.Sure, there were some interesting twists and ideas. The show has some tremendous...potential but it\'s not capable to pull it off. It just trips every time it tries.Honestly, I dislike shows which take a responsibility to realize some hard concepts with a poor directing. Sakurada Reset consists of such concepts. Does it manage to convey them in a decent way? I have my doubts.The art is just okay. It creates a feeling of a ""cheap"" one though. But I reckon it may be because there\'s nothing to animate here. Dull robots talking with another dull robots. From time to time they walk and talk. Or sit and talk. It\'s a bit an exaggeration but that\'s how I felt it sometimes.I did like the op and the ed. They were pleasant surprises to my ear.Speaking about actors\' voices... Once again, robots. And that\'s not their guilt. They voiced characters which they had to. Robots. Nonetheless, I liked ""resetto"" word. It\'s cute. If I were to hear it more frequently, maybe I wouldn\'t drop this show...(just kidding).The major mistake about characters is that there\'s no emotional character enough who would put the show in a right direction. What I mean is... try to imagine the anime in which were only Kyons. There\'s no Haruhi Suzumiya (quite ironic, main girl of Sakurada Reset is named Haruhi as well) to solve this problem.To some degree I enjoyed watching this show. But that\'s not enough to make me watch another 12 episodes. That would be a routine.I\'d not recommend watching it.

The main complaint which can become apparent to anyone who watches the first couple episodes is that many of the characters that appear in the anime have very bland personalities. I would argue however, that for many of those characters (especially Misora and Kei), that apathy they seem to have almost makes sense considering some of the abilities they possess.All of my other thoughts on this anime are positive ones. The story takes its time to develop but once it does you get to see some incredibly...layered storytelling. The way how the various abilities of the characters were used to convey this was very interesting to me. The art and animation are nothing amazing but are at a standard you can deem as acceptable. The soundtrack doesn't really stand out but I thought it was very good. A lot of the characters are interesting and have a certain way in which they view the world. Seeing how these differing ideals clash when characters came together made Sakurada Reset a pleasant watching experience.I think this is one of those shows that may remain a hidden gem but if you happen to stumble across it, definitely consider giving it a watch. layered storytelling.

Because people can not get past the 3 episode rule and because they can\'t pay enough attention to watching this anime; if you are wondering whether or not you should watch this anime then you should first ask yourself the following questions: 1) Do you like puzzles? 2) Do you like philosophical questions? 3) Do you like to eat your candies later? 4) Do you like to think a lot? 5) Can you think with other people\'s perspectives?If your answer is yes to all of the above then I am sure you will find this...anime very very interesting.But for those who wish for a proper review, I will do my best to try and not give away any spoiler while also providing a proper review that this anime deserve.Story: 9/10It\'s hard to put into words as to what the story is all about, but the summary definitely does not do justice to what the story is going to be. To be frank, yes it is about having abilities and two people having abilities that compliment each other, but it is much deeper than that. Our MC will often utter some fairly deep philosophical questions or ideas that will either serve as the main plot towards the specific story that the show is currently on and those can also sometimes be the clue to solve a certain mystery within the show.Be aware that the entire anime is separated with stories or I suppose ""arcs"" which the plot will present a problem and our main characters are going to solve it, each of these ""arcs"" varies in length, but they are within the range of 2-5 per arc.An important note to be taken here is that there will be no fan service at all within this anime, you will not see boobs or panties or guys ran into a girl who just came out of a shower of that sort.Another side note here is that be sure to pay attention to the first 3 episodes of the show as they are the most important 3 episodes of this anime, it sets the story up, it gives you all the information you need before hopping on this train ride of ideals, philosophies, emotions, and mysteries.Art: 9/10Not an expert when it comes to art, but it is what you would expect from a 2017 anime adaptation.Sound: 9/10Also not an expert in this area, I just find the background music, the opening, and ending compliments the show and brought out what it is all about.Character: 10/10This is the part that drives most people from the show and if you are wondering why I still give it a 10/10 well, that is because they are wrong.I am fairly certain that many comments stated their opinion about how the characters in this shows are all fairly robot like and exert no emotion, well they are dead wrong.How so, you may ask, well all the secrets lie within the first 3 episodes where it will be explained to you, that is if you actually not skipped anything and sat down and watched it and understand what is going on.You may ask, ""but does that mean all the characters will stay robot like?"" the answer is no.And yes the characters will show growth, but it\'s not growth that is apparent, it\'s very subtle, and it requires a huge amount of effort to pick up those small changes, which the majority of them lies within the dialogues between characters which many complained to be boring and lack of emotional responses. But again, they are dead wrong, there are emotions within the responses between each character, it all lies within those choices of words, and the characters are designed to carefully choose their words as to slowly show their growth. The characters are all very intelligent and that is why they may all seem very robot like but no, they are not robots, they are still humans and have lots of emotion that they just express very subtle and mostly with words.Enjoyment: 8/10Too much puzzle and ideals and philosophy for my brains to be honest, but it was fun, and it was good.So summing it up, give it a try if you like what you have read, and try not to get bored out, this is a very adult-like anime, and very intelligent, so be prepared and know what you are going into, sometimes you have to watch an episode a couple times before you can fully understand what is going on, and sometimes you will feel the anxiety of wanting to know what happens next, and can not stop thinking about it, those are all part of this anime and what makes it so good, it challenges you to think and to make connections, so if you like those things, please do not be sway by the other comments and be sure to give it a try, I am sure it will grab your heart just like it grabbed mine. anime very very interesting.But for those who wish for a proper review, I will do my best to try and not give away any spoiler while also providing a proper review that this anime deserve.Story: 9/10It\'s hard to put into words as to what the story is all about, but the summary definitely does not do justice to what the story is going to be.

As the story covers events of elementary, middle and high school life in just this short span.This series has one of the best written stories because when it states the rules of a person\'s abilities, it strictly sticks to it and also gives us insight of how it can be used various other things, which you might not expect when you aren\'t thinking out of the box, which shows like ""Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works"" failed miserably, as they don\'t give any proper reason for rules being bent for the sake of story.The most important thing which I\'ve found interesting in this series is the ""Philosophical thoughts"" which were really well written and analyzed and no doubt they are even applicable in our real world.Coming to characters, its the main drawback of the series, I mean mostly only 3 characters are developed and that too you wouldn\'t know much of their backstory about why they were being emotionless. That\'s what makes people hate this show, i.e., you can\'t say which character you like the most or whose behavior you liked, but you can only just say that the ending is beautiful and a story worth the watch.The MC Asai Kei might not be cool, but he is definitely one of the smartest characters in anime history. Its just that he is not someone who you might take for a favorite person, but he has good ideas, also he is someone who tries to reach everyone needs, which is as if he is trying to be a God but if you just skip that part of his naïve ideal rest assured is good.Coming to soundtracks, there aren\'t any noteworthy soundtracks, but the op and ed songs are good to listen.Art is very common, which isn\'t much appealing to see but it\'s alright to watch.Well that being said, this series might not be something great, but it definitely underrated and has one of well-written story and philosophy, so watch it with patience as the ending is worth the watch. It doesn\'t have cool fights but it has some really interesting battle of wits. I know people dropped it because waiting for week for a single episode is a real pain, but now you can binge watch it and taste the true essence of a masterpiece.

This anime is unique and a true Masterpiece, I will recommend anyone to watch as the main Character- especially Asai Kei is really outstanding in knowledge. Great development and growth of character as they realize throughout the story who they are and the weaknesses, which is amazing. The art and sound are great as they appeal to each character perfectly 9/10, but with the...story will just make it feel beautiful. Overall this is a true Masterpiece and will deserves anyone's time! story will just make it feel beautiful. Overall this is a true Masterpiece and will deserves anyone's time!"", 'Two individuals use their reset ability and their eidetic memory abilities to solve problems involving or revolving around abilities.Story: Most stories have a sort of macguffin, whether it is a physical object or just an end result that the protagonist tries to achieve. In any case, a macguffin is a motive for the main character to do what he or she has to do. This anime is no exception. In the town of Sakurada, people possess strange abilities that range from making everyone within a certain radius laugh uncontrollably to having photographic memory. It may seem like a standard superpowers anime, but there are a...few differences. There’s barely any action and it’s not the standard comedic slice of life either. Instead, this anime focuses primarily on mysteries and deeper themes such as identity and ethics. In a way, this anime focuses more on human behavior rather than the abilities themselves. As such, there are many seemingly-nonsensical conversations between the characters. However, there is a method to this show’s madness. It will reveal itself in time.Characters: One noteworthy aspect of this anime is the characters themselves. At first glance, all of them seem monotonous, lifeless even. However, they all have their own idiosyncrasies and personal growth, aside from their abilities, of course.First, let’s talk about the two main characters Asai Kei and Haruki Misora. On the surface, they are probably the most apathetic characters in the show, rarely ever showing emotional responses to their surroundings. However, this does not mean that they are monotonous individuals. Throughout the storyline, they slowly learn more about themselves, their identity, their beliefs. Kei constantly struggles with his ideals: the perfect human being, why Souma did what she did, Haruki’s development. Meanwhile, Haruki constantly struggles with her emotions and her individuality. The two of them grow—with Haruki’s development being reset from time to time—and learn how to deal with conflicting beliefs/emotions.Now, with the two characters that most people would expect to have the most character development out of the way, I personally think that there are other characters that have significant character development. Out of necessity for keeping this review as spoiler-free as possible, I’m going to go over these characters very briefly. Souma Sumire, to start, is very important as Kei constantly thinks back to her and her identity. On the other hand, I really admired Kagaya and Tsushima because they themselves were struggling with their own conflicts with the town. Kagaya struggled with the concept of ethics, more specifically between the utilitarian perspective and the consequentialist perspective. Tsushima on the other hand struggled with his responsibilities and his own emotions, although his story was very much skipped over so it’s largely insignificant. Although it may not seem like it, I believe the conflicts that these side characters face bring up important points in everyday society. In any case, Kei brings up a good point: “There is no right answer. Everyone should be able to find their own answer.”Music/Audio/Art: This section is going to be really short because I do not usually have qualms about the music, voice acting, or art style. Both openings and endings were nice to listen to before and after episodes. The music in the episodes did not have a big impact on me, but they were not out of place either. As for voice acting, Yuuki Aoi did a really amazing job voicing Souma Sumire’s character, especially in the final episodes. The art of the anime itself is satisfying to look at. It hosts calm colors so that viewers can fully immerse themselves into the dialogue without becoming distracted by the art.Execution/Overall flow: Yes, the show may seem slow and tedious for those who do not stick around until the end. Yes, the concepts that they touch upon may seem complex, trivial, or even overbearing. However, everything will start to make sense in the final arc. Pretty much everything is reviewed within the final few episodes, wrapped up, and handed back to you. The first few episodes/arcs are bound to feel long and strained due to the introduction of countless thought experiments (which I personally find intriguing) and theoretical debates. The writing is well thought-out and every conversation and soliloquy happens for a reason.Overall score: 9.5/10 I was originally put off by the slow pacing of this anime, hence why it took me 4 months of on and off watching to finish the show.

Though the anime may seem mediocre, resulting in a low rating. This anime is truly a hidden gem for those yearning for a realistic romance drama and an ethical/moral plot.STORY : 9/10SYNOPSISIn a town so-called Sakurada. A town where every single person possesses an ability of random that can be anything or even everything. A student named Kei Asai who lives in the town and has the ability to recall the past meets up with Haruki Misora, a student who has the ability to ""reset"". Later on become...colleagues.With the power of their formidable combined powers. They use their powers to aid others in the town. But will their powers really outmatch against the difficult obstacles that they both have to face in the future?( Optional-To-Read ) Explanation Of The Two Abilities Combined : Kei Asai has the ability to recall the past accurately whilst Haruki Misora has the ability to reset ( go back to the past with the limit of 3 days maximum ). One issue with Misora\'s ability is that she does not remember the past when she resets. Making her ability practically useless. However. With Kei Asai, even if she resets Kei would still have his memory intact. Allowing him to be able to pretty much change the past.OVERVIEWThe story of Sakurada Reset from the start to the very end is incredibly solid. It has the capability to maintain the state of satisfaction with no ups and downs. However, one issue with that is that some people may not find the state satisfactory but mediocre instead. Since the story rarely ""BOOMS"" and feels more calm throughout the series. You could say that some people find the story of this anime the same as eating only rice.Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the story a lot. In fact, the calmness IS the reason why the story is so good. It doesn\'t get too exciting nor too boring. It feels just right.ART : 10/10Perfect. No comment.Sound : 10/10Could somebody give Sumire Souma\'s voice actor an award? Like, seriously. Her voice felt so matching with her appearance and personality that my respects alone wouldn\'t even be enough for it.Perfect. No other comments.Character : 10/10CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTThe character developments of this anime is astonishing. But it doesn\'t fit the genres the show ultimately has at all. Well, to a certain extent.Still. It\'s amazing. So amazing. Everything just feels so well-planned that I can\'t be bothered to describe it because that would make the review too long.OTHERSOne great thing about this anime is that the character\'s personality matches perfectly with how they look. This makes it even better for an anime that doesn\'t really have any ups and downs for the story. It adds a more ""fitting"" environment into it. Making the story even better.Enjoyment : 10/10Really enjoyed this anime. Lowkey triggered of the fact that the rating is so low. But it\'s reasonable.Overall : 10/10I\'ll say this again. If you\'re looking for a realistic romance drama and an ethical/moral plot. This anime is exactly what you need. Hands up. Period.Also one of the best 7s I\'ve ever seen one there.

Really, really, good.', 'this review only applies for the first 6 episodes of the series it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what i liked or disliked about the anime and the reason i have had dropped it forhello everybody and welcome to my review of sakurada reset where i will not use any capitalized letters or punctuation for the purpose of succesfully expressing exactly how sakurada reset carries itself over on screen by drawing parallels between poorly written paragraphs with no punctuation and the anime itself first comparison is the fact that by simply maintaining a...constant motion where you dont key the watcher or reader as to which bits of text or scenes are important in your story or to your characters these will lose its coherence and the watcher will misunderstand your intentions with what is shown on screen due to how it is shown the way sakurada reset does this is through how the characters talk where they constantly use a monotone voice devoid of human emotion unless the plot requires them to have a strong emotional reaction at a certain given moment but otherwise these characters fail or barely get their personalities and insights across simply due to the fact that they constantly talk at the same pace and they seem unaffected by anything on a personal level the way i have written this review so far matches this perfectly because i am sure there are some of you that have gotten confused or lost in this sea of text due to how you have nothing to anchor to and set any basis on and that is the same case for sakurada reset the characters spout a bunch of text without any value that you have to put together yourself in order to get any value out of the show most of the work you have to do yourself in order to get something coherent across instead of having the directing the voice acting and the characters personalities do most of that for you the second issue is that it makes the series largely unappealing because it is dressed with things that address either philosophical or things that would otherwise be considered deep but because most of the time it doesnt feel natural you arent sure whether it is just a plot dump to make each situation more complex or if it is something that will become relevant later on what makes things largely unappealing is the fact that i have to make too much of an effort to look for the important parts of the conversation since the characters of the show much like this review dont show any signs of what will matter while anything else i would watch things would simply come off naturally because whoever crafted it along would make an effort to queue into what will be important the third and most important part is that the story loses meaning this way we have the main characters who barely show any emotion even if they are stabbed through the hand and bleeding profusely and because of moments like those you kind of lose value of what should be meaningful and what shouldnt the biggest problem is that sakurada reset tries to show the main character as a morallistic god who wants to make the life of anyone he comes across better and show he improves their lives but because of how everything is written every piece of dialogue in the text simply loses meaning because they become just words on a screen and the actions lose their meaning now i have a few questions for you if you have made it this far how much of what i have written has gotten across to you did you find everything maintaining its coherency despite the fact there is no variation in the phrasing of my sentences did you find what i have written appealing despite how everything seems to jumble in together into one big word soup and more importantly has anything lost meaning well know that i think that you would answer similarly to the following questions which are do you think a story would be coherent even when everyone acts in a constant manner devoid of individuality and emotion in a story that is meant to be about people and somewhat dramatic do you find such a story appealing when you know that nobody has any key qualities that shine across and as such it is hard to find a hook and the last but the most important would the story actually be meaningful when everyone has only specific moments where they seem affected by what is happening around them what i can tell you is that the fact that it is a time travellish anime doesnt help because even more tension and stakes are lost due to the fact that everything can be restored to a default state which quite frankly makes things even more bland because everybody acts as monotously as ever in the new timeline the fact that everyone has powers doesnt liven up the world whatsoever because everyone treats them as very mundane things that dont govern any relevance on their life and the people overlooking them mostly see them as a problem that should be overseen simply everything feels dull due to how everything in that anime feels undervalued there arent many people to whom i can recommend sakurada reset because i dont think people find value in something that doesnt seem to value itself and sakurada reset has a very monotone demeanor about everything it presents the anime feels like someone created a text to speech algorhythm equivalent but this one applies as a text to animation algorhythm where words and events are poorly portrayed due to the fact that the robot doing so merely follows some strict guidelines the anime is very much like reading a book with no punctuation which is the point of my review if you couldnt follow along this review until it was over or disliked doing so then i recommend avoiding sakurada reset because it is as much of a hassle as what you have just read i completely understand since that is how it came across to me and that is what made me drop itcomma that being the fact what i watched feltdotdotdot lifelessdot

off naturally because whoever crafted it along would make an effort to queue into what will be important the third and most important part is that the story loses meaning this way we have the main characters who barely show any emotion even if they are stabbed through the hand and bleeding profusely and because of moments like those you kind of lose value of what should be meaningful and what shouldnt the biggest problem is that sakurada reset tries to show the main character as a morallistic god who wants to make the life of anyone he comes across better and show he improves their lives but because of how everything is written every piece of dialogue in the text simply loses meaning because they become just words on a screen and the actions lose their meaning now i have a few questions for you if you have made it this far how much of what i have written has gotten across to you did you find everything maintaining its coherency despite the fact there is no variation in the phrasing of my sentences did you find what i have written appealing despite how everything seems to jumble in together into one big word soup and more importantly has anything lost meaning well know that i think that you would answer similarly to the following questions which are do you think a story would be coherent even when everyone acts in a constant manner devoid of individuality and emotion in a story that is meant to be about people and somewhat dramatic do you find such a story appealing when you know that nobody has any key qualities that shine across and as such it is hard to find a hook and the last but the most important would the story actually be meaningful when everyone has only specific moments where they seem affected by what is happening around them what i can tell you is that the fact that it is a time travellish anime doesnt help because even more tension and stakes are lost due to the fact that everything can be restored to a default state which quite frankly makes things even more bland because everybody acts as monotously as ever in the new timeline the fact that everyone has powers doesnt liven up the world whatsoever because everyone treats them as very mundane things that dont govern any relevance on their life and the people overlooking them mostly see them as a problem that should be overseen simply everything feels dull due to how everything in that anime feels undervalued there arent many people to whom i can recommend sakurada reset because i dont think people find value in something that doesnt seem to value itself and sakurada reset has a very monotone demeanor about everything it presents the anime feels like someone created a text to speech algorhythm equivalent but this one applies as a text to animation algorhythm where words and events are poorly portrayed due to the fact that the robot doing so merely follows some strict guidelines the anime is very much like reading a book with no punctuation which is the point of my review if you couldnt follow along this review until it was over or disliked doing so then i recommend avoiding sakurada reset because it is as much of a hassle as what you have just read i completely understand since that is how it came across to me and that is what made me drop itcomma that being the fact what i watched feltdotdotdot lifelessdot', 'kind of a thought experiment.Imagine a library.

Its inhabitants and anyone who moves to the town are granted a special ability but they\'re limited in such a way that the user can\'t benefit from it and if they left town, they\'d forget they even had such abilities. Kei Asai is a righteous high school student who takes things seriously and won\'t do anything without purpose. One day, the student council president Sumire Soma lures him to the rooftop to meet the emotionless Misora Haruki who goes about her life based on logic. Sumire was hoping their similar personalities will allow Kei to befriend her because she had...no friends. Kei soon discovers Haruki had the ability to reset time for up to three days in the past as long as she created a save point. Problem was her own memories are reset too so she never remembers if she ever used the ability. On the contrary, Kei has a perfect memory allowing to recall even the tiniest detail which ends up protecting his memories from her resets.After learning of her ability, he thought they\'d be able to help many people rid of sadness if they teamed up. As a result of Kei\'s efforts, Haruki opens up and finds herself more expressive. She agrees to team up believing that as long as she\'s with him, they can make the world a better place. They soon discover their abilities aren\'t omnipotent and can\'t help everyone but that ends up motivating Kei even more to study abilities and use them for good. Two years later, the Bureau that govern abilities grants them permission to use their abilities on others as the ""Service Club"" and under the condition they they will be constantly monitored.Based on a seven volume light novel series By Yutaka Kohno, the show has your cliche high school setting and the supernatural. Despite all the special abilities it\'s a strangely relaxed show most of the time with the characters leisurely chatting away with little to no tension at all. I think you could compare it to the likes of Natsume Yuujinchou where the scenarios run at a slow steady pace with the odd bit of comedy, brief scenes of action and of course, the supernatural. There\'s no sci-fi time travel or leaping involved since Haruki\'s ability basically just reconstructs the world around her... It\'s kind of like a group of teenagers playing super heroes except not quite at the same time since everyone has their own abilities. They\'re mostly sent on assignments helping others who are troubled by their own abilities but of course, there\'s always a bigger plot which gradually unfolds so you can play along with the mystery. It actually reminds me of From The New World in this regard and it always keeps you guessing.There are quite a lot of peculiar abilities but, Haruki\'s reset ability alone is already interesting enough with the rules it works by. Kind of like loading a saved file in a game except there\'s an expiry time and it disappears after loading so it\'s not all powerful. I like how Haruki always reports the time after saving so that Kei knows when to search his memories. The abilities themselves end up being the surprises of the show as you don\'t know what the next one they\'ll discover is next. Some of them end up fun silly ones while others are more interesting. The odd times it can get pretty violent and gruesome because Kei doesn\'t show any restraint when he\'s relying on the reset ability. It\'s good to see the characters trying to resolve problems with something that\'s more realistic and achieveable within their current abilities (literally) rather than trying to come up with the perfect solution to not hurt anyone. It has its cute moments with its rare moments of romance while the calm witty dialogue mostly between Soma and Kei keeps conversations interesting. There\'s also a little fan service (not just for guys) but for the most part of the show there\'s none to ruin it.Background art\'s clean and simple. You could say the same for the characters but animations smooth and consistent. I guess the slow pacing and resets helps minimise the amount of animation needed so, they can spend more time on quality. The show kind of makes you think Nestle sponsored them with the product placements in this show. Maybe you\'ll notice the old book store from Jinbocho too that also appeared in Persona 5. As for music, it\'s quite good and matches it\'s mostly tranquil mood. Opening\'s music and visuals kind of reminds me of Nagi no Asukara (Lull in The Sea) although there doesn\'t seem to be any staff in common. Funnily enough, Kei\'s voice actor Kaito Ishikawa voices Kihara Tsumugu from that show while Haruki\'s voice Kana Hanazawa (Mayuri from Steins;gate, Akane from Psycho-Pass) also voiced Manaka Mukaido.If you watched Natsume Yuujinchou or even From The New World and liked those shows then the chances are you\'ll like this. Just that there\'s no cute chubby mascot around and the moral at the end of each sub-story is more of a riddle to solve.

It picks up in the latter half, but still remains a very conversation heavy anime.A lot of people won\'t like this show because most of it is character conversations about heady subjects.This isn\'t a bad thing as the characters are mostly interesting, despite the two main characters having little in the way of emotion. Conflicts are more debates and arguments than action, though there is a small amount.This is a show that intends to dive into the nature of humanity and emotion...as it\'s primary driving force. It\'s a very reflective show and entire episodes are devoted to a couple of characters sitting around and talking to each other.I wouldn\'t call it a ""chill"" show either, despite the pace. You need to pay attention or you\'ll get lost and have no idea what\'s going on. This show is intended to poke at your brain with philosophy.It\'s very well animated, but also kind of bland looking. The colors are subdued and soft. This is an intentional style choice, as it reinforces the tone of the show and the town it takes place in. The place is supposed to be a kind of a limbo in the middle of nowhere Japan.If you like a well written, philosophical, slow burning, drama, this show will probably entertain.If you need action, boobs, and/or laughs to keep your attention, this isn\'t for you.

If the show ends well, I will most definitely rewatch it in the future."", 'All the resets Misora does can\'t stop from LA disliking this anime...Sakurada Reset is an exercise in patience and pointlessness in LA\'s eyes.LA has ALOT to unpack so let\'s start with it\'s...Flaws which it has alot of. Sakurada Reset PRIDES itself on giving us static images and bland deadpan monotoned characters through it\'s 24 episode screentime, what\'s worse it that these two elements makes this anime much longer than it\'s suppose to and sure LA isn\'t expecting EVERY anime to be shounen-esque especially from a premise like a town filled with superpowered humans and the Bureau governing and suppressing their inhabitants powers but keeping this...atmosphere 24/7 won\'t help the experience of having dead air and slow traction in plotlines to occur and be dealt without as much as a sense of urgency. IT\'S AN ANIME ABOUT SUPERPOWERED HUMANS AND A GOVERNING BODY SUPPRESSING THEM, HOW IS THIS NOT FUN???.The deadpanned monotoness of this anime are easily manifested in the majority of the cast but especially in the form of our main characters Kei Asai voiced by Kaito Ishikawa who has the power of remembering everything and Misora Haruki voiced by Kana Hanazawa who has the resetting powers (before people starts, LA GETS why they are monotoned considering their situation the both of them are in, the fact that both characters have a strong sense of justice and doesn\'t want people to be hurt and protect them but at the expense of themselves not to mention the Bureau looming around them, but just because LA ""gets it"" doesn\'t justify why these MAIN characters are extremely dull on ALL fronts as a result) and it\'s even worse when this comes into the romance angle of this anime and it is damn forced how they play this out. The fact that these two characters really don\'t display much to any emotion is one thing, but as LA watched Sakurada Reset, LA just found the romance between these two to be not only forced but plot-driven in Kei\'s part to the point LA only saw Kei using Misora as nothing but a plot device and nothing more, his ulterior motives in using Misora came into the romantic angle and failed miserably (not only because both characters display no emotion and are pretty static, both in relationship but also the anime\'s atmosphere outright kills any notion of a romance angle for LA).Aside from the romantic angle, Kei also has some other plot-driven problems about him, mainly because of his beliefs of not hurting people at any cost but at the expense of his own sacrifice which becomes annoying as that is one of his defining traits and one of the reasons why people think he\'s a saint or a hero and it\'s compounded by the fact that due to Misora\'s resetting powers and Kei\'s own powers, he resolves ALL problems rather quickly, sure you can defend this by saying well duhh because of the Misora\'s powers, but Kei\'s finds some rather TOO convenient ways to resolve things and quickly LA mind you.Let\'s see what else, ohh how about the fact that many of the static imagery this anime does display actually hurts it\'s rare action scenes it has, due to how subdued and lacking in the animation department Sakurada Reset is, even the animation especially the action falters to a slow crawl of heavy action. This also affects the superpowered humans and their abilities as well making their abilities rather dull as interesting as they are at times.Voice acting also gets crippled by the atmosphere of this anime thus the majority of the characters are either deadpanned or rarely way to excitable. The biggest victim of this anime being Kana Hanazawa due to her robotic way of talking sounds like Kana isn\'t even caring how she sounds and just doing her basic deadpan Kanade Tachibana vocals only without the effort, it\'s not Kana Hanazawa\'s fault it\'s her character\'s traits but nonetheless.So was there ANYTHING LA found enjoyable in Sakurada Reset?, well LA did found for the most part the superpowers element at the very least interesting, even better when Kei found ways to mix other powers together to do something out of this world but this only goes so far but that a bit later. Sumire Soma is LA\'s ray of hope for this anime, why?...because she\'s one of the ONLY characters to actually emote in this anime and be different from the majority of the cast, she also shakes things up and allows some of the plotlines to have a modicum of interest and hell Sumire\'s voice actor Aoi Yuuki is LA\'s favourite voice actor in this anime hands down, but alas...there\'s also some problems with Sumire but that also a bit later. Lastly is that the final arc did try to do something Kei giving him a bit of character development and showing us what his true goal is but ummm yeah the finale also has some problems...let\'s start addressing them shall we?First the superpowers were interesting and LA quite liked it when they ""stacked"" with one another making for some interesting results, what LA didn\'t like towards all this is that Kei manipulates and uses them without a second thought because of his plot-driven nature, it made the entire superpowers albeit interesting lose steam extremely quickly by being extremely convenient to Kei as a whole and nothing more than that (not to mention Sakurada Reset DOES NOT throw us bone when we have to remember what EVERY side characters or one off characters\' powers were), also this leads into the Bureau as they do a pretty horrible job at managing powers even in secret by NOT doing anything or using blatantly abuse of power and  even allowing a highschool kid to do most of the work for them and expect him to abide by their rules, because of this, it cripples the basic premise of Sakurada Reset to be even interesting.Second is that Sumire Soma is in this dumb love triangle and SHE\'S the one goading Kei and Misora to be together when it\'s clearly obvious that Sumire likes Kei and LA sees this, supernatural politics aside, Sumire\'s character is downplayed because of this albeit she\'s one of the most unpredictable character in this anime and reasonings are reasonably justified in some situations but still LA utterly hated the stilted dumb love triangle Sumire got herself into.Thirdly is the final arc that LA made LA question this anime\'s point in pointlessness when it came to the ""big"" dilemma in this anime and the villain of this anime in question. LA is going into spoilers but LA doesn\'t care because the villains reasoning was pathetically annoying, but yeah, his plan was to remove every ability in Sakurada because his father wanted to, thus the villain wanted to make his father\'s wish come true. The pointlessness of this entire ordeal comes from the fact that ""so what if people loses their abilities?"", why does Kei even care about it?...for his romance with Misora, that\'s a laugh, as for having abilities or not has a grey morality to it\'s proceedings as to how they are used but Kei ALWAYS tries to be on the ""right side"" even if the villain he faces ALSO wants the same thing just using differing methods. So again...does it matter if Sakurada has no abilities anymore or not?...Kei seems to think so, but LA doesn\'t. Pointless really. (Also you can defend that this is around the time that Kei gains a bit of character development thus is NOT pointless but no...he stays pretty static just with his sense of justice cranked up to an eleven and that he ""loves"" Misora which again is a moot point for LA).LASTLY, yes there\'s more, the dialogue in this anime is utterly pretentious as LA came to realize, with every character spurting out that Kei is a saint or a hero in the most blunt way possible or wondering what this feeling is like to the morality of having abilities or not or even the act of existing comes up. So yeah compounding the dead air atmosphere and deadpanned characters, the lack of action and superpowers glanced over to many of the problems EASILY being resolve by our all mighty janitor Kei...can YOU SEE how boring this anime gets and at 24 episodes at that.Ohh one more thing this anime review has been sponsored by KitKat, Have a Break, have a Ki- WHAT DOES KITKAT HAVE TO DO WITH RESETTING AND A TOWN FILLED WITH SUPERPOWERED HUMANS. Ohh and yes Kei even says the slogan of KitKat and even shows a KitKat without any change to it\'s name or product. Can you TELL KitKat sponsored this anime somehow. Think this KitKat tangent came outta nowhere, well the anime does it in the same manner and expect you to NOT break immersion, it does.What the hell is Sakurada Reset?...Sakurada Reset is probably one thee worst anime of Spring 2017 for LA and as much as LA has seen some pretty horrible animes but this anime is ""intentionally boring"" at best and being intentionally boring is hardly a compliment. Being boring is a typical anime cardinal sin, but an anime INTENTIONALLY doing this is another thing altogether, as in this felt like David Productions wanted a break from Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure and this was a perfect way to put in as little effort as possible. Sakurada Reset also has the honor of the anime of wasting LA\'s time for being pointless, not since Trickster: Edogawa Ranpo ""Shounen Tanteidan"" yori has done this to LA.Sakurada Reset is boring, it\'s pointless, it\'s pretentious and is a waste of your time, time Misora can\'t reset for the life of her. atmosphere 24/7 won\'t help the experience of having dead air and slow traction in plotlines to occur and be dealt without as much as a sense of urgency.

The fact that these two characters really don\'t display much to any emotion is one thing, but as LA watched Sakurada Reset, LA just found the romance between these two to be not only forced but plot-driven in Kei\'s part to the point LA only saw Kei using Misora as nothing but a plot device and nothing more, his ulterior motives in using Misora came into the romantic angle and failed miserably (not only because both characters display no emotion and are pretty static, both in relationship but also the anime\'s atmosphere outright kills any notion of a romance angle for LA).Aside from the romantic angle, Kei also has some other plot-driven problems about him, mainly because of his beliefs of not hurting people at any cost but at the expense of his own sacrifice which becomes annoying as that is one of his defining traits and one of the reasons why people think he\'s a saint or a hero and it\'s compounded by the fact that due to Misora\'s resetting powers and Kei\'s own powers, he resolves ALL problems rather quickly, sure you can defend this by saying well duhh because of the Misora\'s powers, but Kei\'s finds some rather TOO convenient ways to resolve things and quickly LA mind you.Let\'s see what else, ohh how about the fact that many of the static imagery this anime does display actually hurts it\'s rare action scenes it has, due to how subdued and lacking in the animation department Sakurada Reset is, even the animation especially the action falters to a slow crawl of heavy action. This also affects the superpowered humans and their abilities as well making their abilities rather dull as interesting as they are at times.Voice acting also gets crippled by the atmosphere of this anime thus the majority of the characters are either deadpanned or rarely way to excitable. The biggest victim of this anime being Kana Hanazawa due to her robotic way of talking sounds like Kana isn\'t even caring how she sounds and just doing her basic deadpan Kanade Tachibana vocals only without the effort, it\'s not Kana Hanazawa\'s fault it\'s her character\'s traits but nonetheless.So was there ANYTHING LA found enjoyable in Sakurada Reset?, well LA did found for the most part the superpowers element at the very least interesting, even better when Kei found ways to mix other powers together to do something out of this world but this only goes so far but that a bit later. Sumire Soma is LA\'s ray of hope for this anime, why?...because she\'s one of the ONLY characters to actually emote in this anime and be different from the majority of the cast, she also shakes things up and allows some of the plotlines to have a modicum of interest and hell Sumire\'s voice actor Aoi Yuuki is LA\'s favourite voice actor in this anime hands down, but alas...there\'s also some problems with Sumire but that also a bit later. Lastly is that the final arc did try to do something Kei giving him a bit of character development and showing us what his true goal is but ummm yeah the finale also has some problems...let\'s start addressing them shall we?First the superpowers were interesting and LA quite liked it when they ""stacked"" with one another making for some interesting results, what LA didn\'t like towards all this is that Kei manipulates and uses them without a second thought because of his plot-driven nature, it made the entire superpowers albeit interesting lose steam extremely quickly by being extremely convenient to Kei as a whole and nothing more than that (not to mention Sakurada Reset DOES NOT throw us bone when we have to remember what EVERY side characters or one off characters\' powers were), also this leads into the Bureau as they do a pretty horrible job at managing powers even in secret by NOT doing anything or using blatantly abuse of power and  even allowing a highschool kid to do most of the work for them and expect him to abide by their rules, because of this, it cripples the basic premise of Sakurada Reset to be even interesting.Second is that Sumire Soma is in this dumb love triangle and SHE\'S the one goading Kei and Misora to be together when it\'s clearly obvious that Sumire likes Kei and LA sees this, supernatural politics aside, Sumire\'s character is downplayed because of this albeit she\'s one of the most unpredictable character in this anime and reasonings are reasonably justified in some situations but still LA utterly hated the stilted dumb love triangle Sumire got herself into.Thirdly is the final arc that LA made LA question this anime\'s point in pointlessness when it came to the ""big"" dilemma in this anime and the villain of this anime in question. LA is going into spoilers but LA doesn\'t care because the villains reasoning was pathetically annoying, but yeah, his plan was to remove every ability in Sakurada because his father wanted to, thus the villain wanted to make his father\'s wish come true. The pointlessness of this entire ordeal comes from the fact that ""so what if people loses their abilities?"", why does Kei even care about it?...for his romance with Misora, that\'s a laugh, as for having abilities or not has a grey morality to it\'s proceedings as to how they are used but Kei ALWAYS tries to be on the ""right side"" even if the villain he faces ALSO wants the same thing just using differing methods. So again...does it matter if Sakurada has no abilities anymore or not?...Kei seems to think so, but LA doesn\'t. Pointless really. (Also you can defend that this is around the time that Kei gains a bit of character development thus is NOT pointless but no...he stays pretty static just with his sense of justice cranked up to an eleven and that he ""loves"" Misora which again is a moot point for LA).LASTLY, yes there\'s more, the dialogue in this anime is utterly pretentious as LA came to realize, with every character spurting out that Kei is a saint or a hero in the most blunt way possible or wondering what this feeling is like to the morality of having abilities or not or even the act of existing comes up. So yeah compounding the dead air atmosphere and deadpanned characters, the lack of action and superpowers glanced over to many of the problems EASILY being resolve by our all mighty janitor Kei...can YOU SEE how boring this anime gets and at 24 episodes at that.Ohh one more thing this anime review has been sponsored by KitKat, Have a Break, have a Ki- WHAT DOES KITKAT HAVE TO DO WITH RESETTING AND A TOWN FILLED WITH SUPERPOWERED HUMANS. Ohh and yes Kei even says the slogan of KitKat and even shows a KitKat without any change to it\'s name or product. Can you TELL KitKat sponsored this anime somehow. Think this KitKat tangent came outta nowhere, well the anime does it in the same manner and expect you to NOT break immersion, it does.What the hell is Sakurada Reset?...Sakurada Reset is probably one thee worst anime of Spring 2017 for LA and as much as LA has seen some pretty horrible animes but this anime is ""intentionally boring"" at best and being intentionally boring is hardly a compliment. Being boring is a typical anime cardinal sin, but an anime INTENTIONALLY doing this is another thing altogether, as in this felt like David Productions wanted a break from Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure and this was a perfect way to put in as little effort as possible. Sakurada Reset also has the honor of the anime of wasting LA\'s time for being pointless, not since Trickster: Edogawa Ranpo ""Shounen Tanteidan"" yori has done this to LA.Sakurada Reset is boring, it\'s pointless, it\'s pretentious and is a waste of your time, time Misora can\'t reset for the life of her.', 'It\'s safe to say that Sakurada Reset is a ""smart"" show and it is very much aware of that.At first, the anime felt like a ""weekly mystery"" that would solved with the characters abilities. The evolution of the plot into something much more enthralling has been fun to watch and be a part of. We have really grown with these characters as they battle and try to figure out who they are themselves as well as to why it is exactly they are trying to help each other and the world that they live in.Kei as the MC has definitely been one of my...favorites from this season thus far. He truly comes off as a white knight that is able to overcome just about any circumstance and his development and struggle has been great.As the series has progressed the dialogue and conversations between characters prove to be the most captivating parts of the anime. The dialogue is quick and snappy, they are asking serious questions to others as well as themselves. As cliche as it may seem, this anime makes you think and requires that you pay attention to all that is going on all the time.The major philosophical and social questions and themes that run the show truly dominate the intent and overall motivations for the plot and the characters. We are faced with asking ourselves what does it mean to be good or bad, what is good or bad about desire, is any of what we are doing only for ourselves or for the greater good.My issues with the show stem from the complexity that it is pushing. The show so far has felt extremely long. Sometimes the complex dialogue goes in circles and it can sometimes be confusing as to what it is they are really trying to say. The middle of the show became a little muddled and messy as we saw a transition in the plot to something deeper, but as the show is gearing for the photo finish is as exciting as ever. This anime really challenges the viewers to keep up and I would say if you are up for the task to consider giving it your time. favorites from this season thus far.

What I mean by that is the art wasn\'t consistent throughout the story, the dialogue was absolute crap, and there was just a lot of unnecessary silence between characters. BUT I will say this, I enjoyed it. This is one of those shows where the story is really unique that it allows you put aside those flaws and actually allow you to enjoy the show.Story 9/10:So the story is about a town called Sakurada(or Sagrada) that is filled...with individuals with special powers. EVERYONE in Sakurada has a power, whether it be something ridiculously OP or something practical, everyone has a power. And I\'ll be honest, the beginning of this show is VERY slow. The dialogue is really dry and the characters don\'t have much of a personality but the setting and story make you wonder ""What does the author plan to do with this town and its people?"" You begin to wonder, why is this town so peaceful despite people having powers, why do people like having these powers, and other questions. I can\'t really say much about the story without spoiling but I\'ll say this, the story is unique and if you decide to watch 5 episodes and stop, just don\'t. Just finish it at that point. The story gets interesting at the end and makes watching this anime all worth it.Art 6/10:Art is really inconsistent and nothing really special. The character design is pretty good for the most part considering that I could tell each character apart. But there\'s honestly nothing much to say about the art.Sounds 6/10:Like I said the dialogue in this show is absolute crap. There\'s so much unneeded silence and dialogue that it is this show\'s real downfall. The OP and ED is really good in my opinion and none of the character\'s voices give me the ""What...this character shouldn\'t sound like that"" so overall it\'s pretty solid.Overall 8/10:I give it a 8/10 because the story TOTALLY carried this anime. I really enjoyed it. The main characters were interesting to see develop. I feel like this anime received a lot of hate based on the first few episodes but give this anime a try.

The story follows a group of middle-to-high-school-age students who live in the fictional town of Sagrada, Japan, where about 50% of the town's population has special abilities. The abilities can range from something as simple as having a perfect photographic memory to something as incredible as temporary matter displacement or localized time travel. The show has some really thrilling moments, but overall these are bogged down in heavy dialog, poorly written characters, and a story full of plot holes that moves at a snail's pace, intercut...with hilariously out-of-place KitKat commercials. Gotta get that #spon, right?The biggest redeeming quality of this anime, in my opinion, is that it acts as a great supplement to your studies if you are learning Japanese. There is tons of dialogue to listen to, a few moments of interesting Japanese wordplay, and the lead female protagonist even speaks entirely in the polite register for the vast majority of the series. If you're learning Japanese and you would like a show to watch to help you with your aural comprehension, this is a pretty good one if you can keep up with how quickly they tend to speak.Story: 7/10In spite of myself, I quite enjoyed the story and the world that was built throughout the series. The story follows Asai Kei (浅井恵) and Haruki Misora (春樹美空) as they work together to make their town a better place using their combined abilities to turn back time and prevent small tragedies from occurring. Along the way, they unravel a sinister plot by a member of the Bureau, an organization dedicated to overseeing the abilities within Sagrada and ensuring that the dangerous ones remain in check. It's sort of like a slice of life turned mystery drama. It deals with themes of identity, compassion, righteousness, and some weird ones that are tough to summarize into a single word (such as whether a clone is close enough to the original to replace the original should the original die).The pacing is strange and sometimes it seems like things happen in an unconventional order. That is mostly forgivable, as the show does revolve around time travel. Unfortunately, by the end of the series, you're left feeling like there are so many strings left untied, and the finale is extremely underwhelming. The group of students all, serendipitously, have abilities that seem to mesh perfectly together with each other to allow some pretty crazy things to happen later in the show, but it does seem a little too convenient at times. The thing that grated on me the most, however, was that there are many characters whose motivations are never explained, and the ones whose motivations are explained make little to no sense.Art: 7/10The art was the aspect of the show that gripped me first and got me to watch the first episode back when it aired in Spring 2016. It is a really beautiful show, even though it's lacking in terms of energy. The lighting and scenery is always gorgeous. The character designs are mostly pretty well done, with some fairly obvious references to other Manga/Anime (Michiru, for example, looks like she was pulled straight out of One Piece). My biggest complaint, though, is that the CG cars seem extremely out of place and awkward within the otherwise relatively traditional-feeling anime setting.Sound: 5/10The music for this show is fairly underwhelming. The first OP and ED theme for the show are both fairly bland. The second OP is much better, but the second ED theme is just... poorly structured and feels amateurish. The themes that play throughout the show tend to be simple dramatic piano pieces; they fit the show, but they don't really add much and could probably be swapped out with something else without changing the feel very much.The voice acting is... dull, to put it lightly. This is not the fault of the seiyuu, but I think a problem with the direction and the overall tone of the show. Everyone is very matter of fact. Everyone talks quickly and drones on in a monotone. For certain characters, like Souma Sumire, this makes sense, but this is the case for every single character in the show. It feels depressive and lifeless.Characters: 3/10This is the biggest failing of Sagrada Reset. The only interesting thing about the characters is their abilities. It seems like they didn't even have any thought put into them beyond that. Haruki, the lead female, is literally a blank slate who does anything Kei asks without question. She could be swapped out with a first generation iPod Touch and the story would be essentially unchanged. Kei is very much a Mary Sue, as he somehow miraculously is able to outsmart and outpredict even the characters who have access to far more information, power, and insight than he ever could, and on top of it all he's wildly charismatic and can talk people into seeing things his way with relative ease. The supporting cast is far more interesting than the main duo, but they are barely touched upon outside of Souma Sumire.The biggest faux pas here was the introduction of Oka Eri as an antagonist. She has zero motivation aside from that she wants to make Kei unhappy. They do not bother to explain anything beyond that, and when they do delve into her backstory, it doesn't result in any clearer understanding of why she hates Kei enough to go out of her way to screw him over. Then, after a few episodes, she's relegated to a background character who we barely ever see again.Enjoyment: 6/10All in all, I didn't hate this anime. I hated a lot of parts of this anime, but I still watched it all the way through. If you're studying Japanese and you want to watch a show with lots of dialogue and lots of different types of speech, then you'll probably enjoy this one in spite of its shortcomings.

Underrated, many use this word in arguments when talking about anime with friends or with people, this word is enough to win any arguments and elevate someone\'s taste; however this has a really interesting meaning and if some people didn\'t stop at :""This show is underrated, go back to your popular stuff"", it could have more importance and meaning. Sakurada Reset, adaption of the Novel written by Kouno...Yutaka by David Productions, the most fabulous and stylish studio of them all, is Underappreciated for a particular reason, it utilizes a very specific technique that uses foreshadowing and slowly building up a climax through stories, character development and very small details:This technique can throw off some people and the slow pace at first mixed with the very long speeches can make people drop this Anime, for obvious and justifiable reasons, i\'m here today not only to give my thoughts on it, but also to explain what to expect and how to watch this show, because if you narrow it down, it has one of the most well written stories and some of the most intriguing characters this year.Story 8The story is borderline simple, a boy, Asai Kei, and a girl, Haruki Misora, teaming up and solving problems for the small city of Sakurada, but it goes really deep. The presentation is slow but is essential for the character arc of Both our main leads and Souma Sumire, their closest friend, and introduces a concept that will be very important later: Every detail or form is explained through metaphor, folklore stories and very detailed explanations, but it is never fully seen, ultimately is the viewer\'s role to figure things out by himself, and this particular technique of writing is very bold and full of risks, but the author handles it correctly and expands on itThe pacing is nothing great, basic and with too obvious moments of ""filler"", even though every episode is important for the characters and the storyThe speeches and very long lines of dialogue have a bit of that Monogatari Vibe, but they\'re not as good as those, and this is not a problem, because the dialogue in Sakurada Reset gives personality, gives a very smooth flow to the narrative and takes on vary interesting and amusing themes: like whether their powers are right or wrong, political and social themes and even an intriguing take on lifeThe foreshadowing and attention to detail is excellent, everything is important in this show and every slight hint concludes in an incredibile and amazing payoffAll of this combining in a climax devoid of action, but full of satisfaction, character accomplishments and a final showdown of ideals, life viewpoints, in order to really understand who\'s right, who\'rs wrong or if this dispute was really necessary to begin with, and a finale that we, the viewers, have to fully decifrateToo bad there are no JoJo\'s references, i\'m disappointed, silly David ProductionsCharacters 8.25This is hands down the best part in the show, even though not all of them are important, they all return for the climax, and each of them are a stepping stone, a way for our main characters to evolve and growThe growth of our main leads is outstanding, their development feels real, their chemistry is cute and adorable and, most importantly, they grow with ageAsai Kei is intelligent, cunning and a bit cold, but during the story he learns what having powers really means, what life really means and the ultimate reason he was chosen to be a part of Sakurada, he\'s a really good lead and some of his ideals and dialogue are what makes us really think( remember this)Haruki Misora is  the most developed amongst all, she starts off cold, emotionless( but she has a fantastic reason for it) and Meow, but she grows as a person, she has some of the best interactions and banter in the show, she is the best example of an emotionless character done right and her relationship with Kei works so well that i actually felt good while watching themBut the symbol, the essence of the show is Souma Sumire, she is the very representation of the show\'s soul, she is a deep and complex character her character arc is the most beautiful one and central in the entire story, her entirety is amazing and the most well done in the entire runtime, she truly is a Muse that sings a melanchonic yet happy song, a depressing yet real song, an amusing yet bland song, like life itself, like Souma itself, like the show itselfSound 7.5I have to praise Yui Makino, WEAVER and THE ORAL CIGARETTES, they did an amazing job with the endings and opening for the anime, they fit the tone really well, they\'re catchy, the visuals are really astonishing and are essential to the show, i couldn\'t imagine them without Sakurada ResetThe problem lies in the soundtrack in the actual show, it\'s forgettable and, if not for a couple of moments, i wouldn\'t remember a motive or some notesThey do not fit particular scenes quite well and never have that emotional impact neededOnly in some scenes the sound directing really shines, and they do a really fine job, i only wish they could have done this in the other scenes tooAnimation and Direction 7.5The direction is handled really well, with really wide cuts and camera angles, and, speaking of the camera, it is always placed in the perfect position for every scene, creating a frame that acts as an integrant part of the whole narration, every single cut or camera spin has some meaning behind itIn the very few action scenes it focuses on showing the vital points of every character and where they may go next, not where they\'re going at the moment, very unique methodThe animation is really well polished, some frames look incredibly well drawn and everything look fluid, the problem stands in the overall look and animation, it\'s kinda generic and bland at times, i get that sometimes this is the feeling the author wanted to give, but this is a problem that persists throughout.The character models are the most problematic, only one character stands out for her design, but the rest are very generic with very little to offerQuick note for the characters\' eyesm they are really pretty and have a lot of emotion inside themEnjoyment 8.25Some may think that i enjoy slow-paced shows that explain everything and that have really complex plots, and they could call me close-minded for this, but when wanting a good show with good writing and good characters is a sign of ignorance and of a ""close mind""? If this means being close-minded then yes, i am. I really liked the study of the characters, each with their specific role in the narration and in the growth of the main leads, i appreciated the bold narrative moves of the author and how he told this story. The excellent foreshadowing was the icing on the cake, it\'s handled so correctly that it became a pleasure to see and actually rewarded the people who paid attention to what was going onI loved how this actually challenged me, this anime wanted me to think and to deeply analize the characters and their dialogue, because no one is really wrong or right, and the line that separates them is very blur and subtleThis was Sakurada Reset, the Anime that i personally think is the best of Spring 2017 along with SNK II, Tsuki ga Kirei and Sakura QuestIt went down the radar because of his unique and very risky approach, i hope that you found this review helpful and that you understood why i like this anime, because only in facing different opinions and points of view someone can really grow as a person and understand something completely, facing his own opinions and evolving them thanks to different point of views; just like the message of the show, and i hope you will take this show and revaluate it, if you\'ve seen it, or watch from the start to fully appreciate it, if you didn\'tThanks for reading this review, May Our Sweet and Merciful Madoka be with you and, through the touch of our angel, Souma Sumire, you will know the splendid future that awaits you in the arms of our Lady, or, if you don\'t accept the gift, we\'ll just RESET everything Yutaka by David Productions, the most fabulous and stylish studio of them all, is Underappreciated for a particular reason, it utilizes a very specific technique that uses foreshadowing and slowly building up a climax through stories, character development and very small details:This technique can throw off some people and the slow pace at first mixed with the very long speeches can make people drop this Anime, for obvious and justifiable reasons, i\'m here today not only to give my thoughts on it, but also to explain what to expect and how to watch this show, because if you narrow it down, it has one of the most well written stories and some of the most intriguing characters this year.Story 8The story is borderline simple, a boy, Asai Kei, and a girl, Haruki Misora, teaming up and solving problems for the small city of Sakurada, but it goes really deep. The presentation is slow but is essential for the character arc of Both our main leads and Souma Sumire, their closest friend, and introduces a concept that will be very important later: Every detail or form is explained through metaphor, folklore stories and very detailed explanations, but it is never fully seen, ultimately is the viewer\'s role to figure things out by himself, and this particular technique of writing is very bold and full of risks, but the author handles it correctly and expands on itThe pacing is nothing great, basic and with too obvious moments of ""filler"", even though every episode is important for the characters and the storyThe speeches and very long lines of dialogue have a bit of that Monogatari Vibe, but they\'re not as good as those, and this is not a problem, because the dialogue in Sakurada Reset gives personality, gives a very smooth flow to the narrative and takes on vary interesting and amusing themes: like whether their powers are right or wrong, political and social themes and even an intriguing take on lifeThe foreshadowing and attention to detail is excellent, everything is important in this show and every slight hint concludes in an incredibile and amazing payoffAll of this combining in a climax devoid of action, but full of satisfaction, character accomplishments and a final showdown of ideals, life viewpoints, in order to really understand who\'s right, who\'rs wrong or if this dispute was really necessary to begin with, and a finale that we, the viewers, have to fully decifrateToo bad there are no JoJo\'s references, i\'m disappointed, silly David ProductionsCharacters 8.25This is hands down the best part in the show, even though not all of them are important, they all return for the climax, and each of them are a

Might not be true average by parts\' scores.As someone else already pointed out, you really should try out this series first before deciding if it\'s good or bad. I myself tried it out because it had that vibe of a daily life that I just wanted to go through after seeing so many other long winded or great series. But then, my first impression that this isn\'t as lighthearted as I thought, in fact, I realized it was a real brain hacking series...right away. So much I had to stop and pinch my forehead many times just to keep up with the story line of the first few episodes.I also often keep myself from predicting anything as I watch something because, and it\'s not like I\'m saying I\'m just that good here, I would often get it right. But then, I couldn\'t do that for this series, I predicted a different ending, and many other stuff in it. But it was a hell of a happiest ending where everyone is able to accept what they had to face. It was pretty much my 1st favorite ending, overthrown even Negima\'s.Oh, and by the way, I think I have found the most definite best-girl in Anime now. Too bad, I\'m like the protagonist, not able to choose her either, even just among the girls in this series. That\'s too bad for her, I guess. Not that she would want me anyways. (laugh)Story: 10/10Evolved from a good foundation with very subtle use of Chekov\'s gun.An ending where everything really is explained and even hinted along the way all along.Worst thing is on character building. But that\'s what is good about it.Art: 7/10Not very good. But I do like the art and character designs. It really fits the story it presents.Sound: 6/10Could be just my headset acting up, but the sound effect was broken in so many places. Still good use and compositions for each moment though.Character: 10/10I said the worst thing about this series is in its characters. Yes, it\'s true.Most of them show too little emotion. But that changes over the course of the series. One even became the best girl for me even.Worst thing about them is that they are full of lies or information bending. Which I do everyday and which I hate the most. But that\'s how they are so likable.Enjoyment: 10/10I almost made it 9/10. But as I have no right to take 1 point off because I can\'t think of having some part of it in my life, I just had to score it rightly.Edit:At the time I wrote this review, I believed I found my very ""best girl"" in Souma Sumire.But as I went through SaeKano today, this seat just got taken from her.Really, sorry, Sumire.Twice the sorry, even. right away.

Really? I'm sorry, but you cannot just decide that when a show is only aired halfway through.A SUMMARYAsai Kei has the ability to remember everything he experiences, Haruki Misora can reset time up to three days back with some restrictions and now combine these two and you can get the perfect time machine. The flow of the story is quite slow. since it takes its sweet time to introduce every character, develop them and integrate them into the story. It might seem a bit of a bore at first but if you can be patient the plot goes in deeper and...it doesn't disappoint.Why should you watch it? Because it is worth the time and its interesting.If you want a science fiction, kind of paradoxical and a little hint of romance this one's the one you are looking for. Decide for yourself if it was a hit or a miss. I like to keep my reviews short so, I'll end by saying I liked it and I of course recommend it. it doesn't disappoint.Why should you watch it?

What I thought would have been the average school, slice-of-life anime turned out to be one of the most thought-provoking series I’ve watched all season.The show is more so reflective and philosophical than action packed. It may seem slow but may also feel like there is a lot to digest and it can be thought...provoking but also pointlessly confusing. It lacks in all other areas so it’ll either be a hit or miss for most people. Whether it’s an intelligent series or just messing with us, that’s for you to decide. To be honest, I was unsure whether it was worth watching on at a couple of points. A lot of figurative talk.The show has a fractured storyline, it jumps between almost unrelated stories & then comes back, and eventually everything makes sense. It’s quite nice because it gives time to think about each story & where they might lead off to. There are a lot of clues in the visuals, dialogue and actions of the characters which aren’t particularly clear. We’re left hanging for a long time & while I do like the mystery, I feel it doesn’t contribute much to the story. The characters often talk about their motives here and there just in case you couldn’t figure out what they were doingThings match up, characters maintain their integrity throughout the story, and they change very slowly if not at all. We find out/can presume a bit about them but being critical, you could say they’re somewhat flat. There’s a lot of repetition within conversations & it almost feels weird to see the same facial expression all the time. After 20 eps, they still act the same. The main character having a reset ability doesn’t help much either (more repetition, yay!). Perhaps the point of having static characters without much personality is to point out the importance of emotions, they’re still humans with feelings after all.The art isn’t anything special without any particular detail. The series is mostly dialogue so you can expect some frozen frames where nothing moves other than the characters’ mouths. Lots of pokerfaces to look at.SoundThe OP/ED are a nice break from the dialogue & offers what I assume is the general message of the series since all 4 OP & EDs focus on the same points.The only thing I remember about the bgm is that suspenseful tune that pops up generally nearing the end of a conversation which continues until the end of the scene. It’s almost like thinking music reminding you to question the ideas being presented & it sets up the mood nicely.Summary+ Thought provoking, philosophical+ Fun & somewhat relaxing watch- Almost intentionally confusing- Slow & repetitive, mostly dialogue- Uninteresting visualsFinal thoughtsIt seems the first 20 episodes were just a setup for the last 5 episodes where everything comes together. I was a bit touched by the ending, there are a lot of different messages you could draw from the series.It had a lot of potential & it could have done a lot better, I'd give it an 8 but it felt a bit too shallow.

The concept of the anime is pretty interesting with the whole thing about time resetting, but honestly I thought about dropping the anime since the fourth episode. You need to take your time to watch and understand the events happening in Sakurada Reset.[ART & ANIMATION]The art was pretty decent for the most part of the series, but I’m not gonna lie, it had some drops. I like the art style of the characters, but sometimes...their hair didn’t seem natural. The background art was pretty normal, nothing that stands out of it, just simple. The animation was decent but sometimes they did abnormal movement of their bodies, but in the most part was a smooth animation.  (7/10)[SOUND]The soundtrack of the anime was pretty good, I sometimes found myself rocking out with the openings and endings of this anime. I honestly like the songs that they used, and the music was one of the factors that helps transmit the feeling that the anime wants to transmit. In the other hand, the voice acting started badly but it improve over time. I honestly believe that each voice actor fit it the characters that they portrayed, but they could not transmit the feelings of the characters to the viewer until the climax part of the anime.

By only reading the synopsis, the story actually sounds pretty interesting and makes you watch but the anime was a big disappointment for me. The events that unfolded during the series are pretty great and really interesting to watch, the problem that the anime has it’s the way that it tells the story. It gives so much information to the viewer in a short time, and most of it is useless.

(6/10)', ""This show is utterly amazing, and not for those not seeking for depth.Story takes place in the city of Sakurada, where people dispose of superpowers. Out of Sakurada, no other city presents this criteria. Therefore out of Sakurada, people have no power, even those who had some in it. Why ? Well you will understand the more you go, and will catch it eventually.Let's talk about the main problem it may have first. And you will see after why it is not necessarily a problem.The concept of time is extremely complicated to perceive. Once you stuck into it, or let one single detail out of...the picture, you sure are doomed for the rest of the show. Because every freaking element has sense. Why some characters do what they do, why some others, while knowing fully the consequences of what they do, and even some not wanting it, are forced, in a way, to continue to do it. At first i hated some characters, but finally come to love them or at least understand them a little bit more whilst continuing the show.Soundtracks of this anime are very intriguing, they really do catch well with the intention in it, you understand based on the sound, which situation you are at, it was pleasing my ear.NOW, the main STRENGTH of this anime is its characters. They are so, so, so well developed. I won't say anything about it, since it may contain spoils regarding their development, but hey, give it a try, you won't regret it ! the picture, you sure are doomed for the rest of the show. Because every freaking element has sense. Why some characters do what they do, why some others, while knowing fully the consequences of what they do, and even some not wanting it, are forced, in a way, to continue to do it. At first i hated some characters, but finally come to love them or at least understand them a little bit more whilst continuing the show.Soundtracks of this anime are very intriguing, they really do catch well with the intention in it, you understand based on the sound, which situation you are at, it was pleasing my ear.NOW, the main STRENGTH of this anime is its characters. They are so, so, so well developed. I won't say anything about it, since it may contain spoils regarding their development, but hey, give it a try, you won't regret it !"", 'Perhaps this is the rare case when an anime should be watched at least twice. ""Sagrada/Sakurada Reset"" is a real puzzle within a puzzle. There is an ""outer puzzle"" - story and confrontation brought to the surface, and there is also a hidden intricacies of motivations and ideals of characters, which are even more difficult to keep track of than the ""external"" rules of interaction of abilities and battles of wits. All the episodes in the ""Sakurada Reset"" are intertwined. The actions, dialogues, and reflections of the heroes demonstrated in some episodes are often continuations or keys to understanding the actions, dialogues and reflections of...the heroes in other episodes. This is the main feature as well complexity for understanding of the ""Sakurada"" - it is holistic, all the series are connected, although formally they can demonstrate different stories. But what happens to the characters during these different stories affects them and determines their development and behavior. In order for the mosaic to take shape as a whole, all these seemingly disparate episodes, dialogues, events and stories must be carefully listened to, examined, pondered and connected with each other. In order, for example, to understand the reasons for Kei\'s behavior in the fourth episode, when he comes to ""pour out his soul"" to Seika, but hides his difficulties from Misora, you need to carefully watch the first two episodes, listen to Sumire\'s opinion about him and Misora, and also watch Episodes 20 and 24. You can understand Misora only by reviewing the same first episodes, her childhood memories, listening to Sumire\'s statements, Kei\'s comments, watching a series dedicated exclusively to Misora, listening to her dialogue with herself in the episode with a dream, dialogue with Seika and the ending of the anime.When you’ll finally delve into and understand what is happening, when you’ll have a holistic picture and the ""keys"" that reveal the meaning of actions and dialogues by the protagonist in different episodes will be used, then the narration won\'t let you go. The plot, characters and their interactions are quite complex and deep. The main characters, Kei and Misora, as well as the minor characters, are very far from the stereotypical anime characters. They are introverted and not at all expressive, have complex motivations. A storm of emotions and thoughts, their principles and ideals are hidden under a detached appearance and only occasionally, but with restraint, are breaking through to the surface in seemingly “abstract” dialogues, statements and actions. Along with the principles and ideals, each of the characters has their own weaknesses and their own ""dark side"", to which it is even more difficult to ""get"". Watching the heroes, their interaction in a fantastic environment, you seem to be solving a rebus inside a rebus. There are small external detective episodes associated with certain characters and their stories. There is the main detective story, the main battle ""on the surface"". It occurs between, on the one hand, Kei, who seeks to protect the place which is ""sacred"" for him and Misora - Sagrada / Sakurada, a place where miracles happen that can overcome the ""sad rules"" of the ""outside"" world, devoid of miracles, and, on the other hand, Masamune, who hid personal grievances and desires behind the idea of ""happiness and equality for all"" by destroying miracles. But behind each little detective story is hidden unfolding of the story and personality of its main characters, behind the confrontation with Masamune is hidden unfolding of his story and personality, of the stories and personalities of his friends, Kei\'s ideas and principles, Sumire\'s motivations. And behind all this hiding unfolding of personalities of Kei and Misora themselves - a puzzle, the elements of which will fully assemble  only in the last episode (provided that you have already assembled and correctly folded the previous elements, which is very unlikely without re-viewing).This is a deep, subtle, intelligent and beautiful anime for those who will watch it not so much to have fun and relax, but to enjoy, in a good way, ""intellectual provocation"" with a complex and fascinating story, interesting and deep characters that develop and unfold in the course of the narrative, not even through numerous dialogues, as through actions and relationships with other characters. ""Sagrada/Sakurada Reset"" is a holistic mosaic of meaningful dialogues, deep relationships, thought experiments, philosophy, psychology, moral dilemmas and intellectual games. With a little effort of putting together this mosaic, the audience will get pleasure incomparable with the pleasure of watching other anime. If anything this anime is a vibrant proof that ratings mean little when it comes to choosing something of value to watch. Ratings may be good for entertaining things that could please wide audience but for something more special and original, something out of the ordinary, ratings are just hindrance.

For me ""Sakurada Reset"" is without a doubt one of the best anime ever.', ""Sakurada Reset is a strange show.Most people watching it will drop it after the first two or so episodes, for varying reasons. Maybe they're thrown off by the long, quiet conversations. Or the many completely quiet, still shots of people and the scenery. There are a multitude of reasons why people drop Sakurada Reset, and these reasons are why the show has such a criminally low rating on this site.But when you keep watching, almost without realizing it, the show manages to grip your heart completely. Those long conversations, before boring and pointless, now have you gripping onto every word and every moment...of silence. You find yourself enamored by Sakurada Reset, this strange show which you most likely had never even heard about before watching it. And you will come out of watching the ending satisfied, which is somewhat rare for anime.Sakurada Reset tells the story of Asai Kei and Misora Haruki, a duo who, by combining their respective powers, have the power to travel backwards in time by three days to help the people around them. Through this premise, along with ingenious usage of all of the show's abilities, Sakurada Reset manages to create one of the most compelling mystery shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching.I think the best way to watch Sakurada Reset is going into it with zero expectations. It is a genuinely very well made show, but going in with the wrong expectations will inevitably leave you bored. The show is slow in the beginning, but gathers up speed like a snowball rolling downhill. It's a show I would very much recommend you watch, just keeping in mind that it takes its time. If I had to say, watching the first four episodes gives a pretty good idea of what you're getting yourself into. of silence.

Among its residents are Kei Asai, who has a perfect memory that can\'t be tampered with, and Haruki Misora, who can reset time up to 72 hours back whenever she sets up a save point to set the time back to. Both of them are members of the Service Club, a club where the two are assigned to handle unique dilemmas coming from ability users. Unknown to them however, the Service Club is part of a larger chain of events transpiring within the...town.Sakurada Reset has gotten some rather divided reception among fans due to how it chooses to execute its storytelling. It goes the route of the Monogatari franchise in that good chunks of the series feature characters being in long-winded conversations where they talk about their abilities and perceptions of their everyday lives. What made this approach popular among Monogatari fans was that this was accompanied by the colorful and eccentric personalities of its cast. This is not the case with Sakurada Reset throughout much of its run, as characters barely emote as they talk nor express anything resembling a human personality. This unfortunately makes the characters come off seeming like robots or ""talking heads"" (depending on how you view them), and makes it quite a struggle to get through roughly the first two-thirds of the anime series. This is especially bad with Haruki\'s character, as she sounds almost robotic talking, not able to think independently, and seemingly only exists for Kei to use her reset ability whenever he\'s in a pinch.The handling of the character abilities is also a bit of a mixed bag. In concept, all the characters have specific restrictions and conditions they have for utilizing their abilities. To its credit, this keeps the characters from getting too overpowered within Sakurada Reset and they have to think carefully over the best means to utilize their abilities for varying situations. For instance, Kei\'s ""perfect memory"" lets him recall events from prior resets that Haruki made, since she forgets of events that occurred following the previous ""save point"" she set prior to a reset. However, the show\'s rather subpar animation does hinder how spectacular some of the more fantastical abilities of the series are rendered such as Sasano\'s ability to enter the world of a photo for a limited time and Ukawa\'s ability to manipulate the properties of objects.As far as the story goes, much of the first two-thirds of Sagrada Reset is focused on exploring the town and introducing a number of ability users, a number of whom have personal problems related to their abilities that Kei and Haruki have to resolve. On the one hand, the series does do a solid job with dabbling into each character\'s problems, with Kei having to do much of the guesswork in figuring out how to resolve each crisis. In addition, hints are usually dropped about the larger situation that Kei and others gradually find themselves getting into. However due to the mentioned issue with characters barely seeming human throughout much of the series, it does kill quite a bit of investment for the audience to give a hoot about what goes on throughout much of the series.Miraculously, the final third of Sakurada Reset offers a considerably improved experience over its early two-thirds if you are able to press on that far. The larger conflict that comes at hand at this point in the series offers a clash of philosophies over the abilities given to people within Sakurada and puts Kei\'s abilities to the biggest test in resolving the crisis. The storytelling is genuinely more engaging with some major characters forced into making hard decisions to aid one another and having some genuinely engaging dramatic developments in which the characters actually emote more often. This easily makes the final third of Sakurada Reset the best point within the series to watch through and a good reward after struggling through the stagnant first two-thirds of its run.Overall, I suppose I found Sakurada Reset a bit of a mixed bag. While it has a unique premise with solid exploration of its world and characters, elements of its design and direction such as its subpar animation, heavy focus on character conversations, and almost-robotic character interactions hinder how receptive many viewers would be to viewing the series. The final third of the series is a considerable improvement with how the characters express themselves due to the raised stakes of the conflict they find themselves in. But this alone is not enough for me to believe it improves the quality of Sakurada Reset as a whole, and is certainly an area where I can see the show\'s divided reception comes into play. town.Sakurada Reset has gotten some rather divided reception among fans due to how it chooses to execute its storytelling.

The male lead and heroine are a couple of androids, one is like Star Trek\'s Lore without the malevolent behavior or insanity (or, actually, a very very dry Hachiman Hikigaya from Oregairu), the other is Data but female. The recurring mechanic in the show is that the girl can reset...time once, but only on the boy\'s command, which I thought was rather ludicrous. Even more ludicrous is the fact that either very little is shown of why they\'re like this, or the way it\'s told was sufficiently dry that it never clicked with me, as though their motivations weren\'t nearly as important as cramming every episode with reams of dry, monotonous dialogue.The first arc and bits of the closing arc kept me interested, mainly because the 3rd wheel, I mean, character is a bit more colorful. But the production saw fit to remove her from existence at the end of the first arc (er, spoiler warning), so the conversations became much more dull and stultifying-- to abuse another Trek reference, it\'s like they killed off Bones and used Spock and Kirk on tranquilizers. The way she was brought back after 2 or 3 more arcs is interesting, but overall not compelling.Compound that with an antagonist whose sole motivation for being an obnoxious and dangerous nuisance is to somehow prove that she\'s better than the male lead because he snubbed her this one time. Yes, really. And you thought the Frost brothers from Gundam X were bad (briefly, ""We will destroy all of humanity because we weren\'t picked to be Newtypes""), or Bizon from Buddy Complex. She has to be one of the worst-written villains in my memory-- and I\'ve seen pretty terribly-written villains in American cartoons (she came across as a really unpleasant Mandark who never laughs)-- so I just skipped over her scenes. The ultimate antagonist is more interesting, and yet, too godlike in my opinion. I don\'t enjoy ""hopelessly inept"" villains that much, but I think ""flawlessly perfect"" villains are worse, because honestly, they\'re cop-outs compared to writing actual, believable characters.Were the plot and soundtrack interesting? Honestly, I just don\'t care enough to remember. The characters were animated about as interestingly as they were written, which means, they often wore the same expression throughout the entire !@#^$% series. Is this an artistic thing? Were the animation/episode directors even trying, or was creating some sort of world of mannequins more important than making a flippin\' show entertaining to watch?

Yes, there is. Is the voice acting competent in that it maintains a consistent tone of voice for its characters, and there\'s no flub takes being snuck into the final product? Also, yes. Is there a narrative that builds...toward some sort of conclusion? I cannot say no. Neither of these things can be justifications that I in good faith can recommend another person to endeavor this joyless experience.Kei Asai is the main character, and you love him because he has blue hair, sits in the back of the classroom next to the window, goes to the rooftop for lunch, and believes in justice real hard. He wants to wipe the tears of every crying child. He wants to lead lost puppies back to their homes and set out milk bowls for all the starving cats. Happiness is not just a word, it\'s a permanent reality you can achieve if you accept Kei Asai into your heart and allow him to do what he feels is best for you. To quote one of his sycophants, ""Those who wish to save the world know what\'s right for the world to be saved"" - the ends justify the means, and if you\'ll leave both of those up to Kei, he\'ll lead you to the Promised Land. Parallels to Jesus Christ are unavoidable, with the glaring omission that Kei does not end up nailed to a cross in the final act to give some sort of catharsis to the viewer.It\'s not just that he\'s self-righteous, infallible, unflappable, egoless and always right. It\'s that there\'s nothing else. Women fall in love with him, not because of his charms, but because he\'s Kei Asai. Former antagonists rally up behind him because he\'s Kei Asai. His motives or reasoning never needs to be questioned; people follow him because he\'s Kei Asai. There\'s no character development, no flaws, mistakes that trigger self-reflection, earthly desires that compete with his superego. He\'s flatter than flatbread on the back of a flatbed truck.It\'s not just a case of ""bad main character, bad anime"". Anime can have reprehensible protagonists while being grossly entertaining (albeit controversial, School Days would be an example of this for me, your mileage may vary). But there are no other characters in the show, they are mere extensions of Kei Asai\'s will. They might be initially opposed to him, but soon enough they\'ll see the error of their ways and subject themselves to becoming another screwdriver or hammer in his tool belt. Apart from the main ""bad guy"", their motivations rank from ""I want Kei Asai to succeed"" to ""I love Kei Asai and its troublesome that other people do the same"". Cult leaders and totalitarian dictators wish they had subjects as subservient as the supporting cast in this anime.Maybe the plot is great? No, as prior described, characters lack motivations, never does Kei Asai\'s righteous decisions backfire, the stakes are not properly established and whenever our hero is in a pickle the anime can wring some use case out of the abilities to have him come up smelling of roses every time. The arc format doesn\'t help matters as it\'s just another fair maiden in a tower needing to be saved and the main plot is underdeveloped because of it. Dialogue is unnatural, trite, no one has a unique tone of voice, and they try too hard to appear smart by ham-fistedly shoehorning in philosophical concepts in-between the exposition too many times.I don\'t fault anyone for finding enjoyment in this anime, you might see qualities I am blind to and I\'m happy you liked it. For me, this was an utterly joyless ordeal, but I at least watched it with people I love, so once the ugly head was reared, we could make fun of how bad it is, but even then, there are way better anime for that purpose.

Don\'t watch this.', ""I'm writing this review because IMO this anime is severely underappreciated. I read most of the bad reviews and they usually complain about bad characters, no character development, slow burn story etc. and dropping it early on, so that's pretty much a preliminary judgement that shouldn't be used to sway would-be watchers. So let me break it down on my own terms:Story - 8/10, the whole anime is a study of different philosophical and existential ideas, and the way they introduce and execute it is very well down IMO! You would be surprised how much it will pique your interest and pick your brain. If...you love complex, you would feel at home with this story. I don't deny it is slow to pick up but when it does, you'll be pressing next episode when the credits roll in.Art/Sound - Not bad, granted its not action oriented so art and sound are pretty much average and a little bland but it doesn't detract on the overall themes of the story.Character - This I would say is a 7-8 for me, but probably more of a 7. The themes and topics are the forefront of the anime, and it is mostly those topics that drive it. The characters are pretty much tools to convey those topics and not the ones that drive the story forward.Enjoyment - 8 because I really like how they executed the overarching themes and topics. you love complex, you would feel at home with this story.

If you're into that kind of stuff, give this one a go.Story: 9/10Truly a clever story involving people with supernatural powers. The main selling point is the time traveling ability, which is executed in its own unique style. However, it does have a very slow and confusing start. It starts picking up and culminates in an amazing conflict between the MC and the antagonist near the end. Also, there is a lot of philosophical conversations that you may not care for.Art: 8/10Pretty good.Sound: 6/10Nothing too memorable...except the first opening?Character: 6/10Some characters are outstanding; others not so much. My least favorite by far is unfortunately the female lead, Haruki. She feels like a robot whose controller is in Kei's (the male lead) hands for at least 95% of the show. I honestly don't think I've seen a more passive, uninteresting individual in all of fiction. There is some character development with her but it's difficult to relate. Kei and Soma, however, are great. Especially Soma.Enjoyment: 7/10Although the story is fantastic, the enjoyment factor takes some serious hits due to the bland direction unfitting for an anime adaption. I feel as if I'm watching a novel rather than an animated show, if that makes sense. For example, there are no special effects when someone uses a special ability, so it's hard to tell whenever actually uses one. The voice acting is lethargic, like detached kids reading aloud a mundane textbook. The overall enjoyment factor is good but the anime takes no advantage of the medium, instead relying on the source material .Overall: 7/10Although I have not read the books, I suspect that Sakurada Reset is an excellent light novel series that got a somewhat mediocre anime adaptation. The plot is fantastic, but at times I wish I were consuming it in its text form instead.== spoilers about Soma for ranting purposes ==My least favorite part of the anime, as I have said, is Haruki. She is extremely boring. She might as well be just a red button Kei presses whenever he wants to reset. Soma, on the other hand, is an interesting, expressive, and worlds ahead of Haruki overall. I felt really bad when Soma got rejected by Kei four separate times in favor of Haruki, after all she's done for him. Soma sacrificed so much and she gets nothing in return. *sigh* The only main gripe I had with the story in general. except the first opening?Character: 6/10Some characters are outstanding; others not so much.

Kidou Senshi Gundam II: Ai Senshi-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1091/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_II__Ai_Senshi-hen,"[""Mobile Suit Gundam: the Movie Trilogy is the definitive incarnation of the massively influential Mobile Suit Gundam TV series. It may not be perfect, but it definitely deserves its lofty status in the history of anime as a proven classic. As one cannot have one part of the trilogy without the others, this review will cover all three of the compilation movies.The first question on any new viewer's mind regarding the story of Mobile Suit Gundam: the Movie Trilogy (MSG) would be: &quot;Do the films condense too much story from the TV series to fit into its limited run time?&quot; The answer to that is...&quot;no&quot;. MSG takes the liberty to cut some of the flab from the original series and manages very well in terms of preserving the integrity of the story. The pacing may strike as a little faster than usual, but there are no glaring problems pertaining to the question above.The story of MSG follows the crew of White Base, a secret earth federation battleship housing the RX-78-2 Gundam. The protagonist, Amuro Ray, makes the difficult transition from an ordinary civilian to the ace pilot of the federation military, along with a number of other civilians who were also pulled into the conflict against the Principality of Zeon when their space colony was destroyed by a Zeon attack, the purpose of which was to destroy the White Base, along with the experimental mobile suits being developed in secrecy. The long journey aboard the White Base exposes Amuro to many ugly facets of war far beyond the destruction of his home and the loss of life. In the midst of it all, Amuro is burdened with the responsibility of risking life and limb to protect his friends and comrades aboard the White Base, a target of constant Zeon attack, with the gundam. All this weaves an engrossing tale of struggle and growth, rife with challenges on and off the battlefield, making MSG a very interesting war story. There is an epic feel to the films, because though the adventure of the White Base stretches over many destinations, it is but a small part of the vast web of war and politics that makes up the interstellar conflict, and the characters' struggle for survival in the monstrous web makes them seem all the more vulnerable and the story that much more gripping.The characters of MSG are some of the most iconic in the history of anime. Amuro, as mentioned above, is a very well-developed character. His teenage angst may strike as a little too much in the beginning, but his clear maturation throughout the story makes him an endearing character. The antagonists of MSG also also equally memorable, as they are some of the best antagonists one will come across in anime: the cunning and skillful Char Aznable and Ramba Ral, the bold and courageous Dozle Zabi, and even the cold and calculated Ghiren Zabi -- all of them have plenty of admirable traits that really makes the viewer respect the nazi-inspired Zeon. Even when these antagonists bite the dust, the viewer would still feel for them.Hailing from the early 80's, MSG's visuals and sounds are quite aged. Though the animation has definitely improved from the sometimes laughable quality of the original TV series, it will not win over any new anime fans by itself. The frame rate is low, the proportion are sometimes warped, and the details are always shallow. Yet despite all this, MSG still manages to produce a number of memorable battle scenes, which is something to applaud for. The mecha designs, especially that of the gundam and zaku II, influenced mecha designs for decades to come. Even to this day, these old-school robots are sights to behold. The sound effects of MSG are almost as iconic as the mobile suits themselves. Fans will recognize the buzzing sound of the beam saber as well as blast of the beam rifle from miles away. Granted, the quality of these sound effects aren't anything amazing objectively, but they serve their functions well, and their nostalgia value is beyond measure. There are also a couple of very catchy battles tunes to be heard, as well as great sound acting, though Amuro's voice may be a little over-the-top at times.In the end, Mobile Suit Gundam: the Movie Trilogy should be a must-watch for anyone interested in mecha anime or the history of anime in general. Its influence, popularity, and historic value is simply through the roof. There is a reason why even almost three decades later, model kits of the old RX-78-2 are still selling like hotcakes and the name &quot;Char Aznable&quot; remains recognized almost everywhere in japan. MSG is the very definition of a classic, and this fact cannot be denied. What lies in question is the modern viewer's enjoyment of the aged classic. But with a stellar story and memorable characters, MSG still has the quality to win over its viewers, a quality that will most likely remain as long as there exists people who watch anime. &quot;no&quot;.

It was easier to understand what was going on. Moreover it had better drama. That was better because it didn't seem too forceful compared to the first movie.Art: The animation was still as good. However I found it odd that some characters especially the female ones looked practically the same except for hairstyles (Hamon and Matilda). Not really a flaw but worth noticing.Sound: Nothing much to say here, the sound effects and the battle themes were well done. I think the voice acting was great too except for the kids. In my opinion it...didn't match them.Character: Well, supporting characters got development, that's a plus. As a whole it was good but still there was too many mysteries going on (Sayla Mass didn't make sense to me even though I liked her character). The real drawback here is the kids playing as comic relief. Not that I hate children but they were unnecessary (as comic relief) in a war setting. It was better when they actually try to help instead of fooling around.Enjoyment: It was fairly entertaining to me. More battles means less politics means less confusing or less boring. Nothing wrong with politics but it shouldn't be the main plot(I mean it should stay more battle-oriented).

To kick off this year\'s film festival week, I\'m going to be talking about the second film in that trilogy, Soldiers of Sorrow. To start with a quick recap, the Federation and space Nazis IE Zeon are at war. Our protagonists are a Federation force largely made up of teenagers, because so many adults have died. They\'re piloting the White Base on a mission.Story:So, our protagonists continue to make their way to Jaburo while getting into constant battles with Zeon and receiving limited support from the Federation...higher ups. Meanwhile, Char is continuing his subtle quest for revenge.The story actually has the same major flaw as the first film. A lot of what happens whether its character deaths or ""twists"" is really obvious. And not just based on mecha tropes but based on general science fiction and literary tropes that predate this franchise. The death flags especially. Every time a major character is about to go to their death in this and the previous film, they have some scene where it\'s very obvious they won\'t return from what they\'re about to do. Which does make it a little boring.The only part of the narrative I\'m really invested in is Char\'s whole story arc. Which is kind of compelling and the idea behind it may not be original but it\'s one where there are a lot of ways to go with it. And I do still appreciate the fact that the series does explain why teenagers are out on the battlefield.Characters:The characters, save Char, are still pretty uncompelling. Which isn\'t just a problem because it makes it difficult to get invested in the film, but it\'s a problem because we have multiple death scenes that we\'re supposed to have some emotional response to. And it\'s difficult to imagine anyone actually having that kind of emotional investment in these characters. So, these scenes that are clearly supposed to have an impact just fall flat.Another issue I have with the series is that the personnel of White Base ultimately decide to keep taking a trio of small children into battle with them. Which is one of those things where it doesn\'t have verisimilitude and it\'s just stupid in context. It made some sense in the first film when they were on the run and didn\'t have anywhere to leave them, but this is after they have a chance to send them to safety.Art:The artwork has the same issue as the first film. It simply hasn\'t aged well. And it\'s one of those cases where it would be completely forgiveable if there was a really strong script to recommend the film but the relatively mediocre script just makes it more glaring.Sound:Like the first film, the acting is completely passable but limited due to the under-written characters. The music is still pretty good. Matsuyama Yuushi & Watanabe Takeo did a good job.Ho-yay:There\'s none to be seen.Areas of Improvement:1. A more complex cast. Having some supporting characters who are a bit under-developed is fine but the main cast in this is are lacking. And the characters who die and we\'re supposed to sympathise with are also quite shallow. And that is a pretty significant issue.2. Still needs some subversion. Again, it\'s not a problem to play some tropes straight. It is a problem when you use a lot of tropes and play all of them straight. I shouldn\'t be able to predict which character is about to die based on one scene five minutes before their death with a hundred percent accuracy.3. Small children do not belong on a vessel designed for war. I shouldn\'t even have to say that.Final Thoughts:Like the first film in the trilogy, this one isn\'t bad nor is it good. It\'s largely just a super tropey, mediocre piece. As such, I\'m also giving it a 5/10. higher ups.

Upping that ante from the previous movie, there really isn't much to say about it other than the fact that the movie is a middle chapter to larger story. This one contains more action, character development and finally some plot, something I felt was sorely missing from the previous movie.The main subject of discussion here would be character development. Even relatively minor characters like Matilda and Kai get some, further reinforcing them as believable human beings. Of note is Amuro's development. Previously, we saw him as a reluctant teenager drawn into a mess he...had no escape from. Coming to accept his new responsibility, we interestingly see him develop ego issues. However, by far the most interesting character development is that of the enemy. Tomino's sombre vision of war calls for a fair depiction of both sides of the conflict. We are reminded through characters like Ramba Ral and Miharu that both sides involve people with much to lose and suffer. This is also emphasized by several tragic character deaths on the side of the protagonists.Plotwise, this movie was much more interesting than the previous. The Newtype concept is expanded through discussions among the characters, fully coming to head in the final movie. Though only through a rather short confrontation, the true identity of Sayla is hinted at and also is finally revealed in the last chapter.I really don't have much to say. Overall, the movie rightly feels like a middle chapter with the movie beginning with action and ending with action, setting up for the space conflicts to follow. had no escape from.

They\'re not stitched together in a way that indicates progression, aside from the mere fact of certain people dying at certain times. It is nonetheless compelling in isolated instances.Watching this reminded me of something people are always saying about Eureka Seven. They say it\'s ""just Mobile Suit Gundam again,"" but it\'s so obviously untrue. Eureka Seven is, rather, THE BEST PARTS of Mobile Suit Gundam, remixed and combined and extended so that they\'re often running simultaneously and throughout the show. For example, the section in this where Amuro meets...Ral and Hamon in the bar and they try to befriend him could not have taken more than an episode in the original show. In Eureka Seven, that episode became the entire Charles and Ray arc, which was also by far the best part. No (or, at least, very few) of the Gundam shows are masterpieces individually. The original series, so far, certainly isn\'t. Nonetheless, this 6 or 7 out of 10 show is replete with 10/10 ideas and we are so fortunate that it became as influential as it did.

With superb pacing, each scene flows right into the next with incredible finesse. Nothing feels rushed and nothing feels overly done. There\'s a strong amount of respect for the characters and the events taking place. I have to say that the 0079 series is impressing me in every way. From the complex and realistic drama between the characters and Char\'s absolutely captivating character in general, I cannot wait to learn more and more about these characters and the world they live in.I\'m starting to wonder if Gundam is the ""Starship Troopers"" of the eastern world, in that it\'s an excellent science-fiction...narrative that is respectable piece of military literature.

While it\'s hard to get into at first since the animation is so different in comparison to the digital age, you\'ll find it\'s quick and easy to keep focused during any and every scene in this film. The animation flows much better than the previous work, and action sequences feel tighter and riskier than any other. The climax will definitely be a memorable combat sequence for me in anime, as well as the confrontation that the whole film has viewers waiting for.And not just the animation but the background\'s look stunning and each region looks significantly different. This made the world feel more real in that not everywhere was the same, boring background.Sound:Really freaking great. The OST is fantastic, and the combat sequences sound fresh and intimate. Slower sections of the film have really good ambient sounds to bring the scene to life.Character:Holy cow, this film handled everyone\'s characters a lot better than the first. Not that the first didn\'t do a great job, but this one in particular really stood out. The whole film had a great balance of action and drama, and even at times paired the two so seamlessly. Really brilliant, and makes you realize this film is more than an action film but really a space opera unfolding at the perfect pace.Enjoyment:A whole lot of fun. I\'m excited just at the prospect of REWATCHING this film. This series is great, and I can\'t wait to jump right into the last film. I\'m so glad this franchise grew to what it is today.

I bought the film trilogy off of rightstuf and started my journey. Keep in mind I am familiar with anime on the older side especially the 70s such as Versailles no bara/Lupin the third. The 1st movie was condensed admirably from the show and did not have too much of a jarring plot progression and pace. Coming to the second film though I was surprised how packed and frankly divided it was. The first half of the...film does leave off where the first film left off but the editing and sequence of events were clearly shifted greatly where the boring moments with diplomats and the white base just lazily stagnant are put together begrudgingly. *SPOILER* Garma's death is brought forward which is great to see.Overall, it was a bit lazier in effort than the first, but if you have a day to catch up on Gundam, get a big bag of popcorn because you're going to need it. film does leave off where the first film left off but the editing and sequence of events were clearly shifted greatly where the boring moments with diplomats and the white base just lazily stagnant are put together begrudgingly. *SPOILER* Garma's death is brought forward which is great to see.Overall, it was a bit lazier in effort than the first, but if you have a day to catch up on Gundam, get a big bag of popcorn because you're going to need it."", ""The second installment of the Gundam Mobile Suit trilogy delves deeper into the consequences of war, which makes for some terrific character development and world-building. Amuro fights his inner demons as the conflict rages on. At the same time, we get a better glimpse at how the Zeons operate. The story is well done, but some of the novelty has worn off as we know what to expect.I do feel like the middle of this movie meanders and lags just a bit, a lull that is made up for an epic battle between Amuro and Char. Once again, things aren't really wrapped up, so...getting the whole story means watching the whole trilogy.Recommended. getting the whole story means watching the whole trilogy.Recommended."", ""The second Mobile Suit Gundam movie does improve on aspects from the first movie, but it doesn't envelop you in its magic as well as the first one does. The tense moments in Mobile Suit Gundam II feel more stressful to the viewer, such as the scene where Amuro is eating at the restaurant, or just the simple fact that Kai knowingly aids an enemy spy. These little details are much more impressive in this sequel.It's kind of hard to explain the shortcomings of this movie. It's just simply not as engaging and stimulating as the first movie. Not sure what the reasons are, but...you can just sense that something is missing to make II equally as magic as I, even though II has much more thrilling scenes. It's missing a little bit of magic.Don't let these listed shortcomings turn you off of watching this film, though.

I believe it fulfills this task quite well, although not without its typical compromises. First of all, let\'s talk about length.Similar to the previous film, the second installment is approximately 2 hours long. While that\'s quite lengthy for a movie, it\'s always worth noting that certain elements have been condensed to emphasize the film\'s core themes. This is by no means a real concern, as it provides a clear understanding of each character.There\'s a substantial amount to unpack in...this movie. The amount of information presented may be a bit overwhelming, but given the heightened stakes in this movie, it\'s understandable.The bulk of the film centers around the main characters and the White Base in a significant military operation, among other battles. Additionally, the concept of Newtypes is explored, with many characters commenting on it, although they remain uncertain about what a Newtype is supposed to be. The film also delves into the morality of both Zeon and the Federation, depicting soldiers and officials engaging in actions that could be seen as both noble and questionable.The title ""Soldiers of Sorrow"" is very fitting for this chapter, as there are several deaths in this film and a rather serious sequence of events throughout. The main character, Amuro, continues to have his will to go on tested, although he is not without his faults himself. We also witness the character development and the building of relationships between other characters such as Char, Sayla, Kai, and Frau.Much like its predecessor, I would say this film effectively conveys its intended vision to the audience.

You can clearly see in a way how life was like back in the 70s and Mobile Suit Gundam portrays the people’s perspective and outlook of the future with its flying cars, giant robots and Space Battle Ships.This trilogy does a great job in condensing the story line with a very decent pace. This second movie does an even better job in following this military drama.Though it was intended for children the plot touches on deep subjects such as the death...of family and friends, betrayal and self improvement through difficult times, all which you can see in the path of the MC Ray Amuro.

There's a lack of focus which further complicates things, where the first film was heavily focused on detailing Amuro's descent from just an innocent child into a victim of PTSD, Gundam II lacks any specific theme or character to specifically explore in depth.Not to say...Gundam II is a bad film, but it is lacking in the overall cohesion and refinement of the first film - it has its moments (a lot of really nice moments), but they all fail to properly go anywhere and are mostly one off moments, and the focus on the controversy around the discussion of Newtypes was a welcome addition to the story. A further thing to note, is that a lot of named characters are easily killed in the film, new ones and old ones, which adds a certain sense of gravity to the war, knowing that the residents of White Base aren't magically saved from death just because they have a name and history to them.The audio direction also feels as though it is glorifying the combat a lot of the time, rather than being juxtapositional.

Kidou Shinseiki Gundam X,https://myanimelist.net/anime/92/Kidou_Shinseiki_Gundam_X,"['Ah... Gundam X. How long I had waited to see you.It\'s a damn shame that After War Gundam X is the least popular of all the Gundam shows, because it really is an impressive piece of work and probably one of, if not the best of Gundam spinoffs. It has the realism that Wing does not, the maturity missing from SEED, and the extra kick lacking in 00. The only Gundam since the original to be cancelled, and to be honest that\'s the biggest fault X has. You can\'t help but wonder what could\'ve been if only that episode count reached 50.Story: 10/10At the start...of the show we meet Garrod Ran, a young mercenary of only 15 years of age and lets just say, he does some pretty amazing stuff for a guy his age. After taking a rescue job he meets the target, Tiffa Adill, a mysterious young newtype girl. However, upon learning that his employer would only exploit her for her abilities, Garrod turns on him and joins the very group he ""rescued"" her from, the mercenary ship ""Freeden"". With the help of Tiffa\'s abilities, the crew of the Freeden continues their search to help any newtypes who are being unjustly used by others.Gundam X has one very crucial element that no other Gundam spinoff does. It feels like a U.C. show. In the world of Gundam X, the colonists have seemingly dropped all of the colonies down to the Earth as opposed to just one, and the human population is relatively miniscule. Because of this, many people consider the After War universe to be an alternate reality to the Universal Century, as opposed to a standalone universe such as the Cosmic Era from SEED or the Future Century from G Gundam.Without spoiling anything I have to point out again that Gundam X ended 11 episodes early at episode 39 as opposed to 50. Because of this a lot of people feel the ending is rushed. I have to disagree to an extent. Although the ending moves very fast(quite a bit happens in those last 8 episodes in very little time) it wraps things up quite nicely and I can\'t but feel that\'s almost exactly how the original ending would\'ve gone. Still, I\'d love to see those missing 11 episodes.Art: 7/10The art style is good, but let\'s just say the animation could\'ve had a better budget for its time. Roughly the same quality as Wing. Definitely the biggest negative to X in the aesthetics department, but it\'s more good than bad. The gundam designs are pretty outlandish, but for how badass they look, they aren\'t invincible, unlike the SEED and Wing gundams, which is great. The Freeden pilots have an uphill battle ahead of them.Sound: 10/10Great voice acting and one hell of a score. The Gundam X openings (by the amazing group Romantic Mode) are some of my favorite openings in all the anime I\'ve seen, and in regards to the ending credits, I rarely sit through ending credits but for this show I made an exception. The three ending themes(two of them are different language versions of the same song) are some the best that I\'ve ever heard used in anything, anime or otherwise. As for the score, I\'m always humming one or two tracks here and there. Great soundtracks.Character: 8/10At first I thought this was the biggest weakness Gundam X had. A few episodes later and I was proved wrong. All I can say without spoiling you is that it\'s definitely enough character development. At first the show seems to be only about Tiffa and Garrod, but over time it focuses on other characters well enough. Tiffa and Garrod are still the most important characters, but it doesn\'t terribly overshadow the anyone else. There are still flaws, such as expanding on a few bit characters who don\'t show up for more than 10 minutes of screen time, and the Frost Brothers up until the last arc, but overall it\'s all good.Enjoyment: 10/10Gundam X is definitely not the best Gundam show, but damn if it isn\'t the most likeable. It\'s hard to hate this show. It may not be a masterpiece, but it\'s one hell of a ride from start to finish. Garrod in particular is just an amazingly well done protagonist. He\'s impossible to hate, and he\'s always believable. He\'s extremely street smart, but not a genius; very skilled in battle but not exactly soldier by any sense of the word. From the very first episode, he is kicking things in gear and you just want to strap yourself in for the roller coaster ride he\'s going to deliver.Overall: 9/10I like to refer to Gundam X as the Daft Punk of Gundam. Anyone who\'s experienced it can\'t hate it in the least. I give it a 9 because hell, I can\'t deny how much fun I had. I enjoyed this more than G Gundam, and that\'s saying a hell of a lot. A great balance of the always enjoyable shonen heroism while still keeping that tomino-esque reality that the original gundams had. You can even find some parallels between X and Tomino\'s own Crossbone Gundam graphic novel, strangely enough. If you can watch After War Gundam X, then do so. Chances are you won\'t be disappointed. of the show we meet Garrod Ran, a young mercenary of only 15 years of age and lets just say, he does some pretty amazing stuff for a guy his age.

We'll probably never know what set of circumstances led to the early end of its broadcast in Japan, but there is one thing I can say. Much like the original Gundam series, Gundam X was extremely underappreciated in its time.In a technical sense, the art, music and sound effects are roughly equal to Gundam Wing. They were produced back to back, so this is expectable. If you've seen Gundam Wing, then you know what Gundam X looks and...sounds like.What really sets Gundam X apart, especially from its immediate predecessor, is its characters. Gundam X is full of characters that you can actually care about. In particular, Garrod and Tifa's relationship is extremely genuine and endearing. This is quite a feat for a genre of anime not particularly well known for being able to develop a believable romance.The plot of Gundam X is well paced, keeping a good momentum and tension throughout. Each episode tends to leave you hanging, and craving more. This structure worked well for Escaflowne, and it works very well here too.Overall, don't write this Gundam off just because you heard it got canceled. I consider this the best of the AU Gundam series, and enjoy it on the same level as the original series. Any Gundam or mecha fan should see this series. sounds like.What really sets Gundam X apart, especially from its immediate predecessor, is its characters.

Any Gundam or mecha fan should see this series."", 'Alll I can say is, this is definitely one of the most underrated Gundams of the franchise, and an underrated anime in general. I don&rsquo;t get why the hell they can bring SEED and SEED Destiny, and not X and/or Turn A? What I really liked about this series was it took a different direction with the newtype concept that was a re-occuring element in the UC sagas, mostly in Zeta and CCA. Yes, newtypes can be elite pilots, but Tifa demonstrates that newtypes aren&rsquo;t exclusive to this rolel. Granted the extremity this anime took with that concept felt out of place for Gundam, in...no ways did I feel any sense of intensity or suspense was ruined, but I felt it built it up. I would elaborate how unique this series makes its own interpretation of the newtype concept but it would be a spoiler and I encourage you to see the series for yourself to understand what I mean.But other than that, it still retains the other characteristics from other Gundam series, and redefines and advances them. Garoad you can say is more of a modern day interpretation of Judeau Ashita from Double Zeta. He&rsquo;s young, but he&rsquo;s a guy who is out doing his job and circumstances just led him to where he is. What&rsquo;s also unique is that he&rsquo;s not a newtype but yet, he just naturally develops his piloting skills. Tifa&rsquo;s character was just new to me, and I felt the nature of her character felt out of place for Gundam, but because this isn&rsquo;t the original Gundam and the intention was to go for something different and new, I felt she just simply served her purpose though I don&rsquo;t personally call her a top 5 female Gundam character. And as usual, the series will still have villains and antagonists you can relate to which the Frost bros do well at. The series does have some interesting twists and turns that will keep you guessing in relation to the characters and the overall story. I feel that because it&rsquo;s uniquely both characteristically and not characteristically Gundam at the same time give a new distinction it&rsquo;s trademark characteristics.Well, this series premiered after Gundam Wing, so most of the color schemes and gimmicks of the mechs will probably not really stand out since it mostly follows the approach that Gundam Wing has. But I guess some of the features of the GX where its main weapon needs to be powered by a satellite brings a new element to the engineering and the firepower that hasn&rsquo;t been used in past sagas makes it more fresh. And as I stated earlier, the mechs in general don&rsquo;t have any qualities that are necessarily fresh or new. Like the Leopard is pretty much a green colored firearms, and the design of the GX looks like the Wing Gundam but with a different set of wings.The character designs mostly in relation to the costume are a little wilder than your typical Gundam series, thus giving some reflection to its post apocalyptic nature. But other than that, you have generic bishounen and bishoujo designs but very tolerable. My favorite design is that of Jamil with a modern day old school approach. He wears a very ancient military style uniform, and his side burns and hair style is something more characteristic of a 1970s anime hero. And Tanya is just simply hot.The character design is nothing really cutting edge but still appropriate for its setting at some capacity. The battles are pretty interesting since a majority of this Gundam series takes place on Earth and I was wondering if there was ever going to be any traditional space battles, which has always been an iconic trait of the franchise. But I feel that the engineering and the gimmicks of the Gundams presented justified keeping the battles on earth territory for most of the series. But the battles are still intense and they excellently know how to apply land and air war fare with a different approach with more reliance on transforming mechs.Personally, I loved Takagi Wataru&rsquo;s unique approach to playing Garoad Ran. Even though he&rsquo;s achieved world fame as Onizuka Eikichi from GTO, I loved how he still retained his nasal voice and make Garoad come across as a teenager and as a wise ass. I thought it was a very brilliant performance. Granted Garoad has comedic traits, I think Takagi&rsquo;s addition who mostly does comedy roles does a great job in a more serious role such as this one himself. I think Jamil&rsquo;s voice actor, Horiuchi Kenyuu who is famous as playing Raiden in the Metal Gear Solid games brought a unique charisma to his character and also made him sound very intimidating. And another unique actress is Mitsuishi Kotono, who was also still playing Sailor Moon at the time is also the voice of Tanya, the bridge captain. Later she would come back to Gundam SEED. as the Captain of the Archangel. With her role in Gundam X, she brought Misato&rsquo;s party girl side to her character.The music is just intense and beautiful. The opening theme DREAMS just has this militaristic feel with how it opens, but yet transitions to this powerful song about hope and determination, and the ending themes sung in English sound like Love Lift Us Where We Belong, but brought a refreshing feel to the series. The background music is very appropriate for the series.Well, sadly, this Gundam had to be cut due to low ratings, but I heard that this series is finding rejuvenation in Japan with the DVD releases and people are appreciating it more. Artistically as I said earlier, it really does nothing to advance Gundam but I think it still maintained its spirit and really brought a unique and distinctive redefinition to some of its original foundation. Such as the themes and concepts behind the series with new types was what made it unique and was first brought into an alternate universe of Gundam which would later be brought back in SEED which I think they did a bad job of that concept in that series. I say it is required to have some familiarity with the original Gundam to understand the origin of its concepts such as colony drops and newtypes, and some familiarity with Gundam Wing to understand the mech design and style. This is something truly made for Gundam fans, and I think this is probably something that a casual anime fan or a hardcore anime fan that isn&rsquo;t into Gundam could probably handle. no ways did I feel any sense of intensity or suspense was ruined, but I felt it built it up. I would elaborate how unique this series makes its own interpretation of the newtype concept but it would be a spoiler and I encourage you to see the series for yourself to understand what I mean.But other than that, it still retains the other characteristics from other Gundam series, and redefines and advances them. Garoad you can say is more of a modern day interpretation of Judeau Ashita from Double Zeta. He&rsquo;s young, but he&rsquo;s a guy who is out doing his job and circumstances just led him to where he is. What&rsquo;s also unique is that he&rsquo;s not a newtype but yet, he just naturally develops his piloting skills. Tifa&rsquo;s character was just new to me, and I felt the nature of her character felt out of place for Gundam, but because this isn&rsquo;t the original Gundam and the intention was to go for something different and new, I felt she just simply served her purpose though I don&rsquo;t personally call her a top 5 female Gundam character. And as usual, the series will still have villains and antagonists you can relate to which the Frost bros do well at. The series does have some interesting twists and turns that will keep you guessing in relation to the characters and the overall story. I feel that because it&rsquo;s uniquely both characteristically and not characteristically Gundam at the same time give a new distinction it&rsquo;s trademark characteristics.Well, this series premiered after Gundam Wing, so most of the color schemes and gimmicks of the mechs will probably not really stand out since it mostly follows the approach that Gundam Wing has. But I guess some of the features of the GX where its main weapon needs to be powered by a satellite brings a new element to the engineering and the firepower that hasn&rsquo;t been used in past sagas makes it more fresh. And as I stated earlier, the mechs in general don&rsquo;t have any qualities that are necessarily fresh or new. Like the Leopard is pretty much a green colored firearms, and the design of the GX looks like the Wing Gundam but with a different set of wings.The character designs mostly in relation to the costume are a little wilder than your typical Gundam series, thus giving some reflection to its post apocalyptic nature. But other than that, you have generic bishounen and bishoujo designs but very tolerable. My favorite design is that of Jamil with a modern day old school approach. He wears a very ancient military style uniform, and his side burns and hair style is something more characteristic of a 1970s anime hero. And Tanya is just simply hot.The character design is nothing really cutting edge but still appropriate for its setting at some capacity. The battles are pretty interesting since a majority of this Gundam series takes place on Earth and I was wondering if there was ever going to be any traditional space battles, which has always been an iconic trait of the franchise. But I feel that the engineering and the gimmicks of the Gundams presented justified keeping the battles on earth territory for most of the series. But the battles are still intense and they excellently know how to apply land and air war fare with a different approach with more reliance on transforming mechs.Personally, I loved Takagi Wataru&rsquo;s unique approach to playing Garoad Ran. Even though he&rsquo;s achieved world fame as Onizuka Eikichi from GTO, I loved how he still retained his nasal voice and make Garoad come across as a teenager and as a wise ass. I thought it was a very brilliant performance. Granted Garoad has comedic traits, I think Takagi&rsquo;s addition who mostly does comedy roles does a great job in a more serious role such as this one himself. I think Jamil&rsquo;s voice actor, Horiuchi Kenyuu who is famous as playing Raiden in the Metal Gear Solid games brought a unique charisma to his character and also made him sound very intimidating. And another unique actress is Mitsuishi Kotono, who was also still playing Sailor Moon at the time is also the voice of Tanya, the bridge captain. Later she would come back to Gundam SEED. as the Captain of the Archangel. With her role in Gundam X, she brought Misato&rsquo;s party girl side to her character.The music is just intense and beautiful. The opening theme DREAMS just has this militaristic feel with how it opens, but yet transitions to this powerful song about hope and determination, and the ending themes sung in English sound like Love Lift Us Where We Belong, but brought a refreshing feel to the series. The background music is very appropriate for the series.Well, sadly, this Gundam had to be cut due to low ratings, but I heard that this series is finding rejuvenation in Japan with the DVD releases and people are appreciating it more. Artistically as I said earlier, it really does nothing to advance Gundam but I think it still maintained its spirit and really brought a unique and distinctive redefinition to some of its original foundation. Such as the themes and concepts behind the series with new types was what made it unique and was first brought into an alternate universe of Gundam which would later be brought back in SEED which I think they did a bad job of that concept in that series.

This is something truly made for Gundam fans, and I think this is probably something that a casual anime fan or a hardcore anime fan that isn&rsquo;t into Gundam could probably handle.', 'Before watching Gundam X, I often heard how it was considered to be one of worst Gundam series out there since it only ran for 39 episodes, since it had been canceled due to low rating. But after finishing it just now, I have to say, its probably one of the best Gundam series I\'ve seen and quite possibly one of the more under appreciated anime out there.Story: Gundam X takes place 15 years after the war between the Earth forces and Space Rebellion which wiped out almost all of the Earth\'s population due to the use of Newtypes, individuals with advanced abilities. The story...follows Garrod Ran, a 15 year old boy who runs into a mysterious girl called Tiffa and later decides to join the Freeden, a ship led by Jamil Neate, a former ""hero"" in the war(think Amuro Ray), in order to protect Tiffa, while traveling the Earth to prevent the abusive use of Newtypes and eventually to stop a war that could result in the same tragedy 15 years ago. The plot set-up can almost be thought of as a pre-cursor to Eureka 7, the main character chooses to join a group of ragtag individuals in order to protect a girl they\'ve taken interest in,not to fight for peace or anything close to it.Art: Being released in 1996, the art looks dated but still holds up fairly well 14 years since its release. For those who have seen Gundam Wing, you know what you\'re expectingSound: The sound effects and background music are fairly well done( despite the fx sounding a bit old-school and thus similar to Wing again), but the opening themes are very well done and quite catchy too.Characters: Despite the high enjoyment quality of all other Gundam shows, most of the main characters, were rather annoying, throwing out angst and other ""emo"" actions that seemed rather siily. Gundam X has a decent set of characters that are all fairly fleshed out and really likable and don\'t display any of the cliches established by its predecessors. Garrod is a rather interesting main lead and often displays some traits that most teens could relate to. Despite some ""angst"" he displays in the few beginning episodes of the anime, it actually makes sense why he acts this way. Jamil is a mix of Char, Amuro and even Bright, and acts as the leader figure among the crew of the Freeden and his past involvement in the war only makes him more interesting. Roybea and Witz, the other 2 Gundam pilots, are interesting characters as well and they even have good intentions being involved with the Freeden. The Frost brothers are the ones who truly shine in this show, they are the very definition of evil and will do whatever they want to get what they want.Enjoyment: Every episode was well done and did a good job of building up to the conclusion. It started out as showing out with showing how the entire cast only worked to find Newtypes scattered around the globe, but slowly begun to realize that encountering them would lead to them becoming involved in a war once again. The only flaw I can think of is that the show was cut short, so starting around episode 30 to the last episode, it felt a bit rushed as I was hit with so much information in a few episodes, but was wrapped up really well overall.Overall: Don\'t let the fact that Gundam X gets a bad vibe from many Gundam fans steer you away from watching this. The plot is well paced and the characters are all done fairly well and even has a bit of the political themes found in almost every Gundam series( but to a more limited extent here). This under-appreciated gem is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of mecha, romance or anyone who is an anime fan in general. follows Garrod Ran, a 15 year old boy who runs into a mysterious girl called Tiffa and later decides to join the Freeden, a ship led by Jamil Neate, a former ""hero"" in the war(think Amuro Ray), in order to protect Tiffa, while traveling the Earth to prevent the abusive use of Newtypes and eventually to stop a war that could result in the same tragedy 15 years ago.

This under-appreciated gem is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of mecha, romance or anyone who is an anime fan in general.', ""Before I even watched Gundam X. I have been told by people that Gundam X is either one of the most underrated Gundam shows or one of the worst Gundam shows. Also, notice that Gundam X only had 39 episodes instead of 49 episodes like Wing. Well after finishing Gundam X from start to finish I really have to say this. Gundam X is not only one of the best Gundam shows that I have seen but it’s one of the most underrated animes I have ever seen in a long while.Why is that you may ask?You will soon find out.Story.It is the year after...war fifteen. Fifteen years after the 7th space war which ultimately destruction of the whole world and killing billions of people. Many of the surviving residents of Earth now try to make a living as best as they can in the new post apocalyptic world with many of the mobile suits and the technology that was left over from the war becoming extremely valuable to many civilians and organizations.The story of Gundam X mainly focuses on a 15-year boy named Garrod Ran who make a living by selling and taking old jobs. He eventually gets hired to rescue a mysterious young girl named Tiffa who is later revealed to be a special kind of human called a newtype.During a struggle between Garrod and the people who hired him, he discovers a powerful mobile suit that took part in the 7th space war and that mobile suit is called the Gundam X. He uses it to fight off his enemies and protect Tiffa. The two young teens meet up with a crew of vultures lead by Jamil a man who wants to rescue and protect new-types like Tiffa from being exploited by enemy organizations. Soon Enough Garrod and Tiffa part of the crew and throughout the series they will come face to face with various opponents that as the prevent another war.The story of Gundam X is really good and well executedAside from some typical elements from the Gundam franchise like the young boy discovering a Gundam as the presence of char clone kinda character, it's unlike most of the other Gundam shows that are out there. All of the Gundam shows minus G Gundam, this show Turn A, Build Fighters and G Reco revolve around a full-scale war between two factions but Gundam X in a post apocalyptic setting where people are trying to prevent war and most of humanity is trying to regain their lives. Out of all of the alternative universe shows Gundam X has the closet with the universal century timeline.as it has a lot of elements that we all familiar with within the universal century such as the appearance of newtypes. The newtypes in X play a much bigger war in X than any of the Universal Century shows.Themes of exploitation, power abuse, moving forward in the future instead of being clinging to the past were well explored and they expanded as the series progresses.If I had minor complaints of the story in X it would be the pacing for certain story arcs. Unlike in Gundam Wing constantly had bad pacing as well as having too much info-dumping from that stupid narrator. Gundam X mostly had good pacing but some of the arcs were either pacing way too long or way too fast like the final arc which I will explain now.Gundam X was originally gonna to have 49 episodes like Gundam Wing and G Gundam but it was reduced to 39 episodes after the decline of the ratings.This explains why the ending of Gundam X was kinda rushed as well as having no time to build up a proper climax. Despite that, the ending of Gundam X does ties up most of the loose ends giving us the feeling of satisfaction.Overall despite Gundam X being cut down to 39 episodes, I thought the story of Gundam X was really good and well written.8.5/10Characters.The characters in Gundam X are mostly great as they are very likable, relatable and they were enjoyable to watch from start to finish.Garrod is honestly one of my favorite Gundam protagonists.He may have an outgoing personality who is filled with life but he's not afraid to get serious when he needs to be. Also unlike Heero his a well-written character who gets great character development. What makes Garrod stand out from other main protagonists from Gundam that he is just a normal kid. No special powers( Amero), no intense military training( Heero) and no martial arts mastery (Domon). He is just a normal human like you and I. Even though his a normal human being he still proves himself to be a badass pilot.Tiffa is one of the best female characters from the franchise.She is quiet and tends to hide her emotions but she starts to open up more as the series progresses especially around Garrod. Tiffa's role in Gundam X is unique in Gundam since she is a newtype with extraordinary powers thus making her a very valuable target for many people that tried to capture her.The relationship between Garrod and Tiffa gives a lot of Eureka Seven vibes even though Eureka Seven came out after this show. The one thing that I really loved about it is how different they personalities are. Garrod a loud mouth while Tiffa is calm and collecting. Aside from that, it's a really down to earth relationship that was build up extremely well and it makes you believe that they are really made for each other. It’s personally one of my favorite pairings in the Gundam franchise.Another character that I really like is Jamil who is one of my favorite captains from the franchise. His background is based off Amuro Ray but his adult personality is very similar to Bright Noa with a little bit of Char mixed it making him a great badass combination of three of the most iconic characters in the franchise.Roybea may be a lady's man and Witz may be a hot headed but they much more dimensional to them as characters as opposed to the Wing boys in Wing, The Mary sues in Seed, and the Try Fighters from Build Fighters TryThe other characters are also great and very likable with some of my other favorite Gundam X characters being Ennil El,  Malme Toniya and Kid Salsamille.The only characters I was not a fan were the Frost Brothers aka the main villains as they come off as generic villains’ They were not bad characters but they could have been much better but the end of the day I pick the Frost Brothers over the Try Fighters and the Wing Boys.Minus the Frost Brothers, I thought the character cast for Gundam X to be pretty great as they are very memorable likable, interesting not to mention they have a purpose and have an important role in the story.This is one of my favorite characters casts from the Gundam franchise.9/10Visuals.Visually Gundam X is very similar to Wing, however, it a massive improvement over Wing in every field.The characters designs are well designed and they are mostly consistent.As for the actual animation, it's a big step from Wing. The mecha battles are fun to watch and we actually see a lot of skill being shown by the pilots throughout the fights.Also, the mecha designs are really good.The Gundam X may appear like average Gundam but once the moon is out and it charges its satellite cannon. It will terminate anything in its path. The X divider is pretty cool but its big brother the double X is in my top 3 favorite Gundams. Gundam LeopardThe other Gundam designs also great Gundams like the Air Master, Gundam Leopard, and the Versago.Overall the visuals of Gundam X are really good as it a massive improvement over Gundam Wing and the battles were very exciting.8.5/10Sound.The soundtrack of Gundam X is just beautiful filled with memorable tracks.The first opening Dream is a very hard hitting J POP song.The same thing can be said to the second opening theme Resolution which is one of one of my favorite opening themes in Gundam.The first ending theme Human Touch is easily one of the best composed in all of Gundam as well as being one of my favorite ending themes in anime.The second ending theme Gin-Iro Horizon is pretty good.The voice acting of Gundam X is amazing that is filled a lot of talented and high profile Seiyuus.Some of my favorites performances were Knyuu Horiuchi as Jamil, Mika Kanai as Tiffa, Chieko Honda as Ennil, Motoko Kumai as Kid Salsamile, Kazuya Nakai as Witz and I could go on.Sadly Gundam X didn’t get a dub which is honestly sad because if anything this was the show that needed a dub.9/10Final Thoughts.Overall I really liked Gundam X. I think is one of the best Gundam shows from the franchise.The story was well written, almost all of the characters were great, relatable and likable, the visuals still hold up well compared to Gundam Wing, the mecha battles were exciting to watch and the soundtrack is just amazing.If this show were to have all 49 episodes as well maybe having an English dub than I would have giving it a 10/10 as well as being my favorite Gundam show but sadly that isn’t the case.Gundam X ended getting canceled making it the only other Gundam show besides Gundam 0079 to get canceled before finished. There’s has been a lot of speculation on why it was canceled. One theory stated that it got low ratings due to a sudden timeslot switch and an another theory state that people were just burned out from watching Gundam after four years of back to back releases. Whatever the case may be I still thought Gundam X was an amazing show and I consider it to be one of the best Gundam shows in the franchise.If you are tired of Gundam having the same old formula from past Gundam shows then I highly recommend watching Gundam X as it offers a different yet amazing experience for anime fans as well as hardcore Gundam fans.Gundam X has been licensed by Rightstuff in the US on DVD.Final Score 8.5/10 war fifteen.

Following hot on the heels of Wings 50 episode run, Gundam X shared a very similar art style and mobile suit designs. However, due to a very bad time slot as well as franchise fatigue(X aired two weeks after Wing finished, and Wing itself had begun airing two weeks following G\'s run.), Gundam X was cut down from 50 episodes to 39, causing the ending of the series to be rushed and parts cut out. Though surprisingly, this did not...detract at all from the story, though it didn\'t really do it any favors either.Part of the reason that Gundam X still succeeded despite the rushed story was because of the excellent characters and their development. The protagonist is Garrod Ran, a 15 year old orphan who made a living taking high risk jobs and defending his home from Vultures. What separates Garrod from most Gundam protagonists is that he is not some special snowflake. He is an average Human being who happens to be good at piloting mobile suits. And he isn\'t some concealed Newtype or anything like that, because two of his companions would know right away, and they never said a word. Garrod manages to accomplish feats that rival that of Newtypes, which makes him one of the most powerful Gundam protagonists due to his ability to adapt to any enemy or situation. Alongside him are the Newtypes Tifa Adiil and Jamil Neate, as well as the mercenaries Roybea Loy and Witz Sou, along with the rest of the Freeden crew. What\'s satisfying is that almost all of these characters are likable in their own ways and have their own stories to tell.The emotional impact of Gundam X is emphasized by its soundtrack, which is just plain beautiful. The ending theme ""Human Touch"" is just so good that I had it on repeat for weeks. What I found odd and yet refreshing is that it is entirely in English, despite the fact that the series was never dubbed. It\'s a beautiful song, and one that deserves to be heard even without the context of the series. The sound effects or course are mostly reused from Wing, which honestly goes well with the art style which is, again, pretty much the same as Wing.The theme of this series is something that I had never come across before in anime: Labels. We\'re all familiar with how labels work. When you give something or someone a label, you are essentially defining who or what they are because that label comes with a predefined definition. In this case, Oldtypes and Newtypes. And each faction has a different definition for each of these labels, which leads to the series major conflicts. This was a refreshing change from the usual themes and the series conclusion did justice to that theme.In the end, After War Gundam X is quite possibly one of the greatest Gundam series to ever be produced. The problem with its popularity lies in the time slot it was placed in as well as the timing of its release. Both of those factors contributed to its commercial downfall. It has, however, gained a cult following in the many years since its initial release in 1997. This series truly deserved a full 50 episodes, and had it been aired in the US following Wing, its likely that it may have seen the popularity it truly deserved. I recommend this series to anyone who could use a break from the normal themes or is just looking for a great story and characters. I highly doubt you will be disappointed. detract at all from the story, though it didn\'t really do it any favors either.Part of the reason that Gundam X still succeeded despite the rushed story was because of the excellent characters and their development.

In this case, Oldtypes and Newtypes. And each faction has a different definition for each of these labels, which leads to the series major conflicts. This was a refreshing change from the usual themes and the series conclusion did justice to that theme.In the end, After War Gundam X is quite possibly one of the greatest Gundam series to ever be produced. The problem with its popularity lies in the time slot it was placed in as well as the timing of its release. Both of those factors contributed to its commercial downfall. It has, however, gained a cult following in the many years since its initial release in 1997. This series truly deserved a full 50 episodes, and had it been aired in the US following Wing, its likely that it may have seen the popularity it truly deserved. I recommend this series to anyone who could use a break from the normal themes or is just looking for a great story and characters. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.', ""- StoryGundam X takes on a 'what if' scenario. Basically 'What it Amuro Ray from Gundam UC0079 had never stumbled across the Gundam RX-78? Basically, the war would have dragged on and ended with many space colonies dropped onto the Earth wiping out most of humanity and destabilizing Earth's weather.15 years have passed since the war ended and the story from here on follows 15 year old Garrod Ran, pilot of the Gundam X, on his journey along with the crew of an all-terrain ship called the Freeden in their quest in search of Newtypes around the world and offer them protection from anyone out...to find them and use them to start another war.Throughout the journey, he is assigned to protect the Freeden's most important crew member, Tiffa Adill, a girl with Newtype powers that are sought after by anyone who knows of her and her abilities as well as Garrod's love interest. We've seen love interests in Gundam but none of the relationships affected the story like in X. Garrod and Tiffa's relationship is the most authentic you'll see in Gundam.Nothing you'll see in this story is arbitrary, the characters are all well-conceived for the post-apocalyptic Earth setting. So there's always some rhyme or reason for each character's history and actions. And I bloody praise the show for its clever writing.- Animation:You can tell it’s dated 90’s animation but not to the point where it looks obsolete and hideous compared to cleaner anime like SEED, 00, and AGE. It’s still a joy to look at especially since this reduced the amount of recycled animation which was present  in and many other anime shows at its time and if was digitally remastered, get ready to eat your heart out.It would be an understatement to say that this series art style and animation is ‘similar’ Wing’s because it is in fact EXACTLY the same to the point where it would feel like watching a redimensionalized version of it. You could take a character from Wing and put him/her in X or vice versa and they’d fit in perfectly. Even the mech designs are Wing-ish.- Music and SoundThe soundtrack is a mixed bag, some are good, some are dull and easily forgettable. In fact, it’s kind of disappointing that they didn't do as good a job  with Zeta Gundam and Wing series.- OverallThis series was the most refreshing of all the Gundams I've seen. It does contain familiar elements but at the same time it takes liberties in such a clever way to prevent it from not being Gundam. It is different from other Gundams for these reasons, and they are a big deal- It's post-apocalyptic- Strong romantic subplot- Takes place mostly on Earth- No warRegardless of what may or may not have happened if X's animation crew had their way with episode count and story progression, whatever they had to wrap up was done well without leaving anything unresolved. So for what it is, Gundam X is in my opinion a true gem not just in the Gundam sagas, but in anime in general. to find them and use them to start another war.Throughout the journey, he is assigned to protect the Freeden's most important crew member, Tiffa Adill, a girl with Newtype powers that are sought after by anyone who knows of her and her abilities as well as Garrod's love interest.

So curious to see what the series had going for it, I chose to download the series and see if it was anything worthwhile. Suffice to say, I think I can see why reception to this series is mixed.Gundam X is supposed to depict a ""what if"" scenario in the Gundam franchise to depict what would happen to Earth if the war between Oldtypes and Newtypes got heated enough where a space colony drop was implemented and...devastated the human population and atmosphere on Earth. To a degree, Gundam X does a solid job in setting up its world featuring many people trying to survive on their own and groups of hired vigilantes and thieves known as Vultures taking up jobs for any money they need for their survival or mercilessly destroying and killing anything in their way for personal gain. Remains of the Federation still exist in this new era as they try to reclaim the old power that they once had by conquering areas of the world that refuse to unite under their cause. Newtypes are also focused on as they still face a good amount of prejudice in this world with corporations and Federation forces still seeing them as tools of war and some elements similar to racism are brought up in later episodes regarding differences with the origins of Newtypes and their abilities.What does work against the series though would be its style of plotting and its very characters. Gundam X is divided up into several plot arcs focused on the journey of Garrod, Tiffa and the crew of the Freeden as they seek out Newtypes, evade hostile Vulture ships, evade Federation forces and try to prevent a second catastrophic event like the colony drop from 15 years ago. While the arcs help to flesh out more elements to the world of Gundam X and occasionally develop the characters, the pacing to said arcs in many instances tend to be a bit slow and cause progression to grind to a halt at points. I also found that the series was trying too hard at dramatizing a number of serious scenes that took place throughout the show thanks to its overuse of angst and melodrama with its major developments. The last arc for the show\'s final two episodes is rushed in its developments special thanks to said early cancellation of the show as the series tried to cram the major plot developments for said final arc. The final arc is notable in that it reveals the origin of Newtypes, but said revelation felt vague and left a sour taste in my mouth. Gundam fans might not want to take what is revealed at the end at heart considering this is another alternate continuity in the series franchise.I also had issues with many of the characters portrayed throughout Gundam X as well considering many just followed standard character archetypes found in other anime or being used as plot devices you would have seen done before in earlier Gundam titles. Male lead Garrod\'s the hot-headed and defiant teen you would have already seen with Amuro and Kamille, only he\'s not as well-fleshed out as the two mentioned characters and he quite often has to conveniently get his hide saved in life-threatening situations by other members of the Freeden crew or other new characters that happen to be around, which make me question why he even is the male lead of this series. Female lead Tiffa isn\'t much better off either as her character is much more flat than Garrod\'s as she plays the all too-common ""shy, quiet and reserved female character"" archetype needing a male lead to give her a confidence boost which has been done to death in enough modern otaku-pandering shows. As you can pretty much see, I could care less about the romantic developments that Gundam X was pushing with these two because of how shallow and archetypal their characters were. I don\'t even want to get started mentioning the Frost Brothers as I found them to be the weakest villains I\'ve seen in any Gundam series that I\'ve seen thus far due to how poorly developed and shallow that their motivations were for their actions and manipulations throughout the series.In terms of animation, Gundam X is of standard animation quality you would find for a mid-90s anime series. Yet compared to Gundam Wing which was made around the same time period, X is better polished in its scenery and character designs and its quality doesn\'t degrade in heavy action scenes like what occurs with Wing. However, the show still relies on a number of animation shortcuts as reused frames and speed stripes are used rather frequently throughout Gundam X. Much of the music used throughout the series consists of low-pitched and fast-paced tracks used for the title\'s tense moments and action scenes while more slow-paced and light instrumental tracks are used for the title\'s calmer and dramatic moments. Both diversities do their part in enhancing the key scenes that take place throughout Gundam X, but nothing memorable stuck out with them for me. And while I did enjoy listening to the English and Japanese versions of the title\'s ED song, ""Human Touch"", I didn\'t think the song fitted in too well for a Gundam series and seemed better suited for a romance drama title.Overall, Gundam X did present some interesting ideas for its ""what if"" scenario in the setup of its post-apocalyptic world from the heated Oldtype/ Newtype conflict from Universal Century titles in the Gundam franchise. Unfortunately, the title\'s cliched characters and style of plotting did hurt its overall quality for me as it didn\'t seem to want to try making something as significantly different and unique like Turn A Gundam for an alternate continuity series. I guess as many will say, your mileage will vary on how well you get latched on Gundam X as I certainly didn\'t find myself enjoying it all too well. devastated the human population and atmosphere on Earth.

Too bad this anime was cut short from the 50 episode mark to 39. This was due to the underwhelming lack of views after the already low mark from the first 10 episodes.Gundam X is set 15 years after a devastating war ravaged mankind causing inevitably a colony dropping on Earth. Already, there is a plot from the original Gundam series but set after the war focusing on the remnants and after effects of it all. A great idea with a fantastic set up, but poorly...executed. Remember, the original series was canceled too.The remains of the two factions, Federation and Space Revolutionary Army, try to reclaim the power they once had. In the case of the Federation, they try to unite Earth again and wage war against space, again. Needless to say, this is the focus of 90 percent of the anime due to cancelation causing the space part only being the last bits.As the plot is usually slow and character grinding, the main characters of Garrod (pilot) and Tiffa (newtype) along with the rest of the Gundam X cast are incredibly archetyped by the plot and filled with too much over dramatizing and teenage angst on top of it all. It gets to the point of suffering, predictability, and the worst offender of all, re-hashing. Everything from fight scenes to “romantic” developments are constantly re-hashed and not to mention the worst villain(s) to ever come out of a Gundam series. Characters in Gundam X are so blank and insufferable it is no wonder the anime got cut.Music and art are slightly above average for the time in the mid-90s. Although, consistent re-hashing of fight scenes and fast paces low pitched music create a less impressive overall look to the anime. Really, nothing memorable animation or music wise tends to stand out.Gundam X has been called a sleeper mech and under appreciated, but a good idea and great setting can’t make up for bland characters and bland execution. executed.

I never did like anime about giant robots beating each other up, mostly because they were either too complicated for me to understand, especially with technobabble and politics, or because they just never appealed to me. I watched Gundam 00 when it first came out, but only because of Tieria, and I've seen a few episodes of Gundam Build Fighters since it's different, but I had to put it on hold partly due to real life obligations, and partly because it didn't really hook me. I didn't think there would ever be a day where I would like a giant...robot anime...but then I discovered Gundam X. Wow, I never thought I'd say this, as I'm not a fan of the Gundam franchise in general, but I really freaking love Gundam X! It has everything I want in an anime: an interesting but easy to understand storyline, great characters with their own lives and backstories, beautiful animation, a great soundtrack, great twists, my goodness, I could sing about Gundam X all day, and I will!The story begins after a terrible war between the Space Revolutionary Army and the Earth Federation. After a space colony was driven into Earth, the planet became a shambled mess, and everyone on it had to endure years of hard times. People in space have still progressed, but Earth is still having trouble. In the midst of those hard times, a boy named Garrod and a psychic Newtype girl named Tiffa (No, NOT Tiffa Lockhart if that's what you're thinking) are brought together thanks to an old Federation mobile suit, the GX-9900, aka the Gundam X, and meet in a rogue battleship called the Frieden, led by ex-Newtype Jamil Neate and his friends. Together, they have to fight various empires and make sure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated and learn the truth about Newtypes and the world around them.Gundam X originally had 49-50 episodes planned, but due to insane amounts of executive meddling, the episodes were cut down to 39. But oddly enough, that didn't stop the writers from wanting to resolve it in the way they felt was best and giving it a good ending. The fact that they cared enough about this show really shows in everything, the animation being one such example. It looks rather messy compared to some other shows that were airing during the time, but that messiness actually works, since the conflicts between various parties, such as Earth and space, are also very messy. But it also helps to bring out a kind of untainted beauty within everything else. Also, have I mentioned how much I absolutely ADORE the character designs? Everyone looks practical, like they could be real people you could run into! Garrod looks like a football jock, Jamil looks like a shellshocked veteran, Tiffa looks like that girl you could sit next to in school, everyone just looks great without being over the top. Plus, the character movements are very fluid and the explosions and designs of the Gundams all play off each other very well and are drawn beautifully. It's just very appealing to me.The soundtrack is another glorious thing I must sing praises about, as it's just wonderful! The opening songs are hotblooded but still subdued and try not to be too over the top, while the ending themes are soft, soothing ballads. I especially adore Human Touch, and Warren Wiebe's voice is beautiful. His song is just so nice, uplifting, and inspiring! It's a shame he had to go before his time, from what I've read on various articles. But it does kind of suffer a problem that Kiniro no Corda: Blue Sky had, where a BGM piece would continue playing and then suddenly get cut off by something else, such as the eyecatch. Thankfully, it's not as bad here as it was in Corda, but it's still rather noticeable if you pay close attention.The characters are obviously the best part of the series, and the thing is, at first they start off like they're going to devolve into their stereotype, but completely go against it as the series goes on. Normally I absolutely hate the idiot heroes who go against orders, cause trouble, and are hyper, but...I really like Garrod! 1. He actually matures and develops. 2. The circumstances behind his bad decisions are actually explored. 3. He's actually a lot smarter than he looks, plus the fact that his first scene is his hijacking a mobile suit with a gun and a grenade! And normally I absolutely despise the perfect little yamato nadeshiko characters as they usually don't do much, but...I really like Tiffa! Sure, she's shy, quiet, and can be a damsel in distress sometimes, but she actually does do things in the series, has her own wishes, and doesn't always rely on others, and she also develops awesomely. It's very slow and gradual, but she develops. She could have easily been written badly, but the writers executed her character very well. All the other characters are great too, with their own quirks, personalities, lives, and weaknesses that play off of each other very well. I especially find myself liking Jamil, as I thought he'd been kind of a good hearted but strict boss, but he's actually not as uptight as I expected him to be. I even find myself liking the two main villains, because their struggle and petty reasons for doing what they do is very relatable, and the fact that they go to great lengths just to get what they want really makes them good villains. They actually go out and do something and try to make their vision happen, not just sit around on a throne and watch everything. That's what makes a good villain! Make them proactive and willing to get what they want, no matter what it takes!But speaking of the characters, I do find one flaw about most of them: their backstories haven't been fully explored, especially Tiffa's! Where are her parents?! What kind of life did she live before she came to the Frieden? None of that is explored here! At least some episodes focused on Jamil, Witz, and Roybea, and Garrod and Toniya's pasts has only been touched upon with single lines of dialogue, that's it. I love these characters dearly, but I'd care for them a whole lot more if we knew what their lives were like. The Digimon series was very good at this. Also, there are some things that don't really get explained, and when they're brought up once, they're never brought up again. For example, in episodes 2 and 3, it's established that Tiffa has the ability to feel the pain people on the battlefield feel as they die and because it's too much for her to handle, she falls unconscious...but after that, it's never seen or brought up again, even during times when it should happen, it doesn't. Consistency, people! It's not that hard!Yeah, I like a mecha anime. Never thought I'd say that. I also never thought it'd wind up being one of my all time favorite anime.

This gundam asks ""what-if"" this happened in the one year war, and the after math is what\'s presented in the anime. The characters are deep, the plot is deep, the only thing holding this anime back was the sound and animation. Other than that, if you\'re a UC gundam fan, you would absolutely love this and will not regret expanding your UC gundam lore.Overall 8/10, a great one! ', 'Gundam X is, in my very, very personal opinion, the best Gundam series. It has flaws, and its run is completely disappointing, but if there\'s something Gundam X that most other Gundam series fail at (with a couple of exceptions), is that it presents, it portrays, characters that are sympathetic, likeable and act in character throughout the entire show.Garrod is a teenager, and acts like one; Tiffa lives up to her Newtype status by being a shy, lonely girl, who slowly opens up to other people; Jamil is the conflicted, but wise and disciplinary, mentor, who is protective of his subordinates and those he cares...about; and I could go on.Gundam X has characters than have that human factor, which allow an average viewer who isn\'t even familiar with the franchise to highly enjoy this show.Now if there is another thing I commend Gundam X of doing, is that the series isn\'t like most of its ""AU"" brethren (Alternate Universes, for those not very familiar with Gundam terminology): while it indeed has the obligatory UC (Universal Century) references and tradition in it, it actually does something with them: whereas shows like SEED and AGE simply use these tropes and copy paste them on their own shows, X deves into them, cooks them up, and creates its own identity using this exact tradition. I would mention them in detail, but with the aim of not spoiling the reader, I shall only say that, if they have watched UC beforehand, they are into a treat, especially if they have gotten tired of a certain annoying cliché involving potential love interests.In addition to this, and despite its early cancellation, the show manages to tie its plot points very effectively and creatively.The music is astounding, especially for a 90s anime series steming from a long-running metaseries like Gundam. X\'s predecessor, Gundam Wing, had a very, very neat soundtrack, one pf the best of the franchise in my opinion: but Gundam X manages to get to its level, if not surpass it, in some cases. The opening and ending themes are absolutely beautiful, which makes one wonder why Romantic Mode\'s career did not continue; the rest of the instrumental sountrack is feature film-level of goodness. You can tell they really put effort in composition and execution when it came to Gundam X\'s soundtrack. Whether it\'s a sad track, a sweet track, or an epic, battle-inspirational track, it hits the nail.I would also like to address UC fans to tell them that this is the best way to introduce someone to Gundam and lead them to UC tradition: whereas Gundam Wing only revels in action and randomness most of the time, X actually attempts to be a fully good series, and it succeeds. Add to the fact that both UC and AW (After War) have practically some of the same concepts (Gundam X is the only Alternate Universe that has Newtypes), it\'s more suitable for someone who is reluctant to introduce a newcomer to Gundam due to the dated animation of 0079 or the incoherences of Wing.The series isn\'t without flaws, though: the mechanical designs, while effective, ironically do not seem to be very original and seem more like Wing/UC hybrid rejects (although I will point out that the Virsargo and Ashtaron are some of the exceptions), and some people might not initially buy just how jolly and normal everyone seems to live in an post-apocalyptic world (although, serving as devil\'s advocate here: Gundam has never handled ""apocalyptic scenarios"" quite well in my opinoin), and the final arc is very, very, very rushed, despite concluding, ironically, quite effectively.Overall, this is my favorite Gundam series. I guess my tastes may be too generic for the more ""expert"" viewers or something, but I have no regrets. Gundam X is my ideal Gundam series.

And I highly recommend it to anyone, newcomer or veteran viewer, of the franchise, and anime as a whole.', 'A show that offers so much yet very few take up that offer. It strays away from previous Gundams in all the right areas and delivers a unique, touching, captivating experience. While it\'s not my favorite Gundam, I would definitely place it in my top 5 and is an easy recommendation. To offer up a brief history, this show was the third in the trio of Gundam shows during the 90s that were placed in Alternate Universes (the other two being G Gundam and Gundam Wing).  It was cancelled midway through its run which is why it has an odd 39 episodes instead of...the normal ~50 episode runtime Gundam shows usually run. However, the writing in this series is great and you won\'t even notice that it was cut short, the show wraps everything up and ends smoothly.Animation(8/10): The animation is similar to Wing and G Gundam so it\'s not going to be breathtaking but it does it\'s job and you won\'t be distracted. There are also little repeats of footage and for the most part the animation of fluid.Sound/Music(9/10): I really really like the soundtrack for this show, all the openings and endings are excellent and really set the mood, as well as the final song  to end the series. The sound effects are typical of a Gundam show so no problems there. The only complaint I have is the intermission sound can be a little distracting because it\'s a more energetic sound and often comes right after a very dramatic moment, which causes some clashing.Character(10/10): As with any Gundam show, it\'s the characters that make or break it. What I love about the characters here is that they are actually likeable and relateable, unlike many gundam characters. Garrod is an awesome protagonist, he\'s energetic, crafty, skillful, and he grows throughout the series in both skill and maturity. What I like about Garrod though is that he never lets anything get him down, he always charges forward and is a very strong character. Tiffa is the main female protagonist and while quiet and mysterious at first, she matures greatly and breaks out of her shell becoming another great and strong character. Jamil is the ""char"" analog and is a badass. He\'s the captain of the ship the characters travel on and is very likeable and you have his respect basically from the beginning. The rest of the characters are all deep, complex, relateable, and just a joy to watch. You won\'t find angst or depression in these characters.Story(7/10): The story here is a little weak. It focuses heavily on Newtypes and jumps around a lot. Alot of times you feel like the characters are going nowhere, fighting in random battles for no point, and overall lost. While the direction of the story can be confusing the actual plot and interactions between characters and elements is still well done and you won\'t be bored. The story also picks up rapidly towards the end (due in fact to the cancellation) and the last 10 episodes are a fun ride.Overall(8/10): Overall a great show both as a part of and independent of the Gundam franchise. I loved the hopeful tone and optimism the show radiated, especially after watching the depression that was Victory Gundam and the seriousness that was Wing. The show, while not groundbreaking, does do nearly everything right and deserves its place in the Gundamverse. I highly recommend it. the normal ~50 episode runtime Gundam shows usually run.

All we see in front of us are the wastes, the remnants of a world that once was. The effects of war have stained the planet and now all that is left are us and very drops of hope left. Here we go, storing those droplets of hope as we walk towards an uncertain future.The 1990s is considered by some to be the golden age of the Gundam Franchise. Coming off of successful entries such as 0080 and 08th team, the people at Bandai thought about expanding their property beyond the Universal Century Timeline. The fruits...of this expansion were G Gundam, Gundam Wing, and After War Gundam X. After War is a reimaging of the One Year War if there was no Amuro or Char who existed. It takes place on a barren Earth, riddled with crime and debris. The damage that the One Year War had done on the planet can be seen from the very first episode. We are introduced to what seems like a young mercenary, Garrod Ran, taking on a mission to rescue a mysterious girl from a band of thugs. Little did he know that the girl was a newtype, a type of human being with psychic(or supernatural powers depending on the situation) and the fate of the world rests in the hands of these newtypes.The new type portion of all Gundam shows has always been very divisive, starting with its almost random inclusion towards the end of the original Gundam. This both to the show\'s advantage and detriment. Symbolically, Newtypes have always represented humanity\'s ability to create meaningful connections on a spiritual level. To look past political differences, skin color and to see what humans are on a fundamental level. However, newtypes are abused and used for immoral purposes throughout the Gundam franchise. After War X is not an exception to this tradition. The major failing of the newtype in X has to be how the psychic abilities of newtypes are exaggerated to a point of disbelief. Say what you will about Tomino but he always made it clear what Newtypes are capable of. In X, Newtypes are essentially gods on this earth. They talk to the dead, communicate with animals(some animals are newtypes apparently) and all sorts of crazy things.The episodic structure is similar to Gundams of past. They follow a strict formula: idle chatting -> philosophical debates -> mission introduced -> battle -> post battle reflection. If you found other Gundams to be a chore to watch, this won\'t change your opinion. Where After succeeds, is in the moments of reflection. The characters cast their eyes upon a dying world and try to find the reason why they fight. Some may fight for love, to escape their past, or to fight for a better future. It is in these moments, that After War becomes something special. The show has its flaws but there is a genuine warmth and tenderness lying at the center of each episode that is greatly appreciated. And interestingly this series in conversation with Tomino\'s prior Gundam entries. Gundam has always been a dialogue between cynicism and hope. Gundam\'s creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, often times sided with cynicism and it showed in his story choices and directorial style. X adds a lot to the dialectic, often times directly challenging Gundam\'s creator in subtle ways. ""Why don\'t you have hope in humanity!?"" ""There is going to be a better future for us."" seemed to be aimed at Mr. Tomino itself. That is one thing I have always loved about Gundam, more specifically the universal century timeline, each entry was in dialogue with each other. That is something that made Gundam head and shoulders above its competition.We all know the saying, ""all that glitters is not gold"" and applies to this series as well. It suffers from plodding pacing at certain points, and it was cut short of several episodes. These episodes were direly needed to make the show complete from both a narrative and thematic perspective. Long plot arcs are cut short to unsatisfying conclusions, leaving you with metaphorical blue balls. And the ending is the only seemingly contrived portion of the show due to its length. The warmth and kindness seem hamfisted and rather patronizing here.There were also some character issues here as well. Our protagonist, Garrod Ran, is a rather underwhelming protagonist. Coming from the Gundam tradition of angsty, psychologically damaged Gundam pilots Garrod is rather milquetoast. There is nothing about him that makes him stand out from your average, run of the mill, good guy protagonist. However, what the show lacks in its protagonist, it more than makes up for in its supporting cast. Characters like the lovable mercenaries turned good guys, Roybea and Witz, is when the Gundam character tradition comes into play. They are both likable but with interesting backstories that affect everything they do. The show would have been much better if Garrod was not the main character and these two became the focus instead. Jamil Neate, the protagonist of the ship is a veteran with PTSD from the one year war. His beliefs and his guilt for his war crimes make him a pretty compelling character in his own right. The show is also lacking in the villain category. The villains, the frost brothers are two of the most boring villains in Gundam history. They lack the sociopathy of Scirocco, the wittiness, and sensuality of Haman. They are just there to seemingly make the plot move forward.After War Gundam X is a Gundam left to the annals of history. Overshadowed by its more popular and retarded brother, Gundam Wing. It is also a case of missed potential and if it wasn\'t cut 12 episodes short I know it would have been a good, dare I say great entry in the Gundam franchise.And now the sun slowly sets upon our world.

But, personally I think the anime is quite good and has some uniqueness that makes me can't forget it... and V Gundam anime was even worse. "", ""I found the other user's comments interesting how much they rated Gundam X very optimistically.Myself, when I first watched the series, in 2016 (and it was the first TV series in the Gundam franchise that I watched, having only seen Gundam 08th Team before), my assessment was much better than the current one.Reviewing the series, however, it became easier to understand why the series was canceled and was practically forgotten by Sunrise after it ended (they basically published a spin-off manga, and remembered the series in Gundam Build Fighters, but nothing more) .Story: 5/10It didn't have a clear direction. In the beginning, it was basically...Frieden looking for Newtypes, with the Frost brothers getting in the way, almost as if it were the Pokémon's Team Rocket. Apparently the TV Asahi's audience did not like the idea, and in the middle of the serie they returned to the formula that enshrined the franchise: a political plot. But then it was too late.Art: 7/10The character design is very reminiscent of that of Gundam Wing. Art as a whole is not bad, but for a 1996 anime, I expected more. In fact, the animation techniques used differ little from the 1979 series, with some innovations (several of them already coming from Gundam Wing), but nothing that enhances the art as a whole.Sound: 7/10The soundtrack works well, but it is noticeably less than Gundam Wing. It is a little striking trail, and its presence is sometimes ignored.Character: 7/10Ran Garrod is the opposite extreme of Heero Yuy, and is just a little more interesting than Amuro Ray. In the beginning, his personality bothered him, but by the end of the anime, this was partially corrected, but enough to make him more nice.Tiffa Adill doesn't have the same appeal as Relena Peacecraft, and apart from her skills, she adds little to the group. She only got more interesting in the end, when she took over her relationship with Ran Garrod.Jamil Neat is the most interesting character in this series. With an antagonistic look, he is a serious character, but one with good feelings. His backstory is interesting, and it praises the character.Sara, Tonya, Shingo and Dr. Techs are good support characters.Witz and Roby don't like it very much at the beginning, but they improve during the series.Enil El at first reminds Yubel of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX. But it seems that she did not please the audience of TV Asahi, and was somewhat out of place for the rest of the series, ending up as one of the group's allies at the end, which was not exactly convincing.Brothers Shagia and Olba Frost are the most boring characters in the series. Their antagonism is fragile and not justified, and they are more annoying than adding to the story. It basically reminded me of the essence of the Pokémon's Team Rocket. They make a mess, but when the situation gets complicated, they just run away. They are futile and irritating.It is important to highlight how much trouble Hajime Yatate has in creating non-Japanese names. But this is a defect of Yoshiyuki Tomino himself.Enjoyment: 6/10Gundam X takes time to get interesting, but when it does, the story needs to end, because the series was canceled in episode 39, and it didn't win 4 episodes like it happened with Gundam 0079. Following the series was not a pain, but Gundam Wing was good more interesting. At least, unlike Gundam Wing, the dialogues are not so philosophical, which makes the series easier to follow.Overall: 5/10Overall, Gundam X tries to be interesting, but comes up against unfriendly characters, boring villains, and a story that only evolves in the second half of the series, but still with reservations. It recalls the essence of Gundam 0079, but the hasty ending really spoils the series, negating a concept from UC (which was being better explored), and basically contradicting the plot itself. Alone, Gundam X is not terrible, but whoever watched Gundam 0079 and some other series in the franchise (like Gundam Wing) will really realize how much the series is inferior, and how much it was canceled in episode 39 was understandable.

The series delves into the consequences of humanity\'s destructive tendencies and the struggles of those left behind in the war-ravaged world.The characters in Gundam X are well-developed and relatable, each carrying their...burdens and motivations. Garrod Ran, the protagonist, undergoes significant growth throughout the series as he learns the true meaning of hope and fights against despair.What makes the main character here interesting is that he just a regular normal human, with no special power, or special abilities, or background experience in military or combat, yet he overcomes all of his obstacles through growth, skill and love for Tiffa. He loses, he fails, but never gives up... which is really a nice growing up development to watch.The side characters are also similar to Garrod, normal people that just fight to live and seeing each of them develop and change throughout the show is sweet.The setting is also refreshingly good. It\'s like an RPG game where the cast moves from town to town, meeting new friends and enemies and overcome trouble.Visually, Gundam X looks outdated now and sometimes inferior to Wing (maybe just me), but still has detailed mecha designs and cool action sequences.While Gundam X received mixed reception during its initial airing due to its slow paced storytelling in the early episodes, and maybe no mysterious evil bad guys like a Char Clone, it has gained a dedicated following over the years. Its exploration of complex themes and its ability to create an emotionally charged atmosphere make it a standout entry in the Gundam franchise.In conclusion, Gundam X is a mecha anime that offers a unique post-apocalyptic experience. It\'s not deep, it\'s not complicated, it\'s not trying to re-invent the wheel. It\'s just trying to to tell a love story in a destroyed world full of hatred and evil, With its loveable characters, realistic narrative, and memorable mecha battles, it is a must-watch for fans of the Gundam series and those seeking a mecha show that isn\'t about OP main heroes, Newtype space magic or Overpowered broken mechs that never lose. burdens and motivations.

It\'s just trying to to tell a love story in a destroyed world full of hatred and evil, With its loveable characters, realistic narrative, and memorable mecha battles, it is a must-watch for fans of the Gundam series and those seeking a mecha show that isn\'t about OP main heroes, Newtype space magic or Overpowered broken mechs that never lose.', 'X marks the spot...to catch a pretty decent mecha anime.I have to applaud Sunrise for doing something a little out of character for them. Their primary focus was putting on the display of human misunderstanding and when that misunderstanding escalates to war and suffering. Of course, while prior and latter Gundam series have had a similar focus, I haven\'t seen it become the overwhelming theme like it was in this series. Even the mecha battles were pushed aside for this theme.The plot surrounds a 15-year-old orphan named Garrod Ran, who through a set of circumstances meets Tiffa Adill, a girl the same age that is...believed to have Newtype powers and many people are trying to get their hands on that power. Through saving Tiffa, Garrod gets his hands on a Gundam GX-9900, also known as the Gundam X, and their adventure takes off from there. Overall, I found the plot and story to be decent. It\'s a pretty typical plot for a Gundam anime, but what separates it from it\'s predecessors and it\'s followers is its overwhelming themes of human misunderstanding and trying to solve the problems caused by those misunderstandings.The characters were some of the most likable I had seen in a Gundam series. Garrod is ambitious and believes strongly in his ideals, much like his predecessors. One thing that does separate him though is he\'s a quirky character with a pretty good sense of humor. He\'s a bit more crafty than his predecessors. He doesn\'t really have any ""emo"" moments and honestly, I found his character to be much closer to that of a teenager than the likes of Amuro Ray, Kamille Bidan, Judau Ashta, Heero Yuy, Kira Yamato, Setsuna F. Sei (essentially enter any Gundam pilot here). Another nice thing about him in comparison is, he doesn\'t have any supernatural Coordinator/Newtype powers. He\'s just a normal kid who\'s good at adjusting to his surroundings while operating a Gundam. Tiffa is one of the more adorable Gundam heroines I\'ve seen in a series. It seems as though her thoughts are pure while it seems a great deal of her focus is put toward her power. I will admit, it does cause a pretty obvious lack of character from her, but wasn\'t enough to detract from the quality of the series. My biggest complaint is that there is very little character development, especially with the two leads Garrod and Tiffa. We learn next to nothing about their history other than their parents are dead. I understand that these characters are living in the moment and not in their past, but it would\'ve been nice to know a little more as to why they are the way they are. Of course, I do also believe their lack of development is somewhat linked to the theme of the series...they are two of the few characters that aren\'t living in the past and are instead looking toward a future. The supporting characters and antagonists also suffer from the same problems. There really isn\'t that much development about them and we\'re supposed to learn about their characters through their interactions with each other and minor exposition dumps explaining their motives. The antagonists themselves were actually rather weak in comparison to many other Gundam series, but then again, even they are considered to be the products of human misunderstanding rather than being inherently evil themselves.I do think the weakest aspect of this series is the editing. For a Sunrise produced Gundam series, the editing was extremely lackluster. There were moments where the OP and midway points of the episode would jump-scare me. There was even a tender moment later on in the series that essentially got blown up by the blaring music and the black ""After War Gundam X"" title card that COMPLETELY spoiled the mood. As I mentioned before, the episodes would start out usually showing flashbacks of prior episodes or early plot setup for the next small arc in the story and then the OP would come blaring in out of nowhere. I swear to God, it\'s like the people at Sunrise have never heard of a fade transition before. On top of that, and this goes back to the writing, I found Gundam X to be strangely paced. The first 25 episodes or so have a rather slow pace, seemingly taking a while to build up to what the plot is really about. The last 14 episodes or so felt somewhat rushed. Of course, that\'s because the last 1/3 was focused more on war while the first 2/3 of the series was focused more on Earth and it\'s after effects of war. This does go back to character development a little bit, but I wish the producers would\'ve toned it down a bit with it\'s narration and focused more on character. Now that I think about it, this series had a lot more narration than most other Gundam series and I\'ll admit, most of it was unnecessary and felt like episode filler. All-in-all, this was pretty lousy production work from Sunrise.Overall, it does sadden me that Sunrise butchered this a bit with it\'s production, because I found that in regards to plot and characters, this was actually one of the better Gundam series. I will come out and say Garrod is probably my favorite lead character in any of the Gundam animated series and I found the supporting characters to be pretty good as well. However, it\'s obvious what sets this series apart from the others and that\'s the message of the story. I found the message to be much more profound and focused than other Gundam series. I know the ""moral of the story"" is a pretty overused cliche, especially when it comes to storytelling but I found the ""moral"" of Gundam X to be much better than it\'s predecessors and it\'s followers. If you\'re a fan of the Gundam series, I do recommend giving this a watch. Despite the many flaws, the message in itself makes it at least worth of a watch through. believed to have Newtype powers and many people are trying to get their hands on that power.

However two titles always seem to be left in the wayside. These two titles being after war, and Gundam age, so when it came time to watch After war i could only expect it to be surprisingly good or really bad. In the end, it was really just another ok gundam show.After war takes place in an alternate timeline but instead of being its own thing, the show is more of a “what if?” scenario for the universal century. Before the events of the show took place the world they inhabited...had a conflict reminiscent of the UC One Year War. the difference is that the outcome for this war lead to devastating apocalyptic-like climax for both earth and the space colonies. It’s several years later when the events of the start to take place as it focuses on a young man named Garrod as he tries to make it by through the post-apocalyptic planet that is on its way to being how it was before the war. Garrod making a living through any means possible is contracted to rescue a girl from a group of people, which he willingly accepts. This in turn is what kick starts the plot, when during his “rescue” attempt, through circumstance learns that there is more to this girl and the people surrounding her. This ultimately leads to Garrod returning her to her “captors”, and also going them along on their mission to find newtypes. Since the girl, Tiffa, is a newtype she in someway has the ability to vaguely locate newtypes leading the group on their journey.While the story for the most part is the crew following the directions that tiffa have set out, their are still many plot and character elements intertwined into the story. Most notable in the beginning is Garrod being accustomed with working with other people since he has mostly lived alone for most of his life, and also learning to handle a mobile gundam suit in combat. There is also he set-up of several recurring character, most of which are the antagonists of the show as well as hints to the re emergence of certain factions responsible for the previous war. Other than that there’s not much to it as each place they go leads to more conflict and sometimes having Tiffa be kidnapped that comes off as repetitive. There is also a sort-of romance sub-plot between Garrod and Tiffa which while not a well presented romance sub-plot, it’s the best and most endearing that the gundam franchise has had at that point. In the end though the show was cut short due to its ratings leading to a shorter than average gundam show which forced the writers to wrap the story early leading the the final episodes feeling rushed and disappointing.When it comes to the characters they all come off as ok. I do appreciate that the show has more focus on other characters than the pilots. While it doesn’t focus on all the crew members, it at least gives the mechanics, doctor, and bridge personals a sense of presence within the story. Each one having their own stories and reasons  that make them feel more than one-dimensional. Of course they aren’t the most well written, and at moments it can feel cheesy or forced, but in the end they all at least have more to them than their personalities. Garrod for the most part is a decent character who goes through some development in the story, but still is two-dimensional in the end. The antagonists are  probably the low point of the show with the most common recurring villains being the most one-dimensional, while the others may have some development but shallow depth.The art for the show is ok for the most part. The character designs feel like a downgrade to gundam wing, while still trying to maintain the bi-shounen/shoujo aesthetic. They still all look ok and jamil even looks cool even though his glasses doesn’t have that translucent appearance making them more obviously drawn on. The mechs are for the most part ok with the gundams looking no more bizarre than the ones in gundam wing, and the space colonies suits being reminiscent of UC zeon suits like the Zakus. The animation really isn’t the best with much of the action coming off as dull explosions that lacks the carnage and twisting metals of older titles. The show still uses much of the sound effects like many of the other gundam shows from the bleeping of computers to the sound of gunfire. The soundtrack is ok although its utilization feels off since the show tries to portray something one way but the music sounds the complete opposite of what is happening one screen. Not the best production values, but not bad for the most part.Overall After war is just an ok. It doesn’t really do to much to stand out as being good or bad.

And I have never seen a gundam anime that had put so much detail or information in the word ""newtype"" or wanting to find out more about what they are, and what their exact role or purpose in this life is. Through out their many adventures, and up until towards the very end, both before and during the final battle, are they finally able to learn the truth, that has to do with the existence of newtypes, both friend and foe alike are able to...learn this information. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and understand why, this is such an underated gem. Although short, it packs a lot of detail into a short, but worth while anime. I actually did take my time finishing it, as to not rush through it, and end up missing the smallest, yet most important of details. learn this information.

I actually did take my time finishing it, as to not rush through it, and end up missing the smallest, yet most important of details.', ""The first episode starts by showing the main character in action. A bad guy is attacking a small village. Garrod Ran is down below, on the ground. Yet, he somehow manages to steal the bad guy's mobile suit! That's incredible! Here I am, thinking this is going to be Heero 2.0 . However, it soon turns out he isn't that much of a badass, and throughout much of the series, even with a Gundam, he gets his ass kicked most of the time.Fortunately he joins up with a team of freelancers. This team is led by captain Jamil Neat, using an amphibious ship called the...'Frieden'. Captain Jamil Neat hides his eyes under his sunglasses... and he also hides his past during most of the show. He is probably the character I liked the most. His team contains a number of interesting side-characters.The characters definitely showed a good amount of progress... Garrod Ran matures, and improves as a mobile suit fighter.The show felt a bit too slow at first. It simply took too much time for anything to happen. After a while, the show gets up to a normal velocity. From about episode 30 onward, everything starts getting rushed. New characters, and new information gets introduced at a startling speed compared to earlier episodes. Honestly, because of this, I'd say that the middle part of this show, is where it's at its best. For resolving the conflict between both opposing parties at the end, they pulled a bit of a 'deux-ex-machina', in my opinion.A big problem this show has, is a lack of credible villains. They just don't make any sense. Let's look at the main antagonists throughout the show: the Frost brothers.The army didn't care a whole lot for them because their special abilities weren't good enough. This is the reason they want to start up  A WHOLE NEW WAR in a time of peace. Guys, this doesn't make any sense!!! For some reason they decide to pick on Garrod Ran. They keep attacking him out of nowhere. Whether he's minding his own business, or helping someone, they pop up out of thin air. At one point Garrod defeats one of the brothers, only to make them even more persistent in annoying the shit out of him!Garrod usually gets pulverized by them in fights, and each time he gets saved by his friends, the Frost brothers simply take off. AND NOBODY DARES TO STOP THEM ESCAPING!!! This does get old pretty fast though. You can compare them to Team Rocket in that respect.The relationship between Garrod and Tifa follows the pacing of the show. Way too slow at first, then moving along at a reasonable pace, but they rushed it towards the end. However, mostly during the show, they're both too shy and embarrassed to make a move.  Don't get your expectations up too much though, there doesn't happen that much.And yet, even though it has some flaws, I did enjoy it a lot. I have a hard time giving more objective reasons for why though. One reason might be, is that the characters simply feel very human. This is quite refreshing compared to other series.

Reading through the reviews on MAL, it's got a pretty good reputation - one that kind of amazes me. I've always been a fan of the alternate Gundam universes, Wing and G being my personal faves. Knowing that, I was really hoping to find another gem in X.I'm not quite sure whether I have or not.The concept is great. Whereas the other AUGundams are re-inventions or re-interpretations of the Gundam idea, Gundam X actually spins out of the set-up from the original MSG. Having that background familiarity, and having that background...to build off of, its pretty cool and should open up a lot of doors for story-telling.Instead, we get lack-luster characters; a slow, drawn out plot, and sub-par animation.To be fair, the main character - Garrod Ran, a rambunctious young scavenger - is the best written character in the show. His core personality remains much the same throughout, but he does slowly grow. Going from a loner to someone who can work with a team, someone who can trust in his skills, someone who is willing to fight for what he believes in, but not at the cost of his soul.That said, the rest of the cast has little background and less personality. Much of the staff of the Freiden, the main location for the series as well as their transportation, are little more than place-holders. The other pair of Gundam pilots have a lot of potential at the start of the show - after all, unlike Garrod, they've had their Gundams for some time and as such, should have a more complex and interesting history. However, in the space of 20 episodes, we only get one based around them - and even then they share the episode. I'm not saying that episode was bad, it's just a shame that it's ONLY one episode.The main female of the show - and Garrod's love interest, Tifa Adill, is an Ayanami Rei; quiet, withdrawn, and perpetually alone. This works at the opening of the show, as she's a Newtype and as such, she has mental powers that - in a post-apocalyptic landscape of murder and pain - would cause her to pull away from people. But once again, 20 episodes in and we're only just NOW beginning to see her open up. TWENTY EPISODES. That's more time than most anime get to tell their WHOLE STORY and it just seems like a drawn-out waste.Despite my complaints, the show isn't all bad. In fact, the thing I love the most is the exploration of what it means to be a Newtype. A staple of the UC Gundam's, Newtypes are generally just low-level psychics, able to lightly scan minds and anticipate events. Here the depths and varieties of their powers are explored - Newtype brothers, Newtype enemies, strange and interesting concepts. After the show got the rather obligatory and standard ideas out of the way they've started to stretch their feet and that I'm loving.I've been trying to keep an open mind as 1) this is a Gundam and I love me some Gundams and 2) it's an AUGundam, which means a lot more freedom for story-telling. So far it hasn't been bad, but it HAS been drawn-out, lacking in depth, and only just barely touching upon innovation.

Well, after 2 underperforming cours, their sole broadcaster essentially ordered the production to commit seppuku. I wish I were joking. Not only were they told to cut the show by 10-11 episodes (forcing the story to become a mad dash at the end), their time slot was moved to 5 AM on a Saturday. I bet they never bothered to update fans (since the Web...was just starting in Japan, and late-night viewing/recording of anime wasn\'t really a thing until the year after), and I bet a lot of fans at the time thought the series was cancelled at episode 24. Think about that. Not only are you asked to slash a labor of love by about one-third its remaining life, you are asked to perform to an empty house for the rest of the broadcast. I can\'t imagine what the writer and the rest of the production must\'ve thought as they were compelled to do this.This is a show that takes its time with plot and characters (until studio demands otherwise). Once you get to the third arc in episode 10, the characters are now one team, and you start to see some chemistry. By episode 20, even one of the recurring villains starts on the path to redemption. While there are some places where the animation cut corners (a few frames of the new Divider look very hastily drawn), when the moment really counts (stealing the Double X, the captain and pilots getting their mechs back), the action is fantastic.The soundtrack is one of the gems of the production. While other Gundam shows might feature epic themes for the hero mobile suit (AGE-FX theme on infinite repeat, anyone? Freedom Gundam?), the composer here writes themes that exude atmosphere (fun fact: he knew the legendary Dr. Osamu Tezuka of Astro Boy fame). Using little-known techniques like tapping the wood of the bows on stringed instruments (col legno), the soundtrack can create the tension of ambush, or by utilizing dissonant horns, it can induce the dread of facing a powerful adversary. While it was only used in the latter part of the show (the colony arc and afterward), there was a track that screamed ""space conflict"" through the use of vocals and violins, culminating in a climactic riff led by the trumpet section.

There are, however, two tracks that didn\'t make it to the OST for some reason: one featuring pizzicato like part of a famous Tchaikovsky symphony (played once in episode 20), the other much more folksy and featuring a lute-like instrument (played once in episode 35 or 36).

It\'s not the abrupt episode cut and change of time slot, although those inevitably affected production quality. The animation is inconsistent at times-- one shot, the Gundams look fantastic, the next, they look like someone quickly sketched a small frame and had the photographer zoom in (the worst example is episode... 11?). I\'m thinking, Evangelion and its highly-regarded visuals had aired a year prior to this, so GX didn\'t look nearly as good in comparison. Secondly, while they were some of the best-directed villains in all of anime, the writing for the Frost brothers wasn\'t nearly as well-developed as the rest of the regular cast. This could be attributed to the mad dash late in the production, so their backstory had to have been severely cut. Their cold-blooded actions throughout the show made me think ""Oh, their story\'s gotta be good"", and when episode 38 rolls around, I was like, ""... Srsly? That\'s it?? Oh, they so deserve that beating..."" I gotta say, fansubbing the hero\'s lines there was therapeutic. Their dialogue was also dreadfully repetitive; the voice actor for the younger brother became sick of saying ""Nii-san"", and this show predates imouto moe shows.Even cut short, the production staff made the most of a terrible situation, I think. Despite dated visuals and static villains, the soundtrack is outstanding, the Gundams aren\'t ridiculously overpowered (well, all right, the villains\' Gundams are), and the sole screenwriter made sure that there was solid themes and narratives (kinda like a slightly less epic version of J. Michael Straczynski). If anything, it\'s a post-apocalyptic space opera with giant robots, and it\'s definitely better than G Gundam, in my opinion. was just starting in Japan, and late-night viewing/recording of anime wasn\'t really a thing until the year after), and I bet a lot of fans at the time thought the series was cancelled at episode 24. Think about that. Not only are you asked to slash a labor of love by about one-third its remaining life, you are asked to perform to an empty house for the rest of the broadcast. I can\'t imagine what the writer and the rest of the production must\'ve thought as they were compelled to do this.This is a show that takes its time with plot and characters (until studio demands otherwise). Once you get to the third arc in episode 10, the characters are now one team, and you start to see some chemistry. By episode 20, even one of the recurring villains starts on the path to redemption. While there are some places where the animation cut corners (a few frames of the new Divider look very hastily drawn), when the moment really counts (stealing the Double X, the captain and pilots getting their mechs back), the action is fantastic.The soundtrack is one of the gems of the production. While other Gundam shows might feature epic themes for the hero mobile suit (AGE-FX theme on infinite repeat, anyone? Freedom Gundam?), the composer here writes themes that exude atmosphere (fun fact: he knew the legendary Dr. Osamu Tezuka of Astro Boy fame).

I guess in that regard, its similar to Turn A Gundam. Both Turn A and Gundam X are essentially alternate universe conclusions to many of the prior anime in the franchise. In my opinion, Gundam X is slightly more accessible to new viewers whereas watching Turn A wouldn't make a whole lot of sense considering most view it as development of it's original creator and not just a standalone story. The only thing you...really need to know about Gundam in order to understand X is what Newtypes are, and that's a very simple explanation. Newtypes, are humans born in outer space with an extra sense that gives them psychic abilities. Depending on what series you watch, Newtypes could be symbolic of the empathy and unity required for the advancement of our species, or just crazy powers that can sometimes make mechs go ultra instinct. Personally, I'm a fan of the symbolism, but when it starts to expend beyond clairvoyance, ya lose me, the mechs are already enough. Thankfully, Gundam X features one of the best implementations of Newtypes I've seen, so it wasn't a deterrent for me. Now that you know about Newtypes, lets move onto the story. The setting of Gundam X is easily one of my favorites from the entire franchise. It takes place in a UC alternate universe where the war took a catastrophic turn as numerous space colonies crashed down to earth, extinguishing 10 billion lives. 15 years later, new cities have been built and humanity is beginning to thrive once again. Although the war is over, life isn't without its struggles thanks to raiders pillaging their towns using scavenged mobile suits. Think of Gundam X as Mad Max with mechs because you have raiders or vagabonds behind the wheel of massive armored vehicles going to war with each other over discarded military equipment. The story follows Garrod a 15 year old boy who lived most of his life fending for himself and thought his years he's honed the skills necessary to survive. Basically speaking, he's a badass who can walk right up to your mobile suit and kick you out of its cockpit. Though Garrod has the experience to make money piloting mobile suits, he prefers to sell them and live a quiet, solitary life. One day, Garrod's lonesome existence is turned upside down by a mission to rescue a young girl, Tiffa from her kidnappers. As the plot thickens, he discovers that his contractor is the real villain and the supposed kidnappers were the ones who actually saved her. This event becomes the catalyst that throws the story into motion as Garrod reluctantly joins the Freeden, a hover vessel filled with scavengers commanded by the infamous war hero, Jamil. Jamil's goal is to travel the world freeing Newtypes who're enslaved or manipulated for their powers as well as extinguish any remaining embers of the past war. I appreciated the variety of the antagonists in Gundam X because it displayed a believable post war, apocalyptic environment. Some fought for profit, some for survival, and others, simply because ending the war didn't end the mentality that created it in the first place. There's always the risk of starting new wars for old reasons. Each era of Gundam anime is slightly different from the last. In the 80s, Gundam was an abysmal look into the horrors of war. They developed their characters well, then had them brutally murdered leaving the survivors with traumatic scars that will never heal. In the 90's the mainline series shifted its gaze away for cool mechs and exciting battles to became the main focal point. Gundam X is kinda like the best of both worlds because it shares much of the same creative talent as Gundam Wing, so the mechs are awesome and the battles are exciting. It also manages to incorporate one of the more palatable anti-war themes the franchise has to offer. I know war is bad, everyone knows it, but sometimes it feels like the morals in Gundam outweigh the viewer experience, and it becomes emotionally exhaustive. Gundam X on the other hand takes a much more balanced approach to war by primarily displaying how our differences are superficial and can sometimes be set aside for the sake of peace. This is a crucial element for plot progression because some of the antagonists eventually become allies. Which ones? I won't show or tell, because that's a spoiler. What I will say is that some of these baddies get great development, and can really win you over. However, we aren't so lucky to have all of the antagonist be so dynamic, some of them are sadly one dimensional cartoon villains. Despite some of its annoying villains, I think Gundam X makes up for it by having so many likable characters who actually receive development. I'd consider many of the characters and their interactions with each other to be in my top 20 of the franchise. I thought Garrod had an interesting backstory of growing up alone in this post apocalyptic world. This negatively impacted his interactions with the freeden crew, because he's used to being a lone wolf and teamwork isn't in his wheelhouse. The growing love between Garrod and Tiffa was also enjoyable as it was innocent and heartwarming. Jamil is basically their version of Armuro Rey who took an incredibly dark turn. Although it sounds like he should be the powerhouse who negates any threat, he struggles to pilot a mobile suit due to his debilitating PTSD. I also enjoyed Sou and Roy, two mercenaries hired by Jamil. They appear to be pretty bland at first due to their guarded personalities, but they really open up in the second half and actually become my two favorite characters. Gundam X equally develops like 10 characters, and in the end, I liked them all, even though I initially disliked half of them. I'd argue that Gundam X tried to develop far too many characters, in doing so it sacrificed the character depth that could have otherwise been achieved. I like the direction they took, but there's not a single character that I thought couldn't be developed more. Aesthetically speaking, Gundam X clearly falls in line with the other 50 episode Gundam anime from the 90s. I mostly compare it to Gundam Wing considering it was created months later and shared many of it's creative talents such as mech designers, character designer, and animation directors. I loved how they integrated mech designs from previous anime with a twist. It's easy to see how some mobile suits were heavily inspired by Zaku, Qubeley, or various mobile suits from Gundam Wing. I really appreciated the level of creativity featured in these mobile suits. It's just a shame that the series isnt long enough for them to all be appreciated. The GX-9901 has a unique feature because it's one of the few Gundams equipped with a weapon of mass destruction. It's got these solar pannel looking things on it's back that unfold to collect radiation that's beamed down to earth from the moon. It basically just deletes everything in its path. I thought this was pretty cool, but it's kinda conflicting when a show features such strong anti-war themes, but the protagonist evaporates hundreds of people with the press of a button, but I guess that's the cost of war, you cant make friends with everyone. The animation is also what you'd expect for a 90's Gundam, but in my opinion it's much better than Wing because it didn't re-use footage as often. At most they recycled some attack animations. Although the battles weren't as intense or gritty as 08th MS Team, I don't hold that against it because I see them both as being two different brands of Gundam and two different tiers of production quality. Gundam X is more about fast paced action, lots of explosions, and mobile suits flying around and cutting each other in half. Typically in Gundam anime, mobile suits get 1 upgrade and that's it. Gundam X utilizes it's post apocalyptic setting by incrementally upgrading it's mobile suits which added a nice touch considering all the spare parts they must have lying around on a salvage ship. I felt this was another factor in keeping the fights feeling fresh. The main problem I have with Gundam X is that it's a little too ambitious and it's structured in a way that risks representing good ideas poorly which turn people off before they understand what they're even watching. After watching 08th MS Team last week, I wanted to drop Gundam X around 10 episodes in. Of course I finished it, but I wasnt that impressed. After a day of letting the anime sink in, I realized that I misunderstood it, and didnt give it a fair chance, so I started over and enjoyed it much more my second time around. I believe my initial dissatisfaction was not a unique experience. Even the Japanese lost interest which caused it to be cut short by 11 episodes. Although it has a pretty good ending, it's easy to see the pacing is ramped up during the final arc. I believe if it had better written villains and more thorough planning then they would have enticed more people to see it through to the end. My initial impressions were that the series was nothing but a bunch of bland characters and rescue missions. Afterall, Tifa gets kidnapped like 6 times. Although the plot progression and a few shallow villains are undeniable shortcomings, The character development becomes a casualty because the aforementioned flaws tend to eat away at your patience, resulting in overlooking the development that's already there. Many had a similar problem with Cowboy Bebop because it also uses a slow, but gradual characterization method. The difference is that Bebop has a much more exciting and diverse plot with fewer long long term characters that featured a staggered introduction. Gundam X on the other hand dumps most of it's characters in your lap in the first few episodes and uses a development format similar painting a wall, one evenly distributed microscopic layer every few hours. Due to this, it's easy to confuse its abundance of slowly developing characters with boring characters. I remember the exact moment when I realized that the cast was more complex than I had given them credit for, that was episode 15 which is devoted to Roy and Sou. Up until this point, I thought they were just background characters. However, they're just hired mercenaries in a post apocalyptic world. Why would they trust their employers enough to open up? Episode 15 focuses on them away from the Freeden, when they can truly become their self and it's easily my favorite episode in the anime. I can't blame people for dropping Gundam X after 10 episodes, and especially for not wanting to rewatch an anime they didn't like. All I can do is properly set your expectations so that you can appreciate the anime for what it is. I think if you set your expectations at the level of other 90s Gundam TV series like G-Gundam, Wing, and even Turn A, then you'll be impressed. Overall, After War Gundam X is an uncut gem that I'd love to see remade as a much longer anime. It's a slow burn that's not going to be for everyone, but if you're patient and open minded enough, then I think it's a great experience especially if you're a fan of Gundam Wing or Universal Century. I give Gundam X an 8/10. This is just the script from my youtube review. Hope you found it helpful really need to know about Gundam in order to understand X is what Newtypes are, and that's a very simple explanation.

I give Gundam X an 8/10. This is just the script from my youtube review. Hope you found it helpful"", ""Story: 4/10It is clearly a plot built from basic premises (everything revolves around Tiffa and, unlike Wing, which had context and motivations, here it is more focused on battles) and expanding in a more or less free way and with objectives simple-minded, when they exist (they know characters, the protagonist's journey of self-discovery and, several times, rescuing the young lady), which can hinder coherence, giving the impression that events are disconnected and take away the sense of where they want to get to and, when they try to give a north, they get lost, with a poorly conceived political plot and bad ending, which makes...no sense of what they did and exposes a typical problem of the franchise, which are futile battles and without much sense.Art 6/10Character Design is competent and the animation, although average by the standards of the Sunrise itself, manages to maintain some consistency.Sound 4/10Disregarding the main themes, which are very good (although I didn't really like the idea of \u200b\u200ba TV version and a full version for the endings, where the first one ends up being superior), the soundtrack is weak and discreet, where, depending on the theme, ends up being generic and sometimes poorly inserted in the scenes.Characters 6/10In general, they are average, with charisma not being a strong point; the problem really lies in the dense protagonist (for much of the story) and silly actions on several occasions (where not all of them can be attributed to immaturity) and Team Rocket style villains, that smile all the time but when the situation gets complicated they they always flee, in addition to weak and questionable motivation - in short, poorly conceived.Enjoyment 4/10Most of the episodes are not at all memorable, being, at times, dragged, whose battles are not so exciting, where the light romance may motivate a little but does not compensate for the problems of direction. They tried to fix this in the end, but it didn't work out very well.Overall 4/10I am surprised by the popularity and high rating of Gundam X in MAL, wondering if I watched a different anime, but from my experience, the fact that it was canceled ends up not being a surprise (which cannot be compared with the Original Gundam, which, in particular, is superior to this anime, otherwise it would not have won 4 episodes or even the recap films) and it would not be strange if Sunrise itself reneged on it, since the series has been somewhat forgotten over the years. In summary, I do not recommend.----------------------------------------------------------------História 4/10É claramente um enredo construído a partir de premissas básicas (tudo gira em torno da Tiffa e, diferente do Wing, que possuía contexto e motivações, aqui é mais focado nas batalhas mesmo) e se expandindo de uma forma mais ou menos livre e com objetivos simplórios, quando existem (conhecem personagens, jornada de autodescoberta do protagonista e, em diversas vezes, resgatando a mocinha), o que pode atrapalhar a coerência, dando a impressão que os eventos são desconectados e tira um pouco o sentido da onde eles querem chegar e, quando eles tentam dar um norte, eles se perdem, com uma trama política mal concebida e final ruim, que tira todo o sentido do que eles fizeram e expõe um problema típico da franquia, que são as batalhas bestas e fúteis, sem grande sentido.Arte 6/10O Character Design é competente e a animação, embora mediana para os padrões da própria Sunrise da época, consegue manter alguma consistência.Som 4/10Desconsiderando os temas principais, que são muito bons (embora não tenha gostado muito da ideia de uma versão para TV e outra completa para os encerramentos, onde os primeiro acaba sendo superior), a trilha sonora é fraca e discreta, onde, dependendo do tema, acaba sendo genérica e por vezes mal inserida nas cenas.Personagens 6/10No geral, são medianos, com o carisma não sendo um ponto forte; o problema reside mesmo no protagonista denso (durante boa parte da história) e de ações tolas em diversas ocasiões (onde nem todas podem ser atribuídas à imaturidade) e nos vilões padrão Equipe Rocket, que sorriem o tempo todo mas quando a situação se complica eles sempre fogem, além de motivação fraca e questionável - em resumo, mal concebidos.Aproveitamento 4/10A maioria dos episódios não são nenhum pouco memoráveis, sendo, por vezes, arrastados, cujas batalhas não empolgam tanto, onde o leve romance até pode motivar um pouco mas não compensa os problemas de direção. Tentaram consertar isto no final, mas não deu muito certo.Conclusão 4/10Fico surpreso com a popularidade e a alta nota do Gundam X no MAL, me perguntando se eu assisti um anime diferente, mas, pela minha experiência, o fato de ter sido cancelado acaba não sendo uma surpresa (o que não pode ser comparado com o Gundam original, que, particularmente, é superior a este anime, senão não teria ganhado 4 episódios e nem os filmes recap) e não estranharia se a própria Sunrise o renegasse, já que a série ficou meio esquecida ao longo dos anos. Em resumo, não recomendo. no sense of what they did and exposes a typical problem of the franchise, which are futile battles and without much sense.Art 6/10Character Design is competent and the animation, although average by the standards of the Sunrise itself, manages to maintain some consistency.Sound 4/10Disregarding the main themes, which are very good (although I didn't really like the idea of \u200b\u200ba TV version and a full version for the endings, where the first one ends up being superior), the soundtrack is weak and discreet, where, depending on the theme, ends up being generic and sometimes poorly inserted in the scenes.Characters 6/10In general, they are average, with charisma not being a strong point; the problem really lies in the dense protagonist (for much of the story) and silly actions on several occasions (where not all of them can be attributed to immaturity) and Team Rocket style villains, that smile all the time but when the situation gets complicated they they always flee, in addition to weak and questionable motivation - in short, poorly conceived.Enjoyment 4/10Most of the episodes are not at all memorable, being, at times, dragged, whose battles are not so exciting, where the light romance may motivate a little but does not compensate for the problems of direction. They tried to fix this in the end, but it didn't work out very well.Overall 4/10I am surprised by the popularity and high rating of Gundam X in MAL, wondering if I watched a different anime, but from my experience, the fact that it was canceled ends up not being a surprise (which cannot be compared with the Original Gundam, which, in particular, is superior to this anime, otherwise it would not have won 4 episodes or even the recap films) and it would not be strange if Sunrise itself reneged on it, since the series has been somewhat forgotten over the years. In summary, I do not recommend.----------------------------------------------------------------História 4/10É claramente um enredo construído a partir de premissas básicas (tudo gira em torno da Tiffa e, diferente do Wing, que possuía contexto e motivações, aqui é mais focado nas batalhas mesmo) e se expandindo de uma forma mais ou menos livre e com objetivos simplórios, quando existem (conhecem personagens, jornada de autodescoberta do protagonista e, em diversas vezes, resgatando a mocinha), o que pode atrapalhar a coerência, dando a impressão que os eventos são desconectados e tira um pouco o sentido da onde eles querem chegar e, quando eles tentam dar um norte, eles se perdem, com uma trama política mal concebida e final ruim, que tira todo o sentido do que eles fizeram e expõe um problema típico da franquia, que são as batalhas bestas e fúteis, sem grande sentido.Arte 6/10O Character Design é competente e a animação, embora mediana para os padrões da própria Sunrise da época, consegue manter alguma consistência.Som 4/10Desconsiderando os temas principais, que são muito bons (embora não tenha gostado muito da ideia de uma versão para TV e outra completa para os encerramentos, onde os primeiro acaba sendo superior), a trilha sonora é fraca e discreta, onde, dependendo do tema, acaba sendo genérica e por vezes mal inserida nas cenas.Personagens 6/10No geral, são medianos, com o carisma não sendo um ponto forte; o problema reside mesmo no protagonista denso (durante boa parte da história) e de ações tolas em diversas ocasiões (onde nem todas podem ser atribuídas à imaturidade) e nos vilões padrão Equipe Rocket, que sorriem o tempo todo mas quando a situação se complica eles sempre fogem, além de motivação fraca e questionável - em resumo, mal concebidos.Aproveitamento 4/10A maioria dos episódios não são nenhum pouco memoráveis, sendo, por vezes, arrastados, cujas batalhas não empolgam tanto, onde o leve romance até pode motivar um pouco mas não compensa os problemas de direção. Tentaram consertar isto no final, mas não deu muito certo.Conclusão 4/10Fico surpreso com a popularidade e a alta nota do Gundam X no MAL, me perguntando se eu assisti um anime diferente, mas, pela minha experiência, o fato de ter sido cancelado acaba não sendo uma surpresa (o que não pode ser comparado com o Gundam original, que, particularmente, é superior a este anime, senão não teria ganhado 4 episódios e nem os filmes recap) e não estranharia se a própria Sunrise o renegasse, já que a série ficou meio esquecida ao longo dos anos. Em resumo, não recomendo."", 'I first had the chance of watching Gundam X back when local TV networks were capitalizing on the anime resurgence back in the very early 2000s. The first anime series that were shown back in the 70s were Mazinger Z, Voltes V and Daimos -- all super robot shows. With the premiere of Gundam Wing on local TV, I was introduced to the real robot mecha genre. Now Gundam Wing and G Gundam were immensely popular, the former for being the first taste of mecha in the country and with solid robot designs to boot (my first GunPla was a no grade Deathscythe); the latter,...for having incredibly fun fights ala shounen that were airing around the same time (Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball Z) and harking back to super robot which, I\'m guessing, people here have a spot for.Enter Gundam X which was the third Gundam series to premiere and sadly, I was not able to finish as a kid due to reasons I have forgotten now. All I remember was that the main team was composed of three pilots instead of the accustomed five in Wing and G and that the Satellite canon was destructive as hell. I\'m glad that I recently went back to watching Gundam as I have recently come back to GunPla as a hobby.Story - 8Gundam X\'s story and setting were refreshing. People talk about its ""what-if"" aspect and how similar it is to the UC entries. I liked the Mad Max-esque world building they set up in the first half with the Vultures\' adventures in post colony drop earth. There is some lull in the middle with the Ennil El arc, newtype dolphins and enemy mobile suit of the week parts but nothing so jarring as to make you want to drop the show altogether. Towards the end, it does feel rushed as the show was cancelled/ordered to be shortened but the series does end on a high note, a quick one if you may, but it absolutely does not end badly. In the end, the show wants to deconstruct what being a newtype means and if labels we associate with the unknown are just illusions. I liked that very much.Art - 8The lack of stock footage was a major plus especially after seeing SEED\'s shameful application of it. The way the mobile suits moved was not akin to the speed with which some other Gundam shows had e.g. Wing Zero, Heavy Arms jumping around. I would say the fighting was more grounded and similar to UC style which is why the animation was fitting. Character designs were simple but by no means simplistic and there were only a few instances of inconsistencies in the way the characters\' faces were drawn. As for the Gundams and mobile suits, the art was solid but not masterful.Sound - 9Stock Gundam sounds are present which is a good thing. OST and background tracks were actually pretty good especially towards the end with the Garrod-Tiffa romantic scenes. But what really shines for me is the two Openings (""Dreams"" and ""Resolutions""). Amazing tracks and they had you hyped up to watch the rest of the episodes. Really, the only thing keeping me from giving sound a perfect score is the Ending songs which feature a soulful ballad which I understand was to reflect Garrod and Tiffa\'s relationship but I just found myself not listening to it after hearing them the first time.Character - 10This is where X really excels and I find some characters to be the most memorable in all of Gundam. Aside from Garrod and Tiffa, Jamil, Roabea, Witz, Shagia, Ennil, Caris and even Lancecrow all had good setups of their backgrounds, motivations and goals. Just excellent character development and dialogue all around and despite Garrod repeatedly bumbling around with his Gundam, you can\'t help but root for the kid as he fights for Tiffa. At first, I wondered why the Double X\'s incredibly devastating twin Satellite cannons were so underused but then I remembered Garrod wasn\'t a trigger happy lunatic who wanted to destroy entire countries because he felt like it. Ultimately, he uses it to protect Tiffa which is the core of his character. Jamil is also the best captain in the franchise for me.In summary, Gundam X is a very solid Alternate Universe Gundam show with stellar characters and good and well-executed narrative that has something different to offer amidst all that\'s been said about newtypes in the UC timeline. It may not have the iconic designs of Wing or SEED or the high octane fighting 00 or IBO have but I think X\'s message is one of the most profound and illuminating I have yet to experience in AU titles. for having incredibly fun fights ala shounen that were airing around the same time (Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball Z) and harking back to super robot which, I\'m guessing, people here have a spot for.Enter Gundam X which was the third Gundam series to premiere and sadly, I was not able to finish as a kid due to reasons I have forgotten now.

Not much to write home about, but amusing in small doses.The story starts promisingly, depicting the lives of a scavenger crew as they travel a post-apocalyptic world. It is through these adventures that new characters, motifs, and plotlines are introduced: it works well, and operates similarly to Gundam 79 with enough differences in the setting to set it apart. Regrettably, the last cour dissolves these differences for the sake of producing a sappy ending, with the writing being about as subtle as Wing’s. In this aspect the journey is definitely better than the destination, with the adventures...in the settlement of Fort Severn and seawater battles  standing out from the rest of the pack. I wouldn’t mind an OVA or side story in the setting, as there is some good potential here. It’s just a shame that the direction the show takes is so lackluster. One thread that I do enjoy is the love story - it’s heartwarming, effective, and has tangible effects on the characters and their attitudes. I believe it’s a strong point in its favor that saves the plot from total mediocrity.In terms of characters, it is a relief that the antagonist twins are the only ones that fall into similar pitfalls as the story. At first, the older brother is defined by his even-keeled nature and belief in superstitions, using tarot cards to draw the duo's fortune in battle: this was a cool moment when it was first introduced, but is never used again. I am certain there is a logical explanation for this, but it doesn't solve the problem that the twins are pretty flat otherwise. The younger one is even worse: his defining traits are that he’s protective and ends all of his sentences with nii-san. I can understand that they have a greater endgame in the story, but they are a boring pair nonetheless. The upshot to this is that the minor antagonists get to shine on-screen: the archetypal crazed raiders, genteel warlords, and all the rest are more than welcome after the wooden twins spit out their lines. The supporting characters are excellent as well - they’re cheeky yet good-natured, providing solid levity whenever there’s slack or exposition. Very few of them are batshit crazy like the ones in Zeta or ZZ, which will either sour or please viewers with little room in between. The protagonist’s arc is an interesting inversion of what I’ve come to expect from a Gundam series - I won’t spoil it, but I believe it works in the show’s favor. A good showing overall.The animation is something I am lukewarm on. The designs look like outtakes from Wing, and the artstyle can look pretty rudimentary at times. A benefit to this is that the action is quite fluid, with movement and dynamism to back it up. A couple of the designs are nice, like the Bertigo and Virsago chest break. The character design is my least favorite part of the whole deal, but can be forgiven when the characters themselves are generally entertaining.The sound is serviceable but unmemorable. I think people sing the OPs’ praises enough for it to go without examination, and the Human Touch makes for a nice ED. But while the sound effects do their job suitably, the BGM is weakly nondescript. Not much to love here.To conclude, After War Gundam X is a series that is not a trainwreck, but not quite a success either. It’s something to pick and choose pieces from to enjoy: certain mobile suits, openings, characters, etc. Even so, it’s a lot more consistent than lesser efforts like IGLOO and ZZ - I would like to think that the silver linings it carries make it worth a try. in the settlement of Fort Severn and seawater battles  standing out from the rest of the pack.

Mix that with a protagonist with as much balls as Garrod Rand and a mobile suit design as cool as the Gundam X and you've got yourself one hell of a series. After almost 2 decades of Gundam, Garrod is an incredibly refreshing lead character. He's not the kind of protagonist to worry much about what needs to be done. He doesn't balk about being put in the pilot's seat, or worry about killing in self defense. Garrod arguably has one of the highest bodycounts in the series, but he's...not a killer, he only does what needs to be done, the result of him growing up in a post-apocalyptic mad-max world.The moral quandary that's a staple of every good Gundam is still here, though it isn't as much about peace through understanding as most other ones. Here, the moral theme is more about what level of overwhelming force is justified to break an enemy's fighting spirit. Asking the same question that sparked the bombing of Nagasaki, only in context of a Gundam who's main weapon is an unstoppable nuke-level laser able to level mountains, Garrod's main issue is determining what level of collateral damage is justified in ending a single enemy, and that in itself is an interesting take on modern war.Pulling off pretty much THE Renton/Eureka relationship 9 years before E7 came out, Gundam X's supporting cast of characters, while not as strong as other installments in the series, the main 3 characters, Garrod, Jamil and Tiffa, are all really well done.However, as much as I do love it, Gundam X isn't without deep flaws. Much like its progenitor, X was cancelled right as it was leading up to the final arc, resulting in a rather rushed ending, with unremarkable villains and a final conflict much less satisfying than it seemed to be leading up to.However, despite the issues, X still holds a very special place in my heart. Garrod, the harmonica (which shoots lasers), the Double X, and Jamil are all enough to push X into the topmost tier of Gundam installments. not a killer, he only does what needs to be done, the result of him growing up in a post-apocalyptic mad-max world.The moral quandary that's a staple of every good Gundam is still here, though it isn't as much about peace through understanding as most other ones.

By this time people had gotten burnt out on Gundam, so Gundam X was practically doomed to fail through no fault of its own, and it got cut from the usual 49 episodes to 39. Despite the stigma attached to the first Gundam show to be cut short since the original MSG, X is a great and underrated addition to the Gundam franchise that would be more highly regarded if it were more widely seen. In...contrast to Wing and G, Gundam X is a more traditional Gundam story that can appeal to Gundam's core audience. None of the craziness you see in Wing and G.STORY AND THEMES: 9/10Gundam X has a setting that will be very familiar to Gundam fans. 15 years ago a war between the earth-based United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army, a force consisting of spacenoid colonists seeking independence. The war ended when the SRA dropped a colony on Earth, killing billions of people and leaving much of Eath a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Gundam X covers the aftermath of this, taking place 15 years after the colony drop. The story follows the adventures of a group of Vultures (basically post-apocalyptic scavengers) as their captain, who is gathering Newtypes so that they will never be exploited for war again. Like most other Gundam shows (but unlike G and Wing) most of the show takes place on a ship, as the cast goes from place to place. There is some typical Gundam melodrama early on the show involving love and jealousy, which some people won't appreciate but which I enjoyed. The tone of the show takes more from earlier Gundam shows rather than Wing, and it is better for it.The central theme of Gundam X involves the idea of Newtypes. In addition to having a similar set-up to UC Gundam, Gundam X borrows the idea of Newtypes from UC Gundam. Gundam X, however, is an analysis and critique of the way that the idea is portrayed in UC Gundam. Before Gundam X we are used to seeing Newtypes as the way of the future, the next step in human evolution, or even as a sort of master race. Gundam X gives an entirely different perspective. Here Newtypes are not the solution to humanity's problems, or a superior type of being.CHARACTERS: 9/10Gundam X has a solid cast between it, with one of the best Gundam protagonists. The protagonist and hero is the 15-year-old Garrod Ran, a product of his war-torn environment. We never find out much of his backstory, other than that he is an orphan who never got the chance to know his parents. He's a hot-blooded 15-year old, but much more down to earth than other hotblooded protagonists like Domon Kasshu from G Gundam. The biggest struggle that Garrod faces is learning to accept that he is not alone and can rely on others. Once he's over that, he's a dependable and nice guy. Garrod is also unique in being one of the only Gundam pilots who has no supernatural abilities.The main heroine is Tiffa Adill, a Newtype with psychic powers. She starts out as a very stoic, emotionless 15-year old girl not unlike Rei from Evangelion, which was released immediately before Gundam X came out. She quickly latches on to Garrod, though, and slowly starts to open up, and is an all-around sweet girl. Also, the romance between Garrod and Tiffa is one of the best in Gundam.Other members of the cast are generally strong characters if you like the usual Gundam-style of characters. They are certainly less exaggerated personalities than in earlier Gundam AU series'.ANIMATION: 9/10The animation is great. The animation is probably the best of all the Gundam released in the 90s, with less reliance on recycled animation and off-model. Plus the art-style, with its 90s anime charm, is just nice to look at.MUSIC: 8/10The music is generally good. Its two openings sound great. The only downside is that the preview plays over the ending theme, so you're never able to hear it properly. contrast to Wing and G, Gundam X is a more traditional Gundam story that can appeal to Gundam's core audience.

The story is pretty consistent overall, however there is a segment of ""Mecha of the Week"" for like 3~4 episodes which annoyed me as the show had been going great until then. The ending is heavily rushed and makes me wonder how amazing After War Gundam X could\'ve been if it hadn\'t been cut short.Inspite of all that, the relationship between Garrod and Tiffa, all the side characters get decent amount of screentime and characterisation (Roy kinda gets the short end...of the stick at the end of series IMO) and the narrative is strong and interesting enough to push you through the 39 episodes.Give it a fair chance, and you\'ll be surprised how well this 1996 anime still holds up in some regards. of the stick at the end of series IMO) and the narrative is strong and interesting enough to push you through the 39 episodes.Give it a fair chance, and you\'ll be surprised how well this 1996 anime still holds up in some regards.', 'War after X the best gundam I have seen so far, it addresses pretty much every issue that has frustrated me about gundam. So like it\'s another alternate timeline where this universes version of the federation is again fighting the colonies, and Zeon hold these guys\' beer because they do not fuck around. Instead of dropping one or too colonies to prove a point like Zeon they are just like ""let\'s drop all of them."" And they do sending the earth into a 7-year nuclear winter.It starts 15 years after the world is still recovering, nations are reforming. It starts off with a guy...being sent to save a girl from some scavengers called the vultures. He ends up finding out they aren\'t really the bad guys and joins them on their mission to find Newtypes and protect them. I have gone after Newtypes for being poorly thought out and barely utilized past an excuse for why the stupid kid has to be the Gundam pilot. That\'s the thing, the protag isn\'t a Newtype, but the girl is, and the powers they have are finally tangible and fleshed out to a fair degree. The protagonist is even told by his mentor he doesn\'t need to be a Newtype they are not the end all be all, something that every Gundam before this has gone against. And I can actually tell you what a Newtype is in this show and what powers they have.The Gundam in this one is a little overpowered, but in a way that\'s not a good thing. It has this super powered laser beam, but it can only be used when the moon is out, and the Gundam isn\'t all that powerful without it. They have to come up with ways to compensate. I love pretty much all the mobile suit designs. Later on in the show, the Federation regains most of its power and starts ""unifying"" The earth ready to fight the colonies once again, who have mostly been thriving now that they didn\'t have to worry about the feds. Unlike every other show they do not join the feds or the colonies they do not choose the lesser evil they forged their own path forward and not in an idealistic ""total pacifism"" way they don\'t have all the answers no one does, but they are still going to do their best and move forward for a better tomorrow no longer repeating the past. So yeah, I loved this one alot. The only real things negative I have to say about them is that I didn\'t care for the twins as villains and wished they were not overused so much, and I think this one really could have used a few more episodes around episode 28 of 39 it started to get a little rushed and the colonies didn\'t get nearly as fleshed out as I would have liked. 8/10 my new favorite. being sent to save a girl from some scavengers called the vultures.

And I can actually tell you what a Newtype is in this show and what powers they have.The Gundam in this one is a little overpowered, but in a way that\'s not a good thing. It has this super powered laser beam, but it can only be used when the moon is out, and the Gundam isn\'t all that powerful without it. They have to come up with ways to compensate. I love pretty much all the mobile suit designs. Later on in the show, the Federation regains most of its power and starts ""unifying"" The earth ready to fight the colonies once again, who have mostly been thriving now that they didn\'t have to worry about the feds. Unlike every other show they do not join the feds or the colonies they do not choose the lesser evil they forged their own path forward and not in an idealistic ""total pacifism"" way they don\'t have all the answers no one does, but they are still going to do their best and move forward for a better tomorrow no longer repeating the past. So yeah, I loved this one alot. The only real things negative I have to say about them is that I didn\'t care for the twins as villains and wished they were not overused so much, and I think this one really could have used a few more episodes around episode 28 of 39 it started to get a little rushed and the colonies didn\'t get nearly as fleshed out as I would have liked. 8/10 my new favorite.', ""This is a decent show. I'm just not sure why it exists. In the 90s, Sunrise tried to diversify the Gundam franchise away from the Universal Century continuity. G was a martial arts adventure. Wing gave its pilots more agency and focused on school life and the aristocracy as much as war. Turn A turned mobile suits into lost technology and dropped them into a pseudo-19th-Century setting. In that vein, Gundam X is ostensibly a post-apocalyptic story, which you think would open up opportunities for a different type of story. The problem is it doesn't take advantage of them.The first few episodes are promising. Cocky...teenager Garrod gets his hands on a Gundam and looks like he's going to make it his personal toy. A boy and his Gundam alone vs the world would have been something different for the franchise. It doesn't last though. All too quickly, Garrod gets press-ganged by the grumpy captain of a ship that's basically White Base with the serial number filed off. He's Bright-slapped until he falls in line, chafes at authority and rebels occasionally, but generally follows orders and gets crammed into the typical role of all the early UC Gundam pilots. The ship isn't part of a formal military though, and the writers can't seem to figure out what to do with it instead. They just float around the world getting into scraps with bandits, local warlords and army remnants in a manner that's functionally identical to any UC Gundam show.Individual episodes are generally fine, except for the dumb one with the dolphin newtype. It just feels like business-as-usual Gundam though, which isn't what these alternate continuity shows were meant to be about. teenager Garrod gets his hands on a Gundam and looks like he's going to make it his personal toy.

Despite trying to stay close to the premise of the original, it also added elements of other genres that didn’t mesh very well and turned it into just another superficial, shounen mecha show.ART & SOUND SECTIONS: 6/10Typical. TOO typical. The character and mecha designs, as well as the action scenes were not better than an average mecha show. Same thing for the music themes and the character voices. Gundam was always about pushing the limit when it comes to animation. This will not only disappoint fans of the original, it will also...leave mecha fans in general indifferent about it.STORY & CHARACTER SECTIONS: 5/10Gundam is essentially a sci-fi war drama and this series has the same premise. In this timeline, the One-Year-War ends with all space colonies dropping on Earth, instead of surrendering. The result was an apocalyptic event that destroyed almost everything. 15 years later, the remaining humans try to rebuild the wastelands of the surface, only to find many are still using Mobile Suits for profit, while others begin another war for the survival of the fittest race. The protagonist is a young mercenary who is paid to protect a powerful Newtype girl, which possesses the ability to boost a mecha’s psionic capacities. The two enter a Gundam by accident (like in all Gundam series!), team up with a crew of vigilantes and are trapped between the war of Oldtypes vs Newtypes, for the control of the future.Like in the original Gundam’s normal themes, there is:- A conflict between the normal Homo-sapiens/Oldtypes and the new Psycics/Newtypes- Angst before the tragedy of war- Sorrow for the dead over the struggle for control of the world’s natural resources and the futureUnlike in the original, there is:- The presence of a kind, magical, beautiful girl with a tragic past that gives the story a supernatural/messiah theme- More focus on new bigger/better guns that make the story more action-based- Less focus on character and scenario development, making the series more shallowThe story is very simple, with slow development and almost no plot twists. The characters act too typical and frankly they do not deserve to be remembered about anything they did or said. The ending was also poor, as the scriptwriters gave us a stupid moral message through a metaphysical entity, saying, “There is no difference between Oldtypes and Newtypes”. What is this, a fairy tale with a God-From-A-Machine conclusion? As if everybody else was too stupid to realize something that simple by himself. Not to mention that the bad guys in the story where just two siblings that wanted to kill everyone and were beaten in just 5 seconds. Furthermore the show’s sponsors decided to change the time slot and cut it from 50 episodes to 40, so it had a rushed conclusion which made it look even worse than it already was. To sum it up, there is little story, unmemorable characters and a simple ending. Not suitable for a Gundam series which is supposed to be far more than that.VALUE & ENJOYMENT SECTIONS: 1/10If it wasn’t for the name and the basic design of the Gundam in this series, I doubt anyone would care to even try it out. It is just another average-to-bad series that tries to sell by using a renowned title. leave mecha fans in general indifferent about it.STORY & CHARACTER SECTIONS: 5/10Gundam is essentially a sci-fi war drama and this series has the same premise.

This show is amazing.Its a post apocalyptic world where everyone lives in a space prison. Many ""old world"" relationships are cast away to make human survival possible.

When the land finally recovered, humanity reemerged to face this strange yet familiar world. Will we, who once lorded over this domain, still remain the masters of this world?', 'The greatest potential of Chinese anime (donghua) recently released - mainly by the producers Bilibili and Tencent Penguin Pictures - comes from a great expressive use and enabling its 3D.While many are still prejudiced against this language - relatively recent considering that it is less than 50 years since its emergence - which is still undergoing great development, it seems to me that it has reached maturity at Pixar. But that does not prevent that animes like ""Douluo Dalu, 2018"" and ""Ling Long: Incarnation, 2019"" have been able to use this resource in a very evident, expressive and enabling way.It is interesting to note how...Ling Long: Incarnation has a very strong relationship with video games. Both visually and narratively, anime has a very unique principle in being able to link such choices to convey a feeling that we are enjoying daily gambling. The first scene of the anime conveys this idea very well.The characters start in a kind of cave where they need to take resources and go back to their base. As soon as they get what they want, they are attacked by a type of mutant insect that baffles the minds of some, and also by a giant lizard.The characters have a mission, after achieving their objective, they need to escape to survive. This idea is not only in the narrative structure of the anime, but also in the visual, which are very characteristic of shooting games, and in the way the anime is staged.In addition to the expressive use of 3D, which always seeks to travel through spaces, which always leaves the viewer in a great perspective of the action, it also has some frameworks that complement a lot of shooting games. In the action scenes, the characters get to be in first and third person.If Douluo Dalu is an anime that takes advantage of this resource in a very ""poetic"" way trying to express a more contemplative and enchanting beauty, here the scenarios have a presence that seeks more dynamism in the scenes. The camera at various times even floats through the action. The anime makes great sequences without losing perspective on what is happening in each sequence. Something that is not impossible to do in conventional 2D animation, but that requires much more effort and technique from those who are doing it. It turns out that anime isn\'t just about that. The plot also explores a certain social and religious context and hierarchy that guides the events of history.One of my “disappointments” was to think that the anime was going to take this idea - of a game narrative - way ahead. It turns out that most of the anime sequences take place only on the floating base of the characters and in some flashbacks.But in no way would I say that such a development of social classes was bad. In fact, anime spends a lot of time contextualizing everything it can from that universe. Even though it was not what I wanted to see, consequently, I ended up being very interested in everything that was presented to me. The direction also managed to express a dramatic possibility of this 3D very well. Not to the point of making you cry, but rather to interest and instigate.If I could make a general summary, I would say that Ling Long: Incarnation tries in every way to play the viewer in the whole context of that universe.

To my surprise, Incarnation gives almost no importance to the monsters, instead focusing on the human interactions and struggles in the society that formed on this new world.  After a global earthquake unleashes a myriad of underground monsters on the surface, collective known as Extremozoan, humanity is almost entirely wiped out. The last remains lives aboard the Lighthouse, a flying fortress. In order to maintain the civilization, all interpessoal...relationships have been abolished. All individuals live only in function to their role on the Lighthouse hierarchy, being divided in 2 segments: Superiors, those who were born with desirable genetic traits, and who are given the most important jobs and best living conditions; and Inferiors, those who were born just as regular people, delegated to the worst living conditions and, ""less important"" jobs. Only Superiors are given names, while Inferiors are reduced to just to ""Worker N° ####"".  This is a refreshing change from the usual ""medieval magic fantasy"" that 95% of Donghua are composed of. Another welcomed change is the animation quality: while most CGI shows have frame drops issues and kinda ugly graphics, Incarnation is really fluid and good looking, some scenes are actually beautiful. This was a really pleasant surprise of a show and i can\'t recommend it enough. relationships have been abolished.

The soundtrack is very addicting, and the opening and ending songs are amazing. The characters are greatly portrayed as well.

In order to faciliate the most efficient use of resources and preserve the human race, every person is expected to become a cog in the system that runs the ""Lighthouse"". Familial relationships have been abolished, reproduction is centrally planned, humans are seperated into classes to dictate resource investments, and religion is established to reinforce the caste system and encourage the self-sacrifices needed...to sustain this society.

It is very distressing yet suspenseful it kept me at the edge of my seat beaming on what will happen in the next episode.Ling Long Incarnation is a Chinese donghua set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian, barren world where humanity tries to solve the problem of interplanetary migration but fails due to natural destruction. Extremezoans, a mutated living organism capable of interpersonal communication and coordination dwell in colonies on the ground. It appears that they are scavenger organisms that feed on other living organisms as well as breed fast and...regenerate faster. Mutants such as the Extremezoans are the main reason why humanity is on the brink of extinction.The Lighthouse is a city in the sky that houses humanity's last hope of survival. The Lighthouse has 3 codes of survival which are rules that can never be crossed: Abolishment of Family, Social Hierarchy and Gene Optimization.Abolishment of Family on the Lighthouse is a rule that forbids intimacy or familial relations. The introduction of this rule lays the foundation that humans must be controlled in order preserve function in the Lighthouse. An example of this are hunters who are bred and trained specifically for combat ability and awareness - Their purpose is the reason they are alive - not to find mating partners - which is heavily enforced by the Light and Shadow Religion on the Lighthouse.Humans on the Lighthouse are segregated into social hierarchy groups called Superior and Inferior. Inferior humans have health defects which deem them unworthy of a high standard of living like Superiors and are often subject to prejudice and maltreatment. Inferiors get pesky jobs like manual labor and they also accompany the Hunters on missions. Some Hunters treat Inferiors as expendable fodder on missions which is a main reason why Inferiors don't have a long life expectancy. When humans on the Lighthouse reach an age where they cannot contribute more than they consume (in food, health expenses etc.) they are sent on a Long Journey on the ground which basically sacrifices them to reduce resource consumption.Gene Optimization on the Lighthouse is a rule that prioritizes Superior human matching. It is pretty much selective breeding where Superior humans with outstanding features like intellect are bred with humans with outstanding physical capabilities. If a Superior child is birthed, both parties will be rewarded heavily by the Lighthouse but if an Inferior child is birthed the child is sent to the slums where the Inferior humans live. It is against this rule for Inferior humans to breed because the worm cakes ration supplied to the Inferior humans is limited.Religion and culture are forbidden on the Lighthouse, there is only one religion that the Lighthouse acknowledges which is the Light and Shadow Religion. This religion is a controlled cult-worship religion that works in strict affiliation with the Lighthouse leaders. It seems the main idea behind this religion was to brainwash and control Superior humans to keep them contributing to the Lighthouse. In one of the earlier scenes, we can see the Chairman of the Light and Shadow Religion (Son of the master of the Lighthouse) praising Superior humans for obeying the codes of survival, one lady was praised for following the gene optimization rule and one man was praised for denying familial relations with his 'father'.All of these aspects work together to form a series of life rules that control and oppress humans on the Lighthouse. This forces everyone to be complacent with the rules and in the chance someone disobeys they are publicly executed to set an example.STORY:  9/10The story is very descriptive and expansive. Without going into too much detail, we see many perspective and living situations of human life on the Lighthouse. The rules of survival is a genius way that many dystopian survival dramas use to restrict and control the characters and story progression. It also creates the sense of entrapment fearing that the characters will revolt and disobey the rules ultimately facing their demise. Thematically, the story is very aspiring and significant.ART & SOUND: 8/10The CGI animation isn't as flashy as some high budget series like Mortal's Journey or Perfect World but it is very visually detailed. The characters aren't all that detailed but they have realistic fluidity in their movements. The fight scene between Captain Marc and his trainer is a testament to how fluid their movements are which was a surprise. The angles are also have variation and add suspense in some senses on the ground.Sound design is very good, during the first mission there was a lot of background music and sound effects that added suspense and evoked fear. The scene where the inferiors first encounter the spinal organism is an example of good sound effects and suspenseful music to evoke fear and suspense.CHARACTER: 8/10I liked how we weren't spoon fed the story in chronological order. In Episode 1 to 3 we follow the first mission but it plays backwards as a storytelling mechanism when Captain Marc explains it to the Lighthouse Master. Furthermore, The conversation between the Lighthouse Master and Captain Marc about Marc's sister left me questioning for a while until it was brought up in a flash back much later in the series. The story flows but the dead characters still have influence on the storytelling mechanism. The same can be said about the blonde girl that died in the first mission - her unrequited love picked up by the silver haired girl from Marc's squad. And the sudden news of the silver haired girl's match added the icing on the cake. The only thing that I didn't really enjoy was how the character names were hard to remember - There's about 10-15 characters of importance in this season alone and knowing every character is very tricky because the series is so short it is difficult to remember the characters that way.OVERALL: 9/10Although this series feels like a 7 or 8/10 it had very good world building and character establishment in 6 episodes. The animation and sound added more depth into the viewing experience and character conflicts gave the series a personality.

Also, I appreciate the diversity in the range of characters used :)The final OVA hit me like...a truck and I'm still recovering emotionally ;-;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE watch all seasons :) a truck and I'm still recovering emotionally ;-;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE watch all seasons :)"", ""So I do really enjoy this show, gives an energy similar to dead space. And I'm a fan of shows that aren't afraid to kill some of their characters. the art feels like its a full story of something that could be on love death and robots so that's a big +. the characters are all honestly pretty good up until they aren't (like do something really stupid you would never expect them to do) to fuel a plot point or advance the story. Still a cool show though.this next thing is the only thing you could maybe consider slightly spoilerish but its important to...the review. it feels like whenever a character dies, almost no matter how insignificant of a background character they are, they HAVE to have a 2 minute -tension breaking sad final words while other characters call out their name- cliché moment, it happens with characters you wont even recognize. and this almost always is in the middle of combat. This gets more annoying in part 2.oh also the monsters in this show are pretty damn cool.I'd give it a 7.5 if I could. the review. it feels like whenever a character dies, almost no matter how insignificant of a background character they are, they HAVE to have a 2 minute -tension breaking sad final words while other characters call out their name- cliché moment, it happens with characters you wont even recognize. and this almost always is in the middle of combat.

Lupin III: Part 6 - Jidai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50094/Lupin_III__Part_6_-_Jidai,"[""***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***“You’re not old, you’re a classic… Jigen”The times, they are a-changin'It’s been 50 years since Lupin the Third initially hit television screens, and while the gentleman thief tailored himself to each new iteration, his partner Daisuke Jigen remained the cool-headed, hard-boiled gunslinger he was since day one. The same can be said for the man behind the voice. From his first appearance in the 1969 pilot film, to the most recent Lupin the Third: the First film in 2019, Kiyoshi Kobayashi has been the voice of Daisuke Jigen. Kobayashi and Jigen have been one in the same for decades. But at the...ripe age of 88, it’s about time that Kobayashi holstered his Smith & Wesson for the final time. It was announced earlier this year that Kobayashi would be retiring, with Akio Otsuka taking the role of Jigen for Part 6. While initially sad news, it’s great that Kobayashi was able to exit on his own terms. Besides, with the legacy he left behind, Kobayashi has forever left his imprint on Jigen. It’s time to pass the baton (or more accurately, the Model 19). And what better way to give Kobayashi a proper send off than with this special Episode 0, aptly titled, “The Times”.Following a heist-gone-wrong, Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon end up in jail. It’s business as usual, but Jigen thinks it might be time to call it quits. This latest caper, filled with AI drones and dudes with high-tech weaponry, left a lot to be desired for the antiquated trigger-man. Things just ain’t how they used to be – maybe that’s a sign for Jigen to hang up his hat. “The Times” is a deeply introspective episode, with a meta-contextual mood that begs the question, “Why are we still doing this?”Looking back on 50 years of Lupin the Third, not much has really changed. Sure, Lupin has changed his coat a handful of times, and the artstyle has had a few facelifts, but at its core, this series has remained true to its roots. The fact that Lupin the Third has remained relevant for half a century is a testament to the infallible characters Monkey Punch created all those years ago. No matter the time or place, Lupin is the gentleman thief and Jigen his right hand man. Goemon is the reliable rival and Fujiko the fickle femme fatale. And of course, Inspector Zenigata will be hot on their trail. These characters have outlived the word trope, ascending to their own gold standard. WE know why they’ve kept it up all these years, but in the context of Episode 0, the reason for their continued cops-and-robbers boils down to a timeless, wholesome bond between these characters.What “The Times” lacks in plot, it makes up for as a character piece. This episode is a slow-boil with plenty of playful downtime and no-nonsense dialogue – its pitch perfect for a guy like Daisuke Jigen. Each of the token cast members gets a moment to reflect on that larger-than-life question, but ultimately, it’s Jigen’s choice whether he sticks around or not. Goemon is frustrated that Lupin isn’t more concerned about Jigen’s possible departure. Lupin responds with a poignant portrait of their relationship and why the two have remained partners in crime all these years.“When times change, I adapt to them. That’s how I’ve always lived. But Daisuke Jigen is the only man who never said a word and just accepted me no matter who I was. He’s the only stable thing in my life. And maybe that’s why I’ve been able to stay true to myself. So it’s simple: No matter what he decides to do, I return the favor by accepting it just the same.”After 50 years of heists and hijinks, the bond between Lupin and Jigen needs no lengthy explanation. Why has Jigen stuck around with Lupin this whole time? Well, life’s just more fun that way.The times, they are a changin’. But Jigen baby, you don’t gotta change a damn thing.With “These Times”, time has come full-circle for Lupin the Third’s 50th anniversary. For the newest installment, Lupin dons the green jacket once again, harkening back to the series’ origin. In the same vein, we say goodbye to the last remaining remnant of the original anime production. Thank you for all of your work, Kobayashi-san. As far as I’m concerned Kiyoshi Kobayashi is and forever will be Daisuke Jigen.

This episode was an amazing tribute to him and I honestly cried a little. We had a very good participation of the main cast, with the focus on Jigen's life and his point of view on the world around him. It really felt like it was the seiyuu himself saying his goodbyes to the character. I will miss this man a lot since I'm a big fan of the series.Let’s welcome Akio Ootsuka who is the perfect man to fill in the big shoes with part 6! "", ""I've watched almost all of Lupin III seasons and films over the years and I'm happy that over 50 years since the original Pilot film from 1969 it still gets a lot of love and attention. It really shows what a masterpiece the legendary Monkey Punch came up with.This Special has two purposes: being an appetizer for the upcoming 6th Season of Lupin III and giving a special send off to Kobayashi Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi has been voicing Jigen ever since the 1969 pilot and this was his last contribution to this legendary franchise. In fact, of the original cast he was the last one standing....From this day onwards, every Lupin character will have a different voice actor compared to the original cast.Because this is a tribute to Kiyoshi, of course this special had to revolve around Jigen's quirks: his old school vibe, his trademark magnum, his refusal to modernise himself and his motivations to still be a part of Lupin's gang after so many adventures, robberies, schemes and so many other shenanigans.This was very enjoyable, had the good old Lupin III vibe everywhere except on one department: soundtrack. Lupin's classic soundtrack is one of the things that makes the Lupin III franchise what it is and since this is a tribute to Kiyoshi's work as Jigen, it needed to be more present. That's the only thing I would change in this special.All things considered, it gets a 9/10 from me. A must watch if you're a Lupin III fan.Happy retirement, Kobayashi Kiyoshi! You'll always be Jigen to me. :) From this day onwards, every Lupin character will have a different voice actor compared to the original cast.Because this is a tribute to Kiyoshi, of course this special had to revolve around Jigen's quirks: his old school vibe, his trademark magnum, his refusal to modernise himself and his motivations to still be a part of Lupin's gang after so many adventures, robberies, schemes and so many other shenanigans.This was very enjoyable, had the good old Lupin III vibe everywhere except on one department: soundtrack.

You'll always be Jigen to me. :)"", 'Temper your expectations, because this isn\'t exactly the grandiose send-off that it could have been.Labeled as ""Episode 0"", this is effectively a special prelude to Part 6 to commemorate the retirement of OG Jigen voice actor Kiyoshi Kobayashi. With the weight of a 50 year history with the character on its shoulders, you\'d certainly hope for this production to provide something truly special. Its important to recognize however, that that\'s simply not what this is. At best, this is a perfectly ""okay"" Lupin episode that operates as a loose tribute mostly from behind the scenes. There\'s not necessarily a whole lot wrong with it,...but I personally feel as if its severely lacking in ambitiousness. I was really hoping that they would go all out for something like this, and aim for something uniquely gripping and sentimental, but its really just a pretty standard character episode with a couple of small nods relating to its underlying meta. The narrative effectively has Jigen considering retiring in-universe, followed by a series of dialogues between him and each main character, reflecting on their dynamics and relationships. It\'s a cute setup, and there are some fun moments and standout lines that do somewhat cement that sense of history and nostalgic sentimentality, but the fairly basic nature of the episode overall personally left much to be desired. Its also worth noting that the presentation is not especially that strong. This is a pretty massive downgrade compared to Parts 4 and 5 in the visual department, and is a lot more in line with what you\'d expect from the generic mediocrity of the TV specials. The designs this time around feel perhaps a bit uninspired, leaning in this weird middle ground between the classic Part 1 designs and their modern counterparts, and the animation and art in particular are pretty wildly inconsistent, typically ranging from average/decent to outright bad. It does have its moments though, with occasional instances of moody lighting/compositing as well as some surprisingly interesting directing and editing moments. If nothing else, at the very least it demonstrates that it has some aesthetic potential, which I can only hope will be amplified in Part 6 proper. The music is about what you\'d expect, Yuji Ohno is still pumping out absolute bangers.Ultimately, it\'s a perfectly serviceable send-off, but just not much beyond that. but I personally feel as if its severely lacking in ambitiousness.

It has all the standard Lupin beats of daring escapes, secret hideouts, and Fujiko betrayals, but the themes it explores are what elevates it.This was Kiyoshi Kobayashi's final role as Jigen, and as such, they made it a great story revolving around the character. We get a quick little character study on what makes him special to those who know him, why he's Lupin's closest ally, and how the...ever-changing world makes the gunman feel unsure of himself.This special was very uplifting. Just as the Lupin gang finds their way out of another tight situation, you get the sense that Kobayashi's performance is as timeless as the characters themselves. Lupin states he would support Jigen's decision to leave if it was what he really wanted, and it felt like this was being said of the man who'd brought Jigen to life for so many years. It's ok if it's time for you to rest and retire, you've given us so much and the least we can do is support your own choices in a non-judgmental way as the torch is passed on.This special gives me high hopes for the upcoming Part 6. It felt like a beautiful tribute, and I am hoping the fun energy of this special as well as the gorgeous visuals and sound design is something that remains for the full season. ever-changing world makes the gunman feel unsure of himself.This special was very uplifting.

Kore wa Zombie desu ka?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8841/Kore_wa_Zombie_desu_ka,"['Maybe it’s because I’m getting old and senile, but it seems that the more anime I watch, the less sense they seem to make. You could imagine my confusion when I started watching Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? ""Why is the zombie weak to sunlight but not the vampire? Why the hell is he in a pink frilly dress? Why is that monster a giant lobster?"" In exasperation, I put these questions to a good friend, and I found that his reply turn out to be a very apt one-sentence summary for my review.He said to me: ""I dunno lol, who cares? It\'s fucking hilarious!""Everything...in Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, from story to character to humor, is based on complete outrageousness. I hesitate to call Kore wa Zombie~ an original anime, because it\'s seems that Kore wa Zombie~\'s idea of originality is to take as many ideas as possible, exaggerate them to the absolute maximum limit of the imagination, and then cram them together into a single, epic anime.So exactly is it that I mean when I say outrageousness? Let\'s pretend that there are 2 \'idea guys\' who started working on the story for this, whom I will dub them Jim and Bob. (Warning, minor spoilers)""Here\'s an idea!"" says Jim. ""Let\'s make the main protagonist a zombie.""""Great idea!"" replies Bob. ""We\'ll have an utterly immortal zombie who constantly gets humorously dismembered, baked like a potato chip when he stands in the sun, and receives magical powers that turns him into a pink cross-dressing/chainsaw wielding mas(h)ou shoujo(nen).""""Awesome,"" nods Jim with approval, ""and since this is a harem, we need at least one tsundere character.""""Of course,"" replies Bob again, ""we\'ll have a pseudo-sadistic tsun~ ninja girl with a ridiculously named fighting technique that uses cellulose (leaves), cooks up acid pots, and plays the violin in a maid orchestra.""""Let\'s make her a vampire as well."" adds Jim.""Why the heck not,"" laughs Bob, giving Jim a high-five.... and you get the idea.What is most surprising about Kore wa Zombie~ despite having so many wild concepts crammed in, it somehow still manages to tie it all into a very neat comical package. Normally you\'d expect something so slapstick-heavy to comprise it\'s plot and characters, but Kore wa Zombie~ manages to seamlessly incorporate all it\'s content into an (almost) coherent and flowing story.The characters in Kore wa Zombie~ are all, well, ridiculous. I mean one of them literally has like, 10 different voice actors. And she doesn\'t talk! (try getting your head around that one). Needless to say, all the characters are very \'interesting\' and their backstories relatively well thought out and presented. There is the exception of the protagonist\'s human friend cuz, he\'s well... y\'know, normal. Kore wa Zombie~ is a harem of course, so there is the usual male lead and his entourage of female companions. What is great though is that unlike many harem (to Love-Ru for instance) that focuses on the protagonist\'s perverse interactions with the females, Kore wa Zombie~ instead chooses to emphasize building the relationship between the male lead and his companions, which I thought was a nice change of pace.I wouldn\'t exactly call Kore wa Zombie\'s story solid, the plot itself isn\'t exactly complex; there are various backstories which were left untouched and minor plot hole issues. As far as harem-type story goes however, Kore wa Zombie\'s plot is definitely up there in with the rest. The interesting aspect of Kore wa Zombie~\'s story isn\'t WHAT is happening, but HOW it\'s happening, and I found that with Kore wa Zombie~’s almost surrealistic approach, I was caring about the actual plot a lot less that I normally would have, because I was too distracted that ridiculously hilarious thing that just happened.Another thing is the art. While Kore wa Kore~\'s animation quality is nothing too spectacular, the action scenes are unique in that they contain a very interesting combination of a dark tone, spectacle, gore, and an excess of pink. Yeah don\'t think too hard on that one. The OP is also surprisingly well done, and it almost makes me sad that they couldn\'t maintain the same level of quality throughout the entire episode.The only gripe I have with this anime is due to it\'s comical nature, there are various moments when supposedly serious scenes are ruined because they took the humor a little bit too far. To give one example (spoiler alert), in the final moments of the main antagonist\'s death, as he lies dying in the arms of his necromancer, he looks into her eyes in a touching scene, and he says:""If I die, make me a penguin.""Hahaha... No wait. Seriously?This really isn\'t a major issue, but I was disappointed in the show slight deficiency in real consequential, solemn scenes which didn\'t involve some sort of joke tacked on the end. It made the anime feel a little bit one sided and narrow, and prevented me from giving it a higher score. One thing to mention though. They actually bothered air another episode after the \'big climatic battle\'. I literally can\'t count the number of times I\'ve watched anime that seemed to think that a 3 minute epilogue was sufficient in ending the story after the big boss goes down. Kore wa Zombie~ actually took the effort to give some rarely found closure to the story. Thank god.Kore wa Zombie~ is a rather unique anime, perhaps something you\'d expect if you crossed J.C. Staff with SHAFT. It definitely won\'t win any awards and it\'s not exactly thought provoking, but it easily makes up for it in sheer ridiculousness and outrage. So why should you watch Kore wa Zombie desu ka?I dunno lol, who cares? It\'s fucking hilarious! in Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, from story to character to humor, is based on complete outrageousness.

So why should you watch Kore wa Zombie desu ka?I dunno lol, who cares? It\'s fucking hilarious!', 'Is everything really better with zombies?Given the recent surge in stories involving the shambling undead it\'s pretty obvious that there are people out there who believe that they can improve any form of entertainment, so much so that at times it seems as though the world is already in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Tales of creatures that wander aimlessly, groan a lot, and have the annoying habit of eating people while they\'re still alive are rife in movies and games (although I tend to class Resident Evil as more of a playable soap opera with added undead), but that\'s only the tip of...the iceberg. Zombies are now appearing on prime time TV (The Walking Dead), and even literary works have fallen foul of them (Pride & Prejudice & Zombies).Of course, anime and manga are no strangers to stories of the undead, and while there are some interesting takes on the theme (and before you ask, no, the adolescent wet dream that is Highschool Of The Dead isn\'t one of them), the majority of titles on offer follow the George A. Romero method and offer up a healthy dose of body shock. While there are stories like Zombie Loan that try to do things differently, these are often lacklustre affairs that are more drama than actual horror.And then there are shows like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka (Is This A Zombie)?Originally a popular light novel series by Kimura Shinichi (which has also spawned three different manga that are set in the world of the story), the anime adaptation follows the life of Ayumu Aikawa, a highschool student who was murdered by a serial killer. He was quickly resurrected as a zombie by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, and since that time he has tried to make the best of a bad situation. His life now consists of everyday mundanity (barring an inability to tolerate the sun and avoiding fire hazards), as he lives in relative peace with his silent saviour, but all that changes when he meets the young, chainsaw wielding masou shoujo in training called Haruna (and no, that\'s not a spelling mistake).After that his life takes a turn for the worse.Okay, it all sounds pretty intriguing, but that\'s as far as it goes. The plot features some interesting tokens that work well with one or more of the themes in KoreZom, but the series composition has been poorly executed, so much so that viewers may find themselves wondering if there\'s any point to the show. The main problem is that there\'s simply too much going on, and because of this the storyline is so disjointed it can sometimes seem like the narrative is being held together with some glue and a couple of nails, and that\'s not the worst part.KoreZom attempts to parody some well known genres, and initially it may manage to raise a few laughs with its approach, but this quickly becomes tiresome as the series attempts to turn them into running gags. In addition to this the idea of putting all of the protagonists under one roof has only been done for those stereotypical comedy moments that are amusing to those with more teeth than braincells, which is a shame as there are a few hints of how funny the show could have been. The storyline appears to be desperately trying to reach for ... something, but what it is and how it could be achieved are things that only the producers may know.Unfortunately the shoddy workmanship continues into the visuals where generic design seems to be the order of the day. Aside from the outfits, KoreZom features some truly unremarkable looking characters, all of whom look like they were copied directly from other harem based shows. That said, Studio DEEN are only partly to blame for this as the main inspiration came from the light novel\'s illustrations by Kobuichi and Muririn, which is a tad unfortunate as if the rest of the artwork is anything to go by, the series would have been better served with the producers creating everything from scratch. While the scenery and settings may sometimes be generic, they can also be atmospheric and detailed, and there\'s a variety to the imagery that highlights the difference in creative mentalities. Granted the character design may have been an attempt to support the parodying of specific genres, but that\'s no excuse for the obvious lack of originality or innovation.Which brings up the issue of fanservice.When a show has a transparently weak foundation there are many ways to bolster the viewer\'s opinion of it, but the one that takes the least effort follows the simple ethos that ""sex sells"". Now somebody on the production team obviously realised very early on that KoreZom was a shaky proposition so not only is the fanservice aggressively blatant, it often feels more like a slap in the face.I mean seriously, is there any need for all those close ups during the fights? This is supposed to be a comedy, not Ikkitousen or Queen\'s Blade.Aside from the background imagery, the only other good point about the visuals is the animation, most of which is of a decent standard. There are a few blips here and there, some of which are purposeful to highlight certain comedic aspects while  others simply slipped through the net, but these can be forgiven in light of the major problems this series has.The opening sequence features a rather dramatic array of imagery depicting the main characters in various ""thoughtful"" poses before adding some action sequences to highlight their combat skills, all set to the song Leave-It-To-Me-Tonight by Nomizu Iori. Unlike the OP, the ending sequence is more true to the predominantly humourous tone of the series, and features the track Realize, Mr. Zombie, I Am Your Classmate by Rie Yamaguchi and Manzo. As for the background music, KoreZom has a nice variety of well choreographed accompaniments, but the truth is that a few of them are unnecessary as they don\'t really add much to the scene and seem like nothing more than another support for a weak storyline.Surprisingly, especially given all of the production issues, the acting is actually pretty decent. The script is fairly mediocre as it follows an age old comedy format (so repetitive phrases abound), which isn\'t really the best thing for the serious moments in the show as it can be difficult to make the mental switch between humour and action - and this shows in several places. Thankfully the seiyuu are on hand to save the day, so what could have been very flat comedy routines gain some life and the more emotive scenes are provided with much needed personality. Unfortunately the actors are only human, so even though they do their best with the script, there\'s simply not enough viable content to support or develop their roles.Now given that KoreZom is supposed to be a parody of sorts it should be the case that characterisation is all that\'s needed to make the series work, so it\'s a little disappointing that the characters are nothing more than shallow copies based upon one or more archetypes that are generally found in harem romantic comedies. Aikawa is the typical clueless lead male with few future prospects who is suddenly surrounded by females who apparently like necrophilia (he\'s a zombie, remember?), and after his introduction viewers can engage in a spot of ornithology (bird watching).Oh look! There\'s the Greater Spotted Tsundere Loli, and over there is the Large Breasted Warrior trying not to look embarrassed, and in front of the TV you can see the Silver Haired Silent Warbler waiting to be entertained.Yes, KoreZom has a wealth of common character types that will keep any harem junkie entertained for five minutes, and the best thing about all of them is that viewers will never once believe that they could ever be real, so feeble is their characterisation and development.So is there actually anything good about this series?Well ... actually there are a few bits worthy of praise, and if one discounts the generally banal and inane humour then KoreZom has a few morsels to offer. There are some genuinely funny moments that are both surprising and well executed, and the while the initial parody of the mahou shouko genre is pretty bog standard, the second one actually refutes the idea that Puella Magi Madoka★Magica was in any way genre breaking.Unfortunately the comedy can only carry the show so far, and the simple fact is that KoreZom simply doesn\'t know what it\'s supposed to be, so it winds up being nothing in particular. It\'s a shame really as the seeds are there for this to have been either an interesting supernatural tale, or a very good parody (if one removes the unnecessary fanservice), and it\'s nice to see a different take on zombies once again.The sad fact is that the traditional zombie is now almost extinct in entertainment media, and those that remain are treated as rare relics of the original belief that a person could be magically raised from the dead in order to complete tasks like carrying the shopping, painting the house, etc, etc. These old style zombies from West Africa and Haiti are usually a far cry from the modern take, often being better groomed, able to speak, and capable of following simple orders.Actually, they sound a lot like husbands. the iceberg. Zombies are now appearing on prime time TV (The Walking Dead), and even literary works have fallen foul of them (Pride & Prejudice & Zombies).Of course, anime and manga are no strangers to stories of the undead, and while there are some interesting takes on the theme (and before you ask, no, the adolescent wet dream that is Highschool Of The Dead isn\'t one of them), the majority of titles on offer follow the George A. Romero method and offer up a healthy dose of body shock. While there are stories like Zombie Loan that try to do things differently, these are often lacklustre affairs that are more drama than actual horror.And then there are shows like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka (Is This A Zombie)?Originally a popular light novel series by Kimura Shinichi (which has also spawned three different manga that are set in the world of the story), the anime adaptation follows the life of Ayumu Aikawa, a highschool student who was murdered by a serial killer. He was quickly resurrected as a zombie by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, and since that time he has tried to make the best of a bad situation. His life now consists of everyday mundanity (barring an inability to tolerate the sun and avoiding fire hazards), as he lives in relative peace with his silent saviour, but all that changes when he meets the young, chainsaw wielding masou shoujo in training called Haruna (and no, that\'s not a spelling mistake).After that his life takes a turn for the worse.Okay, it all sounds pretty intriguing, but that\'s as far as it goes. The plot features some interesting tokens that work well with one or more of the themes in KoreZom, but the series composition has been poorly executed, so much so that viewers may find themselves wondering if there\'s any point to the show. The main problem is that there\'s simply too much going on, and because of this the storyline is so disjointed it can sometimes seem like the narrative is being held together with some glue and a couple of nails, and that\'s not the worst part.KoreZom attempts to parody some well known genres, and initially it may manage to raise a few laughs with its approach, but this quickly becomes tiresome as the series attempts to turn them into running gags. In addition to this the idea of putting all of the protagonists under one roof has only been done for those stereotypical comedy moments that are amusing to those with more teeth than braincells, which is a shame as there are a few hints of how funny the show could have been. The storyline appears to be desperately trying to reach for ... something, but what it is and how it could be achieved are things that only the producers may know.Unfortunately the shoddy workmanship continues into the visuals where generic design seems to be the order of the day.

(Im just randomly adding words here) And some fan-service to boot.SPOILER!Everyone\'s favourite GIGA PUDDI made an appearance in episode 3 :)', ""So what is 'Is This A Zombie?' aka 'Koreha Zombie Desu ka?'Zombie Desu ka (as I'll refer to it from now on) is an anime that abuses genre cliches, it's horrendously inconsistent, shockingly violent and has some of the most uncomfortable shots of a guy's ass on several occasions...and it's easily one of the funniest animes I've ever seen.YES. Zombie Desuka is the BUSINESS. I honestly couldn't contain my laughter ever since the dynamic and hysterical first episode. What makes this anime so special is, as I've mentioned, how it abuses genre cliches such as harem, shonen, fantasy, fanservice and even a bit of heavily...implied yaoi. There's an ample amount of fanservice in this anime, ranging from your typical 'pantsu' shots to bouncing cleavage, but there's also a surprising amount of fujoshi bait (and by that I mean moments that would make girl fans cream themselves) which is a nice balance. So while it was uncomfortable to see the main character's ass every so often, I can take it as fair since modern animes try more to appeal to both perverse fanbases.Speaking of the main character, Ayumu is your typical, lazy-eyed, dangling spiky hair protagonist. You can draw comparisons between him and Tomoya from Clannad and Ichika from infinite Stratos, but I believe that he is a lot like Sato from the anime Ben-To. They're both energetic guys who don't go out of their way to be perverted but are definitely guys who wouldn't pass a chance to take a look, nor do they act all bashful when they're caught. In fact, there's a lot of similarities between Ben-To and Zombie Desu ka, from the absurd plot devices, the pacing and tone as well as the random comedy. And like Ben-To, I found myself surprised by wacky elements popping up every so often and it was great how it managed to blend with the semi-serious story. I've grown fond of animes like this; the whole 'comedy action fanservice' genre, cause it manages to not take itself too seriously but delivers a hilarious plot with some great action and fanservice shots. It's a delicate balance that few animes manage to achieve properly, but these few are pretty amazing. Animes such as Heaven's Lost Property and Highschool DxD have much 'darker' stories and heavy ecchi/ fanservice, whereas animes like Ben-To and Zombie Desuka are lite on the fanservice but emphasize the wacky side more often.So as the title implies, the anime revolves around Ayumu being a zombie, resurrected by a quiet, moe necromancer named 'Eu' who treats him as a servant and friend. He uses his newfound life, and surprisingly superhuman powers, to find his killer. If this all sounds awfully serious and deep, trust me the first episode derails that by the end. The dramatic air that the first few minutes of the first episode give off is immediately dispelled by a hilarious moment when Ayumu gets hit by a car in a wacky fashion. By the end of the episode, I shit you not, he becomes a magical garment girl on top of being a zombie, doing a whole long-ass magical girl transformation and everything, with PANTY SHOTS AND EVERYTHING *shudders*. The weird train doesn't end there, as he ends up having a 'masou-shoujo' in this house, then later a vampire ninja girl (with big boobs, cause why not) and eventually has another vampire ninja girl (also well endowed) end up falling in love with him, under ridiculous, parody-cliche circumstances. While this all sounds like a cluster of absurd plot devices, it's exactly what makes this anime so hilarious.One of the defining features of Zombie Desu ka is the aforementioned moe necromancer, Eu. Her full name is 'Eucliwood Hellscythe' and she takes the quiet moe girl cliche to a whole new level. What I found very creative is how, while she doesn't speak at all and prefers to write down what she wants to say, the main character imagines her voice in his head, saying perverted things in place of the normal request she asked. This is done each episode by a different voice actress (both in the sub and dub) so you're never sure which voice is her real one, and it's probably one of the most creative things about her character. While there's a lot of cliches in her design, her reason for not speaking are actually quite dramatic. The explanation comes off as a load of over-complicated fantasy mumbo-jumbo, but it fits in with the semi-serious tone of the show and it's a major plot device. I won't ruin too much but there's a lot of surprises in store regarding her reasons for not speaking, and trust me you'll wanna see what those reasons are.The antagonists in this anime are unexpected but manage to be entertaining in their own ways, and the overarching main bad guy delivers one of THE funniest lines in the second to last episode. The final episode decides to take all the cliches it hadn't touched upon and abuse them to a comedic end as well, and so does the OVA episode. While this can be considered a harem anime at its base level it surprisingly manages to dodge a ton of genre cliches or use them in moderation; strange for an anime that parodies cliches. It almost never uses the typical 'walk in on girl naked' cliche and 'fall on and grope girl' cliche that animes like To Love Ru are infamous for, and when it does the result is violent retribution (as usual) which is balanced by the fact that Ayumu is a zombie so any physical damage is real but doesn't last. The main character however does go through a ton of physical and verbal abuse from start to finish, being called 'pervert' and 'maggot' for a ton of different reasons, a lot of which is funny. However the vampire ninja girl Sera does weigh on your patience with her persistent insults and she's not even a tsundere or love interest waiting to happen, she's more of the freeloader who has her own motives and shits on the main character all the time. While she is hot and her insults are funny for the most part, it can become annoying after a while. Despite that, every character manages to be goofy and funny in a variety of ways so small things like that don't get in the way.That isn't to say that Zombie Desu Ka is perfect, far from it. There's a lot of plot holes, inconsistencies and moments that go unanswered. There's characters that get introduced but disappear just as quickly or aren't seen often. There's plot devices that are mentioned or implied, but never expanded upon. And there's a lot of issues regarding the depth of Ayumu's powers and why he's able to steal someone else's powers. However, I don't believe that any of these are an issue since the animes M.O. from the start was to abuse plot devices and cliches, so you tend to go with the flow rather than look for answers in a semi-serious anime. A lot of the occurrences in animes like Excel Saga go unexplained and we accept them purely because it's wacky fun, and whilst a lot of comedy animes have a decent amount of wacky elements I'd say that Zombie Desu Ka is one of the few animes that fully embraces the wacky side. Despite the inconsistencies, there's a lot of subtle things that this anime does well. The animation is solid and the fight scenes are fluid and epic. The music is upbeat and can be mellow when dramatic things occur. The plot device of Ayumu hating the sun since it dries him up (strange plot device for a zombie, I know) is interestingly accentuated by how blinding the light is during the day and each character has one or two defining quirks just like this, including the main bad guy. So while it was the kind of anime you don't have to think too deeply about, it was easy on the eyes too.In the end, what can I say about Zombie Desu Ka? It's absurd, it's violent, it's random and it's just plain weird sometimes. But it's also hilarious, epic, touching at times and surprising at other times. I don't usually give numbered scores but if I could give this anime a score i'd give it a 9/10. I've only watched the first season so far so I have big hopes for the second. I watched the dub of it, and the cast did a phenomenal job, especially with the many voices that portrayed Eu in Ayumu's thoughts. Both the japanese and english versions manage to be funny for their own reasons in both the delivery of jokes and contexts of funny situations, so each is a unique watch. I look forward to watching the dub of the second season and I really hope it doesn't derail itself like too many second seasons do. However if it's like Heaven's Lost Property or Highschool DxD, it can only get better and funnier. Despite all the physical violence, verbal abuse, weird situations and world ending events that come across Ayumu's way, he can take it. Why? Cause he's a zombie. implied yaoi.

While she is hot and her insults are funny for the most part, it can become annoying after a while. Despite that, every character manages to be goofy and funny in a variety of ways so small things like that don't get in the way.That isn't to say that Zombie Desu Ka is perfect, far from it. There's a lot of plot holes, inconsistencies and moments that go unanswered. There's characters that get introduced but disappear just as quickly or aren't seen often. There's plot devices that are mentioned or implied, but never expanded upon. And there's a lot of issues regarding the depth of Ayumu's powers and why he's able to steal someone else's powers. However, I don't believe that any of these are an issue since the animes M.O. from the start was to abuse plot devices and cliches, so you tend to go with the flow rather than look for answers in a semi-serious anime. A lot of the occurrences in animes like Excel Saga go unexplained and we accept them purely because it's wacky fun, and whilst a lot of comedy animes have a decent amount of wacky elements I'd say that Zombie Desu Ka is one of the few animes that fully embraces the wacky side. Despite the inconsistencies, there's a lot of subtle things that this anime does well. The animation is solid and the fight scenes are fluid and epic. The music is upbeat and can be mellow when dramatic things occur. The plot device of Ayumu hating the sun since it dries him up (strange plot device for a zombie, I know) is interestingly accentuated by how blinding the light is during the day and each character has one or two defining quirks just like this, including the main bad guy. So while it was the kind of anime you don't have to think too deeply about, it was easy on the eyes too.In the end, what can I say about Zombie Desu Ka? It's absurd, it's violent, it's random and it's just plain weird sometimes. But it's also hilarious, epic, touching at times and surprising at other times. I don't usually give numbered scores but if I could give this anime a score i'd give it a 9/10. I've only watched the first season so far so I have big hopes for the second. I watched the dub of it, and the cast did a phenomenal job, especially with the many voices that portrayed Eu in Ayumu's thoughts. Both the japanese and english versions manage to be funny for their own reasons in both the delivery of jokes and contexts of funny situations, so each is a unique watch. I look forward to watching the dub of the second season and I really hope it doesn't derail itself like too many second seasons do. However if it's like Heaven's Lost Property or Highschool DxD, it can only get better and funnier. Despite all the physical violence, verbal abuse, weird situations and world ending events that come across Ayumu's way, he can take it. Why? Cause he's a zombie."", 'Have you ever seen an anime you were convinced was going to be really cool and interesting and only just to have it let you down to no end?  Welcome to my experience with Kore Wa Zombie Desu Ka.  After two episodes which presented a genuinely interesting and refreshing take on the harem genre (interesting takes on mythological creatures, nobody particularly interested in each other romantically, basically just putting up with each other simply because they have to), this series succumbs to the harem tropes it actively avoids and just becomes ultimately a very lazy series.The initial concept for this show is actually...pretty interesting, with Ayumu who has just recently become a zombie living with the necromancer who resurrected him because, well what else is he going to do realistically.  After his transformation, they meet other mythological creatures and beings such as a magical school girl and a vampire ninja.  They fight creatures called megalos which are evil spirits that actually have some really creative and inspired designs to them.  In one episode, they fight a giant whale in a school uniform that would put Sin from Final Fantasy X to shame.  In another, they fight a giant enemy crab and attack its weak point for massive damage.  One of the big points of humor in these fights is how as a zombie Ayumu basically has no powers, so he has to use magical girl powers a la Sailor Moon, which include gratuitous transformation sequences (it’s actually pretty funny in practice.)  In this regard, the first half of the series is the best because it focuses on the sheer lunacy of the entire situation and the creatures they have to fight.But then something terrible happens, Zombie No Desu Ka starts to take itself seriously.  This show, about a zombie living who uses magical girl powers and lives with a necromancer, another magical girl and a vampire ninja, starts to take itself incredibly seriously for some reason right around episode 4 or 5 and it absolutely kills the momentum.  When the show isn’t having fun with its ridiculous premise, its bogged down by pointless drama about Ayumu’s killer or a story arc later in the series that is so ridiculous that I can’t believe they even animated it.  On top of all this, after episode 6 the show just starts to become a victim of the same tired harem/ecchi anime tropes that we’ve seen a million times before.  The jokes start to get really lazy, the girls start to get interested in Ayumu, a new tsundere vampire ninja is introduced, and the entire show just becomes a drag.  It just drags itself through the motions up until the final episode, which is almost unwatchable.  It’s a pool episode featuring some terrible J-Pop performances from the cast of girls that I’m convinced almost made my ears bleed.  How in the hell did we get to this point?This is what happens when you completely forget why your show works and just start pulling stuff out of thin air to kill time.  This show could have been really cool by sticking to having fun with its absurd initial set up and following it through to the end.  I was completely on board to enjoy this show thoroughly.  Please don’t waste your time on this show.  It’s a crime that a show like this ended up getting better ratings across Japan than a masterpiece like Fractale, despite this being a wasted opportunity.  If you want a real comedy series, look elsewhere; this will just leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. pretty interesting, with Ayumu who has just recently become a zombie living with the necromancer who resurrected him because, well what else is he going to do realistically.

Today we'll talk about `Koreha Zombie Desuka?', whose original name is 「これはゾンビですか？」, henceforth called `KoreZom'. First, allow me to tell you that I've never read the original Light Novel, as well as never read any of the adaptation manga. So, every opinion bases itself on the anime, and no comparisons between adaptations are made.Well then, let us begin.~!~Story: 9 out of 10.KoreZom has lots of comedy, but even though it manage to unfold an very interesting plot. Since, once again, it has great focus over the comedy, I really wasn't expecting any story at all. I've seen comedy animes that just had almost...no plot; the anime seemed to flow only over its own jokes, but there was no development. Well then, KoreZom is not like that. As a matter of fact, its plot is much more well thought than other animes of this very season.I was going to give it 8, but it turned out 9 because the jokes are all very well timed and played, so much that they affect positively the story itself.By the way, every character seems to have cool backgrounds, but I fear those aren't going to be shown, unless we get a second season.~!~Art: 10 out of 10.It is beautiful. The characters' designed is cool and well-done, from casual outfits to a necromancer's armored outfit. Emotions are well expressed, too. Also very fitting are the backgrounds, from a high school to a graveyard, they're all very expressing, and cool.~!~Sound: 10 out of 10.Great voice acting, general background effects, as well as a rocking awesome opening! The ending music kind of sucks, although being funny, but since there's no reason to hear it, I didn't count it.There's really not much to say, really. It is just great.~!~Character: 10 out of 10.Now that's where that show shines. A cool zombie lead male, an even cooler necromancer girl (well, she's my fav anime girl), a bad-mouthed vampire ninja, an extravagant masou-shoujo (a pun with mahou-shoujo), and that's not even the beginning. Funny as hell friends, psychopath villains, and (yet again) funny enemies called `Megalos'.Damn, the characters are splendid, each one of them.~!~Enjoyment: 10 out of 10.Cool characters, well timed and played jokes, nice artwork, and a interesting story. How could you not enjoy it? You'll laugh out loud, pause at a certain zombie's delusions, re-watch the cool moments, and have chills in the spine with Yuu (also called Eu).~!~Overall: 10 out of 10.That's it, folks. There's absolutely no reason to look down or overlook this fantastic anime. Each episode proves better than the previous, and you'll catch yourself counting days until the next episode. The best thing is that there's more to come! And maybe we got even a second season.Now, I know that there will be folks that won't like it the way I do, for everybody has its own tastes. But well, that's my opinion: this anime is a masterpiece, whose only drawback is the low number of episodes.Until next time! no plot; the anime seemed to flow only over its own jokes, but there was no development.

Forget about mindless monsters trying to eat you alive. What we have here is a harem mixed with slapstick comedy, magic and lots of gore.Story: As in most harem animes, the actual story is not the show\'s main focus. However, at first glance, it seems quite a promising one for its genre, though pretty simple: A high school student is murdered after he is attacked by an unknown person. However, he is revived as a zombie with the help...of a weird necromancer girl. From then on, he serves as her undead servant, while at the same time searching for the one who killed him, as well as continuing his school life. Various other (female) characters are also introduced, including a magic girl and a vampire-ninja, each with their own mini-backstories.Art-Animation: Like most of the latest anime, the animation is very good. The designs are crisp and well drawn, and I dare say quite pretty. I can\'t say that I have any particular problem with it whatsoever.Sound: The voice acting does its job well, with the voices being properly funny or serious depending on what is needed. There is nothing really memorable about them, but that\'s not nececerily a bad thing, as long as the job gets done. What I do have to aplaud  is the OP, which is officially my third favourite OP of all time (behind only the OP of Umineko and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni).Characters: To the core, the characters in ""Kore wa Zombie desu ka?"" are pretty much the usual Harem stereotypes: A teenage guy surrounded by a bunch of girls (which include the typical tsundere, loli etc). However, the fact that they all belong in the supernatural world slightly changes things. They can all be quite kickass at times (except for the Necromancer girl, who is extremely docile 99% of the time, but bringing people back from the dead is even cooler anyway ;) ). They can all be hilariouly funny at the same time, and they all seem to have some higher goal in life than just sleeping with the other characters - which some of them also have, nontheless. To sum it up, they seem like proper characters, unlike in the majority of harem animes. I mean, what other harem features a zombie and a vampire ninja among the protagonists?Enjoyment: This a harem anime, so fanservice and tyical harem humor is always going to be there. But there is much more to it than that. The element of slapstic comedy is always there. What is unusual is the excecive (for the genre) amount of gore - which can be strangely funny, rather than shocking, at times. Add to that all the supernatural stuff... you \'ve got yourself a very good combination right?Overall: Harem, Comedy, Supernatural, Gore, School Life... there are not many series that combine all these. ""Kore wa Zombie desu ka?"" does so, and it seems to do so well. If you like any of the above genres, you \'ve got to give this a try. You might love it or you might not... but you\'ll never know until you try for yourself. of a weird necromancer girl.

I find myself torn while writing this, on one hand there were some extremely funny and enjoyable moments where I could not stop laughing. But on the other hand there were some downright terrible moments where I was raising my head to the ceiling praying for the scene to end. Is this a Zombie is an anime that makes it's mark by throwing in every genre, every character type, every trope, just everything really. If you can think of it there is a high probability you'll find it in this show. But despite throwing everything under the sun into this anime,...I would never dream of calling it cliche, and actually say it is extraordinarily unique.Story: 7Guy meets girl, they kind of like each other, plot ensues, girl now lives with guy, more girls live with guy, etc, etc. While some of the specifics may be new, the overall concept is nothing we have not seen.The Zombie and Necromancer (a.k.a servant and master) relationship was well done. Tack onto that the school life setting with a guy just trying to pass through along with his nerdy best friend; it was all well done, though a bit unoriginal. The eccentricities and unique nature of this show come in when we meet a chain-saw wielding Magical Girl (though she uses her magic a whole lot less than Ayumu...) and a busty Vampire Ninja with a leaf sword. Not gonna lie, her concept is fucking amazing. This show throws in every concept you can think of but somehow manages to make it work.I would be remiss if I did not mention my largest gripe with the show, the fact that Ayumu is more or less our magical girl... Maybe I am alone, but I do not find cross-dressing to be a very funny plot point, I just don't. But even then I can sometimes see how it could work in a story if well done. But sadly, I did not find this to be one of those times. You see, Ayumu doesn't like it, first time, first episode, he dislikes transforming into a magical girl with a pink frilly outfit complete with panties and a bow. Hates it may be a more accurate statement. But every time he is forced to do so, he gets an unbelievable amount of shit from the other characters for doing it. Forced to cross dress in pink to save them all, and they insult him for doing so. Sorry, not a scenario I found even remotely amusing or entertaining.Art: 7I can't really say much here, it felt exceedingly average. But since the average these days (for 2011) is still good, it gets a 7. Though I should mention I really liked the character designs. I can't say anything on their artistic value, just a specific aspect I found really nice.Sound: 8I found that the OST really just did it's job. Set the scene, nothing more. But what I absolutely loved was the voice acting. I came into this show long after it aired, long enough that there was in fact an English Dub, and that is what I watched. Stone me, go ahead. Spout your insults and hate for the one who neglected to watch it subbed but had the audacity to write a review. Ignoring the hate though, I loved the English Dub. I thought the voices were perfect and added to the hilarity of the scenes, while also capturing some of the more emotional moments fairly well.Character: 8This was a rather fun cast of characters. They all seemed to fall into archetypes, but were extremely memorable despite that.Ayumu Aikawa- Our zombie protagonist who is a nice enough guy but with that laid back, bored disposition. I rather liked Ayumu, he was fairly similar to other harem leads in that he isn't the most popular, isn't extremely capable physically or intellectually, but still sits in the back right side of the classroom next to a window. He gets a lot of abuse in this show, verbal and physical. Being immortal the characters feel no guilt in stabbing him. Being the nice guy he takes it all with a bit of disbelief but really just goes along with it.Eucliwood Hellscythe- I thought I had seen the quiet character exhibited perfectly in Yuki Nagato. Boy was I wrong. Eucliwood (though everyone calls her Eu) is the character that I consider to be the ultimate moe blob of adorable. She takes the quiet nature to a whole new level by literally not saying a word, but writing everything on little notepads. Though giving off an uncaring persona, she is actually extremely kind hearted. Where I truly applaud the creators is the way Eu had a different voice actress for every episode. Now for a character that doesn't speak it may seem difficult to have a voice actress; luckily our perverted main is here to imagine Eu complimenting him in a suggestive format. It was well done and extremely enjoyable.Haruna- The resident Tsundere Magical Girl who is a self proclaimed genius and makes great eggs. She really is just a fun character with a ton of energy. She doesn't have the best memory and freeloads at Ayumu's home eating more food than anyone else.Seraphim- The busty Vampire Ninja, she is extremely cold towards our main character but gets along with others well enough. My issue with Seraphim is that she is accurately summed up by the word bitch. Obviously there is a bit more to her than that attribute alone, but that forms the crux of her character and it left liking her a very arduous task...My biggest issue with the characters is that they all seem to give Ayumu a bit too much crap. Don't get me wrong, at times it was hilarious to watch them all insult Ayumu. But in my not-so-professional opinion this show needed a character that Ayumu could get along with. In my head this equated to a character that acted in a more playful manner rather than a degrading one. Sexual innuendo or playfully teasing, just someone that alleviated the constant barrage of shit Ayumu received.Enjoyment: 7My enjoyment overall is limited to a 7. When this show was good, it was GREAT, but when it wasn't great I honestly considered it be rather bad. My opinion in this facet is probably rather polarized from the majority, but for every scene I loved I found one I disliked as well. My enjoyment did swing in a positive manner on the whole, but nevertheless I had my issues.Overall: 7This show takes every thought that could pop into a writer's brain and throws it into an oddly coherent plot. Combined with a fun cast and good voice acting, comedy, some action, and even the occasional emotional moment, you get a genuinely good show. This show is definitely good for a laugh. Even if you are like me and dislike main characters who get a ton of shit, I would still recommend this show. If you're on the fence about the show than I would recommend watching the first two episodes as they perfectly exhibit what this show is: A fun 12 episodes that is even complimented by a second season.

Fortunately, it was much better than I thought.Story: 6I was very surprised that this had a plot. It really did. The story focuses on a high school boy, Ayumu, who is both a zombie and a Magiclad Girl (Yeah, I know, kinda weird) and his supernatural friends, Eu, Haruna and Sera who fight against all kind of creatures. This might seem a little mediocre and it is because as the show goes...on, more and more unearthly phenomena occur and strange characters show up. But, like I said, I am glad that the anime followed a decent plot with some unexpected events and it wasn't just a stupid comedy.Art & Sound: 9Both were good. The characters have many details and some distinctive features, the magical creatures are ok and the outdoor scenery is good, so I don't have much to say. My eyes liked what they saw.Character: 6Here, unfortunately, we have some stereotypical characters: Ayumu - the easy-going teenager who cares a lot about his friends and wants to protect them. Eu - the most powerfull character, silent but very smart, full of emotions and very altruistic. Haruna - the funny girl, always smiling who falls in love with Ayumu. Sera - the sensible one, with a strong character who likes being in charge of everything,There is truly nothing special about those characters, none of them stands out. On the other hand, I apperciate the huge character development. Ayumu starts to care about Eu when she leaves and realizes she's very important to him. Eu also realizes that she's not a soulless monster and she has friends who would die for her and Sera abandons her mission to kill Eu because she finally understood that friends are the most important thing in the world.Enjoyment: 7It wasn't a brilliant anime, even far from a good one, but I somehow enjoyed watching it. It was funny indeed (especially Ayumu's transformation into a Magiclad Girl), it was violent indeed (which I liked the most) and it had some heartbreaking moments which really got to my feels. As I said, there were some boring episodes, unrelated to the actual plot but at least they were funny.Overall: 7I rated Kore wa zombie desu ka? 7 because it represented a nice surprise for me. The series exceeded my expectations which is really awesome and if the caracters were a little more original, I would give it an 8.What can I say... If you like fantasy-comedy-harem with some gore and romance anime, you should really watch this. It might be a disappointment for some people but on the contrary, I find this anime better than I thought it would be. on, more and more unearthly phenomena occur and strange characters show up.

Riddled with fanservice, a harem which means no actual romance, and a cast of invincible characters. Our good male lead Ayumu is a zombie, taking an arm or two is but a flesh wound, and our female lead  has enough magic power that the universe is changed at her emotions and words. The action scenes are enjoyable and occur frequently but nothing extraordinary. They aren't afraid to show a bit of blood though!Nevertheless, there is something about the comedy in this set up that makes every episode worth watching. Of course...being undead gives the genre slapstick a new meaning, and by the end of the first episode Ayumu gains the power of Masou Shoujo. Yes that’s right - he is a magical zombie cross dresser wielding a pink chainsaw. If you don't find it funny the first time he transforms well you will definitely get sick of it by the end of the show.Now I did look down on the show earlier for the fanservice. However, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the female cast. Eu is our mute armored necromancer who doesn't get much of an appearance in the show till later because, well, she is mute. I liked her appearances but story wise she made a lot of decisions that didn't make sense.Haruna is the masou shoujo who has lost her powers and is the pain in the ass tsundere that lives in Ayumu's house. The fanservice target, she is the most prominent female character. Another person who can be a break or make on your takeaway from the show.Sera is a vampire, whose story of origin was horrible. Yet, voiced by Youko Hisaka, one of the more fun characters. She has a running gag of how horribly she can verbally abuse the main character, but is also a ninja at the same time. She is never prominent in the story, but makes steady appearances throughout.Yuki, another vampire, acts as the wife or Ayumu, reasons to be left to your imagination, and is the only character that's dere was actually enjoyable.Despite being a strong comedy, it attempts to have a serious plot at times. At these times it fails to be serious, and you are left wondering if they intended to make the plot a joke (in more ways than one). It starts out with how Ayumu wants to get revenge on his murderer, but despite how mysterious it seems like it will be at the start the intensity vanishes until he easily finds them a few episodes in. From there the plot switches to Eu's past mistake and the whole situation is rather ridiculous.If you enjoy a mix of peculiar comedy and have a tolerance for harem settings this could be the show for you. The atmosphere is typically bright except for those random serious moments they throw at the viewer. being undead gives the genre slapstick a new meaning, and by the end of the first episode Ayumu gains the power of Masou Shoujo.

That suspicion has been confirmed. Today\'s review was requested specifically because ""Ive seen Ktulu review some real crappy stuff (I think I saw Baka to Test somewhere), so I thought this would be \'right up his alley\' reviewing-wise."" Yes, that is an actual quote. Is it really that bad? Let\'s take a look and find out.Kore wa zombie desu ka follows a magical girl zombie who lives with the necromancer who brought him back to life, a magical girl...and a vampire ninja. It\'s every bit as stupid as it sounds. There is an over-arching story but it\'s really basic. An enemy shows up, the group has to fight him. You might think that, as stupid as the premise is, it has to get some good humour out of it. Nope. The humour is as weak and imbecilic as the story. Most of it is simply the same joke repeated. Ayumu is a zombie, watch as he gets abused. The series tries to mix comedy and seriousness but it fails at both and the mixing of the two just makes it more pronounced. The last episode is a pointless fan-service episode and the relationship developments are just grody.The characters are the same one-dimensional cliches that pop up in every poorly written harem anime. The clingy jealous girl, the quiet but kind girl, the tsundere girl, and the girl who gets pulled into the situation through an absurd plot contrivance that makes her feel like she has no choice but to pursue the main character and, of course, the completely unremarkable and utterly boring protagonist who can\'t make up his bloody mind. It doesn\'t help that all of the characters are idiots. We\'re told that Haruna is a genius, but she acts like a complete and utter twit so it\'s as much of an informed characteristic as the marksmanship skills of Imperial Stormtroopers.The art is mediocre. It could be better if not for the strange art decisions at some points and the over-reliance on fan-service. Yeah, there\'s a massive amount of fan-service. Since it\'s a harem anime, this should come as no surprise.The voice acting is pretty dull. The only actor who seems to be putting in any effort is Nomizu Iori, the rest of the main cast sound like they\'re bored most of the time. And she exaggerates to an absurd degree. If I wasn\'t familiar with the cast from other series I might suspect that they just made bad casting calls, but I\'ve heard all of the main cast and most of the secondary cast in roles where they gave much better performances These aren\'t incompetent actors, this is incompetent directing. The music is the best part of the series. It\'s actually pretty good. It\'s got a lot of energy and the performances are well done.The yuri factor is a 3/10. Seraphim and Haruna have some moments, and there\'s one moment with Haruna and Eu. But they never go anywhere and the series is quick to dismiss them.My final rating for Kore wa zombie desu ka is a 1.5/10. It\'s not one of the absolute worst anime I\'ve seen, but it comes pretty close. The story and humour are rubbish and the characters are completely unsympathetic with no redeeming qualities. The only thing worthwhile is the music and you don\'t have to watch the mind-numbingly stupid series to hear it. and a vampire ninja. It\'s every bit as stupid as it sounds.

What initially attracted me to the show was that the main character was in fact a zombie and after seeing that it was labeled as a harem story I was interested to see where it would go.Story: 7/10Ok, personally I really enjoyed this show.  However I would say that the story was the show\'s major weak point.  The initial premise of the story is extremely unique and interesting.  Main character and normal high schooler Ayumu Aikawa is murdered by a serial killer, is then brought back to life as a zombie...by a necromancer and now is trying to discover who killed him and why, certainly a somewhat dark and unique idea.  However with the introduction of Masou-Shoujo Haruna, the story takes a turn for the weird and comedic.  After being cut in half by Haruna\'s chainsaw during a battle, Ayumu accidentally absorbs her magic and must now take over her role of fighting demons as a Mahou-Shoujo, complete with transformation sequence and frilly pink dress.  And that basically is how the rest of the show proceeds.  It constantly walks the line between ""wow this is a dark bloody action anime"" and ""boy in a pink dress encounters harem hijinks.""  This results in the pacing of the show being somewhat off and at times I felt as if I was watching two completely different shows.  Most of the time there was no particular reason for why the story progressed the way it did, things would just kind of happen and then the characters would respond.This having all been said though, the comedic aspect of the show was great and almost every episode something would be said or happen that would provoke a laugh out of me and the show does tell a compelling and unique story when it decides to get serious.  Despite also being labeled a harem genre, this is only a minor detail in the events of the main story and the overall feel of the show.Art and Sound: 8.5/10The animation in the show was very good I felt.  The scenery was good, the landscapes realistic, and the character designs were very unique and fresh.  The fight sequences and gore were extremely well done yet equal attention was given when dealing with the more comedic and ridiculous aspects of the show (flying whale monsters for example).  The sound was also excellent, the opening got you hooked and the ending theme was just plain fun and both were very original.  The voice acting was good as well, everyone delivered a great performance and fit their roles to a tee.  Plus Yuu\'s plethora of different voice actresses contributed to a great part of the series\' humor.Character: 9/10The characters were definitely (in my opinion) the best part of the show.  They were modeled off past traditional character types but they were very fleshed out and there was a good amount of character development in the show across the boards.  Ayumu is not your typical average harem lead ( for one he\'s a zombie).  He\'s not overly perverted or boring in any way, he\'s just an average guy forced to deal with ridiculous situations and handles them accordingly, and unlike a normal harem lead he\'s got some redeeming qualities and is more than capable of being a badass when its crunch time.  I thought that all of the characters were hilarious in their own way though.  All of the rest of the characters in the show were mostly there for comic relief and fulfilled their roles excellently.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite its faults, I really liked Kore wa? The whole time I was watching it I was just thinking to myself ""wow I love this show"", even when I noticed plot inconsistencies or when I felt they went over the top with something.  It was hilarious, the characters were crazy, the story was original, and while the romantic and the serious aspects of the show often clashed, I felt both worked in their own right and made the show amazing.Summary: If you are looking for a show with great comedic value, unique characters, or just a different or ridiculous story, then I would highly recommend watching Kore wa Zombie desu ka?.  It was always fun, with its fair share of serious moments and interesting characters.  I highly recommend for fans of harems or offbeat comedies. by a necromancer and now is trying to discover who killed him and why, certainly a somewhat dark and unique idea.

There is a certain amount of ""cliche elements"" in the telling, but what sets Kore wa Zombie desu ka? apart from the crowd and saves it from being a cliche ridden also ran is the way it turns each and every one of those cliches on its ear, pokes a wet willy in it, strips it of its dignity, and then tells it ""It is OK! People still love you even with all your warts!"" In other words, the show has an overriding irreverent tone and...a mocking sense of humor about itself and the various genres from which it harvests its plot fodder. The show is extremely well written and funny, eliciting several ""laugh out loud"" moments per episode on average, but at the same time, it actually approaches tear inducing tenderness when it takes the time to focus on the protagonist and his savior/master/goddess of all that is dandere, Yuu. (I said almost... I don\'t think I have cried yet, though I am a notorious softy... just ask my kids.)The character of Yuu is a thing to behold. Moe in the extreme, she takes dandere to a new height, as she isn\'t just quiet, she doesn\'t talk, with the exception of dream sequences, labeled ""This is fantasy of our weak-hearted protagonist Aikawa Ayumu"", in which she speaks with a high, pleading voice and calls him Onii-chan, complete with mooney eyes, and frequently scantily clad. She communicates by writing notes on a pad, frequently with a tsun edge in the writing, making her, I guess, a tsun-dan-dere character.  The other characters are good as well. The heavily tsundere Haruna, who is living with them until she recovers her Masou Shojo powers from Ayumu, is a bundle of contradictions, as a genius magical girl that can\'t seem to be bothered to remember mundane things like names or where she was supposed to be buying tofu for her magical girl teacher. The third member of the harem is Sera, the Vampire-Ninja who seeks Yuu\'s aid and stays with them when she is refused, hoping to earn Yuu\'s help, all the while referring to Ayumu as various names similar to ""worthless pile of $%!#"". There are also Ayumu\'s friends at school, who he doesn\'t want to discover the truth about his living/unliving situation, as being the male living with a harem of magical/dangerous women is not something he thinks his high school buddies can handle.All this would rate a high, but not stellar score if it weren\'t for one thing that the show does: surprise! Just when I think that I have a handle on the show, it throws a curve. Just when I think I know where the story is headed, it changes course. And just when I think I have things figured out, it turns another corner and reveals that most of what you have seen is not really the way things are. When that is combined with the consistently funny dialog and over the top humor, it makes for an enjoyable ride!Art: 7 of 10The main failing in Kore wa Zombie desu ka? is the art, at least in my opinion. There are frequently times when it seems the backgrounds are neglected, and the character renditions sometimes have shortcuts. Much of the combat animation is choppy and awkward looking, though I will grant that some of this is intentional due to the nature of the zombie protagonist. His body moves in awkward ways at times. The character designs, with the exception of  Yuu, are also a bit generic, with Sera being the only human character that I have not mistaken for someone else at least briefly at some point in the show. The men are particularly generic, with the glasses of the \'best friend\' character distinguishing him from the protagonist. Luckily there are not many shots of men other than Ayumu. It is possible that this is mostly a personal problem and others see more distinction between the designs, but I particularly find it hard to distinguish Haruna from some of the other girls, either at his school or the ""friend"" in the hospital that shows up in the third episode. There are some parts that are beautifully done, but others that fall short. The magical transformation sequences are quite striking, in their visual effect and the humor value as well! Another aspect that bothers some, but not me, is the level of fan service and gore. I consider most of the fan service to be parody, and it never becomes prurient or of an overtly sexual nature. The gore is also frequently used for comic effect, and the show is, after all, about a zombie! One must anticipate a certain amount of blood and gore!I\'m not saying that there aren\'t some bits of excellence. Where the animators take the time to make the art shine, it is great. I just feel there are too many points at which they let it slide along at average.Music/Sound Effects: 8 of 10The opening music is very good and the incidental music is frequently spot on. The end music is a catchy little tune, but also a bit annoying, as is the super deformed animation used during it.Voice Acting: 8 of 10The main voice actors are well done, with Haruna and Sera having a nice blend of acerbic tone with the occasional softer side. The male lead is well done but nothing really that special either. The best friend character\'s voice I find annoying, but I think you are supposed to. The Megalo tend to all sound alike to me. The ""friend in the hospital"" is one of the strongest vocal performances, as that character goes through some pretty impressive changes and variations across the episodes the is featured in. The absolute winner in terms of voice acting is the sickly sweet voice of Yuu in Ayumu\'s weak-hearted fantasy life! She sounds absolutely endearing and devoted, as is appropriate for a fantasy of that sort.Overall Enjoyment: 10 of 10I am loving this show! I watch it first of the Monday shows that come out on Cruncyroll and will re-watch episodes most weeks. The combination of broad comedy, fun action sequences, macabre zombie mayhem, and strong plotting with a touch of sentimentality that sparkles with joy when it bubbles up to the surface make it a fun, fast paced, and thoroughly enjoyable ride! Oh, and Yuu is muy, muy dandere moe!!! But that isn\'t really why I like it. Honest... a mocking sense of humor about itself and the various genres from which it harvests its plot fodder. The show is extremely well written and funny, eliciting several ""laugh out loud"" moments per episode on average, but at the same time, it actually approaches tear inducing tenderness when it takes the time to focus on the protagonist and his savior/master/goddess of all that is dandere, Yuu.

It is possible that this is mostly a personal problem and others see more distinction between the designs, but I particularly find it hard to distinguish Haruna from some of the other girls, either at his school or the ""friend"" in the hospital that shows up in the third episode. There are some parts that are beautifully done, but others that fall short. The magical transformation sequences are quite striking, in their visual effect and the humor value as well! Another aspect that bothers some, but not me, is the level of fan service and gore. I consider most of the fan service to be parody, and it never becomes prurient or of an overtly sexual nature. The gore is also frequently used for comic effect, and the show is, after all, about a zombie! One must anticipate a certain amount of blood and gore!I\'m not saying that there aren\'t some bits of excellence. Where the animators take the time to make the art shine, it is great. I just feel there are too many points at which they let it slide along at average.Music/Sound Effects: 8 of 10The opening music is very good and the incidental music is frequently spot on. The end music is a catchy little tune, but also a bit annoying, as is the super deformed animation used during it.Voice Acting: 8 of 10The main voice actors are well done, with Haruna and Sera having a nice blend of acerbic tone with the occasional softer side. The male lead is well done but nothing really that special either. The best friend character\'s voice I find annoying, but I think you are supposed to. The Megalo tend to all sound alike to me. The ""friend in the hospital"" is one of the strongest vocal performances, as that character goes through some pretty impressive changes and variations across the episodes the is featured in. The absolute winner in terms of voice acting is the sickly sweet voice of Yuu in Ayumu\'s weak-hearted fantasy life! She sounds absolutely endearing and devoted, as is appropriate for a fantasy of that sort.Overall Enjoyment: 10 of 10I am loving this show! I watch it first of the Monday shows that come out on Cruncyroll and will re-watch episodes most weeks. The combination of broad comedy, fun action sequences, macabre zombie mayhem, and strong plotting with a touch of sentimentality that sparkles with joy when it bubbles up to the surface make it a fun, fast paced, and thoroughly enjoyable ride! Oh, and Yuu is muy, muy dandere moe!!! But that isn\'t really why I like it. Honest...', 'Ok, so call me EL Diablo, amigos, for giving this anime a rating of all 6\'s, but, HEY! That\'s how I looked at it, anyway there are a couple of more episode to go before the ""PIECE DE RESISTANCE"" of this anime and move to the new season, so, why all the 6\'s?Ist, the story:Even it \'s genre are: Action, ecchi and magic, I think that comedy and mystery should be inculded since this anime did played with our minds as to who really killed the muchaho(male lead) and how his realtionship doing with the tres chicas (Yu, Sera and Haruna) if there is...a love connection with any of them before ep 7. There is also a lot of laughs involve especially when the muchacho (lead male) is a reluctant cross dressing Mahou shoujo and other funny secnes which the 3 chicas gives the muchacho a lot of cabeza del dolor (headache). I never thought that there is still a main villan involved aside from Kyoko whom we now know is the serial killer, but you know I think it is only FAIR ( number 6) enough that we wait just a few more episode and see how things will turn up.2nd, the art:I\'d say for a anime with an action genre, I think that the art itself as to how the characters were drawn should have been given a much more symmetric body figure. Then again since there is comedy in it, so a 6 will do.3rd, the sound:Here, I\'m referring to the soundtrack, particularly the opening theme......What can I say, soy mucho gusto. By the way, I really hate the closing theme. So 6 it is.4th, characters:Aikawa Ayumu- A loner at frist, until he get\'s skewed to dead and resurrected, though he\'s greatful for the unfortunated thing that happen to him - co\'z he ain\'t lonely anymore, he\'s unable to enjoy summer co\'z the intense sun shine willl dried him out. He kinda function as a male bitch for the 3 chicas and it is unclear if any of them has any feelings for him. He always fantasize about Yu talking in a cutsy manner and he also did the same with Sera (only once). Now he\'s linked to Yuki a vampire ninja from another tribe, question is, does he like her?Eucliwood ""Yu"" Hellscythe - she was found by Aikawa sitting near a conveniences store, as just like that, they started chatting - Yu writing down her words rather that saying it and then the next moment she\'s reviving Aikawa. At fist I thought that she\'s the villian (how wrong am I). It is not know wheather she has feeling for Aikawa since she declared him his servant. Among the characters she\'s probably the most mysterious of all to the viewers, co\'z as the episode progresses we see a lot more that what we think she is. Who wouldn\'t know that she doesn\'t just revivie dead people, she also has powers for fighting and she did mentioned that her magical powers would still fuction even when she\'s dead,  does that mean she\'ll never die?Haruna \'Masou Shoujo"" - It\'s very clear as to why she stayed with the muchacho, she want\'s her powers back from the muchacho and as unlucky as it get\'s, both of them don\'t know how to do it, what puzzles me is why would the author of this anime decide to let Haruna maintain some of her powers, while her true form is stuck with the muchacho, also why did she since she already saw her sensie in ep 7, why didn\'t she took the opportunity to ask for help in getting her true form back from Aikawa? By the way, her near naked scene really adds to the encchiness of this anime.Seraphim \'Sera\'- is a vampire ninja sent to request Yu\'s help to come to their village, though she\'s the muchacho\'s servant (in word only) she doesn\'t seems to be like one co\'z as we watch the anime she\'s always engage Aikawa in petty bikering and cusses the poor muchacho everytime, I like her boobs.Yoshida Yuki - she only came around in ep 7 and her weapons are pretty wierd, her tribe is probably the only ones who uses Tonkastu soup as a weapon of choice - or maybe they used something else. She\'s cute, but I prefer either Haruna or Sera to be the muchacho\'s love interest. Like, that will happen.Ariel - who we now know is haruna\'s Dai Sensie, I wonder if she\'s the main villian?And last but not lease, Kyoko ""The serial killer""- I guess she\'s the ""Piece de resistance."" Or is she?I do have some questions about the character, but, who am I talking to anyway? Well a number 6 rating will do for this part.5th and 6th, Enjoyment and Overall:I guess this anime if fair enough to be enjoyed by early teens as young as 13 -15, since the ecchiness is rather quite mild and the blood scene were artistically done, Strongly it is not for children as young as 10 and below. So I give both a fair 6  co\'z the anime itself is not that bad but not too good either.PS: I have not read the manga, so pls bear with me, amigos. a love connection with any of them before ep 7.

It reminded me of so many different shows such as ""My Bride\'s A Mermaid"", ""B Gata H Kei"", and ""Heaven\'s Lost Property"". This is not to say this anime doesn\'t have a charm of it\'s own. I went into this show with not knowing what I was getting into really because I had heard nothing about it. Not gonna lie, the 1st episode was a bit over the top for me at first, but you get adjusted to it shortly after....I believe the reason I liked this show so much was because of the expectations I had when I began to watch it. The thing is, I had none! So I was thoroughly surprised when certain scenes occurred. This anime is to never to be taken seriously, if you take it seriously you lose the whole point of the show, which is to entertain you rather than to tell some complex story with plot twists up the ass. Now let\'s get into the sections of the show and what I liked and disliked. (I haven\'t watched the OVAs and the 2nd season at the time I\'m writing this review)Story: 8The show\'s story is a extremely weird but I LOVED IT. It\'s all about a boy who\'s name is Ayumu who was tragically killed by a serial killer and is brought back to ""life"" by a Necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe (Eu). Eu is the most powerful magical being in the world, but having all that power comes at a cost. After this encounter with Eu, Ayumu\'s life will never be the same. He then becomes friends with a Magical Garment Girl and a Vampire Ninja. Story sounds pretty crazy right? It only gets crazier as the story progresses. It was pretty unique and different in my eyes, so I enjoyed a lot.Art:8I\'m not very good when it comes to determining how Art is, compared to other anime and what not. But I enjoyed the art style for what it was. The colors really gave the show a nice feeling to it because they would always match depending on the scenario. Never seen any flaws with it in my eyes.Sound: 7To be completely honest, I don\'t remember hearing anything really memorable from the show. Which is a good and a bad thing. Its a good thing because it shows I found nothing wrong with the sound itself, but it didn\'t stand out much. So it was ok, the only song I remember was that blasted Ending. It was AMAZING, I almost always watched it whenever it came around. I honestly got giddy when it came to the end of episode so I could hear it again. The animation that goes with the ending also added to my enjoyment to it.Characters: 8The characters were both the one of the greatest things about the show and one of the downfalls of it as well. If you\'re not closely watching the show and just enjoying it for what it is, you\'ll find the 95% of the the characters are likeable and funny in their own ways. The situations they get themselves in are pretty hilarious as well. But when I took a better look at them, most of them are just one dimensional, there are a few exceptions mind you, but again MOST OF THEM are. Characters won\'t be much of a problem if you don\'t this anime seriously though. Most of them are all zany, even if they don\'t show it at first.Enjoyment: 10This is easily one of the funniest anime I\'ve seen in a while. From the parodying of clichés, to the overall humor this anime provides, it\'s just a riot. Some people may find some of the rehashed jokes some characters use to be annoying but, I didn\'t mind them one bit. Another thing people may have a problem with is when this show is trying to be serious. This anime has the tendency to have a serious moment, have some humor and then a serious moment again. This may cause viewers to have a disconnect with serious moments. BUT, as I said before, this show is just for enjoyment. So if you don\'t take it seriously, you\'ll actually find some of the serious moments to be funny in itself. Some moments just didn\'t make sense even when I replayed over several times, but it didn\'t take away from my enjoymentOverall: 8.5-9This show was something I didn\'t imagine I\'d like very much, contrary to this, halfway through the 1st episode is where I just fell in love with it. As I\'ve stated several times in this review, if you take this show seriously you\'re not going to enjoy it much. If you turn your brain off for the 12 episodes this show has, you\'ll most likely enjoy it very much. Even when you turn your brain off, you may notice some things in the show that don\'t seem right, but you\'ll get over it no time.P.S. In my opinion, I loved when this show showcased the different parodies of popular things that happen in other genres of anime and just of clichés in general. I would be bursting out with laughter XDP.P.S. I CAN\'T WAIT TO WATCH THE OVAS AND SEASON TWO!

Those who watched this and took everything literal can not enjoy the beauty of this anime.Now to my review. I thoroughly like that this anime is just one solid joke after another. Nothing in this anime is serious and should not be taken serious. It makes fun of all aspects anime out there, and does a good job at it. It builds up great characters that are lovable and does a decent job at putting in background story considering the anime is more of...a feel good funny show.Personally I think if you want a good laugh this is the anime for you a feel good funny show.Personally I think if you want a good laugh this is the anime for you', ""Out of all the anime I watched this season I would probably say Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? is one of the stronger series.  The reason I decided to give the series a try is because the picture caught my attention when I was selecting anime to watch.  However I'm glad that I decided to watch this seriesThe first half of the series doesn't really follow much of a story, instead we are given some gut busting comedy to pass the time.  The comedy did actually get me to laugh a lot and I would've had no problem if the series kept...going like this, but in the second half of the series a plot started to unfold. After the plot was revealed, the amount of jokes in each episode dropped to advance the more serious plot.  There was still some comedy during the second half of the series and the jokes were still funny when they came around though.The plot itself wasn't actually bad. Sometimes the plot did feel rushed because they tried to fit it in the end, and there were some plot holes.  I think it would've been  better if they either made the plot a bit longer to let it develop more or just taken it out entirely.  It's not the best plot out there but it is interesting nonetheless and it is certainly better than some of the other plots in series that aired this season. Also putting together a good plot with gut busting comedy isn't exactly the easiest thing to do, so I think the series did a respectable job with the plotThe art is actually very good, I like the character designs and the backgrounds were okay too.  The animation during the opening was awesome and you could really tell the mood by the art. I have no complaints here.The sound was alright, I enjoyed listening to the opening and ending and the voice actors did a solid job with their character. However nothing really attached to me here.When I first saw the opening and saw the different characters that were going to be in this series I thought to myself, this seems to be a strange combination of characters. However the characters were done really well.  Our main protagonist, Ayumu is a zombie is probably one of the better protagonists I've seen mainly because he's not weak like a lot of normal Harem leads. That already is a plus and he also seems know how to act in tight situations.  We also have a very adorable female lead, Eucliwood (Eu for short) who undergoes the most development and also doesn't talk, instead she writes on a notepad. She doesn't show her emotions much but as the series goes on she begins to open up to the main protagonist.The other characters are also very likable. They don't seem to undergo much development but that's just really asking for too much from a series like this.  We have a tsundere Mahou Shoujo and 2 other Vampire Ninjas.  They do have traits of harem stereotypes but they also have qualities that makes each one of them unique.Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? is really an enjoyable series, I couldn't count the amount of times that I laughed.  Add in very lovable characters and we have ourselves a very entertaining series. If you want a good laugh I would recommend watching thisOverall Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was one of the better series of the season and although the quality of it did dip slightly toward the end I still found the series to be very good. I give it a 8/10.Thanks for Reading going like this, but in the second half of the series a plot started to unfold.

As he tries to make the best of his un-dead life, he encounters a mashou shoujo named Haruna and accidentally takes her magic powers, being forced to become a mashou shoujo in the process. With Eucliwood, Haruna, and a vampire ninja named Seraphim living with him, Ayumu helps battle demons known as Megalos while trying to figure out the mystery behind his own death.Story & Characters (5/10)After watching enough gut-busting man-eating zombie movies you start thinking that you\'ve seen everything that is until you saw Kore...wa Zombie Desu ka? (aka KoreZom). This hybrid show takes those horror stuffs into a new leap with its flashiness like a magical girl chainsawing monsters or some guy trapped in your every harem jest.Plain-looking high school student Aikawa Ayumu is a normal teenager living a boring, laid-back life with no excitement except one thing: as he\'s ready to tell you, he\'s a zombie. But how come a zombie doesn\'t feed on human fleshes and goes to school? That\'s not a long story. His life dramatically changed after being butchered by a serial killer. Luckily, a silver-haired lady necromancer by the name of Eucliwood ""Eu"" Hellscythe brought him back to life and Ayumu has entered the world of the occult since. Meanwhile, super-powered beasts wearing traditional seifuku called Megalo appeared wrecking havoc in town. Armed with a high magical (pink) chainsaw and a Cardcaptor outfit, Ayumu battles these monsters while trying to get to the bottom of things.No mistake about it, KoreZom is utterly insane and comical. We\'ve all seen the scene where a character selflessly jumps in front of a vehicle to save an animal or person countless times in anime, but in this case the potential hero, right before being struck, turns his head towards the screen and says: ""Oh, yeah, I\'m a zombie."" Wow, that\'s one heck of a start and it sets a variety you couldn\'t expect in a show with the title ""zombie."" Wait, maybe you could.For most part, KoreZom is purely for fun. Breath-taking humor being thrown rubbed away the disturbing gore and intense psychopath. There\'s chaos with zombies, vampires and the undead but the show always seems on the verge of blowing apart under the pressure of its own insanity. Characters are introduced when convenient or seemingly for the hell of it, to be killed or excised on a whim perhaps lighten the series up a little.But they don\'t, being a typical harem trap, the female cast have convenient moe look yet their kinds don\'t attract much. Eu is an expressionless bishoujo with a hidden past, Seraphim is a busty hot chick with sword and Tomonori (naturally) is the protagonist\'s wife. For a ""harem leader"" achertype, Ayumu can pretty stand up for himself as he can dismember without hesitant, not exactly the ""loser"" formula. Crazy, but brilliant.Art (7/10)Studio Deen, an animation studio who is famous for those bloody gore such as Higurashi and Umineko, here produces a bright and colorful effort which is hardly a paragon of action animation but loads itself up so effectively on the cute factor. Its designs are uninteresting, mainly focus on the moe standard with is trademark hairstyle, facial expression and eyes (although Eu\'s Gothic-moe look is a joke unto itself). Ayumu\'s design is even worse, you can immediately tell that he\'s yet again another dating heroes. Still, the utterly absurd parody of a magical girl transformation scene, complete with the sexy gasp, involving Ayumu is a hoot and the ensuing panty shots of him show that even the series\' fairly frequent fan-service isn\'t immune to parody, either. Stick with this guy a little, and you\'ll see tons of crazy stuffs around him including his pervy delusion and ""man-service.""Ah right, because the title has the word zombie, there are expectations of violence. And speaking of violence, what is better than those moments full of all the decapitation, amputation and disemboweling that even the most juvenile of gore-hounds could desire.Sound (7/10)Casting features some familiar faces, giving KoreZom a bit of familiarity shared by its genre. Majima Junji again voices a colorless nice guy, while others such as Haruna or Seraphim\'s manage to give the show pushes with their cutie tsundere tones.The synthesizer-heavy musical score mixes some cheesy themes in with cutesy themes, an occasional mildly dramatic one, and themes which sound like they were directly borrowed from an ero game for an overall effect that is energetic but unimpressive. The same goes for OP ""Ma?Ka?Se?Te Tonight"" sung by Eu\'s seiyuu, a somewhat cute and spiritual the show has, and ED which composed with a highly enthusiastic male-female dual with the lead characters performing some new kind of caramelldansen in the background.Overall (6/10)Accept KoreZom for what it is – a simple cutesy fan-service show – and it can be quite entertaining. However, those who finished the show would find it quite disappointing. The plot is divided into two parts with little relation to each other: the first part is about the search for the mystery behind the murders while the second revolves Eu\'s past. But what more of an utter disappointment is how the producers turn the last episode into a mindless silly gag created for fan-service. There\'s still the OVA (or perhaps a sequel) to talk about, but I highly doubt they will continue the left-opened story. Just wait to see what other tricks they have up their sleeves. You will find lots of laughter here, depth probably not, but really, what can you expect in a series that has a guy wearing women\'s clothing as demon fighter?Good:+ An entertaining, breath-taking humor take on demon-fighting cliches.+ Ayumu is kind of manly for his achertype.Bad:+ Ridiculous villains.+ Last episode is a cheap trick. wa Zombie Desu ka?

This hybrid show takes those horror stuffs into a new leap with its flashiness like a magical girl chainsawing monsters or some guy trapped in your every harem jest.Plain-looking high school student Aikawa Ayumu is a normal teenager living a boring, laid-back life with no excitement except one thing: as he\'s ready to tell you, he\'s a zombie. But how come a zombie doesn\'t feed on human fleshes and goes to school? That\'s not a long story. His life dramatically changed after being butchered by a serial killer. Luckily, a silver-haired lady necromancer by the name of Eucliwood ""Eu"" Hellscythe brought him back to life and Ayumu has entered the world of the occult since. Meanwhile, super-powered beasts wearing traditional seifuku called Megalo appeared wrecking havoc in town. Armed with a high magical (pink) chainsaw and a Cardcaptor outfit, Ayumu battles these monsters while trying to get to the bottom of things.No mistake about it, KoreZom is utterly insane and comical. We\'ve all seen the scene where a character selflessly jumps in front of a vehicle to save an animal or person countless times in anime, but in this case the potential hero, right before being struck, turns his head towards the screen and says: ""Oh, yeah, I\'m a zombie."" Wow, that\'s one heck of a start and it sets a variety you couldn\'t expect in a show with the title ""zombie."" Wait, maybe you could.For most part, KoreZom is purely for fun. Breath-taking humor being thrown rubbed away the disturbing gore and intense psychopath. There\'s chaos with zombies, vampires and the undead but the show always seems on the verge of blowing apart under the pressure of its own insanity. Characters are introduced when convenient or seemingly for the hell of it, to be killed or excised on a whim perhaps lighten the series up a little.But they don\'t, being a typical harem trap, the female cast have convenient moe look yet their kinds don\'t attract much. Eu is an expressionless bishoujo with a hidden past, Seraphim is a busty hot chick with sword and Tomonori (naturally) is the protagonist\'s wife. For a ""harem leader"" achertype, Ayumu can pretty stand up for himself as he can dismember without hesitant, not exactly the ""loser"" formula. Crazy, but brilliant.Art (7/10)Studio Deen, an animation studio who is famous for those bloody gore such as Higurashi and Umineko, here produces a bright and colorful effort which is hardly a paragon of action animation but loads itself up so effectively on the cute factor. Its designs are uninteresting, mainly focus on the moe standard with is trademark hairstyle, facial expression and eyes (although Eu\'s Gothic-moe look is a joke unto itself). Ayumu\'s design is even worse, you can immediately tell that he\'s yet again another dating heroes. Still, the utterly absurd parody of a magical girl transformation scene, complete with the sexy gasp, involving Ayumu is a hoot and the ensuing panty shots of him show that even the series\' fairly frequent fan-service isn\'t immune to parody, either. Stick with this guy a little, and you\'ll see tons of crazy stuffs around him including his pervy delusion and ""man-service.""Ah right, because the title has the word zombie, there are expectations of violence. And speaking of violence, what is better than those moments full of all the decapitation, amputation and disemboweling that even the most juvenile of gore-hounds could desire.Sound (7/10)Casting features some familiar faces, giving KoreZom a bit of familiarity shared by its genre. Majima Junji again voices a colorless nice guy, while others such as Haruna or Seraphim\'s manage to give the show pushes with their cutie tsundere tones.The synthesizer-heavy musical score mixes some cheesy themes in with cutesy themes, an occasional mildly dramatic one, and themes which sound like they were directly borrowed from an ero game for an overall effect that is energetic but unimpressive. The same goes for OP ""Ma?Ka?Se?Te Tonight"" sung by Eu\'s seiyuu, a somewhat cute and spiritual the show has, and ED which composed with a highly enthusiastic male-female dual with the lead characters performing some new kind of caramelldansen in the background.Overall (6/10)Accept KoreZom for what it is – a simple cutesy fan-service show – and it can be quite entertaining. However, those who finished the show would find it quite disappointing. The plot is divided into two parts with little relation to each other: the first part is about the search for the mystery behind the murders while the second revolves Eu\'s past. But what more of an utter disappointment is how the producers turn the last episode into a mindless silly gag created for fan-service. There\'s still the OVA (or perhaps a sequel) to talk about, but I highly doubt they will continue the left-opened story. Just wait to see what other tricks they have up their sleeves. You will find lots of laughter here, depth probably not, but really, what can you expect in a series that has a guy wearing women\'s clothing as demon fighter?Good:+ An entertaining, breath-taking humor take on demon-fighting cliches.+ Ayumu is kind of manly for his achertype.Bad:+ Ridiculous villains.+ Last episode is a cheap trick.', 'ZOMBIES!!! One almost immediately thinks of flesh-eating, mindless, corrupted humans when he hears this word. It also brings to mind gore and blood spilling! Today, the ""zombie"" genre is very widespread, so it no wonder that Japan has already opened its doors to it.There have already been other ""zombie"" anime that have been made, namely HOTD and the like. But unlike its other companions, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka is... unique!Kore wa Zombie is a hilarious anime that will most likely leave you gasping for air in every episode. It\'s a fun, worry-free, and not-so-serious anime. But as a ""zombie"" anime, it is...guaranteed to have lots of blood and gore to satisfy its fans.  But don\'t worry. The ""blood-gore"" level isn\'t that bad. So people with weak constitutions can watch it without worry. Although what you should be afraid of is the moments where one might lack oxygen due to laughing too much. It even has a touch of harem to boot!The art is pretty good. But it\'s not that note-worthy since almost all 2011-2012 anime use the same type of technique. It\'s all pretty balanced. But I\'m pretty sure you won\'t be pausing to look at the artwork, since its pretty fair.The OP and ED both sound pretty nice. And they have great Seiyuus to boot too. Once again, all of them totally fit their characters... Well all except maybe Hellscythe-dono. I\'ve noticed that her voice changes in several episodes, and it\'s bothered me a bit, but it\'s nothing serious.All in all, Kore wa Zombie is definitely a must watch! Guaranteed to satisfy all your hilarity needs. Warning: when asthmatic, please make sure you have your asthma attack spray ready, just in case of emergencies.

I had always wanted to watch it since I loved its opening theme ""Ma.Ka.Se.Te.Tonite"" by Iori Nomizu and after having dedicated my day to it, I\'m here reviewing it with mixed feelings.This anime gets the ""fan_service"" tag for being all about lewd portrayals, panty-shots, casual nudity and bodacious characters. It also has its good share of cartoonish-gore. Being a zombie, Ayumu is subjected to his body parts being dismembered, more than...a dozen times and it doesn\'t end with him. Ayumu is also forced to cross-dress against his liking which was just funny. Sera\'s degrading dialogues are cold, unforgiving and hilarious to listen to. Does anything make sense? Not in the very least. The anime succeeds at being an over-the-top fusion of all these elements and actually got me laughing for half of its tenure. The other half was rather grueling.The anime tries to take on a more serious note on several occasions, all of which seemed uninteresting. Some of the later battle scenes had me yawning, even fast forwarding, through it. They kinda had a whole episode centered on Fan-service which was not just cliched but also wasn\'t worth my time. There\'s nothing particularly outstanding about it but its good for an anime between two anime.Okay... Fan-service, check. Tsundere, check. Moe, check. Harem, check. Zombies, Magicians and Necromancers, check. Ninjas, check. Vampires, check. Ninja Vampires, check. Chainsaws, Katanas and Scythes, check. Human abuse, check check.

Have you ever wondered if you can find out the same with magical garment boys?Adapted from a light novel series of the same name by Shinichi Kimura, Is This a Zombie? was directed by Takaomi Kanasaki and produced by Studio Deen. Character...designs, original and anime, were provided by Kobuichi and Shinobu Tagashira respectively. We follow one Ayumu Aikawa who, after finding a random sword sticking out of his gut before keeling over, was reanimated by the mysterious, beautiful, and seemingly mute necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe. The both of them now living under the same roof as servant and master, our undead male protagonist tries to live his school life the best he can without anyone normal finding out. Trouble finds him, however, juggling the eccentric company of ninja vampires and magical garment girls wielding leaf blades and chainsaws on top of the caveats that being a zombie in his universe entails, and suddenly, he's also living with a vampire ninja and a magical garment girl. And, for whatever reason, he magically becomes a magical garment boy. Yeah, boy, though unfortunately, the costume's not tailored to his specific gender.Lots and lots of random, over-the-top hilarity ensues, and it's precisely the random and over-the-top qualities that make the comedy work well in this series. The show's no stranger to exploiting anime tropes, most notably the -dere series, but the show is so audaciously gung-ho about each of them that their comedic value stays fairly constant. In addition to these running gag anchors are just a stream of ridiculously absurd developments, puns, gags, one after another, keeping the funny consistently fresh for a good portion of the show.The characterization deserves a mention. Granted, it's not going to win any accolades for it, but for what it is, a random, over-the-top harem comedy, I appreciate that the show were able to characterize these girls as individuals outside of their designated stereotypes, and that they show a significant amount competence independent of the male protagonist. Aikawa himself also comes off as a decent character, with humorous quirks and relatable worries. You know, ones that don't constantly scream pervert all the time and end up with him getting constantly decked. Getting beaten down's a reality for him, but it's not something the staff overly abuses for constant laughs. Outside fairly harmless daydreams about Eucliwood, or Eu, he doesn't harbor any obsessive lust for the women that surround him; in fact, he genuinely respects, cares, and tries his damndest to shield them from grief.Outside comedy, at least for the more episodic first half, there's also some fairly decent drama, the majority of it centering around Eu and how her necromantic abilities, powerful enough to raise the dead, and possibly more powerful still, are related to her seeming inability to speak. Outside her exotic headdress and armor plate, outside her quiet, emotionless exterior, is a girl who's lonely and, because of circumstances, has been alone until now.I mentioned first half, because the show starts to come off from its seams by the second once there's a transition to something more plot-centric. Simply put, the writers behind this series do not know how to write a decent plot, especially one meant to be dramatic. Here random, over-the-top, and this show's brand of comedic are not welcome. Everything supposedly linear comes out fragmented, everything supposedly serious comes out unfulfilling, and everything supposedly silly comes out contrived. For instance, we got a life-threatening situation over here involving someone being crushed to death. Is it really a smart time to be stupid by making the perpetrator a giant plushie? We got a world-ending scenario involving the creation of a portal to hell on top of kidnapping and coersion. Is it the best time to animate a completely nonsensical scene of walking in to everyone nonchalantly eating pasta? The potential those few precious moments of drama early to make something delightful is wasted on the show's later lack of focus and tact.Utilizing the heavy elements of the electric guitar and drum set, OP “Ma-Ka-Se-Te Tonight,” or “Leave-It-To-Me Tonight” by Iori Nomizu is strong enough rock to get into for those who are fans of that genre, coupled with the action-packed introductions of the main cast in a rather bleak, apocalyptic setting, but overall, in my opinion, it wouldn't be the number I'd use to characterize this show, the action is more a supplementary element than a major focus, however well-animated it may be at times. I'd also have to question, limited my understanding of the Japanese language may be, why opening seconds grammatically misuse some of the romaji for the show's title. ED “Kizuite Zombie-sama, Watashi wa Classmate desu,” or “Notice me Mr. Zombie, I am your Classmate,” fits the bill better.  Essentially a duet by Rie Yamaguchi, who also seiyuus one of the characters, and Manzo, it has this goofy sense charm that playfully shifts tempo, style, and pitch at sections to fit with the visual whimsy of the male protagonist dying while in heat. That's a double entendre.A generally funny show that doesn't go too overboard on fan service, as far as harem comedies go, with a surprising amount of depth, the second half soured what would otherwise have been a mainly positive experience.  If the staff could get a better handle at working the plot, or just making future content more episodic like before, then I'd be a happy zombie.Speaking of which, it occurred to me that there were less messy ways for sniffing out zombies than using chainsaws.

Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?  is an action harem at it\'s core with tons of comedic moments to fill the time. I won\'t lie, what drew me to this anime was the title picture of a magical girl...with a chainsaw. Getting superficial here but who doesn\'t appreciate a chainsaw toting magical girl(and later magical girl boy, well, whatever the hell he\'s suppose...to be).On to the first section, the story. I won\'t be going into many details since I can\'t do it in way without spoiling it. At  the first third or half of the story nothing much is going on other than character introductions. This is fine because there\'s a lot of great comedy to be had and it\'s fun to see the characters interact with one another.

The backgrounds were pleasant to look, particularly the graveyard and the city as a whole. If I recall there wasn\'t a lot of stuff going in those backgrounds but still nice designs.

I won\'t be going into many details since I can\'t do it in way without spoiling it. At  the first third or half of the story nothing much is going on other than character introductions.

I was expecting something mind-numbing and slapstick and while there is that, it actually made it worth watching each episode.The core characters make up for a very delightful cast, all over there own development as fhte show goes on. It was nice to see the changes they acquired while learning from their experiences that it doesn't have to compromise who they are or where they're from.I'm usually pretty retentive about visuals to match the show and whatever the subject is, and this one does well.This is just a lot of fun without any sort of effort required. Just sit...back, watch and be entertained. back, watch and be entertained."", 'What could be more fun than a series that contains magical girls, zombies, vampires, ninjas, necromancers, and evil whales in school uniforms? Well, a lot of things actually. Kore wa Zombie desu ka? starts off promising and funny, but starts to take itself too seriously toward the end and focus on the rather unexciting and uninspired plot than what really made it good. When you watch the first episode, you know you are stepping into strange territory that only gets stranger as the series progresses, but it maintains a certain sense of seriousness that seems unneeded in an anime that’s main character is a zombie...who can transform into a magical girl boy.The plot is fairly simplistic. Ayumu dies and is resurrected by a cute necromancer girl, Yuu. The guy runs into a tiny, feisty magical girl named Haruna. He steals her powers accidentally and gains the ability to transform into a magical girl boy complete with pink striped panties. He also meets a vampire ninja. Together, the four search for the person who killed Ayumu. It gets somewhat complicated from there with a magical girl school and rival vampire ninja clans and another zombie like Ayumu. This is all well and good, but the problem with the plot is not in the fact that it is trying too hard to be complicated and adult, but more so, as I stated, in the fact it takes itself so seriously most of the time. Which is fine, but when you start a series with lots of comedy and very little story, don’t try and throw something at me that is attempting to be complicated.Another problem can be seen in the rushed ending. The main bad guy of the series is another zombie who was resurrected by Yuu. His intentions are never clear, other than the fact he wants to die. Why he wants to destroy the world in the process is lost on me and how he has magical powers is never actually explained. Anyway, the end of the series comes with episode eleven. Episode twelve is what should have been an OVA as it is the obligatory pool episode with enough fan service to make Rosario Vampire blush. Not only is the episode stupid and pointless, it is also a waste of time. With a second season on the way, there had to be more story that could have been thrown in, or at least something stupid, but progresses the plot or character interactions (like something between Ayumu and Tomonori?).The animation is alright. Characters look good, backgrounds look good, but it can sometimes look a little on the sloppy side, especially during fight scenes. If I can give the animators an award, it would have to be for jiggle physics. One particular fight halfway through the series was so amazingly captivating in its use of hypnotic giant boobies bouncing around a graveyard like two happy, skipping children. With every movement the breasts flung themselves in the direction the girl is going, threatening to tip her over. A chiropractor had to have been needed after that battle.Sound, sound, sound. Whatever shall we do without you? The opening is pretty good, not exactly amazing but better than the generic pop that permeates the openings of a majority of anime. The ending on the other hand is plain. Music during the show ranges from six notes on a piano (which I’ve complained about before) to what could be village music in a Final Fantasy game. The voices are all good and the sound effects are good as well.The character department, as always, is the part where I completely destroy an anime. But one of the things that makes Kore wa Zombie so great is that it has a variety of good characters to enjoy the company of. A few aren’t so great, but a few are pretty fun.Let’s start with main character Ayumu. He’s as generic as every sentence I write about main characters in anime. It’s getting boring saying that the main character isn’t all that exciting minus his one problem or complex (in this case, being a zombie), but it has to be done pretty much every time I review something. He’s just a generic guy with a harem. Nothing sets him apart from the rest of the high school kids in strange situations.Eucliwood Hellscythe is an interesting character. As she doesn’t speak and doesn’t really show emotions, there’s a lot that you know is inside of her that you want to learn more about. What she writes and the few emotions she displays do make you feel sympathetic toward her. She’s not the kind of character you will fall in love with, but she does have a certain appeal that can mostly be found in the mystery surrounding her, as well as her feelings later in the series.Haruna is the magical girl of the anime and has an allergy to clothing. She’s got a lot of nude and scantily clad scenes throughout, but she is also not a particularly bad character. She’s got the tiny complex, she’s got the attitude, but there’s also something likeable about her. And it’s not the nudity. Don’t say that. It’s more so her personality. I know you can trade her for a magical girl version of many anime characters, but I like the females with an attitude who don’t take crap from anyone. She’s strong and likeable because of how tough and in your face she can get. She doesn’t act like it when just screwing around with her friends, but she truly cares for them and would do anything to protect them. She’s also a magical girl with a chainsaw. A FRICKIN’ CHAINSAW. And she’s also the funniest of all the characters.I did not like Seraphim on the other hand because the moment we are introduced to her, I knew she was what my friends and I call “The Boob Character”. Big tits=big laughs and lots of guys paying attention. Not only is she a total slut, she’s also a vampire ninja. This ridiculousness would have been funny if it hadn’t turned into some sort of political intrigue about conservative vampire ninjaism vs. radical vampire ninjaism. On top of that, she just didn’t have a lot of character. She was helpful as a fighter, but as a person she was just an ass, plain and simple, and totally unlikeable.Tomonori is the final character I’ll dedicate a whole paragraph to. She was one of my favorite characters for whatever reason (maybe it was the fact I didn’t get to see her enough to learn to hate her). She was damn cute, and on top of that her relationship with Ayumu is my favorite of the series. As the plot progresses, you can see her change and start to really like Ayumu. And on top of that, she was the second funniest character.King of Night, the bad guy, as stated before was lame and pretty cardboard. The other bad guy (who I won’t name) wasn’t all that exciting either. Dai-Sensei is a character I want to know more about. Otherwise, everyone else is not worth mentioning.Kore wa Zombie is a fun little ride. It has good action, good characters, and some pretty funny comedy. It starts to lack that comedy as it progresses, but the story isn’t all that bad, just nothing worth remembering. There are some idiotic moments (the last episode), some cool moments (the whale), but overall it’s a lot of meh. It just never seems to find its stride. With a second season on the way though, we can hope that it will provide better bad guys and figure out whether it wants to be a funny plot-based story or a serious plot-based story. who can transform into a magical girl boy.The plot is fairly simplistic.

You get a Zombie, a Necromancer, a magic girl and a vampire ninja living under the same roof.The story is simple, take your typical ecchi anime.  Now turn the main male lead into a zombie.  Next turn the girls hes living with into fantasy archetypes and make them all abuse and take...advantage of him.  Oh and mix in some of the best parodied troups of anime.Art & Sound are top notch.  The opening is great, but the ending is just plain golden.Characters are perfect.  Every one of them is a classic troup anime personality given a twist that brings the show into its own.The reason why this show gets a 10 is because of the sheer amount of jaw dropping laughter.  Everything is over the top, and hilarious.  If there is any downfall in this series it that the creators are just trying to hard.

', ""This anime was great! But saly I had to give everything a nine! Why? Well at the start I did not like it. I watched 3 episodes at the start and decided I would rather watch something else more interesting. But soon after I watched a few episodes of other stuff I was beginning to complete a lot of things a part from Kore wa Zombie desu ka which stood at 3 episodes watched. I decided I had to pick up the pace and start liking this anime! So what I did was told myself watch 2 episodes and if I still wasn't interested I...was to put it on hold or just drop it but after the fourth episode I thought I ned to stop watching this! but remembered my note of watching 2 episodes. I shook my head and watch episode 5! Which just changed my entire view of Kore wa Zombie desu ka. Everything seemed different characters power became more interesting their lives past lives futures became more interesting. More or less I decided to watch to episode nine. By that time it was still interesting but it was  in the morning so I went to sleep and completed it the next day. My opinion of this anime is give it a shot like I did. Then recommend it to people or tell people to stay away depending on your opinion. If you have seen this anime before give yourself a pat on the back you managed to see this anime out of all the animes in the world! And if your overall rating was nine like me... then add me and we can discuss more animes! was to put it on hold or just drop it but after the fourth episode I thought I ned to stop watching this! but remembered my note of watching 2 episodes.

He is now tasked with defeating Megalos, demon-type enemies bent on destruction. However, he has a few problems, mostly the girls in his life who will not leave him alone! I giggled throught the anime and it made me smile.I thought Kore wa (shortened!) was a nice little anime at first, kitchy with its comedy and fanservice and the way the girls (haruna, Eu, and Sera) always picked...on him and more often than not (haruna) beating him up. However about halfway through the story changed into something darker, deeper and more compelling. Sure there were the comedy/fanservice moments but i found myself tearing up at some parts and really getting into the characters, most noteably Eu (Lady Deathsythe) her story just about teared me to bits.As far as characters go Ayumu is pretty average, he is the typical high school guy, leering at girls, slacking off. He really does have a soft spot though and he really shines near the end during Eu's crisis. He had his redeeming moments, much like the others. The one i did not truely like was Sera (Seraphim) she is a ninja and thus, cold. She does show a softer side but hearing her call Ayumu 'repugnant' or a 'maggot' multiple times Every. Single. Episode. Got annoying to say the least. Same with Haruna, i had to hear 'dumb Ayumu' more than i would have liked.  There are other characters thrown in as well, but they do not have such a defining story as the others.All in all it is a charming anime, with 12 episodes int he first 'season' it is short and worth the 6 hours to watch it if you like yoru light animes. While there are some dark themes and quite a bit of blood, it is not so deep that it will stick with you indefinatly but its a nice, easy, vacation from the more complex animes out there. on him and more often than not (haruna) beating him up.

Now onto the characters, all characters have there spot in the show and none feel rushed or forced to be put in the show, though I do have issue and this might only be me but...I personally did not like they way they showed the main character.

However if you can deal with that and can easily laugh at most things, then this should be a good watch for you.Story: 6As said before this anime doesn't really have a strong story for the most part. They try to put a little story element in there, which I was able to enjoy, but by no means is this show made to be watched due to the story.Art: 7I feel this is more of a...subjective subject to judge. It's better than previous anime of course, but most anime around this series release should be. The art was nothing to be praised about either but it was good. It didn't hurt my eyes and the fanservice was a good plus.Character: 10Characters for me is one of the strongest points. You have a zombie, necromancer, vampire ninja, and magiclad girl as the main cast. Each character was characterized really well. Though the main character is more of your stereotypical anime protagonist the things that he actually goes through really makes his character more funnier than most. Necromancer is your silent heroine, Magiclad girl is your very loud, cocky, and honestly somewhat annoying heroine, and the vampire ninja is your sadist matured heroine who pretty much verbally abuses our main protaganist.Enjoyment: 10Again a very subjective and rate but I rather greatly enjoyed this show. It was one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. I can honestly find myself re watching this show whenever I wanted to. The comedy and the characters really having me coming back to the show.

Her words are so powerful, so she's afraid to talk.There are some pretty cool battles in this anime too.This was...a great anime, but I had to doc one point of for the manservice, but if you like Harem anime with a twist, watch this! a great anime, but I had to doc one point of for the manservice, but if you like Harem anime with a twist, watch this!"", 'I never heard of a zombie that wanted to become a ""penguin"".""Is This a Zombie?"" or ""Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?"" is a rear and interesting anime at most. I can honestly say I\'ve never seen anything like it before. Its funny and serious but too comedic at times that suck the seriousness right of it. I cant say this a is a perfect anime but it was good. If you need a anime that to pass the time this is it.I can\'t see myself getting to invested in the story. ""Is This a Zombie?"" kept reminding me of the anime ""Rosario + Vampire"" so...if you were a fan of that you might like this. This did make me laugh at times but sometimes I felt like they were trying to hard to make ""you"" laugh and at times the jokes were just too flat.This happens about twice during the hole show. Somethings that kept bugging me, throughout the hole thing ""Ayumu"" the main character who is a zombie kept referring himself as a zombie. Whenever there was a life and death situation he would say something like ""let me do this, remember i\'m a zombie"" or something stupid like that... It did make me laugh when ""Seraphim"" the ""Vampire Ninja"" (whatever that means) would always refer to ""Ayumu""  as a ""maget"".The story does a good job in introducing each character and where they come from. For the most part, the story jumps around until the last 5 episodes not counting episode 12. Which felt like the were done with everything and need one more episode to fill up space but for the most part it was good. There is a lot of thing that just got me confused and made me scratch my head at, like one was the hole violin and music thing to destroy the incoming monster this isn\'t a spoiler but it is weird.But sometimes its better to just accept these flaws and just go with it. Well that\'s what I did and after I was done with the hole thing I started asking my self these weird question like why does a zombie die in the sun? But to be honest even if I got an answer I would still question it. And the amazing thing about it is that its extremely enjoyable. This anime is just for the LOL\'s and nothing else. The story is kinda touching but nothing too serious. It wont make you sad and cry but makes you curious makes you wonder whats going to happen next. I would have like to seen the anime to take themselves a bit more serious but its good the way it is. So if your bored and have nothing to do, do yourself a favor and watch it. Oh ya and did I mention that the main character who\'s a zombie that cant die and will live forever is also a tranny with magic powers. ^_^Don\'t forget to hit that ""Helpful button"" if you found this helpful in any way so others can find this review.

It definitely got me hooked and I went through the 12 episodes pretty fast.The comedy was one of the main things that grabbed my attention, since it doesn\'t take much too process. It\'s perverted to say the least (panty shots, boobs, girl and guy butts, you name it) which caught me off guard sometimes, but just added to the hilarity. There\'s also some sarcasm, breaking of the fourth wall, and just flat...out immaturity. It made me laugh out loud a lot.One thing some might have a problem with is the lack of of a consistent plot. Each episode bounces from one thing to the next, occasionally bringing ideas from previous ones with it. Often things are resolved quickly and then something new would pop up to replace it. A few parts of the story also carried action along with it, which surprisingly had some gore in it. The gore-factor though was kind of hard to take in while teenage boy Ayumu, the main protagonist, is dressed as a magical garment girl wielding a bright pink chainsaw.But the not very strong story wasn\'t an issue for me- I was too busy enjoying the characters! I really liked all of them, my personal favorite being Eu, the necromancer who uses a pen and paper to communicate. (Or as Haruna would say, ""neck-wear mancer"") I thought the dynamic of the characters worked together very well, especially in the show\'s comedic sense. You definitely can see a lot of the stereotypical anime tropes in cast, but all of the characters\' quirks help soften the edges of the easy to spot tropes.Overall I really liked Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?, and would recommend to it anyone looking for something short, funny and easy to enjoy. out immaturity.

Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? was a blast to watch!

Development between characters is sometimes is sometimes a little ""Meh"" standard harem drama and such.

Its story and characters are light hearted and easy to understand but also able to make to laugh and brighten your day. I highly recommend people to watch this if your looking for a funny but also interesting anime. ', 'I\'ve approached this anime while looking for something trashy and relaxing, for which I could turn off my higher brain functions and just enjoy the dumb humour and action - and I\'ve got exactly that, but not necessarily in the quality I hoped for. If I wanted to describe this anime shortly, I\'d say it\'s Highschool DxD, but with less ecchi and way more WEIRD. It\'s a show that never treats itself seriously and has fun with the harem formula, but to the point it barely manages to even pretend it tries to tell a coherent story, or build a setting and characters that are...more than just walking gags.There are, to be fair, many fun ideas in it and jokes that land well. The strange, ""mute"" main heroine adds quite a lot of mystery and comedic opportunities to the whole setup. The parody of magical girl tropes is great. The protagonist is perverted in an amusing way and the internal dynamic of the harem is quite fun, thanks to the very different attitudes of the girls and a clear emphasis on Eucliwood being the primary one. All of this, however, does not develop into any kind of coherent narrative, and none of the characters truly shine during the first season. It was fun while it lasted, but left me feeling pretty much nothing when it was over and with very few memorable moments to think about - if something ever stood out, it was mostly through sheer randomness and absurdity.The production quality of the show is very decent and I honestly think it provides a fine way to burn a few hours when you don\'t want to challenge yourself in any way. It just never rises above being a fun distraction - be sure to adjust your expectations appropriately. more than just walking gags.There are, to be fair, many fun ideas in it and jokes that land well.

The anime did spend quite a bit of time in the first half cramming in its share of ecchi however, it did mature a bit near the second half of the series.  There are a few things left unfinished in the end but overall, things went much better than I thought they would judging by the first 5 or 6 episodes.

There is a good reason why she doesn\'t talk much or show too much emotion, she\'s not just a Yuki/Tabitha/Rei clone.  She\'s probably the character that is most easy to sympathize with especially in the 11th and 12th episodes.Seraphim: The ninja Vampire...  yes you read that right.  She hates the male lead... a lot.  Responsible for the other 1% of ecchi/yuri in the series.  There is a legit reason for this strangely enough which is revealed along with Yuki\'s introduction.Dai Sensie: Haruna\'s teacher Ariel.  Dragged Haruna down to Earth for tofu apparently.

Even the way they show off a zombie is not typical; nothing like ‘High School of the Dead’ or ‘Walking Dead’. The zombies in this show… or should I just say Zombie as there is really only one… doesn’t eat brains, go on a rampage, or try to kill everyone around him. How is that a good show? Well… like I...said, the show isn’t normal and hard to explain if I don’t go into detail.Our first character is Ayumu Aikawa, or if you would like to call him typical high school boy stereotype number one then that would be fine too. The first time we even meet him, he basically spells himself out, then says he’s a zombie like it doesn’t mean anything at all. And it’s true, if you took out the Zombie aspect to him, he would be pretty normal. I just don’t actually understand the part that happens after he says he’s a Zombie. What was the point of having his clothing fly off after he was hit by a truck? Anyway, the reason why he is a zombie is actually a rather sad story. He was killed by a serial killer after trying to protect someone. Then he was brought back to life by a young Necromancer and now stays by her side wanting to one day catch the person who killed him. Like I said, he has a rather tragic back story and yet we don’t get much of that. Sure one or two times he would stop and think about it, but other then that, he spends his life just learning to cope with being a Zombie rather comically. Even more comically when he absorbs a magical girl’s powers and is able to transform but I will get to that in a moment.The next person I’m going to bring up would be Haruna, one of the many girls who ends up living with Ayumu, hence the harem part of this show. She is a magical girl from a different… dimension?... who is learning how to be a magical girl though… school? The only real reason why she is actually in Tokyo was to get… Tofu… for her… teacher? Alright, so for her character, there is a lot I have to actually speculate (or ask why the heck it’s even in the show to begin with) as they don’t really do a very good time explaining it. Her power ends up being absorbed by Ayumu and for the whole show, she does nothing but complain about it, learn how the world works, and try to get her powers back. I don’t understand why they put her into this show except for the fact that she ends up giving Ayumu her powers. Actually, the scene they show when she loses her powers reminds me a lot of ‘Bleach’ when Rukia gives Ichigo her powers in a way. The difference is that Rukia was actually a likeable character in that anime and Haruna just gets on my nerves.The reason why I didn’t bring up Eucliwood Hellscythe second is the fact that she really doesn’t have much of a presence in the first half of the show. She is one of my favorite characters and the only one that I can actually have feelings for as when they get into her back story, it is really sad and actually explains a lot more about her then the other characters. Hellscythe never speaks (although Ayumu always pictures her with this really cutesy voice) and will only write things down on a paper to express herself. All through the show, there are very few times that she will actually show any emotions at all, normally she just sits at the table in front of the TV and drinks her tea. I guess this is why I like her so much. When she does show even the slightest emotion, you can really feel that what is going on is important.The last person I’m actually going to put energy into talking about would be Seraphim. By the name, you can know exactly what she is, right? Well no… she isn’t an angel, she’s a Vampire Ninja. Yes… you heard me right, a Vampire Ninja. Don’t look at me like that, I didn’t make that up! I can only wonder just exactly what was going on with how they picked what she was, like they pulled it out of a hat or something. Anyway, her signature outfit to wear is a yellow spaghetti-strapped top showing off her midriff and dark blue jeans... (um… So… that’s what a ninja wears in this universe it seems…) She is also fights with a Katana and is always yelling ‘Swallow Cut’ (‘Swallow Return Strike’ in the English Dub… which if you really look it up, its not what she says it is) as she is fighting… (Again, seriously. What the hell makes her an actual ninja?) Shall I also mention that she is the one with the largest breasts and they seem to like pushing them in your face as a joke? I know Japan’s idea of what is funny is different then America, but still, I can’t get away from sighing at this.So let’s go into the main aspect of this show, the fact that we have a male zombie turning into a Magical Girl. It is an awesome idea in concept, but with how this was executed, I am not all that sure. While I liked watching the show, I feel more like I watched the show to know more of Hellscythe’s back story rather then for any of the other characters. Ayumu just seems bland as a main character, Haruna is really annoying, and Seraphim… I have no idea exactly what she is. I feel a bit sad that Hellscythe isn’t the actual main character but then I do remember how she doesn’t talk and know how hard it would be to write a story around someone like that. Maybe it is the mystery behind her that makes me want to watch the whole show.The animation is actually rather good. Studio Deen did a rather beautiful job for the most part. The only problem with the style they are using is the fact that it has been used countless other times. They aren’t doing anything ground breaking with the designs of the characters, the action scenes… its just very typical. I give them props for not just throwing things together with squiggles and luckily every character keeps their proportions for most of the show which after reviewing so many other shows, the proportion thing is a bit of a blessing. The colors are very bright and happy even during some of the darker times that it basically keeps reminding me this is a comedy show. Sadly, that doesn’t go well for the times that we are supposed to get emotional.The English voice acting is actually pretty good to me, making it pretty enjoyable. The voices of the characters do seem to fit well with the personality and look of the characters making me believe that when I don’t like a person, it’s not just because of the voice. Ayumu is voiced by Austin Tindle and he has a little bit of a monotone going for him. Austin did a couple voices like Alzack Connell in ‘Fairy Tail’ and Ken Kaneki in ‘Tokyo Ghoul’. What makes me rather sad is that Haruna is voiced by a voice actress that I really like. Her name is Jad Saxton and she voiced the character Masako Hara in ‘Ghost Hunt’. She was really good in that one but here, it feels like she is sort of trying to force the energy into the character (I do give her props though that I did not first recognize her voice as that from ‘Ghost Hunt’). Like I said, this is one of the reasons that I believe it’s only the characters I don’t like and not the actual voices for those characters. It did surprise me though that many of the main characters were voiced by little known voice actors rather then large names. Most of the big names are set for either side characters or antagonists. Funimation has been known to put the bigger named voice actors like Vic and Todd Haberkorn into main character roles that it’s nice to have characters that don’t sound like someone from another series. The music isn’t really something to write about as it’s the same sort of stuff you would normally get for a comedy driven show.Overall, I would not call this the best show ever, but it does have some strange and interesting parody changes. I give them props for there creative twist to a genre that was pretty much set in stone but the way they executed it was a little forced. From the many different characters that pop up, the situations they put themselves into, and the fact that there are so many genres smashed into this one show… it just feels like they were trying to hard. It’s one to try and watch, but I wouldn’t blame someone for not really getting into it. said, the show isn’t normal and hard to explain if I don’t go into detail.Our first character is Ayumu Aikawa, or if you would like to call him typical high school boy stereotype number one then that would be fine too.

Maybe it is the mystery behind her that makes me want to watch the whole show.The animation is actually rather good. Studio Deen did a rather beautiful job for the most part. The only problem with the style they are using is the fact that it has been used countless other times. They aren’t doing anything ground breaking with the designs of the characters, the action scenes… its just very typical. I give them props for not just throwing things together with squiggles and luckily every character keeps their proportions for most of the show which after reviewing so many other shows, the proportion thing is a bit of a blessing. The colors are very bright and happy even during some of the darker times that it basically keeps reminding me this is a comedy show. Sadly, that doesn’t go well for the times that we are supposed to get emotional.The English voice acting is actually pretty good to me, making it pretty enjoyable. The voices of the characters do seem to fit well with the personality and look of the characters making me believe that when I don’t like a person, it’s not just because of the voice. Ayumu is voiced by Austin Tindle and he has a little bit of a monotone going for him. Austin did a couple voices like Alzack Connell in ‘Fairy Tail’ and Ken Kaneki in ‘Tokyo Ghoul’. What makes me rather sad is that Haruna is voiced by a voice actress that I really like. Her name is Jad Saxton and she voiced the character Masako Hara in ‘Ghost Hunt’. She was really good in that one but here, it feels like she is sort of trying to force the energy into the character (I do give her props though that I did not first recognize her voice as that from ‘Ghost Hunt’). Like I said, this is one of the reasons that I believe it’s only the characters I don’t like and not the actual voices for those characters. It did surprise me though that many of the main characters were voiced by little known voice actors rather then large names. Most of the big names are set for either side characters or antagonists. Funimation has been known to put the bigger named voice actors like Vic and Todd Haberkorn into main character roles that it’s nice to have characters that don’t sound like someone from another series. The music isn’t really something to write about as it’s the same sort of stuff you would normally get for a comedy driven show.Overall, I would not call this the best show ever, but it does have some strange and interesting parody changes. I give them props for there creative twist to a genre that was pretty much set in stone but the way they executed it was a little forced. From the many different characters that pop up, the situations they put themselves into, and the fact that there are so many genres smashed into this one show… it just feels like they were trying to hard. It’s one to try and watch, but I wouldn’t blame someone for not really getting into it.', ""Watching the apathetic zombie Ayumu shrivel in the sun and get sawed in half by a chainsaw wielding magical girl is pretty entertaining.  It was that unforgettable transformation sequence that hooked me though.  Something about watching Ayumu find himself dressed from head to toe in pink frills and lace and fighting a giant lobster just won me over.  Zombie showed, with that first episode, some creative and decent story writing that I just wasn't expecting from this type of show.  There is good banter between the characters and even to my surprise decent drama mixed in here and there.Unfortunately, the quality...of the writing didn't last. Around halfway through, the show started a descent into the realm of cliched and disappointing.   The comedy that originally made the series shine either devolved into silly jokes or just vanished entirely.  The main villain that eventually gets introduced just isn't appealing.  The fan service gradually becomes more gratuitous and the feel of the show falls into mediocrity.  It's really a shame, when Zombie is at its best there is obviously potential for something unique to grow, but the writing just falls flat in the end.Also episode 12... I honestly don't know what to think about that one.  In fact, for all intents and purposes the show basically ends after episode 11.  The last episode is a random pool episode that turns into a who can be the biggest idol competition.  The only reason I can come up with for it existing is just to go all out with fanservice.  There are plenty of swimsuits and skimpy outfits for any who are interested to ogle at.I can't honestly recommend Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? for most people.  I enjoyed it for what it was and it is only 12 episodes.  Some of which are actually good.  So there isn't any harm in watching even if I think it could have been much better.

Episode 2 made me interested in finishing Kore wa Zombie desu ka, almost every episode has a funny scene but as long the story goes by, they get more serious, and that is what made me like this anime. This anime is good but it could better, it only lacks ONE THING, and its only a little of a ""Romance"" I know some watchers wanted some ""Romance"" in this anime. Well after all I still think that this anime would go better without that ONE THING ', ""Zombie? Crossdressing Zombie? Count me in!

The show is a crazy mishmash of genres, character tropes and various powers and supernatural beings that come together to create an extremely energetic and fast paced show.Ayumu Aikawa is the central character of the show, a normal Japanese high school student who just happens to be a zombie. After being killed by a roaming serial killer and subsequently revived by the necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe (Yuu), he is now a walking dead, with enhanced strength and invulnerability. While searching in a graveyard for...a clue to the identity of his killer, Ayumu encounters Haruna, a “masou shoujo”, or magical girl, who inadvertently transfers her powers to him while attempting to heal him. Ayumu is now both a zombie and a magical girl, granting him magical powers, the use of Mystletainn, Haruna’s pink chainsaw (of course) and a full magical girl costume, frilly adornments, garters, stockings and all.As the series progresses, many more characters join the cast, including Seraphim (Sera) a vampire ninja who wishes to become Eucliwood’s student and servant and Tomonori, a vampire ninja from a different faction who Ayumu accidentally marries after the two kiss. Ayumu and his harem fight a number of different monsters, called Megalo, including a giant demon bear, a giant lobster wearing a school uniform and a giant flying whale. Later on in the series, Ayumu also encounters his killer, as well as the king of the night, another zombie previously revived by Yuu, who serves as the main villain of the series.Kore wa zombie desu ka? is a high-octane show, with most of the story progression and comedy being fuelled by the crazy and surreal situations Aikawa is put into. The premise doesn’t change too much, the characters and the comedy style in the first episode here still apply, the fight scenes are still of a very high quality and the characters are still extremely likeable. While the show continues to surprise with the surreal elements, throwing them into the mix at a very rapid pace, the actual plot of the show is never too deep and the story doesn’t progress too quickly either. The show attempts to show a love connection between Aikawa and Yuu, with occasional love interests in Haruna and Tomonori, but they come across as hackneyed and stale, never going further than the standard harem tropes and superficial, immature love stories portrayed in countless series before it.The focus of the series is without a doubt the surrealist elements coupled with the action that is featured throughout. Kore wa Zombie desu ka? is a comedy show and it definitely succeeds there. The characters are voiced very well, especially Aikawa, who continues to show shock and disbelief at the random monsters he is forced to battle with and the ridiculous scenarios he is forced into. The art style and animation, while not among the best this season, are more than acceptable, with the monsters and the main cast being extremely detailed and animated very fluidly, especially in the action sequences. Aikawa’s design is very basic, but this is most likely to contrast the detailed designs of the other characters and to show how he is still a normal student forced into a ridiculous situation.I’d have to say though, that where the series falls short is the forced story and attempt to provide depth to the show. It might sound weird, but I honestly think that the show would be a lot better if the love story and any other attempts at emotional content were taken out. It might sound weird for me to spite any form of depth in a show, but it seems like it would stand better as a pure comedy, focusing on the surreal elements and the action sequences rather than the relationship between Aikawa and Yuu. Kore wa Zombie desu ka? works best as a simple comedy/harem/action series, I really do think the other elements get in the way. Character relationships would obviously still remain, but in the form of playing against each other in comedic situations and working together to defeat enemies, rather than empty and dull pseudo-romantic speeches.In conclusion, Kore wa zombie desu ka? is a very enjoyable show. While the show wasn’t too imaginative in terms of plot, the characters, concept and design do make up for it. The show doesn’t really do much more than merge a number of different genres together (Magical girl series, Ninja series, Vampire series), but the result is still very enjoyable. While I wouldn’t strongly recommend it, especially over the other incredible shows that aired in the Winter 2011 anime season, it is still a very well made series, and is still worth a watch. a clue to the identity of his killer, Ayumu encounters Haruna, a “masou shoujo”, or magical girl, who inadvertently transfers her powers to him while attempting to heal him.

I thought the plot had a lot of potential but lots of areas fell short for me. The biggest issue I have is anime is it lacks back-story on quite a few of the characters. It only gives minimal explanations to why some of the characters abruptly enter the story, and others leave much in the...same fashion. It didn't seem to explain much of anything to satisfaction. That being said it is only a 12 episode series, and I feel like the majority of 12 episode series run into this problem. It just ended up feeling like half a story to me, I have not read the light novels so I'm not sure if the story was condensed or changed to fit in a shorter time.Another problem is the comedy aspect. This anime seems to run the line between trying to take itself seriously and outright ridiculous. I didn't approach this anime looking for a series story, nor did I think i'd find one, but I felt some of the quirky comedy aspects kind of weakened and cheapened the more serious sections and should have been executed differently.That seems like a whole lot of bad, but there is also some good. The characters personalities were very captivating and it was easy to make connections with them.As for the animation and sound I felt they were both up to par, in fact I really enjoyed the animation style.

The guy becoming a magical girl was funny, and the excessive fanservice was even forgiveable. The characters were pretty stereotypical harem tropes, though, and it both devolved into a harem anime and dropped in overall quality about halfway through. Of course the plot was nonsense, but what really pissed me off is that even with all its ridiculousness, it tried to take itself seriously.If you're going to make a series with a magical girl zombie boy and a vampire ninja as main characters, here's a tip: don't try to take yourself...seriously. It makes it stop being funny, but it sure doesn't make it moving or cool. Some plot developments seriously come out of nowhere, are never explained, and are obviously meant to seem cool or moving, but really just come across as annoying and wannabe edgy.Don't waste your time on this one. seriously.

All in all, worth a watch. second season. All in all, worth a watch."", ""TLDR:This show had some real potential but too much torture p0rn and too much cringe. If they had focused on the real comedy, the fight's, the side characters, and the romance this could've been god tier. As a result I say it's a 5. if you're willing to go through the shitty first season, for a mediocre second then it's worth a watch. Otherwise stay away. I recommend you watch kona suba for a real comedy, as for this anime, at the very least watch the funny moments on youtube.I have seen both seasons, as such i'm reviewing it as a package.Story: Forgettable...I just finished...it and i can barely remember the plot points. The plot is just there to get the characters from A to B. Which is fine, it's a comedy.Characters: Most of the main cast are unlikable. The MC is funny and cool, but the 3 girls he lives with are awful. Eucliwood is okay, Haruna can be cute and funny at times, but is usually really annoying and obnoxious, and Seraphim is just a bitch...she so snobby and condescending it's not even funny. (More on them later) The side characters really make the show for me, but get very little screen time. Aikawa's best friend is super funny, yuki is a really great person, Kirara is interesting, and Kyoko is just awesome. But they get barely any time.Comedy: Here is my biggest problem with this anime, over 80% of the jokes (especially in Season 1) are pretty much the MC getting hurt or humiliated to the point where honestly i'd call it torture p0rn. The MC is like deadpool, as he can regenerate from pretty much anything. Seraphim, and Haruna pretty much use this as an excuse to mercilessly beat him every episode. You really start to feel bad for the MC for taking these beatings on the daily...Whether it's getting pikes shoved up his anus (Not exaggerating) getting his eyes stabbed (Not exaggerating) Getting his teeth kicked in ETC... Even though it's his house, for some reason he puts up with it. If that's what you find funny then to each their own but that stuff is really dumb to me. What makes this anime funny are the interactions with the side characters. This show could have been funnier if they ditched all the torture p0rn and made more of the real comedy this anime has to offer.Art:This one is hard because there's times where this show looks average, but times where it looks almost movie quality. But it never looks bad.Sound:The voice actors are great and did what they could with the scripts they were given. Music doesn't stand out. Sound effects are decent.Conclusion:(Same as TLDR) This show had some real potential but too much torture p0rn and too much cringe. If they had focused on the real comedy, the fight's, the side characters, and the romance this could've been god tier. As a result I say it's a 5. if you're willing to go through the shitty first season, for a mediocre second then it's worth a watch. Otherwise stay away. I recommend you watch kona suba for a real comedy, as for this anime, at the very least watch the funny moments on youtube. it and i can barely remember the plot points. The plot is just there to get the characters from A to B. Which is fine, it's a comedy.Characters: Most of the main cast are unlikable. The MC is funny and cool, but the 3 girls he lives with are awful. Eucliwood is okay, Haruna can be cute and funny at times, but is usually really annoying and obnoxious, and Seraphim is just a bitch...she so snobby and condescending it's not even funny. (More on them later) The side characters really make the show for me, but get very little screen time. Aikawa's best friend is super funny, yuki is a really great person, Kirara is interesting, and Kyoko is just awesome. But they get barely any time.Comedy: Here is my biggest problem with this anime, over 80% of the jokes (especially in Season 1) are pretty much the MC getting hurt or humiliated to the point where honestly i'd call it torture p0rn. The MC is like deadpool, as he can regenerate from pretty much anything. Seraphim, and Haruna pretty much use this as an excuse to mercilessly beat him every episode. You really start to feel bad for the MC for taking these beatings on the daily...Whether it's getting pikes shoved up his anus (Not exaggerating) getting his eyes stabbed (Not exaggerating) Getting his teeth kicked in ETC... Even though it's his house, for some reason he puts up with it. If that's what you find funny then to each their own but that stuff is really dumb to me. What makes this anime funny are the interactions with the side characters. This show could have been funnier if they ditched all the torture p0rn and made more of the real comedy this anime has to offer.Art:This one is hard because there's times where this show looks average, but times where it looks almost movie quality.

Laughable, and yet it could make you gasp in disgust a few times. The zombie thing is kinda played out, but what this anime did was just reverse the traditional zombie and make it into a comedic stunt with another played out theme- Magical Girls... or so Magical Girl harem.The story gets 7- It was funny, contained some mystery at the beginning and roughly around the end. The plot was decent and it did leave room for seriousness.The art-7, it was filled with pretty pretty girls! If anything the anime did well with its artwork on the females....The fight and death scenes were good and a lot of blood. The defeat of the monsters were sparkly and really good-looking.The sound-a 6: The only time you hear music is the last episode- which is hilarious and yet beautiful. The background sounds were spot on with the gore, the weapon effects, and the ick sounds of parts being put back together.Characters a 7: Multiple characters, funny, added well to the plot, and the silver-haired heroine is soooo cute! You'll just want to hear her voice- and Haruna- is like a hyped time bomb. She's all over the place. Sera- is a bit mean and plays off another well-known and kinda cliche anime theme of ninjas and vampires. Makes you feel sorry for the hero of the story.Enjoyment and Overall- good. I would rewatch if I have the time, and it's a good pick-me-up if you just need a laugh or see pretty/cutie girls who oddly enough like to go around without clothes.

They go on living their normal lives( i think normal isn\'t the right word) and fight megalos,a anti masou shoujo creature. in the middle he fights with the serial killer and later in the series at the end he encounters a fellow zombie who was revived by the necromancer who has a wish of death! then they fight for the necromancer! he defeats him and after that they lived happily ever after!or so it seems! thats the sum of the story. but this anime is far from it!the art of this story is pretty good! this a isn\'t exactly a action type anime but mostly focuses on comedy! i can assure you that this animes comedy is great! there are a little bit of romance no more like few touching scenes which are very beautiful and may bring tears! and last but least echhiness and the male character gets smacked for reason or maybe misfortune all the time which is nothing but hilarious.this anime has a beautiful background music in the touching scenes and in the comedy scenes!The main male character of this anime is Aikawa Ayumu! He is a highschool boy whose parents lived abroad and sents him weird stuff that he doesn\'t know!by the way ayumu is a zombie and masou shoujo and a disgusting piece of shit!

He is willed to protect Eu and wants to have peaceful life with no worries in the world!(that i think never happens to him)Euclliwood hellscythe is necromancer who revived Ayumu!she also the strongest masou shoujo. She is so powerful that her words can kill anyone. so she wears gauntlets and writes her speeches rather than speaking. She is kind hearted and likes to drink to tea.Haruna is self proclaimed genius masou shoujo who lost her powers to Ayumu.

She likes Tsubamegaeshi secret sword technique, she is skilled in Tsubamegaeshi secret sword technique and her hobby is Tsubamegaeshi secret sword technique. by the her cooking is dangerous than a nuclear weapon.Maelstrom(real name Yoshida Tonomori) is also a vampire ninja.Unlike Seraphim she has a nice personality.because of a accident kiss with Ayumu she becomes his wife.( according to her clan rule) she tries her very best to cook for Ayumu and she is a clumsy character and her sense of decoration is weird! her name is always mistaken and her favorite speech is ""Don\'t call me Tomonori""there are also few characters like Oritto,Ayumu\'s pervert otaku friend, Dai sensei, teacher of haruna\'s and Sarasvati, a high ranking vampire ninja.this anime has a variety of a unique character and they really fits the spot.This anime mainly focuses on comedy genre with little bit of action,romance and thriller.In my opinion this anime is great! so i really recommend it!!!! of them!! and one of them suddenly becomes his wife because of his accident kissing! a lonely boy suddenly lives with three girls, oh that makes me jealous!!!!!! but i think in this case i am glad that i ain\'t in his shoes.

This isn't some story focused anime that many shows strive for but a show about characters that make you laughI would recommend this to someone who has had a fair share of rom coms just so they don't get overwhelmed by the crazy jokes that can pop up-Well that is about it, not going to complicate this review because this isn't some article or professional review slot that people on here seem to think it is, just hope you enjoy the show "", ""I'm sorry to anyone who likes this show, this review of is this a Zombie? is certainly not directed to fans of the show, but Is this a Zombie might just be the worst anime I've ever watched in quite a while. But this is just my opinion, and I hope anyone who likes the show does not take my opinion on this anime too seriously.First of all, I think this anime actually had a good premise at the beginning. I mean, after the silly first episode where we are given the background for our main hero, a zombie cross dressing magical boy, we are...than introduced to a Ninja Vampire Girl, and this Ninja Vampire Girl wants to fight our Zombie Cross Dressing Magical Boy. And they do!At first I thought this would kind of be like a Weird Super Human fighting tournament where these weird characters fight each other and something about that is actually really original and creative. We see this Zombie Magical Boy use his Zombie state to gain an advantage in the fight such as severing his arm and using it as a projectile. It's things like this that show the shows true potential and really makes me wish it was better than it actually was.And after that fight the show completely drops it's initial concept for a murder mystery that is really weak and ends like it was some kind of bad memory and than the final episodes are really bad. It's some kind of concert and there are some bad singing. I think the voice actors had some fun but I really don't think there was a lot fun left for the viewers.I think Is this a Zombie was just not sure what it wanted to be, so at the end it copped out and did whatever it wanted.I'm not sure what a lot of people see in this anime but for me it was a good concept gone sour. If you like this anime, I'm sure it was probably a lot of fun for you, but for me I'm sorry but I didn't like this anime. I liked the first few episodes but after that it gone down, down, down till I gave it a thumbs down. than introduced to a Ninja Vampire Girl, and this Ninja Vampire Girl wants to fight our Zombie Cross Dressing Magical Boy.

This serie was really good to watch on a Sunday evening with friends. Something to drink, chillout and watch this great anime. (more fun together right?)The story of this serie was great and easy to follow. A zombi/human together with a necromancer, Vampire and Pop idol look a like with a chainsaw. Well...weird things happens in anime so does this one. The story is all about the struggle life of the group with the main zombi character as much in the spot. Story is really well made and just the comedy parts was awesome. We laugh...alot with my friends.The art was not to great for me. Only the special effect was awesome. I dont really like how the eyes were. And thats my personal opinion. I know some people likes it, i'm not.Intro and outro was fun and nice music. And the last song of the serie. was kinda emotional. You know what I mean when you watch it.All the characters were awesome. And great personas. First of all the Zombi main (Aikawa) person. A friendly guy who got killed and reincarnated. A big hearth and well...Clumsy at some moments.The necromancer (Hellsythe) is to quiet. But that notebook is just funny. And the thoughts of the male main. Well sometimes a little bit to dirty.The pop idol bla bla bla... Just chainsaw girl (Haruna) is one of my favorite girl main person in this serie. She act sometimes like a Tsundere but she is kinda different. For example she likes Aikawa. And is not afraid to kiss him. Funny moments happens alot with her.And if you want some fan service here she is Seraphim. She has a rude persona and well...She is irritaded how Aikawa is behaving sometimes. But she is also a vampire ninja. A nice person to girls and not a great chef.Ow before I forget (just saw the other main girls). Yoshida the blond girl. And other side then Haruna she is also my favorite. Maby its better for me to dive into the body of Aikawa (hahaha). She nice girl and a good cook.Enjoyment for me was just by watching this with my friends. The was alot of fun in this serie. And the genre really worth it. Not much ecchie but good enough.

I read a bit of the manga, and the anime seems to be a fairly accurate interpretation of the manga except its elaborated on quite a bit.  No clue about how it is compared to the novel yet.The comedy types in this show are a combination of nonsense, harem, violence, and embarrassment comedy.-Nonsense meaning they say weird things which make no sense at all-harem comedy is obviously accidental groping of breasts followed by a kyaa and a swift dismembering-violence comedy has a lot to do with the...main character being a zombie, since the protagonist can't die they don't hold back on anything-embarrassment comedy being that the main character gets humiliated in front of his classmates a lot in rather extreme fashions.The story is alright as I haven't seen them stop introducing core plot throughout the 2 seasons I've seen so far.  It seems like they are really tempted to go the route of ranma 1/2 though and just throw random episodes out there which they have done and seem like they are doing more often.  New harem members seem to be steadily entering the series at about the same rate they do in Sekirei.The arts mediocre, usually very little is animated in every scene.  Its typical shounen art with high quality images, but the animation is fairly weak.  They also take full advantage of the girls to give them super cute scenes which are elaborated on from the manga using really cute art and sound.  Nothing breakthrough about the sound either.  Pretty standard opening and ending music.Of course the usual redeeming feature about an ecchi harem story is the characters.  This anime truly does paint a wide array of interesting characters from various walks of life with absolutely bizarre backgrounds and personalities.

There are minor spoilers.First off, the characters. Is This A Zombie does a good job of making characters and their personalities, which is one of the reasons I like it so much. It introduces Aikawa Ayumu, who thought he liked a bland and normal life, until Eu, Haruna, Sera, and Yuki came into his life. Halfway into the first season when they fight Kyouko, Aikawa realizes this and would rather lead this life than the life...he previously had. Next, there's Eu, who comes and saves Aikawa when he was killed, forming the bond between Eu and Aikawa. In the first half of the first season, Aikawa learns more about Eu and why she can't show any emotions or talk. This makes the bond even stronger and make Aikawa like Eu more and Eu like Aikawa more for accepting her. In the second half of the second of the first season, Eu decides to leave, seemingly for no reason, but it is showed that she left because The king of night was after her, and she didn't want the others to get hurt more because of her decisions. At the end of the first season, Aikawa begs her not to leave ever again, and Eu actually speaks and tells him she won't, which makes Aikawa believe her. Haruna’s subtle change is in the beginning of the series, when her head teach says to Aikawa that Haruna remembers faces, not names, yet she decided to remember Aikawa’s name. She continues to builds up by beginning to like Aikawa (which isn’t that much because this is a harem, but she’s the only one who actually likes him in that way) in the first season, and shows her tsundere love when she goes inside Aikawa’s mind to tell him to get back in his body and help save Eu. Haruna also influences Aikawa by being the funny, order-giving tsundere that helps Aikawa with his magical girl powers. Sera‘s character gets more free-will throughout the series, as we see Aikawa get annoyed when he hears Sera and Yuki (aka Tomonori) “have to do it because of their clan”. And when Aikawa hears that Sera has orders from her clan to kill Eu, Aikawa forces her to disobey the order because Sera doesn’t want to kill Eu, not because her clan told her to. And she keeps Aikawa in check by being the more wisa and serious order-giving character, calling whatever slightly embarrassing thing Aikawa does “repugnant”. All together, they’re not just funny, but also have character behind them that make the show’s plot interesting and moving at points.The second point about the show is the humor and fan service. I especially like the show’s humor, because it’s random, yet original. What I mean by that is that because how random the show is, it can makes jokes about alot of aspects of the show, and that’s what it does. It doesn’t make a bad random joke for the sake of it like some other funny shows do, but instead make a funny, completely absurd joke based on the situation. One example is the first episode, where the recurring joke ---- kick is shown and is dumb because it’s not a kick, as the enemies point out. Or in the last episode of the first season, when Saras becomes an idol, and Sera and Haruna, and Eu decide to join in too, somehow making it up the ranks even though it’s their debut and it’s at one concert. And when Aikawa has to get Eu’s powers because Eu wants to sing, Aikawa accidentally wishes for all the girls to be in spaghetti straps. The absurdity is humorous, but it doesn’t become too absurd, or go to the point where the joke doesn’t make sense, like some other funny shows do. The fan service, however, is a little too much. When the fan service is used for humor, like in the concert, it's funny and effective. But when it cuts to a tasteless panty shot or when it showed a scene of the three girls taking a bath, it's annoying to watch. Luckily, the fan service doesn't contribute to the plot, like some other shows do. Overall, there's a little too much fan service, but at least it doesn't show as much as High School DXD.The third is the art and the theme (when I say art I mean music too). The theme of the show is a weird one that doesn’t seem to go with the show, but somehow does. One contributor of the theme is the physical art, which has a dull, yet saturated theme. The show does a good job of making the color seem dull at points, but it makes sense because of the place they are in, or the problem they are in. The color can also be very lively and impressive, like when the sun sets and … actually, the color with the sunsets is impressive all by itself, that I can’t think of any more good-looking color scenes, and I’m not disappointed either. In some episodes in the first season, we get some shots of dull-looking streets, and a single bike going down it, almost as if the world there is desaturated and lonely, giving off a different feel of the world than the way other shows portray the same scene of an empty street. It’s almost as if you can connect to it, where the world may be gray on cloudy days, but there’s always a beautiful sunset between it. The second contributor to the theme is the music. After listening to the soundtrack, I can say the music in the body of the show isn’t all that impressive, but it The third contributor to the theme is an element that makes a show all that more fun to watch, and can sometimes be a very impressive part of the show. The opening. The opening is a hype rock piece with green and pink neon colors and the same unsaturated feel the show has, except for the explosions and lights, which are done well. The opening song makes the show seem a little like punk rock, which it isn't, yet it fits with the opening and the show. And after listening to the season 1 (Ma-ka-se-te Tonight) and 2 (***Passionate) opening, it becomes a pretty catchy rock song.The last is the message of the show. In the show, we do get alot of humor and fan service, but there’s a message behind the rest of the show. The show is realistic. Let me explain what I mean by that. As a said, most of the art is kind of dull and unsaturated, except for the beautiful sunsets, and as I said about Aikawa’s character, he’s glad he has friends, excitement, and not a dull boring life he once had. The stays and looks the same way for the entirety of the show, but Aikawa gets to see more of the world of it because his newfound friends, and fights enemies with them too. The message is to go out and do fun stuff If you think about it, it’s the same as alot of moe or other anime shows, but this one has a superhero story, alot of jokes, twists, superpower battles, ships, and more. It’s the whole package. And I think that’s why I like it so much. he previously had. Next, there's Eu, who comes and saves Aikawa when he was killed, forming the bond between Eu and Aikawa. In the first half of the first season, Aikawa learns more about Eu and why she can't show any emotions or talk. This makes the bond even stronger and make Aikawa like Eu more and Eu like Aikawa more for accepting her. In the second half of the second of the first season, Eu decides to leave, seemingly for no reason, but it is showed that she left because The king of night was after her, and she didn't want the others to get hurt more because of her decisions. At the end of the first season, Aikawa begs her not to leave ever again, and Eu actually speaks and tells him she won't, which makes Aikawa believe her. Haruna’s subtle change is in the beginning of the series, when her head teach says to Aikawa that Haruna remembers faces, not names, yet she decided to remember Aikawa’s name. She continues to builds up by beginning to like Aikawa (which isn’t that much because this is a harem, but she’s the only one who actually likes him in that way) in the first season, and shows her tsundere love when she goes inside Aikawa’s mind to tell him to get back in his body and help save Eu. Haruna also influences Aikawa by being the funny, order-giving tsundere that helps Aikawa with his magical girl powers. Sera‘s character gets more free-will throughout the series, as we see Aikawa get annoyed when he hears Sera and Yuki (aka Tomonori) “have to do it because of their clan”. And when Aikawa hears that Sera has orders from her clan to kill Eu, Aikawa forces her to disobey the order because Sera doesn’t want to kill Eu, not because her clan told her to. And she keeps Aikawa in check by being the more wisa and serious order-giving character, calling whatever slightly embarrassing thing Aikawa does “repugnant”. All together, they’re not just funny, but also have character behind them that make the show’s plot interesting and moving at points.The second point about the show is the humor and fan service. I especially like the show’s humor, because it’s random, yet original. What I mean by that is that because how random the show is, it can makes jokes about alot of aspects of the show, and that’s what it does.

And when Aikawa has to get Eu’s powers because Eu wants to sing, Aikawa accidentally wishes for all the girls to be in spaghetti straps. The absurdity is humorous, but it doesn’t become too absurd, or go to the point where the joke doesn’t make sense, like some other funny shows do. The fan service, however, is a little too much.

I did just that and I gotta say I was surprised.Now normally I\'m a little cautious when it comes to the Slice of Life genre when it has both the Harem and Ecchi tags going along with it. High School DxD was the show that did this to me because that show was the first one that I saw which I felt really went way overboard with both aspects. I\'m certain it was the intention to do so but just my personal...taste.I\'m happy to say that Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? didn\'t do this. I was pleasantly surprised at the end of it to feel good about almost everything. It has just enough Ecchi to where you never really feel like its being forced down your throat. Comedy that doesn\'t feel overly forced and doesn\'t require a ton of TL notes to understand. A nice cast of characters within the Harem complete with different traits among the girls that aren\'t overly done in my opinion. A main character that is well rounded enough. It feels like he\'s still a high school student but not completely awkward when it comes to the ladies around him in their risque moments. That for me is huge because I personally do not like a main character who is nothing but a wuss when it comes down to this aspectThey did manage to put in a range of supernatural things, which I enjoyed even squeezing in the traditional Mahou Shoujo transformation whenever the time called for it. It was  a big bonus that it did\'t drag. Each time it felt really compact. I\'ve seen a few shows where after five or six transformations I start dreading it coming at me. This never happened here.Not sure if everyone will get this reference but my opinion of this show is that it\'s a bag of trail mix. That\'s the best way I can describe it. You have a lot of elements that come into this show to make it one whole bag of a Slice of Life series but they sprinkled just enough of all the ingredients to make the bag tasty and filling.

', 'Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?, aka Korezom. Now that\'s a pretty interesting series. This review may contain spoilers along the way so if you\'re going to give it a read, do it at your own risk. With that out of the way, I\'ll admit, the series doesn\'t do anything to get out of the cliched ecchi harem based comedy/drama action packed anime, with pretty unoriginal characters and the formerly human MC who becomes some sort of a mythological creature. Thing is, most of the main characters fall into the same typo, more or less.Now, the concept this anime introduced is pretty interesting. Said MC Aikawa...Ayumu becomes a zombie after being murdered by unknown serial killer and revived by overpowered legal loli necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, aka Yuu, (who happens to be a pretty great character, I could say even a rare for a kuudere). Then again, what anime main character doesn\'t lose his humanity to switch race, with Issei Hyoudou of High School DxD and Ken Kaneki of Tokyo Ghoul being headlines for these types of transformations? Then again, the fact that the former human main character turns into a zombie out of all fictional races is rather unusual, and well, pretty much mocks the concept of a zombie being a mindless creature who can\'t live unless he eats a human brain. Instead, in Korezom, a zombie is an undead human who can use his body at super speed, strength and healing ability. It pretty much did the whole cliched thing of -boy meets girl, stops being human, starts kicking ass and gets chicks into a harem- differently. At least when referring to the race the main character adopts. Cause if you refer to the harem trophies, they are annoying at worst and boring at best. Especially tsundere magical girl Haruna and borderline yandere vampire-ninja Sera. Also, I must say Ayumu absorbing Haruna\'s power and getting Masou-Shoujo abilities goes beyond hilarious, especially when he is pretty much forced to use this transformation to defeat monsters since his body, with all the regeneration abilities, is not able to withstand tougher attacks.As a character, I must say Ayumu is one of a kind MC. As OP as he can be sometimes, you can\'t take him seriously when you see him battling monsters while crossdressing as a magical girl, and he\'s also perverted to a near-Issei level (well, except the sister complex he has for Yuu, and he actually tries to deny it). Still, unlike other main characters, he doesn\'t lose his head in the battle and go overly emotional or spout cliche crap like ""Imma kick ya ass"" (despite, well, having more reason to do so than many other luckier MCs); and instead shows a serious and sarcastic stance when in battle (when he doesn\'t whine about his girl outfit, that is). And you could even pity him at times, since he is reduced to a dog in his own household, and constantly subjected to more or less comical bullying from Haruna and Sera. In a comedic way, his fate is quite tragic despite how much of a lucky bastard he is. And I\'m not even ironic.As for the other characters... Yuu: I see her as an interesting character. Well, being the forced emotionless kuudere that she is, she can at most deadpan or ignore Ayumu\'s antics, but she doesn\'t seem to mind his siscon delusions towards her. Cause if she did, she\'d write it on paper, duh. Also, I find her the combo of that emotionless face and writing communication kinda cute. Tomonori: Heh, as cliched as the whole ""I\'m your wife cause faction custom"" thing, I can\'t deny that she builds a cute romantic tension between her and Ayumu in trying to fall in love with him (absurd concept but she succeeds -_-). Not to mention her antagonistic moments were badass. Haruna and Sera: I don\'t even.Story. Starts with a cliche, but well, a guilty pleasure of mine is that I actually enjoy how the plot goes on from that point. With the crossdressing zombie meeting girls and kicking evil monster Megalo ass until some resemblance of a plot shows up. And this is where the most enjoyable, episode 7, is when Ayumu defeats Kyoko, the serial killer who murdered him, and kills her down to her last life which... he spares! Oh, and it\'s revealed Kyoko wasn\'t actually a yanigiri, she was just possessed by an evil spirit who was forcing her to do all that stuff. Great! Then the Evil from the Past arc with Yuu running away and her former apprentice King of the Night, fellow zombie, threatens to burn the world down unless he dies (gotta love this absurdity but hell being undead kinda gets boring). Ayumu\'s character development is also interesting in the said arc. Ever since that scene when Yuu doesn\'t take his hand so she flies away instead. Suffering a Disney death while taking a bomb on his head and explodes midair, getting pieces of his body put back together but he\'s too stuck in a Kanekish mindscape to actually wake up. So Haruna has to invade his subconsciousness and knock some sense into him. Before he goes to have Yuu return to him and kick the shit out of his fellow zombie. Oh well, said zombie gets beaten by Ayumu and his death wish is fulfilled by Yuu (RIP). Then Yuu speaks for the first time and swears to stay with Ayumu forever. Awww...The animation, well, is as good as a 2011 series could go, and the sound... who even watched this series and heard the soundtrack should actually be rewarded a medal. Enjoyment?...Besides all the stereotypical stuff, Korezom is actually an enjoyable anime for providing some good comic relief and interesting resemblances of a plot.

"", 'Note: This will be a review of the series in its entirety.Overview:Sometimes an anime doesn\'t need to be or do anything particularly special in order to be enjoyable, like telling a story you won\'t ever forget. Sometimes, all it needs is to be just plain fun. After all, an anime\'s main responsibility is to show the viewer a good time, right? ""Is this a Zombie?"" is a fantastic series, but not because of its story, or its visuals or because of some thoroughly mesmerising soundtrack. No, ""Is this a Zombie?""\'s success lies in delivering one of the funniest anime you could find anywhere.Story & World...(6.5/10):The story follows Ayumu Aikawa, a kind-hearted but very unlucky teenage boy who has recently been killed and resurrected as a zombie. Now, he lives with a cute girl named Eucliwood Hellscythe, or Eu for short, a Necromancer with uncontrollable power who brought Ayumu back to life after he was killed by a serial killer. Now, he\'s attempting to hunt down the killer, in order to make sure nobody else suffers the same fate he did. It\'s not long before he encounters Haruna, a Magical Garment Girl from another dimension. In a horrible turn of events, he ends up absorbing her powers, forcing him to fight the monstrous Megalos in her place and wear a frilly dress as he does it, while Haruna takes up residence in his house until her powers return. Things get even more complicated when a third girl, a vampire ninja named Seraphim, appears wishing to be the servant of Eu, though since Ayumu has already taken the position, she settles for being Ayumu\'s instead, though she doesn\'t act like a servant at ALL. And so begins the misadventures of this incredibly unlikely foursome, as we see both their daily lives and their various dealings with the supernatural.As you might have guessed, the story does not take itself seriously. There is a massive amount of genre clichés here and plenty of moments that go unexplained. The second season in particular is a bit of a mess, introducing a lot of new plot points and not really going anywhere with any of them. There are a few touching moments here and there, however, and the characters are really lovable (more on that later), but overall the story is easily the series\' weakest link.The world is also relatively unexplored. The most we ever really get told is that it\'s a \'world full of weird stuff\'. There are magic, monsters, vampire ninjas and many other things, but we are only ever really given a basic outline of what these are. It\'s basically just our world injected with a bunch of random supernatural phenomenon and, ultimately, not particularly interesting.Art & Animation (8.5/10):Visually, ""Is this a Zombie"" looks pretty damn good. The characters are all very well-drawn and the art style is distinct. As I mentioned before, however, the visuals aren\'t the reason you would watch this series, as there are a few camera problems here and there as well as occasionally stiff animations. It DOES look very good, just not outstanding.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):The soundtrack is somewhat hit-and-miss. The opening and ending themes are rather forgettable and I skipped them every time. However, there are quite a few good themes to be found in here, particularly ""Play, Seraphim!"". The voice acting, on the other hand, is fantastic. As with most anime, I watched the show dubbed and most of the voices are really good, with all of the actors delivering their lines extremely well. And I would also like to note that this has easily one of the best scripts for an anime I have ever seen, with literally every episode having at least 4 or 5 quote-worthy lines. Overall, the sound is really pleasant on the ears, and one of the anime\'s greatest strengths.Characters (8.5/10):As I mentioned above, the characters are really lovable. Let\'s start with Ayumu. From the very first episode, it’s clear that the guy just cannot catch a break and while the stuff he goes though is hilarious, you can’t help but feel for him at the same time. Hell, in the pre-opening scene, he gets hit by a car, is sent flying through several trees, loses all of his clothes and ends up buck-naked in front of two screaming girls, all because he was trying to save a cat from being run over. His luck doesn’t get much better from there, being forced to dress as a little girl on several occasions among other things, and yet in spite of all of it, he remains a kind person throughout and doesn’t let any of it slow him down for long, which you can’t help but respect him for. Overall, he is a great lead character, especially with his constant snarky quips, which at times could give Kyon a run for his money.However, if I were to pick a standout character for the series, it would have to be Eucliwood, who is also one the biggest reasons to watch the series along with the humour. We learn early on that her magic is extremely powerful to the point that it activates whenever she says anything, and causes her serious head pain whenever it activates. As a result, she has to suppress her emotions and communicates solely using a notebook. While the things she writes are fairly simple, usually referring to her appetite, Ayumu has a habit of interpreting them in a perverted way, having various fantasies about her. There are many of these throughout the series, and as an added bonus, the voice actor for the imaginary Eus is different in every episode. As for Eu herself, while seemingly emotionless, she soon proves herself to be the nicest character in the entire series. How nice is she? The events of the series began when she used her powers to resurrect Ayumu as a zombie, taking on the pain of being stabbed in the process, when she had only known him for a couple of hours at the most! Beyond that, she is incredibly cute. I mean, just look at her! All of this comes together to create a really unique and lovable character, and she is one of the absolute highlights of the whole series.The other two residents of Ayumu’s household are the aforementioned Haruna and Seraphim. Unlike Ayumu and Eu, they are both pretty big jerks, who generally treat Ayumu like dirt in spite of the fact that he let them into his home. While they do help around the house, normally with cooking (which Haruna is very good at but Sera stinks at), they are also very demanding and rude, particularly Sera, who constantly calls Ayumu a maggot on basis of him being a perverted zombie. Thankfully, they both loosen up notably over the first season, and by the end I would say I actually preferred Haruna to Ayumu.The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Besides Sera, there are two other vampire ninjas encountered throughout the series- Maelstrom, who comes from a rival clan of Sera’s, and Sarasvati, Sera’s superior. There’s also Ariel, Haruna’s teacher who is a serious oddball and almost disturbingly protective of her students. The problem is that, while most of them are likable enough, they don’t really do all that much or just don’t show up very often. One character in particular is introduced in the last two episodes and doesn’t really contribute anything other than some tasteless fanservice, though your mileage may vary on that one. The villains are unexpected, but do add some decent flavour into an otherwise senseless story.Enjoyment (9/10):This is definitely not a category the series falls short in. With the gut-bustlingly funny script and slapstick humour, “Is this a Zombie!” remains an incredibly enjoyable experience from start to finish, especially when complimented by the awesome action scenes. However, there are notably less action scenes in the second season, admittedly making it a bit of a disappointment when compared to the first season. That’s not to say the second season isn’t satisfactory- it’s just that I feel they could have done a bit more with it.Overall:“Is this a Zombie?” is about as absurd and inconsistent as anime can get, but it’s very rare that you’ll find an anime that is THIS side-splittingly funny, and the lovable characters more than make up for the stale plot. If you’re the kind of person who watches anime solely for a compelling story, then this is not the series for you. But if you just want to have a good old laugh or unwind after a long day, then you need not look any further than the misadventures of Ayumu and his friends.Score:6.5+8.5+9+8.5+9=41.5/50=8.3/10 (6.5/10):The story follows Ayumu Aikawa, a kind-hearted but very unlucky teenage boy who has recently been killed and resurrected as a zombie. Now, he lives with a cute girl named Eucliwood Hellscythe, or Eu for short, a Necromancer with uncontrollable power who brought Ayumu back to life after he was killed by a serial killer. Now, he\'s attempting to hunt down the killer, in order to make sure nobody else suffers the same fate he did. It\'s not long before he encounters Haruna, a Magical Garment Girl from another dimension. In a horrible turn of events, he ends up absorbing her powers, forcing him to fight the monstrous Megalos in her place and wear a frilly dress as he does it, while Haruna takes up residence in his house until her powers return. Things get even more complicated when a third girl, a vampire ninja named Seraphim, appears wishing to be the servant of Eu, though since Ayumu has already taken the position, she settles for being Ayumu\'s instead, though she doesn\'t act like a servant at ALL. And so begins the misadventures of this incredibly unlikely foursome, as we see both their daily lives and their various dealings with the supernatural.As you might have guessed, the story does not take itself seriously.

So what strengths does this anime actually have? Well...- Story & ThemeWe're told the backstory early on and it's not very complicated. The protagonist dies, is turned into a zombie by a necromancer and is now immortal. In the first episode he is also turned into a chainsaw wielding magical girl and then a vampire ninja becomes his servant. It's an over-the-top take on the harem genre, but for a harem it isn't really played out as one. The main story revolves more around the necromancer and her...powers, although the first episodes establish the characters rather than have much plot and most of the series focuses on gags and violence rather than story. It's seldom very serious, but it has its moments. It also has a lot of fanservice, especially the two OVA episodes (I will not be writing a separate review on those).- Characters & WritingThe characters are based on tropes, but they still manage to come through as their own characters. Not too deep or complicated by any means, but enough to make them distinct from other animes. The writing is mostly fun and silly with serious, romantic or over-the-top weird scenes thrown in every now and then. Don't expect a masterpiece of writing, but it's competent and works well for what it is.- Style & PresentationThe animation and style isn't the best so don't expect anything fantastic. Still, it's not terrible by any means, perhaps with the exception from the few times it uses poorly done 3D. Monsters are mostly large animals with clothes which plays into the weird and silly and the other antagonists look like humans. Every now and then there are scenes with an abundance of blood, mostly when the chainsaw is used, and the action scenes are fairly well directed and do not drone on for too long. You'll see a lot of ecchi moments and they often feel a bit cringe, although at times they're tied into the plot.- OVA episodesI'll mention them briefly here because they're just two short episodes with even shorter stories in them. Basically, they are simply fanservice to the point where they're hard to watch, even at their short lengths. The stories aren't very good or interesting and they don't tie into any main plot. You can give these a skip.- ConclusionThere's no single thing about this anime that is outstanding, but the show is nonetheless entertaining and I'd say the different elements tie together well enough for the show to become more than just the sum of its parts. It did make me chuckle from time to time and the fact that it's not too long also helps.

I laugh through almost every episode. The show is overall fun and good to watch after watching serious horror or? shows.Overall:a good show that puts some weird concepts together. If you only like serious things then don't watch it but if you're looking for a funny harem battle magical girl zombie ninja vampire anime this is great "", 'Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?! follows the recently deceased Ayumu as he begins life as a zombie, living with Eu, the necromancer who revived him, Haruna, a magical girl, and Sera, a vampire ninja. Ayumu soon absorbs Haruna’s powers and becomes a magical girl himself. Our hero’s party battles fleets of flying whales, crazy women, giant stuffed animals and golems using the power of a magical girl’s chainsaw, leaves, and ramen.I’ll be the first to admit that most of this show doesn’t make any sense whatsoever. But who cares? Making sense is boring. And Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka is certainly not boring. There were...a few episodes in the middle where the show attempted to be serious and make sense (it actually didn’t do too bad, either) but fortunately the creators abandoned this endeavor and went back to the ridiculousness that made the show so much fun to watch in the first place.One thing which I found that the show does particularly well at is combining the plot (such as it is) with comedy. Anime often have a tendency to focus only on comedy or only on the plot exclusively, and they’ll often end with a “climax” of sorts which is entirely serious and drains all the fun out of the show. Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka?! does an excellent job avoiding this: they even have the main antagonist tell a completely non-sensical joke and relive all the tension right at the peak of the climax.The characters start out seeming annoying: Haruna has a cheerful, genius-level idiocy and refuses to wear pants; Sera is only capable of cussing; and Tomonori takes the role of the young “wife”. But all of them eventually grew on me as they played more of a role in the show. Harun’s genius became more idiotic, Sera’s disses improved from the initially generic insults to ones more specific to Ayumu and the situation, and Tomonori was sat on by a humongous stuffed animal and transformed into a golem.Overall, I recommend giving this show a watch if you’re looking for some brainless humor.ps: this review is NOT writen by ME. but i agre with everything this review says. so i decided to post it a few episodes in the middle where the show attempted to be serious and make sense (it actually didn’t do too bad, either) but fortunately the creators abandoned this endeavor and went back to the ridiculousness that made the show so much fun to watch in the first place.One thing which I found that the show does particularly well at is combining the plot (such as it is) with comedy.

(both seasons + all OVAs)Here are my thoughts:This is just another junk-food harem-comedy show that for some reason became popular among casual anime viewers and was subsequently overrated.Any attempt at plot always resulted in a convoluted mess. The show is strongest when it sticks to SOL and comedy scenes. The weakest episodes by far were those which were plot-focused. Poor direction might be the biggest flaw of this anime.The show's best aspect is its supernatural flavour, I think. This is somewhat unique, and a lot of the skits and gags built around supernatural phenomena were funny...and creative.There is a strong otaku culture influence as well, which I found entertaining.The character designs and animation seemed somewhat dated even for the production year. I'm not sure if this was an intentional artistic decision. This is not necessarily a bad thing but I thought it was noteworthy.The music is okay; I liked all of the OP and ED songs.There are moments where the show shines but they're outweighed by the mediocre remainder, unfortunately. I rate this anime 6/10 overall. It's watchable junk food, but junk food nonetheless. and creative.There is a strong otaku culture influence as well, which I found entertaining.The character designs and animation seemed somewhat dated even for the production year.

You can\'t go analyzing everything or else you really won\'t enjoy it at all. Sure the type of characters arn\'t very ""original"", and the fan service can be excesive.But honestly, there arn\'t a lot of ""original"" anime out there anymore now is there? I can honestly say that other then Puella Magi and maybe Steins Gate, the newer anime are pretty much all ""unoriginal"". Now that I made that clear I...can start with my review.So the story follows a young highschooler named Ayumu Aikawa (actually a sunlight fearing zombie) who\'s put through all sorts of situations with his friends Eucliwood Hellscythe (a necromancer), Haruna (a maso shojo), Seraphim (a ninja vampire) and Yuki Yoshida or Mael Strom (a ninja vampire). Fighting both Megalo\'s (giant animal monsters) and even others like themselves.So too sum up it\'s a harem/parody with a little Shounen adventure kind of twist in there. Because it\'s a harem I had to give it\'s story the rating I did because it\'s a harem, plain and simple. But personaly I liked the artwork because it fit it\'s characters and story nicely. It was a change from the artstyle that every anime seems to share now-a-days.Now for the characters, personaly, and my judgement might be clouded with old age but, I loved the characters! Not enough for a perfect score because I to have standards when watching anime, but still. The tsundere was a masou shojo with a chainsaw! Not a useless mage like Louise, or a magical samurai *ahem* Flame Haze like Shana. Unlike other Harems the main protagonist could actually pull his weight in a fight unlike Tsukune Aono from Rosario+Vampire or Yuuto Amakawa from Omamori Himari.So what I\'m trying to say is in what the characters lake in depth they gain in attachement. You get attached to them and learn to love them during the story no matter how ""unoriginal"" they are. They aint no Goku or Haruhi, but they\'re still entertaining and loveable never the less!Even if it is ""unoriginal""! If you can look me in the eye and tell me that you didn\'t chuckle when you saw that panty shot of Ayumu in a maso shojo, then I\'ll be really surprised. I recommend this series to anyone willing to take a break from all the hardcore series\', to relax, have a good laugh and enjoy the anime for what it is.It\'s no Naruto or Bleach but hell, it\'s to DIE for XD! can start with my review.So the story follows a young highschooler named Ayumu Aikawa (actually a sunlight fearing zombie) who\'s put through all sorts of situations with his friends Eucliwood Hellscythe (a necromancer), Haruna (a maso shojo), Seraphim (a ninja vampire) and Yuki Yoshida or Mael Strom (a ninja vampire).

None of the characters have any personality and all of the writing relies on slapstick humor. The animation is under-par, so none of the comedic slapstick gets across the way that it should.

HAHAHA"". I was so curious about this anime that it made a person to go and post about it, brag about it. So, I started watching it and let me tell you it was SHIT.Is this a Zombie? Funny name. First episode, the protag explains his story about the girl who just came into his house. I was like okay okay nice. episode ended I was like wait what that\'s it? what the...heck? where\'s the comedy? Literally watched 13 episodes of it, I still haven\'t laughed a single bit. Yeah there are some jokes which made me smile. But that\'s it, there are nothing but childish jokes which I think I am too old to get or else this is some japanese shit that I can\'t comprehend.I don\'t care about the cliche characters like one is loli, one is mute (but still somehow finds a way to humilate him), one is vampire ninja whose attitude is like she owns everything, one is his bride (actually a single person who is not that bad and he doesn\'t get attracted to her at all, weren\'t him and his buddy wanted this?).Art style was okay in my point, I only watch anime for story and enjoyment. I only hate the hentai or pretty old animations. But it is on a mediocre level.Like what the writers thought when they were making this? Oh let\'s humiliate, defile the protag and let\'s make a harem with lots of girls and let them abuse him as much they want. And nooooo, he can\'t say shit to them because he\'s a zombie. He will let these girls live in his house as long as they freaking desire.Then there is this ninja girl, who at every sentence calls him a maggot like literally it\'s getting freaking boring. Move on? New jokes? Something? Hellooo? Then she says I am his servant and acts like he\'s her slave or something.Then they made him so good, caring, powerful but without any self respect. I feel violated seeing this. It made me so angry when I saw him getting abused for no freaking reason like come on. Either make him a bad person who deserves this kind of treatment. They live in his house, he pays for them, he gets abused by them, still he treats them good.Overall, pretty shit anime, I don\'t recommend it at all. But if you are curious, then go ahead. I don\'t watch those lovely dovely romance anime where the protag will do anything for ""his"" woman, so I guess that\'s my point of view.

That’s not a judgement against people who enjoy that stuff, I just want potential viewers to know what they’re getting when they watch this.I found the show a lot less interesting than its synopsis made it sound, and dropped it after 5 episodes. Lots of voyeuristic camera shots of the female characters, whether they are are actually doing something sexy like bathing or just starting a convo with the male lead, you will probably see a close up pan of their bodies starting...with the breasts. Much of the show focuses on the fantasy of domestic life with these girls, who are either indifferent to the main character or actively abusive.The upshot is the show contains some reasonably interesting and well-animated fight scenes with monsters. Occasionally the jokes would have me smiling, particularly the male lead who I appreciate taking everything in stride when his world constantly gets wrecked by the girls of his supernatural harem. This makes him a surprisingly likable male lead for a harem show where the main character is usually a bland stand-in for who creators imagine is their target audience. Lastly, the design for Haruna is cute, though not particularly original, (basically Card Captor Sakura with a chainsaw.) The mystery of the murderer kept me through 5 episodes, but there are way better shows out there that I could be watching. with the breasts.

And by ""poor execution,"" I mean that they attempted to lop its head off with a very dull axe, and had to take multiple agonizing swings in order to finish the job.  Then, being a zombie, the plot got up and continued wandering aimlessly anyways.The BBEG has a tragic back story filled with betrayal and disillusionment...  But we have to infer this from circumstances, because the show doesn\'t bring it up in spite of this being the keystone of the entire plot.  We don\'t explain what happened to bring him to such a...point of desperation, or what kind of time frame this took.  We don\'t divulge the origin of his extraordinary powers which are unrelated to what little we know of his background.  We don\'t get into the rationale for persistently denying his ethically reasonable request, even when the lives of friends and, indeed, an entire city (which may or may not have a population of over twelve people) are at stake.  We do, however, specify that he likes penguins, because that\'s very relevant.  Because it explains why he looks at penguins.  *sigh*The trite yet severely overstated running gags are irritatingly tired before they even become running gags.  About half of the characters are genius imbeciles of implausible power, and pretty much all of the characters are self-caricatures.  Dialogue is mostly pretty predictable, except for when a character goes off the rails for the purpose of ham-fisted exposition.  The plot needlessly writes itself into a corner multiple times, then escapes either by ignoring the situation, throwing continuity out the window, and/or the liberal application of Deus Ex-Sensei.  There appear to actually be multiple plot lines (and pointless red herrings), but they\'re all wadded messily together into a lumpy screenplay play-doh snake because \'all weird things are directly connected, and writing is hard\'.  I don\'t believe that the writer(s) had any real understanding of plot structure, or at the very least they lacked the competence to meaningfully fill that structure.I think I can summarize the nature of this whole mess with one teensy-weensy spoiler: vampire ninja maid string ensemble ghost busters.  If that sounds like word salad to you, then imagine it as an actual scene—a scene included exclusively to wedge a central character into the plot climax without actually involving them in it.  In fact, that\'s basically a synopsis of the entire plot right there, and the list of characters it applies to includes the protagonist.  All of the frenetic conflict is just filler surrounding a single dramatic-ish character interaction—there is little actual material in this season which could not have been more effectively covered in one non-violent OVA....Speaking of which, I\'ll murder the OVA in my next review.There was one moment of genuine dark drama.

Nanbaka,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30016/Nanbaka,"[""A description of Nanbaka is probably going to make it sound real dumb. This is likey because it really, really is. But the fact it is dumb does not preclude it from being entertaining, and I assure you that it is nothing if not that. I 100% recommend watching it if you are:A.) In the mood for something funny.B.) Unbothered by something being really stupid.C.) Equally unbothered by anime being weird for weird's sake.Story:I can best sum up Nanbaka thusly: it is pretty much what would happen if you transformed the Looney Tunes into bishy anime twinks with FABULOUS hair and threw them into a...facility that is simultaneously the worlds most secure prison and the worlds most liberal Montessori preschool. So like Tiny Toon Adventures meets Orange is the New Black. Specifically those two shows, because like Tiny Toon Adventures the characters seem to have the impulse control of infants and can pull seemingly whatever they want out of Hammerspace and like OITNB everybody is kinda compelling and pretty fabulous and kinda gay and in prison. If that doesn't sound fun to you, you probably won't like it. We would probably also not be friends, because it sounds like a whole bunch of fun to me.Art: OH MY GOD REALLY GOOD! It is a joy to look at. The color is hyper-saturated, lime green and hot pink and crazy in the best way possible. It is exciting and surreal, which helps you suspend your disbelief over the antics of the ridiculous plot and characters. The art puts me in the mood to have fun, which the show then offers. 10/10, this is what art should do for an animated show: inform you by design alone what kind of show you are watching.Sound: Also awesome. The opening song is pretty cool: rocky J-Pop paired with some fun imagery indicative of the mood of the show. The ending, however, is the shit. It's more or less chibi versions of the characters running around escaping from prison while they all sing a song together. I love it and watch it every time. It is charming and funny, and always made me want to watch the next episode.Character: Over the top and too much, but so is the show and consequentially it more or less works. The main 4 are all pretty funny and engaging, although main guy (#15/Jyuugo) is kind of a sad sack these days. Everybody has more or less exactly one joke that they are used to tell over and over, but the joke seems to always land despite being repeated ad nauseam. They are either manic and adorably annoying, or unvarying serious to the point that they cannot themselves be taken seriously. Sometimes both at once (The Warden). Special shout out goes to Nico, the hyper kid who takes a bunch of drugs and is really into stupid anime, because he is basically me. I just wanted to hang out with him and smoke a blunt and watch G-Gundam (secretly the best Gundam despite what everybody else who has ever watched it beside me and Nico might say).Enjoyment: Loads. This show isn't going to teach you anything. It's not going to tell you anything profound, it will just make you laugh a bunch. If that is enough for you, give it a watch. I did and do not regret it in the slightest. facility that is simultaneously the worlds most secure prison and the worlds most liberal Montessori preschool. So like Tiny Toon Adventures meets Orange is the New Black. Specifically those two shows, because like Tiny Toon Adventures the characters seem to have the impulse control of infants and can pull seemingly whatever they want out of Hammerspace and like OITNB everybody is kinda compelling and pretty fabulous and kinda gay and in prison. If that doesn't sound fun to you, you probably won't like it. We would probably also not be friends, because it sounds like a whole bunch of fun to me.Art: OH MY GOD REALLY GOOD! It is a joy to look at. The color is hyper-saturated, lime green and hot pink and crazy in the best way possible. It is exciting and surreal, which helps you suspend your disbelief over the antics of the ridiculous plot and characters. The art puts me in the mood to have fun, which the show then offers. 10/10, this is what art should do for an animated show: inform you by design alone what kind of show you are watching.Sound: Also awesome. The opening song is pretty cool: rocky J-Pop paired with some fun imagery indicative of the mood of the show. The ending, however, is the shit. It's more or less chibi versions of the characters running around escaping from prison while they all sing a song together. I love it and watch it every time. It is charming and funny, and always made me want to watch the next episode.Character: Over the top and too much, but so is the show and consequentially it more or less works. The main 4 are all pretty funny and engaging, although main guy (#15/Jyuugo) is kind of a sad sack these days. Everybody has more or less exactly one joke that they are used to tell over and over, but the joke seems to always land despite being repeated ad nauseam. They are either manic and adorably annoying, or unvarying serious to the point that they cannot themselves be taken seriously. Sometimes both at once (The Warden). Special shout out goes to Nico, the hyper kid who takes a bunch of drugs and is really into stupid anime, because he is basically me. I just wanted to hang out with him and smoke a blunt and watch G-Gundam (secretly the best Gundam despite what everybody else who has ever watched it beside me and Nico might say).Enjoyment: Loads. This show isn't going to teach you anything. It's not going to tell you anything profound, it will just make you laugh a bunch. If that is enough for you, give it a watch. I did and do not regret it in the slightest."", ""NEVER TAKE THIS SHOW SERIOUSLYNow that that's out of the way, I found enjoyment in this show though the hilarious imagery and funny jokes.THE STORY is mediocre at best, but it's a comedy, so there's not much you can expect.THE ART is great. It's the main focus of the comedy element and sometimes is a bit too lenient on it. The art by itself  though colorful and wild is sometimes a bit eye bleeding.THE CHARACTERS aren't varied. They are all just comic relief, which makes them seem  bland overall.OVERALL I liked this show, not to where I'll be recommending...it, but it made me laugh and I think a comedy shows goal is to make you laugh and this show accomplishes it's goal. it, but it made me laugh and I think a comedy shows goal is to make you laugh and this show accomplishes it's goal."", 'Many have heard the old proverb, ""If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one"". By extension, the more rabbits one chases at once, the harder each is to catch. Nanbaka takes this a step further: it starts going after one rabbit, then gets distracted by a bird and later a fish. It unfortunately fails to catch any of them, but at least it looks cool trying.At its core, Nanbaka is a zany, colourful gag comedy in a prison setting! ...Or is it an action shonen? No? A character drama? In practice, it frequently switches targets when it may have been wiser to...stick to one.From the get-go, Nanbaka presents a fast-paced series of varied jokes, ranging from visual humour to ironic subversion to borderline non-sequitur. They weren\'t exactly original, and didn\'t get to me personally, but variety and quick pacing are handy tools for holding interest whenever a punchline doesn\'t quite hit the mark. At this point, I respected Nanbaka for what it was. It had a clear identity, and showed commitment to it.However, the show quickly lost its focus from there. In my eyes, a lack of focus is one of the fastest ways to kill viewer interest, and often a sign of poor writing. Nanbaka soon falls into this trap; rather than continuing its gag comedy roots, it tries to take on multiple identities at once. As soon as the action and drama arrive, the pacing slows considerably and the jokes become less varied or frequent. This would be fine if the new elements meshed well, or were at least strong additions to the series, but instead, they just make things messier.The action elements suffer from weak choreography. This is expounded on by mid-action cuts to narration by onlooking characters - an issue seen in many action anime. For once, Nanbaka could have made this trope work in its favour by filling the narration with its usual zany jokes. Alas, it\'s just the usual filler dialogue to stretch out the no-longer-action while explaining attacks that didn\'t really need to be explained and/or stating things that are obvious to the viewer.Despite the action portion\'s weaknesses, the drama is where I find Nanbaka to be the least successful. At these points, the show suddenly takes on a more serious tone than the accompanying gag comedy and action. This results in a weird situation in which a viewer is simultaneously expected to take the show seriously while also not taking it seriously at all. It\'s not the tonal shifts that are the issue - rather, it\'s their frequency and the show\'s inability to sell them.Furthermore, compelling drama requires compelling characters - something Nanbaka does not have. Most of them come down to one-dimensional quirks or hobbies and maybe the occasional simple backstory. They\'re too simple to be interesting on their own, and it makes investment difficult.And this brings up what I believe to be Nanbaka\'s main weakness, and the source of nearly all its problems: it\'s characters. Even with its wildly differing subject matter, this show certainly wasn\'t doomed from the start. It simply lacked the tools needed to succeed. While there were several things that could have helped the show (improved action pacing and choreography, or a more memorable soundtrack to quickly and effectively shift tone), ultimately, I believe that characterization is the one key missing weapon it really needed to hit all its desired targets.Stronger characters can create chemistry which helps to sell the comedy and elevate it from ""gag"" to ""riot"". In turn, these jokes can be a quick and effective way to show characterization. From there, these improved characters help to invest a viewer before the show switches to action, and when drama builds, the viewer will more readily buy into it. But without this depth of character, the act falls apart, undercut from its very foundations.Despite all my criticisms of Nanbaka, one positive I can mention is the show\'s art. It has a unique, sparkly, insanely colourful style that immediately draws attention. I\'ll admit, this alone made it easier for me to sit through Nanbaka\'s weakest points. The style, however, is not nearly enough to carry the show on its own against its many weaknesses.In the end, Nanbaka gets a tad too ambitious for its own good, and misses the fundamentals as a result. What could have been a notable series sadly ends up as a disorganized, zig-zagging mess, with no clear identity beyond its visual style. When it does manage to catch a rabbit, it\'s not a particularly tasty one. stick to one.From the get-go, Nanbaka presents a fast-paced series of varied jokes, ranging from visual humour to ironic subversion to borderline non-sequitur.

The great shows are not only deliver brilliant action scenes through the quality of the technical aspects, they’re also hilarious and consistent with the comedy. The poor action/comedy shows either skimp on the quality of the art and sound involved or lack consistency in the comedy or both. Action/comedy shows are at their best when they’re funny or exciting but not when they drift off into needless drama.Nanbaka falls between the two; it starts out great with an interesting premise and acceptable comedy. But it loses its focus along the way near the end...of the series and slowly becomes boring.[Repeated prison escapists]Nanbaka is an action/comedy anime series based off a web manga originally created by Futamata Shou and his influence glows throughout the show. It is directed by Takamatsu Shinji, who’s directed brilliant comedy series like Gintama and The Daily Lives of Highschool boys. The series is revolves around the daily antics of four inmates in the self-proclaimed, most formidable prison in the world. The inmates of the infamous ward 13, Juugo, Uno, Rock and Nico, often try to escape the prison’s walls and are always stopped in their tracks by the fearsome guard, Sugoroku Hajime. But Juugo is also on the lookout for the man who gave him his unremovable shackles and his colleagues question their motives for trying to escape the prison.[An interesting premise abandoned]Nanbaka begins as a ‘gag’ comedy with an interesting premise: the main characters frequently try to escape from the prison. In the first few episodes, we see them break through several high security gates only to be caught and beaten by the head guard, Hajime. The hilarious execution of this premise coupled with the diverse skill set of the inmates makes these episodes interesting to watch. The premise also leaves a lot of room for creativity; the prison could be viewed as a dungeon, for example. As thin as the plot was, it was replaced by a pointless intra-prison arc.The intra-prison arc was not boring by any chance; it was even more exciting than the initial episodes though less creative. The event introduced most of the cast of the show and showcased the abilities of the inmates and guards alike. It was hilarious and full of explosive battles with fluid animation and lots of special effects. It was pointless but still fun to watch. Unfortunately, the show slides into a series of dramatic sketches following the last battle in the arc.The last few episodes seemed like the opposite of the first episodes; they had direction but were boring. They just seemed to tick off all the common tropes for drama present in an action show; a self-deprecating main character who learns to lean on his friends. It wasn’t awful; it just wasn’t what was sold by the show at the start. Also, the drama would have been better had there been more characters involved.[A diverse and wild cast]Nanbaka has a large cast of characters from various nationalities. Some are declared in the show like Juugo’s British and American fellow inmates. Others are inferred from their design like the inmates of ward 5. With this comes a variety in the design; some inmates wear their prison clothes while others do not. Unfortunately, the personalities aren’t as diverse. Almost all the characters, inmates and guards alike are hyperactive and aggressive; most of the inmates have no motives at all. Only the main characters seem to want other things hang out in prison.Juugo likes to break out of his cell, 13,  for the fun of it; it’s later revealed that it’s the only skill he has. He’s also in search of the man who placed shackles on him but this only becomes a focus of the show much later. Uno is the self-proclaimed pretty boy of his cell; Rock is the muscle who likes to eat and Nico is playful and immune to drugs. That’s about all there is to them although they reveal other skills that only last the duration of the intra-prison event arc. The other characters of note are ward 13’s head guard, Hajime, who’s a workaholic and the warden who has a crush on Hajime. Fortunately, what Nanbaka lacks in characterization, it makes up for in its art and character design.[Glitter, gloss and pretty boys]The art style of Nanbaka is distinct and loud. The background and character art is sharp and colourful; the colours are bold and bright; the characters are drawn with prominent outlines. It’s artstyle is similar to that of Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure but it’s recognizable for the tones of colour used. It’s uniqueness lies in its overall theme: femininity.It’s difficult to miss the glitter that pervades the environment in the show. The characters glitter, the prison walls glitter, even the ocean that surrounds the prison glitters. In addition to the glitter is the gloss that’s also on everything, from hair to their clothing. The characters also tend to wear more jewellry than the average male and often have painted fingernails. Then there are characters that are effeminate in their appearance, voice and mannerisms. This art style, coupled with the jazzy themes, gives the show a 70s feel.[Jazzy with a spice of rock]The opening (Rin! Rin! Hi! Hi!) gives away the catchy jazz style that pervades the entire show. It’s a brilliant intro to the flamboyant show and one of the most memorable for me in the Fall season of 2016. Sadly, only Uno’s melody (a score that plays when he’s about to play a trick) comes close to being as memorable as the opening music. The rest of the scores are either gentle jazz tunes or generic rock music that’s designed for fight scenes in anime.I wouldn’t say I enjoyed Nanbaka in its entirety as some of the episodes were a chore to watch, often because of the obvious drama. The comedy grows less hilarious past the halfway point; it even loses its most popular running gag. The show was mostly enjoyable for its first few episodes and its flamboyant art style.

In late 2016, Satelight began airing an anime adaptation. You may remember them as the studio behind Heat Guy J & Sousei no Aquarion. So, how does this one compare to their other works I've reviewed? Let's take a gander.Story:Nanba is, supposedly, the world's most formidable prison. With the toughest guards, the most inescapable perimeter, the sparkliest design and the finest dining and recreation services. We follow four prisoners, Juugo, Uno, Rock & Nico, who have escaped from prisons all over the world as they go about their lives and...make trouble for the guards. Insert shenanigans here.The biggest issue with this series is that it attempts to blend zany, really over the top comedy, with some more serious back stories and an underlying plot about a certain character having serious enemies who may well pose a threat. This results in a pretty significant case of tonal clash. Then we have the humour itself. Honestly, it doesn't work a lot of the time. A lot of it is based around the characters being stupid or something over the top and random happening. I've talked about this before with a different less than good comedy, but randomness isn't funny. A good zany, absurd comedy will have some internal logic that will be largely consistent, being bent on rare occasions for a jape. Pure randomness is what you get when an eight year old tries to make up a joke. “So, a guy walks into a pub and asks the bartender for a pint. The bartender says, 'I can't serve you. I'm a cockatoo.' And the guy looks up and notices that he is.” And it's not funny but you give them a pity chuckle because they're eight. Problem is, this was written by an adult who should know better.That being said, some of the goofs based around characters acting like idiots are pretty funny. There are times when those get executed well. I'll give it credit on that, it does have some funny bits.Characters:The major inmates in this series can all be described very simply. They have a tragic back story and very little personality. Now, I have maintained that a comedy doesn't need deep, complex characters. It needs characters with strong dynamics who can play off of one another really well to deliver the laughter. However, the whole tragic back stories element and the more serious stuff the series tries to do arguably makes this a series that should have more complex characters. Even putting that aside, the character dynamics are pretty underwhelming and don't generally lead to good comedic moments. A lot of the side characters suffer from one joke syndrome. Take the Warden. Her joke is that she has a crush on Hajime, the guard in charge of our protagonists, and people misinterpret her intense gazes.Art:The art isn't very good, to put it nicely. While I will give it credit for having unique character designs, the backgrounds are pretty lazy. Additionally, Satelight made the perplexing decision to put everything in sparkle vision. I'm not kidding, the entire bloody anime is sparkly. Now, here's the thing. Sparkle vision can work when used in certain circumstances for comedic effect. Fullmetal Alchemist is a great example. However, putting everything in constant sparkle vision doesn't have any comedic effect. Instead, it just hurts your eyes.Sound:The cast in this is perfectly passable. I can't call them brilliant in this, or even good, but it's also one of those series where the acting can't make up for the lack of characterisation. The music was handled by Fujisawa Kenji and it's all right. Which may actually make it the strongest element of the series.Ho-yay:There's a bit. We have the gay stereotype character voiced by Kimeru. Juugo also mentions liking both guys and girls, and there are reasons to believe he was serious.Final Thoughts:Nanbaka is a pretty weak comedy. It suffers from tonal problems, humour that falls flat more often than not, constant sparkle vision and dull characters. That being said, it does have its funny moments and I can't really say it was bad. If you're a fan of randomness and comedy stemming from characters being morons, you might enjoy it. For me, the final rating is going to be a 4/10. Next week I'll look at Osomatsu-san, which will hopefully be a better class of comedy. make trouble for the guards.

The group dynamic was so fun to see and made me love all of the characters.

Lets start with the story: there are some convicts who are good at escaping from jail so they put them in a maximum security prison (all together of course, so that they can work as a team to escape whenever they want to). This idea has potential and if taken seriously it could have been worked into a great psychological thriller, so of course they did the exact opposite when making this show. It's so bright and colorful that there were moments where i thought I was on a bad...acid trip and was about as serious as the chances of a childhood friend in a rom-com, that is to say, not serious in the slightest. The art didn't want to make me actively bleach my eyes though so that's a plus. The songs were possibly the most vanilla songs I have ever heard in my life. In all honesty I was hoping that the characters would somehow die so that the series could end, I felt not an ounce of emotion for them. It was a mad dash to the third episode with this one watching it at 2 times speed so that it would be over faster. Overall, this anime was just a mess. Its like if Grand Blue wasn't funny at all, so essentially just a big heaping pile of nothing. acid trip and was about as serious as the chances of a childhood friend in a rom-com, that is to say, not serious in the slightest.

I was just in it for the laughs, but it got totally serious after the tournament arc, after which it dove head-first into hidden dark sides and tragic backstories galore. These were never BAD by any means, just kind of mediocre. This being the case, it was never so dull as to make it difficult for me to finish watching an episode, or several in a row. ', ""In a world where people are born with nail polish...Story:Nanbaka is a complete mess. First it starts as a slice-of-life comedy, then it shifts to action shounen, then to drama, then back to comedy and eventually back to drama. I have no idea what the creators were trying to do, but it sure as hell wasn't entertaining the least bit. The main story (if you wanna call it that) is shortly mentioned early on, then forgotten for a good while, then brought back again all of a sudden. Maybe the episode writers should've talked to each other at some point.1/10Art:The character design is a disaster....These guys are so flamboyant and feminine that it's ridiculous. And everything sparkles. Everything! This is what hell for the homophobic must look like. Animation is solid, the backgrounds look good, but I can't take my eyes off of these ladyboys.3/10Sound:The voice acting is good. Especially the chief warden sounds good, with her dual personality. Opening and ending were not very good however, especially the ending was more annoying than anything.6/10Characters:Most of them are incredibly boring. The chief warden and her assistant are somewhat funny, Hajime is also pretty cool. But that's about it. Especially the main characters feel very empty.4/10Enjoyment:You may have noticed that this review is pretty short, especially compared to my other recent ones. But there simply isn't much more for me to say about Nanbaka. It was boring most of the time, the storytelling was incoherent and most of the cast was completely uninteresting. It's not even been a week since I finished this anime and I have already forgotten most of it. If you ever feel the need to completely waste your time, feel free to give Nanbaka a shot.2/10Overall:3.2/10 These guys are so flamboyant and feminine that it's ridiculous. And everything sparkles.

Though, if you came here for a short show that will keep you entertained on times when you purely want to watch something simple, but just aren\'t into those moe-blobs or harem shows, then... nope, not that one either.Nanbaka offers you the typical gag-anime humor consisting of popular shounen anime ""special move"" exclamations and pointless comical moments in the middle of serious fights,...but then there is some drama that makes the show seem as it were trying to make the plot deeper, thus make it look like it doesn\'t know what kind of series it actually wants to be.The story is nothing special. Four young criminals with unpleasant pasts, known for always breaking out of every prison they\'re transferred to, end up in the world\'s most intimidating prison, where the story is set. That\'s pretty much the baseline, and while it wasn\'t that bad at all, the needless drama kicked in, and it ruined everything. Pointless overexaggerating drama, even though it could\'ve stayed a fun and lighthearted series without any drama whatsoever.The art is very nice and detailed, which I like a lot. Every single thing on a character, no matter how big or small, has a slight gradiation which makes the art look significantly more detailed. The animation seems pretty solid, as well. The colours are very bright and vivid; just what feels best for an action anime series. On the other hand, we always have those flashy stars around the character that seem kind of pointless. Also, all of the characters have these colourful characteristics, be it hair, eyes, clothes, or all of those together, and while it suits the carefree comedic side it had in the beginning, it quickly gives off the opposing effect when it has its identity crisis. Simply makes it look like a few rainbows fighting to death. Lovely.When it comes to sound, I didn\'t really notice anything astonishing during the actual show, but I do like the opening considerably. I might also add that the voices suit each character fairly well.The characters might be a little cliché at times, but overall they\'re aren\'t that bad... that is before it goes up the hill with the drama and they become impossible to relate to, or even just enjoy.Now, there are still quite a few flaws in this anime, so let me just mention those right now.For starters, the show is about 5 different individuals, the four inmates and their guard, so why is it that an episode ends with an intriguing cliffhanger and continues with an entire episode about the backstory of a character who barely even has any screen-time? In that case, a mere filler about just one of the main characters would\'ve been a lot more entertaining. Generally, the show often gives off this rushed feeling, as if they tried developing the story at the last second. Which leads to my next point, what we\'ve all been waiting for: The identity crisis. Typically, an action gag-anime has a lot of humor during fights and such moments, with slight drama here and there to add some spice, but here there\'s a supposedly serious fight, random humor all over the scene, and then suddenly everyone gets depressing. The anime proclaimed that it\'s a gag-anime during the show. It seems as though it just can\'t pick its mind on what it wants to be, a serious action drama show, or a comedic gag-anime. My guess is that it tries to be both, serious and funny, and balance that like other shows do, but it just seems to fail miserably. In my opinion, it would have been highly enjoyable without any drama, if it simply stayed the way it was in the first few episodes.The only audience I could imagine Nanbaka for, the way it ended up, is the audience that has just watched a few mainstream shows, and doesn\'t really care about that story. The audience who just wants some action, which action is kind of unappealing, as well, because it barely has any. but then there is some drama that makes the show seem as it were trying to make the plot deeper, thus make it look like it doesn\'t know what kind of series it actually wants to be.The story is nothing special.

The latter being the definition of this anime. I originally decided to watch it cause the character designs were interesting and as an aspiring character designer, I decided that I would give it a go and see what this show was really about.Story: 6Since this is a gag anime, usually the story isn't very serious or just has a basic scenario. However, similar to Katekyo Hitman Reborn ( originally a gag manga/anime that turned shounen after 20 eps), the story takes much darker turns here...and there, but never fully explores the darker parts of the story, as it always returns to the lighthearted comedy at some point. There are many questions left in the more dark parts of the story, so therefore the score is reasonable until S2.Character:7First thing I would say is that the character designs in this show are rather unique. Each character is distinct, outrageous and has their own personalities, which fits the show well. The downfall of this however, is that only the main 4 plus random side characters got actual plot stories plus some character development. So there's that. My main problem was the random side characters that got development even though they served no purpose to the main storyArt/Sound 10/9First of all, this anime is BRIGHT. Flashy colors, and literally, sparkles EVERYWHERE. it fits the atmosphere perfectly, as the comedy is just as outrageous as the colors of the animation. In the darker parts of the show, the colors still maintain some brightness, but are slightly muted. My only slight problem is that there were sparkles in the serious parts of the show, which kinda ruined the atmosphere of the scene. The music is only really noticeable during the serious parts, with some nice opera in the background. It does its job. The OP is definitely a favorite though.Overall: 7I actually enjoyed this show, and managed to binge watch all the episodes because I loved the outrageousness of it all. Despite the flaws it's still a nice show to watch for the comedy and the outrageousness of the characters.

I like most of the characters, although I pretty much hate hajime the guard, that bastard can go and die somewhere. I also dislike the female boss, she just can't stop being lovestruck all the time and it pisses me off, especially since I hate the one she likes.The story is so-so, kinda average, nothing special at all. The art is pretty nice, I like the style although the colors feels a bit too flamboyant. The sound is great, well, at least...the opening song, I was really fond of that one. The characters are nice in some ways, at the very least they feel kinda unique, but I feel like too much effort was put into making them too extreme, the author should learn some moderation, medicine in great quantities becomes poison, that concept applies to pretty much everything in this world. Too much is never a good idea(well, at least in normal circumstances). Overall, my enjoyment was pretty nice for most of the anime.What annoyed me the most here is that the author chose to screw up big time because he wants to put serious stuff and drama into the anime. It just DIDN'T work at all, it ruined the entire anime. Maybe I should've lowered my score even more, giving it a 7/10 is very generous considering the huge flaws. This show was never meant to be serious, at least it shouldn't have. The only good part is the comedy and interaction between the characters, but the decision to put drama, tragedy and whatever else into it as well and drag it out for WAY too long was a horrible one, utterly horrible. The real tragedy here is that they felt it was a good idea and thus murdered a show that could've been so much better.This is especially the case since I couldn't care less about these characters, I'm used to extreme tragedies after reading certain stuff and this shit can't even make me feel anything at all. If I wanted drama and tragedy, I wouldn't watch a screwed up anime like this. I would watch a proper serious anime or read a manga or novel like that. Putting stuff like that into a f*cked up anime like that? Come on. That's like putting a bloody beef into your sweet, creamy cake. Who would want to eat that crap then? It's incompatible, it's either one or the other. Changing styles suddenly is just bullsh*t and always ruins things. Not saying comedy and tragedy/drama is always incompatible, but when it's done like this, it indeed is.I saw that a lot of people say the second season is way worse and reduces the comedy a lot, well, I'll try to watch it and see if that's truly the case. If it is, I guess it's best to drop it fast because it's not worth watching. Well, to be fair, I guess that the manga version might actually be better.

How about a happy prisoners trying to escape a prison? Sounds unrealistic right? Well, of course!!! This anime tells us that situation. It has a happy go lucky vibe like Beelzebub and Assassination Classroom while you are watching this. This kinda reminded me of the Impel Down Arc of One Piece while watching the first episode.The comedy is very funny. Been laughing so hard. The art is amazing where it comes to the point that you can't tell a boy from a girl based from their appearance. The anime is action-packed and very entertaining to watch....The prisoners are funny as hell. The guards are badass, funny and powerful. You cannot predict what will happen next unless you will predict in your mind.Having seen both Seasons 1 and 2, all I can say this is a gold comedy and a very entertaining anime. Lots of parodies here. A MUST-WATCH if you want a good time.  Not convinced? There's a hidden dark story here as you go further.Can't wait for Season 3. The prisoners are funny as hell.

But what I didn't expect was how it so easily shifted from a comedic standpoint to a full-on serious, shounen-esk type of genre with actual high stakes without much effort. Not to mention, the serious story plot-points are actually really good in my opinion and it has a rather unique level of backstory for...each character and even has a few wholesome moments in them too.Character development is clearly there in terms for the protagonist and also the supporting cast. Like Rock for example, he was able to make amends with someone who's deemed to be his enemy/rival just by conveying his love for food and how it's changed him as a man. You don't get that type of wholesome moment in most anime nowadays.I simply can't praise this anime enough, not once did I ever feel bored after episodes: 3 - 13. If you have not watched this anime then I highly recommend it.TL;DR Nanbaka is an anime where it's about hardship and bonds built in a society that's known to be brutal and with sprinkles of wholesome moments and quite a bit of serious moments and questioning of one's self-motives and aspirations.Again, I must say that I highly recommend this anime. each character and even has a few wholesome moments in them too.Character development is clearly there in terms for the protagonist and also the supporting cast.

I was sometimes confused whether I was watching a comedy or a drama because it would break from comedy to have these large emotional dramatic scenes and then go back to its normal bouncy comedy.

The overall premise and layout was fun and enjoyable to watch. However the dramatic events that arise are really not that deep or extraordinary as some reviews have mentioned. Its those ""deep"" moments in the later part of the show that really kill the entire thing for me.The story revolves around 4 prisoners in the most secure and top secret prison in the world. These four prisoners are well known for escaping prisons, Juugo especially. What seems to start off as a comedy show about escaping,...and or making a home in this oddly comfortable super prison turns into a odd mix of mini stories. Each prisoner has some sort of semi tragic back story. However the main focus turns to Juugo as we discover a odd tangle of things involving modifications, super advanced technology, fantasy like super villains...etc.The art is strange but very colorful and fun. The soundtrack was enjoyable to listen to as well.The characters were a great mix. Juugo, the main character is only good at breaking out of prison. Nico is the otaku character who has the ability to steal peoples moves by observing them. Uno is the woman lover who is exceptional at cheating and has amazing intuition. Rock is the brawny guy who loves to fight, but more than anything loves food. Its a ragtag bunch and the first few episodes you watch as they attempt to escape, pick on the guards and make friends.Most of the characters are important and have their own back story. However most of the show revolves around the four prisoners.I enjoyed this show a good amount for the first half or so. It felt like a silly romp in an insane prison. However they derail that for some cheesy drama. The good news is the cheesy drama gets replaced with drama so game changing you are left thinking ""Wasn\'t this a show about 4 jail breakers trying to escape the worlds most impressive prison"". The deep moments everyone is yammering on about is nothing more than friendship, finding a home, and ""tragic pasts""...the usual stuff. The friendship and finding a home elements get destroyed along side the comedy. The tragic pasts are poorly written drama fodder.This show was like a small get together with a handful of friends. Its enjoyable, things are going alright, your having fun but you wouldn\'t mind being somewhere else. Then all of a sudden the person who had two mikes hard lemonades drunkenly stands up and begins spilling everyone\'s secrets. After a few well chosen swear words and some shouting they begin pissing on all of the snacks. They didn\'t spill any of your secrets so your not angry, but you had been eyeing that chocolate cake all evening. You wanted it, but it was clearly the last piece and you didn\'t want to be that guy. Now its being pissed on and the only thing you can think is ""damn, I really wanted that cake"". You look around to see how everyone else feels about the cake being ruined and they are all cheering him on. You look back at the cake confused and somewhat sad before you leave out into the world where you will find another cake or perhaps some Wendy\'s.TLDR: Decent start, poor and shallow ending(cliffhanger).

Art and soundtrack pretty good.', 'Overall: 4/10Nanbaka had vast potential as a pure comedy anime. The animation and characters were stellar, and all the anime needed to do in order for this to be a hilarious and entertaining watch was to follow the everyday life of these guys and observe how they interact with each other. But whoever is responsible for writing this managed to screw that up. By the end of the season, I felt as disappointed as I\'ve ever been by an anime, which says something considering I\'ve seen Gantz.Story: 1/10Watching this anime, I got the feeling that whoever wrote the material thought it was critically necessary to...add some degree of a serious plot in order to make a good anime. The plot shows up about halfway through the season, and shatters everything that was good about the anime up until that point. The first six episodes were funny, lighthearted, and pure. There wasn\'t any plot to speak of, just a series of minor arcs unrelated to any kind of bigger picture, and that was just what this anime needed. Then, all of a sudden, the most forced plot I\'ve ever seen came up out of nowhere and dragged the mood, experience, and humor down to rock bottom. It ran completely against everything that had made this anime great, stomped it out and took it over. Even putting that aside, it was just a terrible plot. It didn\'t make any sense, and just felt fake and forced, as if it was only there to fulfill some sort of requirement.Art: 8/10The art style of this anime was unique, vibrant and quirky, matching the characters and setting perfectly. Everything was crazy brightly colored, the characters were all given flamboyant styles to match their personalities, and every line drawn was crisp and sharp. The characteristic style of this anime, in which the foreground objects (characters and the bare minimum of props) were isolated from the rest of the setting and drawn against a conspicuously colorful patterned backdrop, was used to great effect in most scenes where two characters were interacting with each other, highlighting the action and accentuating the comedy. Normally, this would merit a 9/10 score from me, but the art stopped matching the mood when the plot kicked in.Sound: 5/10The soundtrack in general was pretty average. I took off one point because there was at least one scene where the music did clash with the atmosphere and detract from the experience. However, I really liked the outro, which is worth about half a point to me, and I partially counted the announcer-guy as a component of the soundtrack, who added another half point to bring the score back to average.Character: 7/10Aside from Jyugo and the other characters related to the ""plot"", every character in this anime is amazing. They all have very distinct, very flamboyant personalities, that show so prominently that none of them really needed any backstory or specially dedicated screentime in order for the viewer to understand them thoroughly. They complement each other perfectly, and the natural interactions between these eccentric people would have been more than enough to make for a thoroughly entertaining watch without any semblance of a story whatsoever. Like with the art, this would normally elicit a 9/10 from me, but I have to take one point off for Jyugo\'s forced backstory and another point off for the rushed introductions of the other prisoners in the first couple episodes.Enjoyment: 2/10By the second episode, I was cautiously optimistic for this anime. By the fifth episode, I was having a blast watching this. But once episode 7 rolled around, it dove downhill fast. I think I\'ve already addressed why in the overall and story sections. The feeling of utter disappointment by the end almost completely drowns out any enjoyment I had earlier on, but I will give it one point above rock bottom. add some degree of a serious plot in order to make a good anime. The plot shows up about halfway through the season, and shatters everything that was good about the anime up until that point. The first six episodes were funny, lighthearted, and pure. There wasn\'t any plot to speak of, just a series of minor arcs unrelated to any kind of bigger picture, and that was just what this anime needed. Then, all of a sudden, the most forced plot I\'ve ever seen came up out of nowhere and dragged the mood, experience, and humor down to rock bottom. It ran completely against everything that had made this anime great, stomped it out and took it over. Even putting that aside, it was just a terrible plot. It didn\'t make any sense, and just felt fake and forced, as if it was only there to fulfill some sort of requirement.Art: 8/10The art style of this anime was unique, vibrant and quirky, matching the characters and setting perfectly.

Nanbaka's comedy was barely noticeable, and even if it was there, it wasn't really funny. But personally, the action and drama parts were better written than the comedy.The story is mainly as the synopsis says. There's no story progression as such, and there's just a tournament arc filled with games at the beginning, mostly games where comedy can be introduced in. The action part was also mixed in there, the fights were well done, and the flashy artstyle did not interfere. The comedy part was mainly in the first half of...the series, with some decent jokes, did not make me cringe, made me grin twice overall, was fairly enjoyable, so I'll take it; it was above average. The second half introduces character backstories, but they were really interesting to see. Tsukumo with his road to discover himself, Juugo and Musashi's story concerning the shackles, and how Juugo united the prisoners of Cell 13. The comedy became secondary here, but the backstories were more interesting than the comedy, so I did not have much complaints. Overall, a solid story.The artstyle is seen to be flashy from the wallpaper itself, which is a feature of this anime. It looked good but it was excessive, even though I can understand that the manga used this style too, so props to Satelight for duplicating it and enhancing the character designs. Soundtracks were noticeable too and fit the scenarios, but I wouldn't call them memorable.I really liked the chemistry between the characters, and Hajime was a badass and Seki Tomokazu just made him look even cooler. Juugo was the most explored character, the others needed more focus but they were supportive of each other and that was nice to see. Even Musashi is great to see as he rebels against the person who ruined his life.All in all, I would recommend Nanbaka, but not really for its comedy, unless I'm just not the type to watch this kind of comedy, since others seem to laugh at this. the series, with some decent jokes, did not make me cringe, made me grin twice overall, was fairly enjoyable, so I'll take it; it was above average.

It took me a bit to get used to the art style-- almost every character had 2 tone hair and tattoos. But once you settle in, you might think the MC and/or his prison guard are quite attractive. (Male viewers- may I suggest you look to the female prison warden.)I was expecting a story to make me laugh and that...it does. However, as the story goes on there is a complexity and sadness to it. If you have ever found yourself feeling sorry for a villain then this anime is for you. The story touches on mental health in a way that I think most people can relate to.The only reason I didn't give this one a 10 is because I think some of the art choices don't make sense--- such as one prisoner who wears a ball and chain shackle when no one else in the same prison does (and with no explanation why he would need that--- yes, I am picky). it does.

The same can be said for the characters because almost everyone has a very elaborate hair style or colour and it can be pretty distracting at times.Now the show does start off with Comedy and it really starts off strong because most of the stuff that happened during the first 3 episodes was pretty damn funny and then it turns into action at the halfway point which was the New Year Tournament and for a tournament or challenge type episode (or episodes) it was seeing how powerful the characters were and made you think that messing around with them is not the best idea.Overall I think this was a fun and colourful show if you're looking for funny characters and a surprising story then you might actually enjoy this anime. find out more about some of the inmates who have their own secrets.It was also fun seeing the attics that the inmates get up to so they can annoy the guards who also have their own problems with each other.There was a few sections that really stood out for me like the new year tournament and pretty much the second half where the situation goes from comedy and action to dark thriller which was a unexpected twist of events.I thought the characters were very likeable and usually I don't watch a lot of anime's that mainly focus on male characters since pretty much all the Inmates and Guards are dudes apart from one character.The main Inmates are Juugo, Uno, Nico and Rock who for a band of prisoners work so well together they have good chemistry and are really funny plus they care for each other too since all they have is each other.Juugo is pretty much the most interesting character since he has a dark backstory and has a secret ability that is shown later in the series, but is someone you will fell sorry for since he didn't have a choice in the matter.The other inmates Uno, Nico and Rock are also fun characters since each of them have specific feature that makes them stand out like for example Uno is a womaniser, Nico is a huge anime/manga fan and Rock just loves to eat food now even though these are pretty big cliches in the anime world these characters fit those personas really well and it keeps the show going for me.The Guard characters are also fun too because even though they are OP when fighting the prisoners and each other they actually do get some development and you go from seeing them as just adversaries for the prisoners to well rounded characters.I also have to say there is a lot of trap characters like as of the end of the series there is probably 3 or 4 of them and that would catch a lot of guys off guard.One thing I can definitely say about the Artstyle is that it is very colourful and sparkly yet for some reason it fits mainly because of the fun nature of the show and it's characters and it still somehow works when there is a serious moment going on I mean there is probably every colour of the Rainbow throughout the show.

I’d even go so far as to put it in my all-time favourite top three. It’s a rollercoaster ride that takes you from comedy to drama to mystery, and grips you from start to finish. The story is at times so ridiculously comical that it’s obviously a parody of the genre, and at other times so deep and heart-wrenching that you’ll wonder if you’re even watching the same anime as moments before.That’s not to mention the sheer fabulousness of all the characters, and the setting. Steer far away from...this if you don’t like sparkles, because Nanbaka does not stop sparkling. Ever. Even at the climax of the story each character is surrounded by glitter and bright colours. Some people won’t like the stark contrast between the content and the setting, but I think it summed up the tone of Nanbaka perfectly. The series isn’t meant to be realistic, even though the characters are some of the most relatable I’ve seen in anime. The entire show is a parody, and the fact that it can be both satirical and emotional at the same time – successfully – just shows me how brilliantly it was done.The story starts off as a lot of nonsensical fun; a bunch of wacky inmates who constantly try to escape from the most secure prison in the world. This is an arc that’s purely comedy, you’re introduced to the characters and the setting, and get a taste of their daily life. The type of comedy is something I would describe as similar to Gintama or Nichijou, it’s very self-aware and basically just random. There are a lot of references, the gag humour is hilarious, and there’s a lot of witty dry humour too. It caters to most areas of comedy at one point or another (although it doesn’t tend to be crude). It’s awesome if you like that kind of thing.The second arc veers off topic slightly, dealing with special events in the prison. The tone starts off similar to the first – very heavy focus on pure comedy - but shifts near the end and becomes altogether more serious.This leads into the third arc, which is a masterful depiction of the main character’s mental state. There’s some amazing character development in this arc, and it’s what cemented this anime as a favourite for me. Sure, it’s very different to the previous arcs, but the shift was actually needed at about this time – it’s just when the audience starts to get tired of the endless humour and want a more fleshed-out story. The mystery element was also expanded on here, and was quite frankly unusual and really intriguing. It provided an understandable explanation of the MC’s reasons for his actions, and served another purpose in that it allowed for some meaningful interactions between the inmates and the guards which added more depth to all their characters and the story.Almost all of the characters are good. And I don’t mean that in like a ‘righteous’ kind of way. I mean that they’re done really well. Each and every character has some sort of ridiculous but memorable design and quirk, which makes watching them really fun and ensures you don’t constantly have to check who’s who by referring to previous episodes. Minor characters get development that can change your whole view of them, each challenge plays a major part in understanding or developing a character, and no one is introduced and then never seen again.Juugo, Nico, Uno and Hajime felt like real people, despite how exaggerated their characters were. The way they cared about each other was strangely relatable, and very touching to watch. The concept of family was presented beautifully. Forget Fairy Tail and the power of Nakama, this anime shows how a group of misfits can become family in an incredibly heart-warming way which somehow still seems realistic. (Odd, considering that it’s meant to be a parody and all, but that’s part of what was nice about it.)The art is…flashy. All the characters have these elaborate multicoloured hairstyles, long painted nails and weird eye colours. If you can get used to that, or find it entertaining, you’ll enjoy the anime much more, because bear in mind the art is a big part of this anime. It’s a part of the anime’s identity – Nanbaka wouldn’t be Nanbaka without the art.The animation is captivating, particularly around the action scenes, and the sound is superb. I absolutely loved the opening, ending, seiyuus, and sound effects. They added so much to the anime.Okay, hold up. So I’m aware that I haven’t been strictly objective. It’s hard to remain unbiased in a review when I actually love the show so much. So now I’ll try and list a few of the things the anime could have done better in, for the sake of being fair.•\tRock really needed some more development; all the other characters were explored beyond their basic hobbies but he stayed a one-dimensional foodie to the end.•\tThe mood shifts – I personally liked this but it could be confusing at times, and the heavy parts were a big leap from the comedy it proclaimed itself to be. The sparkles also really shouldn’t have been in at the more emotional points.•\tThe warden’s crush was irritating after a while, too much time was spent on it without any progress.•\tThere were a lot of unanswered questions at the end (although there is a second season which I’m assuming resolves this).So, what do I think about Nanbaka?It’s wacky. It’s zany. It’s sparkly. It’s utterly ridiculous at some points, and deep and thought-provoking at others. It will make you chuckle, snort, laugh and show other expressions of joy. It might also make you smile sadly, clutch your heart and wipe away a tear or two (although the last is unlikely).Overall, it’s a reminder of why anime is a medium unto itself; for better or for worse. Where else would you find something like this? I can’t recommend it highly enough. XDNB: Obviously, I’m talking to fans of comedy and the like here. Don’t come hear looking for a realistic slice-of-life, romance or thriller. Duh. 😊 this if you don’t like sparkles, because Nanbaka does not stop sparkling. Ever.

Duh. 😊', ""The creators of Nanbaka looked like they didn't know where they wanted the show wanted to go, the story line went from lighthearted to serious and back to light-hearted before you even know it.Art:I absolutely loved the bright colors throughout the show. My only concern is the sparkles that float around throughout the show. These sparkles added a fun touch but when the series got more serious, these sparkles were out of place and took a toll on the dramatic effect.Sound:I'm not a huge critic on voice acting but I can say that it sounded pretty good to me :3I LOVED the opening and...ending songs, both are catchy and memorable. I never skipped the opening/ending when it came up like I do for most other shows.Character:Each character is memorable and has a unique personality.

Is Nanbaka one full season, or is there two seasons. Because Crunchyroll advertised it as one season with 25 episodes while Myanimelist treated it as two separate seasons. Either way, as of this review I will be reviewing Nanbaka based on the 25 episodes that I watched. And by god, what a load of crap this was in the end. You know if I ever had to make a comparison to Nanbaka, I would compare it to the Sonic The Hedgehog franchise. It was praised at birth, went through a horrible phase at one point, became good again...and then turned into absolute shit yet again. I got the impression that this was a comedy, however when you search for Nanbaka under the comedy section in Crunchyroll, it doesn\'t appear. So what is this anime? Is it actually a comedy? The show states multiple times that it is a comedy, but most episodes had more action than comedy inserted. Even then, I didn\'t particularly enjoy Nanabaka when it was an action adventure, it worked better as a comedy and thats the way it should\'ve stayed! That\'s what Nanbaka shines at the most if you ask me, its the comedy. Around 75%, the jokes that were presented to me made laugh and giggle and it matched with the tone of the anime. For the most part. I love it when the characters break the fourth wall and when the art style changes to a more cutie approach. Something I haven\'t really seen from any anime that Ive watched at this moment. But Im sorry to say, this is all the good things I have to say about this anime. So here are my negatives.Whats the story of this anime again? I didn\'t even think there was a story in the first half of Nanbaka. It was more or less an insight as to what the inmates got up to in there daily lives at Nanba. The main prisoners get forced into a tournament with the Nanba guards, so for around five episodes the prisoners are trying to compete against each other. You may be asking yourself, why is a prison holding a tournament when they should be cleaning up the lavatories or at least mowing the lawns. You can ask yourself that, but Im afraid you won\'t get a definitive answer. There were times during this show where I legitimately asked myself ""Hey is this even a prison?"". It sure doesn\'t feel like one sometimes. After a certain point in the tournament, the main character Juyugo gets into a little fight with Musashi as they had some previous rivalry in the past. However this little fight turns into what I can only say feels like a Pokemon battle. Musashi becomes Charizard and starts shooting fire balls and Juygo evolves into Heracross and grows these giant swords from his arms. When this scene occurred, I was so bewildered. It nearly turned me off from watching any more episodes, because the show was trying to be something that it clearly was not meant to be in the first place. I get that the show is not meant to be taking itself seriously, but i thought this was a show about normal prisoners trying to escape prison. But no, they can perform hadokens and weird anime shit. The next few episodes after that are filler until the 13th episode where things start to get interesting which then ultimately leads onto the second half. So if you didn\'t like the first half, then I think your asking a lot of yourself to go ahead and watch the second half.Thankfully the second half is better, but not by that much. There is more of a story, not that its climatic or anything. But like the first half we get filler that adds nothing to the story and characters that get introduced and are never bought up again. Ontop of that the main villain in the second half does absolutely NOTHING!!! He more or less stands around saying that he\'s going to kill off Juyugo but does nothing about it. We get four episodes dedicated to fighting the same guard who can\'t seem to understand how to fucking die. Btw that Prison guard would make a great Kitana skin in Mortal Kombat X. These episodes are clearly filler and there is obviously no structure to the story whatsoever. The second arc doesn\'t even bloody finish, it leaves you on a cliffhanger hoping that you wait another year to watch the 3rd half. And i thought people complained about Mob Psycho 100s ending.I struggled to find any connection with the cast members. I don\'t know why I should care for Juygo, Uno, Rock and Nico at the end of the day because they are prisoners. Even so, they are nice prisoners which makes you wonder why they were put in prison in the first place. I was really looking forward to seeing the character interaction between the main prisoners, but they get split up most of the time in later episodes, so I was really disappointed in the end. Its really hard to actually understand there motivations and goals, because aside from Juyugo, the other prisoners have already met their goals despite how childish they may seem. Juyugo doesn\'t even know what he wants in life, so thats a massive problem which doesn\'t get expanded upon. Moving onto Haijme, he\'s the character I actually got the most enjoyment out of. Mainly because he\'s just a big bully that doesn\'t want his workload to increase, and along with supporting character Seitarou, I got the most laughs from both of these characters. There is more character interaction between the prison guards rather than the inmates.Lets move onto the art style! Now this anime is colorful and the crazy character designs are absolutely gorgeous. But Nanbaka is set in a prison after all and aside from Haijme and then four main prisoners, none of the cast members actually look like they belong in a prison let alone work for one. But the biggest offence that I found from the art style was the backgrounds. On more than a couple of occasions you\'ll be looking at backgrounds that look like they could\'ve been made in Photoshop. Orange triangles, pink and white polka dots and blue and purple zigzags, and you see this more than the prisons architect itself. Which is a shame because the Prison Nanba is beautiful to look at. However when your not looking at these colourful backgrounds, your mainly limited to grey and boring prison cells. When you boil it down, it looks like to me that this was a budgeted decison. Did I also mention about how unimportant cast members just get turned into blue and lifeless stick figures? Whats up with that?The music wasn\'t really memorable either. Rin Rin Hi Hi was the only decent track that I got some enjoyment out of. However when you watch the second half of the show, the band who sings the song sound like they snorted a bag of cocaine and then sung the song again. Except this time, it sounds like utter shit.In short I refer to the quote that I made back at the very beginning. But Nanbaka is just like Sonic The Hedgehog at the end of the day. An anime that I was honestly interested to see left me with a feeling that I didn\'t get with other anime such as Mob Psycho 100 or Gurren Lagann. You know what, go watch that instead because its consistently funny and those shows establish itself as a action and a comedy from the beginning. Nanbaka starts off as a comedy then turns into an action midway. Like Twin Star Exorcists, the show has a hard time trying to understand what it wants to be. Don\'t watch this anime, if you want to go and watch a couple of episodes go ahead. But take my word for it, this is nothing special by any means. and then turned into absolute shit yet again. I got the impression that this was a comedy, however when you search for Nanbaka under the comedy section in Crunchyroll, it doesn\'t appear. So what is this anime? Is it actually a comedy? The show states multiple times that it is a comedy, but most episodes had more action than comedy inserted. Even then, I didn\'t particularly enjoy Nanabaka when it was an action adventure, it worked better as a comedy and thats the way it should\'ve stayed! That\'s what Nanbaka shines at the most if you ask me, its the comedy. Around 75%, the jokes that were presented to me made laugh and giggle and it matched with the tone of the anime. For the most part. I love it when the characters break the fourth wall and when the art style changes to a more cutie approach. Something I haven\'t really seen from any anime that Ive watched at this moment. But Im sorry to say, this is all the good things I have to say about this anime. So here are my negatives.Whats the story of this anime again? I didn\'t even think there was a story in the first half of Nanbaka. It was more or less an insight as to what the inmates got up to in there daily lives at Nanba. The main prisoners get forced into a tournament with the Nanba guards, so for around five episodes the prisoners are trying to compete against each other. You may be asking yourself, why is a prison holding a tournament when they should be cleaning up the lavatories or at least mowing the lawns. You can ask yourself that, but Im afraid you won\'t get a definitive answer. There were times during this show where I legitimately asked myself ""Hey is this even a prison?"". It sure doesn\'t feel like one sometimes. After a certain point in the tournament, the main character Juyugo gets into a little fight with Musashi as they had some previous rivalry in the past. However this little fight turns into what I can only say feels like a Pokemon battle. Musashi becomes Charizard and starts shooting fire balls and Juygo evolves into Heracross and grows these giant swords from his arms. When this scene occurred, I was so bewildered. It nearly turned me off from watching any more episodes, because the show was trying to be something that it clearly was not meant to be in the first place. I get that the show is not meant to be taking itself seriously, but i thought this was a show about normal prisoners trying to escape prison. But no, they can perform hadokens and weird anime shit. The next few episodes after that are filler until the 13th episode where things start to get interesting which then ultimately leads onto the second half. So if you didn\'t like the first half, then I think your asking a lot of yourself to go ahead and watch the second half.Thankfully the second half is better, but not by that much. There is more of a story, not that its climatic or anything. But like the first half we get filler that adds nothing to the story and characters that get introduced and are never bought up again. Ontop of that the main villain in the second half does absolutely NOTHING!!! He more or less stands around saying that he\'s going to kill off Juyugo but does nothing about it. We get four episodes dedicated to fighting the same guard who can\'t seem to understand how to fucking die. Btw that Prison guard would make a great Kitana skin in Mortal Kombat X. These episodes are clearly filler and there is obviously no structure to the story whatsoever. The second arc doesn\'t even bloody finish, it leaves you on a cliffhanger hoping that you wait another year to watch the 3rd half. And i thought people complained about Mob Psycho 100s ending.I struggled to find any connection with the cast members. I don\'t know why I should care for Juygo, Uno, Rock and Nico at the end of the day because they are prisoners. Even so, they are nice prisoners which makes you wonder why they were put in prison in the first place. I was really looking forward to seeing the character interaction between the main prisoners, but they get split up most of the time in later episodes, so I was really disappointed in the end. Its really hard to actually understand there motivations and goals, because aside from Juyugo, the other prisoners have already met their goals despite how childish they may seem. Juyugo doesn\'t even know what he wants in life, so thats a massive problem which doesn\'t get expanded upon. Moving onto Haijme, he\'s the character I actually got the most enjoyment out of. Mainly because he\'s just a big bully that doesn\'t want his workload to increase, and along with supporting character Seitarou, I got the most laughs from both of these characters. There is more character interaction between the prison guards rather than the inmates.Lets move onto the art style! Now this anime is colorful and the crazy character designs are absolutely gorgeous.

Let me explain: I love chocolate, and I love steak, but if you tell me you\'re gonna give me one thing, but I get the other, I\'ll still be disappointed. This is what Nanbaka did. I went in, having finished the first few episodes, being promised sweet comedy chocolate. I was primed to laugh at the goofy antics of Jyugo and crew, as they lay in a maximum security prison for petty crimes. And you know what? They accomplished what I thought they set out to do. The first few episodes may be...some of my favorites from anime. The humor just resonated with me! It was goofy, witty, and most importantly, didn\'t take itself too seriously. Imagine my surprise when the main course was brought out. Lifting up the lid of the first half of the series, I found not my delicious chocolate comedy, but a battle-scarred, overly serious shounen steak. I was shocked but still resilient. With a sigh, I dug in. ""I will enjoy this anime."" That was my mantra, episode after episode. I kept thinking, ""If I just get far enough in, it\'ll go back to being what I want."" It didn\'t though. It was a show full of men with neon hair, covered in body glitter, pretending they were in the most serious of situations. It was painful, like watching a clown in a fist fight, the crowd yelling, ""You\'ll just hurt yourself! Go back to what you do well!"" I have to admit, though. It drew me in in the last episode or so. I was genuinely concerned for the characters, invested in the plot. For a minute, I forgot its betrayal. I flipped to the next season, having finished season 1, ready for more. The next episode was a slap in the face. The title? ""Nanbaka is a comedy anime"". The content? Mediocre. I was done. I AM done. Season one is the end of my life with Nanbaka. So ends the days where I would sit down every Tuesday, just to have a laugh. Truth be told, those days ended long ago. I didn\'t enjoy this anime, but in truth, I hope you can. This was my first review, and I hope it wasn\'t horrible... Anyways, if you\'ve come this far, I give you my sincere thanks. Have a great day! some of my favorites from anime. The humor just resonated with me! It was goofy, witty, and most importantly, didn\'t take itself too seriously.

No. Can it be entertaining? Yes.Is this a comedy anime?Yes, but it gets turned into an action comedy anime in it's out of place tournament arc.Also, be sure to take a shower, as fter watching this, you might have some glitter on you, because EVERYONE'S SPARKLING!Side note, if there is no sparkles, it's no longer a comedy anime F.Y.I.Give it a shot, it might tickle your fancy. "", 'I first watched Nanbaka due to having been nagged into doing so by my younger sister, who loved the series. After finishing it and reading a good portion of the manga, I can say with confidence that I am very glad I finished it - in fact, it\'s by far one of my favourite anime. So why only a six? I do try to be honest with my reviews so, despite how much I enjoyed the show, I am well aware of its flaws and I can understand why they might ruin the viewer\'s enjoyment slightly. With that being said, I\'ll try my best to...write a spoiler-free review with as little bias as possible.STORY""Colourful, sparkly inmates have fun trying to escape from an equally colourful, sparkly prison. Shenanigans ensue""; - Thomas Sanders, Real or Fake Anime?Set in a prison, I went in to Nanbaka expecting to find an emotional and thought-provoking story detailing the inmates\' journey to rehabilitation and redemption. I quickly realised that I was wrong, though I should probably have known better given that the genre is ""action comedy"". The story features four particular inmates in their day-to-day life in a particularly high-security prison, where their antics make for, in my own opinion, some excellent comedy. In many episodes I was laughing the whole way through, so I can safely say they succeeded in the comedy element. However, the plot switched from comedic and lighthearted to morbid and intense back to lighthearted again very quickly to the point where the self-aware narrator has to remind the audience that they\'re watching a comedy. While this didn\'t bother me too much, I can see why it would others and make the plot difficult to follow. (The manga in particular got rather confusing for me - I had to keep going back and re-reading sections.) While comedy seems to be the main focus there is a small theme of redemption running throughout the show.STORY - 7/10ARTRemember the adjectives ""colourful"" and ""sparkly""? Yeah, that\'s about it. Each character is designed with extravagant hairstyles and colour palettes, and the backgrounds are particularly bright and somewhat eye-bleeding. While this can enhance the comedy acts, the sparkles can take away from the seriousness of certain fight scenes and the bright backgrounds and colourful characters are somewhat inappropriate for the setting of a formidable prison. However, it\'s certainly fun to draw if nothing else.ART: 6/10SOUNDFirst of all, I loved the opening theme. I preferred the one in the first season to the second due to them being performed by different artists, but both where satisfyingly catchy which made it hard to skip. Another aspect of sound I noticed was the way it changed in the mid-point screen depending on how intense the episode was, which certainly had the right effect. In terms of soundtrack, while I wouldn\'t listen to it independently it did enhance certain fight scenes and drama, even if it wasn\'t particularity memorable.SOUND: 7/10CHARACTERColourful sparkliness aside, I loved the characters. Many reviewers have commented on them being two-dimensional at times and I do get that (like I said, I\'m really not biased), but I love them nonetheless. They all have prominent, unique traits that caused them to be comedic and memorable to me - the phrase ""precious cinnamon roll"" comes to mind when describing a good 90% of them, though in various different ways. Small amounts of character development is present, though the manga goes into a lot more depth with them. An important thing to note is that they are all morally grey, with convicted criminals who show kindness and friendliness and professional guards who commit questionable acts at times. (Course, it could just be me as a character development lover overthinking things but let\'s not go there.) Character development potential is visible, but not explored as well as it could be which mildly frustrates me. There\'s also diversity among the cast, with characters from various nations such as the protagonist Jyguo\'s British and American cellmates, though their nationalities don\'t come across in their voice acting.CHARACTER: 7/10ENJOYMENTThis is where I\'m gonna stop being non-biased.

That’s just because crunchyroll decided to continue the season, the season was still meant to end at the 13th episode though.Story: 8 out of 10.I rated it this because the overall story is pretty good. Nanbaka's plot had me hooked from the moment I saw those four idiots try to escape nanbaka prison. Nanbaka had a lot of action and I laughed at least three times during every episode. Though the plot was sometimes very random and I had trouble following it, I...found the story very endearing and good. I expected it to be a comedy anime (which it was) but it’s also a slice of life and action anime, in my opinion.I liked that all of the characters (most of them) were able to have backstories. Backstories made them all feel less randomly dropped in the story and explained why they were there. Still, as I already mentioned, there were still some parts where I had to go back to the previous chapter because I couldn't understand what was happening. I did eventually get what was happening enough to continue watching the anime but me being confused with what was happening temporarily  is why I couldn't rate it a 10. It was still a good, creative story.Art (8/10): The art was okay. It wasn't outstanding but it was fine and I could watch the anime without cringing at it. The characters all looked very different and I liked how many colors they used on each character. I didn't understand why all of the characters were glowing but I didn't mind. They're fabulous so they deserve to glow...Sound 9/10: I can't judge sound very well because I don't usually listen to anime openings or anything like that but I enjoyed the songs in nanbaka. I thought they were really fun and were not at all boring to listen to. As for the english dub... I actually didn't mind it. People complain about it but it's actually one of the better anime concerning english dub. I could do without the warden’s high-pitched voice, though.character (9/10): I really loved the characters in nanbaka. The main characters and some of the side characters have really well character development and backstories. I can also relate to most of them, so that's a bonus. I didn't really get to see much of the prisoner’s in building 13’s background, only snippets, in the first season but I think/hope I'll learn more about them in the second season. They all seemed like a family and I loved that they were able to have that bond.Jyugo: Jyugo is practically my child, I love him so much. I wasn't very attached to him in the beginning of the series but, after hearing his backstory, I got very attached to him and now I just want the best for him. I love his character development and he reminds me a bit about myself. He's a character you can relate to in a way or another. He deserves to be the main character and it is shown how he unites all of his friends in the later episodes in the season.Uno: the classic gambler. I mostly paid attention to him because I ship him with Jyugo but now I just love him for him. I liked his cheery attitude and 'pretty boy' face haha. Actually, every main character but Jyugo had a very cheery attitude (something I love, ironic cause they're prisoners). He's kind of a 'tough love' guy and I love that. He pretends he doesn't care about others (*cough* Jyugo) but he really does and it's cute.Rock: I love Rock, alright? He’s really kind-hearted and upbeat. His love for food is definitely very relatable. It's nice to see an anime character appreciate how nice anime food is. He's one of my favorite characters but I also love all of the other inmates to death. He’s also really kind-hearted and an overall great character.Nico: I loved Nico from the start. Who couldn't? Nico is just soooo lovable. I used to think he was a girl but it was made very clear that he was a male a BOY and not not not a girl. I wish he was a real person so I could give him a big hug and rant to him about anime and manga. He is the best otaku (ironic but great) and his english voice actor totally fits how I imagined he'd sound so that's also great. He's so precious and I hope he never grows up.Hajime: He definitely is a top notch guard. I have a kind of biased grudge on him because of a SPOILER but he isn't heartless.Momoko: To be honest, I found her really annoying. She must be the only character I kinda really hate. All she did was fawn over Hajime in this really high pitched voice. She is one of the only female characters in nanbaka and I thought she could’ve had so much more potential then how she was used. Whenever she comes to the screen I kind of cringe...Enjoyment (10/10): Nanbaka is an amazing anime and I will most likely watch and like the second season. It made me laugh a LOT, at least three times each episode, and it surprised me by making me nearly cry. It’s a really touching show and I love nearly everything about it.Overall (9/10): Season one was really good and it had a great finale. Nanbaka is a really GOOD anime show and I highly recommend it to whoever. GO WATCH IT!!! found the story very endearing and good.

GO WATCH IT!!!"", 'Sho Futamata\'s story NANBAKA tells the tale of Nanba Prison, considered the most unbreakable facility in the world. This prison is populated by a host of colorful characters, both the prisoners that have been contained there and the warders who are employed to contain them. Each of these residents have their own distinct history,The animation is beautiful to see, and the characters are pretty and interesting with enough character depth to gain interest. Also, there are some numerical jokes in the story (for instance, Nanba means ""number"") that give the story a clever touch.However, one major problem the series suffers from is too slow writing....The first season had decent pacing and was enjoyable, but the second season drags on for too long. The manga comic has already moved on beyond what the show brings up, and if a third season will ever be made it\'s going to need major effort to be brought up to date with the events of the manga.It\'d be a fascinating tale with an equally fascinating cast, if it wasn\'t imprisoned by too slow writing.

The bright and vibrant colours used for the show really emphasise the lighthearted fun nature of the show, the fact that everything sparkles is immensely comical and I still find great amusement in that simple fact at the end I never think it gets old. Secondly the art contrasts with the setting to allows the shows tonal shifts to not feel jarring.Characters. The Characters a the single best thing about the show, I believe that all of the supporting cast in this show...can stand toe to toe with a most protagonists in other anime.

Well, let me explain. A Mimimi AMV on youtube. I really liked the art style, but I only watched about 30 seconds of it, because I didn't want to look at that many spoilers. It looked like quite the enjoyable comedy anime, which it was for about...6 episodes or so? 8? I don't know. But at one point in the series it went from this: :OTo this: :/That was because of the (to me) cliche dialogues which hardcore roleplayers would die for, and the lack of comedy. There was a gag here...and there, but that was it. I litteraly no other comments about this anime, because the first half were worth an 8 or even a 9. and there, but that was it.

The biggest positive is without a doubt the style of the show.  The ""content"" itself is just ok.I love the way everything looks in this show.  All of the character designs are super distinct.  This makes a huge difference for me, as theres nothing more I hate then trying to figure out which high school girl is which by the color of their hair alone.  These guys are vastly different heights and sizes, with transitional hair, different teeth styles, uniforms, eyes, number placements, accessories, etc....Its undoubtedly the best part of the show.  So if youre interested, just google search the characters and if you think they look cool, then watch it.The comedy part of Nanbaka is fine.  I was never rolling on the ground, but some of the jokes were pretty good.

This anime actually has a storyline and has some character development. The only one that actually gets good character development (or any development) is the main character Jyugo.

Nothing kept me watching aside from my own completionist desires.', '(SPOILER-FREE Review)Nanbaka is an anime that is, from start to end, in search of identity and purpose. Since it lacks a single identity, purpose and any focus at all, it adopts multiple ones arbitrarily. I am all for multi-genre anime as long as the mix of genres is done gracefully, it serves a purpose and the plot is largely coherent. Neither applies in the case of Nanbaka; the sudden change of pace and genre is even lampshaded by some characters a few times, presumably because even the writers thought it was excessive and wanted to alleviate the problems by pointing them out. Lampshading often helps...but in this case it didn\'t. From the 4th episode onward, starting with that ridiculous prison tournament, the anime abruptly changed from a gag comedy anime to a mix of shounen, drama, character driven story, action, you name it, as was also pointed out by the main lead Juugo. The first 1/4 of the anime is *radically* different from the rest of the episodes and this abrupt change serves no purpose.The (sporadic) comedy is OK, but unfortunately it often relies on milking fun out of preposterous situations rather than genuinely funny ones. Comedic anime, even gag comedies, do not need to abandon every semblance of common sense and reality to be funny; good comedies (such as Konosuba, Eizouken, Hinamatsuri, Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon etc) can still make sense. Mediocre ones like Nanbaka do not, since they sadly equate ""ridiculous"" with ""funny"", which are not the same thing. The entire prison system of Nanba is basically set up like a huge farce, apparently by design; Looney Toones make much more sense than this, and its characters have a smaller hammerspace. Nanbaka\'s characters are worse than average, not relatable and very forgettable. Its music is fine but not very memorable.Basically the entire anime runs not on its story or characters but on its *fabulous* art. The art is truly something to behold. Everything sparkles, glitters and twinkles, literally. The characters, both guards and prisoners, are all dressed for the gay parade rather than a prison, which also sparkles. The prison, due to its design and structure, would be perfectly suited to host a massive gay parade event as well. Their hair jobs alone have more colors than an entire dully colored anime. If this anime had poor art it would have found itself at the bottom of the bargain bin, with zero hopes of a second cour. Its rating here would not have been a (very generous) 7.34 but something like 4.5, at best. If you love anime with just very good art, with a ""plot"" that is all over the place, starting from nowhere and ending nowhere (even the ending was abrupt, and I don\'t mean ""cliffhanger abrupt"", just abrupt..), you will probably love this anime. The rest of you are not going to.I never thought that a ""rule of cool"" anime with an even finer (and gayer) art and even more ridiculous ""plot"" than the JoJo series existed. Then I watched Nanbaka. At least JoJo is self-consistent in its preposterousness.  I also never thought that my first review here would be for an anime like Nanbaka.

I wish they stuck with one or the other. The characters were pretty bland and didn\'t have much depth. Some of them were insanely annoying. The premise of ""escaping the prison"" didn\'t stick to the end. And tbh, i don\'t think they could\'ve written a story solely based on that anyways.It starts to lose its way and amounts to being confusing and not being good at either genre they were trying to do. There were some nice moments, but they immediately...get ruined by the pacing, storytelling, etc. When there was some interesting development happening, they don\'t *go* for it. And it ends up being a crappy job. The mystery plot was really interesting, but it seemed like they ran out of jokes and decided to do a 180 from its original genre.Despite all this Nanbaka was promising. Some major tweaks are needed, but the characters can be endearing, wholesome, and lovable. Either stick with the prison mates gag comedy, not just focusing on them escaping the prison, but also on their daily lives. Or stick with the mystery plot and make it more serious and believable, while still keeping the characters with some of their traits and characteristics that make them unique and lovable, and adding depth to them. Also, pls don\'t make the main character so oblivious to what\'s going on. The \'imma save them by myself, and not tell them they are in danger"" is a frustrating cliché that results in many problems that could\'ve been solved by communication.Overall, could\'ve been better. get ruined by the pacing, storytelling, etc. When there was some interesting development happening, they don\'t *go* for it.

Greeeaaat. "", ""**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**Somewhere between the release of .Hack and the year of 2013 the isekai genre devolved into a downwards spiral of recycled ideas being vomited out by any studio looking to make a quick buck. The World’s Finest Assassin tries to break free from this cycle, spicing up the genre by making the protagonist a world-class assassin instead of a loser otaku. If that isn’t enough to satisfy you, he’s also an anti-hero with the mission of bringing down the hero of the world. Apparently, any slight change to an isekai is enough to get an A+ for originality from the anime community.You...know, sometimes I feel bad for isekai protagonists. It must be terrible having every single girl in existence want to get inside your pants. Lugh is such an attractive human being that even his own mother can’t help but be strangely obsessed with him. It’s honestly quite impressive, he only had to manipulate 2 girls to swear absolute loyalty to him, and they’re so dedicated to him that they’re even willing to clean up his wet dreams for him. If that isn’t true love, I don’t know what is. In case you were thinking that his actions are morally wrong, don’t worry. His emotional manipulation is definitely 100% only for his mission. He would never actually have perverted thoughts about minors… except for a wet dream when sleeping with two of them… and he might kiss one… and get excited at seeing them naked… but besides that he’s fine!The producers for this anime are absolute fucking geniuses. Airing this at the same time as Mushoku Tensei’s sequel is such a brilliant way of avoiding controversies. Who’s gonna worry about this 60-year-old assassin sleeping with kids when Rudeus motherfucking Greyrat is running amuck on the front page of every social media site. This is by the same author as Redo of Healer, so it’s damn right the boundaries are going to be pushed at every chance possible. There’s some child trafficking themes (which by the way, are handled fucking horrendously), some pedophilia, and overall just a little bit of something for everyone. At the end of every episode, I thought to myself, surely this can’t get worse. But it did. It got worse with every new fucking episode. The production team knew it too, the initially good art style visibly degraded the further the season progressed. It was a smart move including numerous still shots of naked girls to take up screentime, why worry about animation when there’s some nudity on screen. Why doesn’t the author just make a hentai? The world may never know.Anti-heroes can be a great part of an anime if done correctly. They can push character decisions and motives past being a basic right or wrong. They can allow the viewer to question their own sense of morals through the actions of another character. Or sometimes anti-heroes are just included to look cool, which is essentially what World’s Finest Assassin does. He’s a professional assassin, the finest even, that never feels much attachment to the lives of others and is willing to do whatever is needed to complete a mission. There are, of course, no consequences for this because it wouldn’t be cool if a badass character suddenly cared about the act of taking a life.The rest of the cast are forgettable. I was hoping that the world’s hero who our assassin protagonist was supposed to track down would be at least interesting, but they end up being a no-show for the entire season. The main harem basically consists of a servant girl, a girl of nobility, and a well-spoken ara ara girl. Unsurprisingly they’re all painfully bland with their defining personality traits being them wanting to suck off the main character. You’d think that severe mental trauma from witnessing your friends get raped as a child would be quite a life-changing event, but apparently not in this anime. All is solved after the protagonist shows up, buys a girl being trafficked, and adds +1 to his collection of love interests. By the way, the main love interest is also his cousin. You can’t make this shit up.Audio-visuals are passable. As mentioned before, the art has a pretty noticeable drop as the anime progresses, but it never gets to the point of making the experience worse than it already is. The opening is pretty overrated but at least it’s unique and not just another copy-paste of an existing isekai theme song. None of it really matters though, as this anime would still be a 1/10 even if it had the greatest damn visuals of all time.“The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat” is another awful isekai that desperately tries to disguise itself as smart and original. It shouldn’t even be worth a full review yet here I am, actually putting some thought into the meaning behind something that never had any thought put into it in the first place. For the love of God, avoid this if you have any sense of human decency left in you. At least other similarly trashy isekai have some self-awareness.This is a straight 1/10 and it isn’t even close. know, sometimes I feel bad for isekai protagonists.

It\'s especially more so from one that has created one of the most controversial works adapted into anime, rightsmack at the beginning of the year: Redo of Healer. That\'s right, Rui Tsukiyo is once again back on the anime scene, and this Isekai Assassin work that this chill furry dude has so thoroughly written, is indeed no pushover. It\'s something that feels a lot more like your traditional decent Isekai reincarnation story, with a premise that makes it kinda impressive...to boot.Isekai reincarnation stories, as we\'ve seen over the past year or 2 have realistically boomed up, with a lot of varied concepts from being the stereotypical hero to even animals of all kinds, and this booming trend will continue to be very popular as time passes. This is as such with Rui Tsukiyo having his combi-quasi idea of an Isekai reincarnation story about assassins and aristocrats, and the setting being in medieval fantasy times, both themes are a good fit in the overarching story where the plot is as such: ""Kill the Hero who is prophesied to destroy the world.""And that\'s where the story starts with the protagonist: an old man who has the distinction of being the world\'s No. 1 assassin working for the organization that he is very loyal to, only for the same organization to belittle that same loyalty in order to assassinate him in the same fashion as how ""Tantei wa mōu, Shindeiru."" started with the plane situation circumstance. This old man\'s days are numbered due to his old age, and his usefulness is counted to nothingness as death sets in quick. In a twist, the reincarnation stage opens as the old man transitions into the afterlife, where the usual God entity (in this case the Goddess) has a mission to assign to the rebirth character (the old man) to eradicate the Hero who has a duty to destroy the world after the usual ""defeat the Demon Lord"" debacle. Of course, being an accomplished assassin, and in the witness of the Goddess, with the choice to experience a life of happiness as opposed to the suppressing of emotions from his real life\'s stints, how can he say no? And there sets the story and plot as the old man is rebirthed as Lugh Tuatha Dé, the son and heir of an accomplished family of spotless assassins with a license to kill and leave no traces of evidence for all of their advances. Assassins are humans, not tools.Lugh being a newborn child from the hands of his parents Cian and Esri, the life of an assassin must be hard-coded from young, because when your child has a distinguished name like Tuatha Dé, expectations run high stemming from the offspring from all who\'ve come to expect what the House of Tuatha Dé can do. And that\'s exactly what both parents did to nurture Lugh\'s growth as he grows up into a fine assassin and bearing the Tuatha Dé aristocrat name, being aware of their actions and to separate both family and missions when it comes to the crunch. Not a bad start for Lugh since the Goddess has accepted his reincarnation with all of his memories intact, and as you\'d expect, Rui Tsukiyo\'s writing is really succinct and rarely ever feels like it\'s an aberration of Redo of Healer, even with the subtle sexual innuendos (which really flood the manga adaptation of the LN intentionally) that he knows where to draw the line between enjoyment and going too unintentionally sexual. Really though, well done for writing such an intriguing story plot, even if it\'s decent by Isekai reincarnation standards, and coming off hot from the less-than-stellar Seirei Gensouki last season, this is practically IMO the superior version overall.Alas, what\'s a story without its characters, and Rui Tsukiyo deserves another round of accomplishment from being really careful not to cross the line with the representation of the characters that follow the illusive assassin, who\'s looking forward to enjoy life to the fullest and not see this new second chance of a life as yet another ""used as a tool"" narrative. The loving parents of Tuatha Dé, father Cian and mother Esri are parents that if I was reincarnated in another world, I would choose them regardless of their profession. They are trained in the Tuatha Dé fine arts of assassination, and thoroughly execute their duties as instructed when clients come to them who need their assassination aid. Being proud parents of Lugh when he manages to slowly but surely surpass Cian\'s teachings and Esri\'s cooking and proection (through uh...boobs I guess), this is the standard of a family that knows what\'s good for their offspring and nurture to the best of their parenting abilities. A cruel assassin family that otherwise, displays the exquisite affection to all.You know the deal with OP MCs and a harem, these 2 have to come together like it\'s the iconic standard, and Isekai Assassin is no different in that regard. Lugh by himself is a sensible and tactful OP MC built upon by the standards of the Tuatha Dé family, and just like his real life counterpart, oversees the assassination missions from start to finish, leaving no trace or footsteps whatsoever. He is supported by his team of waifu-worthy assassins nurtured by him: Dia, Tarte, Maha. Dia being the very first girl that he met when he was young, and being young meant that he had to pick up skillsets on the double. That\'s where Dia comes in to teach Lugh magic, and seemingly so, because she is one of the most powerful mages in her kingdom of Swiogel. Alas, things aren\'t meant to be, and they\'re split up due to her kingdom\'s political turmoil...which next leads to Tarte. A mage who is saved from her poor background and coming to the Tuatha Dé region for a better life, the coincidental meeting solidified her position has Lugh\'s assistant, being taken in immediately to be trained by him as an asset for the Hero assassination mission. The hopes of Lugh being formally inducted as the head of the House of Tuatha Dé leads both him and Tarte to yet another girl: Maha. Her chapter oozes close similarity to Redo\'s revenge plot with her orphaned friends, that like Tarte, was just living life by, only to be caught by rogues and used as prostitutes. This caught the attention of the now new Tuatha Dé head and his new assistant, and just like any other assassination mission, executes the plan to intercept as an aristocrat and save Maha and her friends out of the traumatizing situation that has happened for quite sometime. And there you have it, the assassination team of Lugh Tuatha Dé, that as much as it tries to inject the sexual innuendos as bait for the potential harem, Lugh just doesn\'t think of them as tools but companions in need to fix a grave situation. A chad MC that has the interests of people as a whole and not so much a harem playboy displaying unequivocal love to his one true love, that speaks volumes more than other harem shows of having girls swarm the MC for attention. Props for equality as character development in the most badass resilient manner.Silver Link has always been the de-facto standard when it comes to Isekai reincarnation shows, because the studio has clearly been able to produce decent adaptations under budget constraints for quite sometime. With Isekai Assassin, there\'s another outsourced studio (Studio Palette) to help with the production values, and dare I say that it evokes the same visuals as Seirei Gensouki on face value, but does everything up to 11 to amp up expectations, and this is thanks to in-house director Masafumi Tamura, whom with the failure of Spring 2019\'s Kenja no Mago, made one hell of a comeback with last Summer\'s Maou Gakuin. In fact, knowing that he directed Maou Gakuin before should give you the feel that expectations CAN be met that the work together with script and series composer Katsuhiko Takayama (ef: A Tale of Melodies) amplifies the LN as a whole, and from my view, that is a relative success.The final segment of the music department, and once again, Isekai Assassin gets a massive W for this. Yui Ninomiya\'s ""Dark seeks light"" for the OP is really good, maybe even up there as some of her best songs ever composed. Same with Aira Yuuki\'s ED which more than her mellow sung voice, is a well-made closing song through and through. Rarely do I ever feel that the OST ever misses, and for such an action-pumped series like this, the high octane moments make you feel like you\'re on the kill scene, being one together with Lugh on his assassination expeditions everywhere.Like Mushoku Tensei, I\'d feel that Isekai Assassin is now part of the rare breed of LN adaptation perceptions that the manga adaptation (of the LN) is just bad, the LN is the original source material that can be referenced to, and the anime is essentially the best version overall. Bear in mind that this is still the Redo of Healer Rui Tsukiyo himself, so all the perceptions from the previous work will undoubtedly shift into Isekai Assassin, but just take a step back, and you\'ll see an Isekai that\'s not dogshit and is some trash-worthy freaking goodness in the making. This is truly the pinnacle of Rui Tsukiyo\'s works, and I\'m eagerly looking forward to the next controversial adapted series to come out of this furry\'s wide catalogue of his many written works. to boot.Isekai reincarnation stories, as we\'ve seen over the past year or 2 have realistically boomed up, with a lot of varied concepts from being the stereotypical hero to even animals of all kinds, and this booming trend will continue to be very popular as time passes. This is as such with Rui Tsukiyo having his combi-quasi idea of an Isekai reincarnation story about assassins and aristocrats, and the setting being in medieval fantasy times, both themes are a good fit in the overarching story where the plot is as such: ""Kill the Hero who is prophesied to destroy the world.""And that\'s where the story starts with the protagonist: an old man who has the distinction of being the world\'s No. 1 assassin working for the organization that he is very loyal to, only for the same organization to belittle that same loyalty in order to assassinate him in the same fashion as how ""Tantei wa mōu, Shindeiru."" started with the plane situation circumstance. This old man\'s days are numbered due to his old age, and his usefulness is counted to nothingness as death sets in quick. In a twist, the reincarnation stage opens as the old man transitions into the afterlife, where the usual God entity (in this case the Goddess) has a mission to assign to the rebirth character (the old man) to eradicate the Hero who has a duty to destroy the world after the usual ""defeat the Demon Lord"" debacle. Of course, being an accomplished assassin, and in the witness of the Goddess, with the choice to experience a life of happiness as opposed to the suppressing of emotions from his real life\'s stints, how can he say no? And there sets the story and plot as the old man is rebirthed as Lugh Tuatha Dé, the son and heir of an accomplished family of spotless assassins with a license to kill and leave no traces of evidence for all of their advances. Assassins are humans, not tools.Lugh being a newborn child from the hands of his parents Cian and Esri, the life of an assassin must be hard-coded from young, because when your child has a distinguished name like Tuatha Dé, expectations run high stemming from the offspring from all who\'ve come to expect what the House of Tuatha Dé can do. And that\'s exactly what both parents did to nurture Lugh\'s growth as he grows up into a fine assassin and bearing the Tuatha Dé aristocrat name, being aware of their actions and to separate both family and missions when it comes to the crunch. Not a bad start for Lugh since the Goddess has accepted his reincarnation with all of his memories intact, and as you\'d expect, Rui Tsukiyo\'s writing is really succinct and rarely ever feels like it\'s an aberration of Redo of Healer, even with the subtle sexual innuendos (which really flood the manga adaptation of the LN intentionally) that he knows where to draw the line between enjoyment and going too unintentionally sexual. Really though, well done for writing such an intriguing story plot, even if it\'s decent by Isekai reincarnation standards, and coming off hot from the less-than-stellar Seirei Gensouki last season, this is practically IMO the superior version overall.Alas, what\'s a story without its characters, and Rui Tsukiyo deserves another round of accomplishment from being really careful not to cross the line with the representation of the characters that follow the illusive assassin, who\'s looking forward to enjoy life to the fullest and not see this new second chance of a life as yet another ""used as a tool"" narrative. The loving parents of Tuatha Dé, father Cian and mother Esri are parents that if I was reincarnated in another world, I would choose them regardless of their profession. They are trained in the Tuatha Dé fine arts of assassination, and thoroughly execute their duties as instructed when clients come to them who need their assassination aid. Being proud parents of Lugh when he manages to slowly but surely surpass Cian\'s teachings and Esri\'s cooking and proection (through uh...boobs I guess), this is the standard of a family that knows what\'s good for their offspring and nurture to the best of their parenting abilities. A cruel assassin family that otherwise, displays the exquisite affection to all.You know the deal with OP MCs and a harem, these 2 have to come together like it\'s the iconic standard, and Isekai Assassin is no different in that regard. Lugh by himself is a sensible and tactful OP MC built upon by the standards of the Tuatha Dé family, and just like his real life counterpart, oversees the assassination missions from start to finish, leaving no trace or footsteps whatsoever. He is supported by his team of waifu-worthy assassins nurtured by him: Dia, Tarte, Maha. Dia being the very first girl that he met when he was young, and being young meant that he had to pick up skillsets on the double. That\'s where Dia comes in to teach Lugh magic, and seemingly so, because she is one of the most powerful mages in her kingdom of Swiogel.

We have an overpowered MC with anti-hero vibes surrounded by a bunch of cute girls for his harem. It has a dark theme from killing and torture, but fortunately, it doesn\'t go to the extremes. The fanservice is not the kind where the MC assaults every girl he encounters. The girls show signs of interest in the MC like sneaking into his bed, but the MC simply uses the girls for his mission. Since his main focus is getting stronger. It is more fantasy and action-oriented, surprisingly a well written one, and...is one of the guilty pleasures Isekai that surpassed my expectations, and here\'s why:If you watched the first part of the show, the story has the usual tropes that happen in an Isekai, but it doesn\'t make the show entirely bad. It is well-executed, and overall I have no complaints besides the really fast pacing. Everything is easy to consume and understand satisfying my guilty pleasure. The MC gets reincarnated starting as a baby retaining the memories in his previous life. The MC turns out to be a child genius, and a loli magic instructor steps in to teach him. The MC then surpasses his instructor. And will leave home soon to accomplish his mission.  In this case, Lugh\'s mission is to kill the hero using the highest stats a human can theoretically have given by the Goddess. Lugh then meets other girls along the way who will help him.The best thing here is the MC personality, Lugh, in his previous life, was not an overweight perverted NEET from his 30s. So you won\'t see the MC glorifying panties nor having sexual fantasies with his cousin. Lugh was a former elderly man working for an assassin organization and is known as the world\'s greatest assassin. If you put a guy like that in a different world, we get to have a manipulative, calm and collected MC who naturally attracts women around him. He doesn\'t feel a thing or two with feeling the sensation of his beautiful mother\'s boobies as she hugs him, nor sleeping together with a loli instructor. He has the humans are tools vibe. He is the perfect MC suited for the assassination plot.I would like to praise the magic system as well. There are five ranks for skills: S, A, B, C, and D. And six attributes: Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Dark, and Light. There is a variety of skills, and they make use of both weapons and magic spells when fighting. MC has a skill for each rank and has the four basic attributes, making him overwhelmingly strong. But what I love here is the clever use of Lugh with his skills which is not limited to battle. Especially with spell weaver, which allows him to create new spells. He can create new spells by changing parts of the incantations. And he also applies his knowledge from his previous world, like creating new inventions which are very fun to watch.The visuals are amazing, and the opening song ""Dark seeks light"" with a black-white theme is very catchy and is such a banger! I keep playing the opening song in a loop for hours, and I kept re-watching the third episode, which is my favorite, and it still won\'t be enough to satisfy me. Yes, the show can be seen as generic. But is the show bad? Definitely Not. There are many questions that need to be answered. And it makes you want to watch more of the show. So if you love this kind of uniqueness and overpowered stuff, a badass mc, with a pretty decent story, then I recommend watching World\'s Finest Assassin!

It is one of the promising Isekai shows out there.', ""***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***The World’s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated into Another World as an Aristocrat is an isekai that’s centered around an old, about-to-be-retired assassin who gets himself killed by the very “organization” he was loyal to during his final mission. Just before he was destined to die, he was reincarnated and placed in front of a god, which the entity tasked him to slay the hero of her realm. As it’s said by the entity herself, if the hero wasn’t slain, the hero would bring destruction and annihilation upon the world in which he saved.Well, that would have been the plot of the...series if it actually intended on carrying out its original narrative.Cause once the former assassin was reincarnated into a new family of assassins, he was given a new identity: Lugh Tuatha Dé. Under this family’s name, he was rigorously trained by his father to be the best assassin in the vaguely touched upon Kingdom in which they resided. Lugh was obedient. As a former assassin, he does everything that his father taught him to do. Besides his usual training, he also had to learn the ambiguous magic abilities from Dia, the instructor/teacher. Except he was bestowed with all the magic skills when he was first summoned into this fantasy world. Everything that Dia instructed him on was everything he already knew. So what it ended up being is just Lugh showing off his skills apathetically to his instructor and the viewer of this anime for an episode. This type of presentation is seen everywhere in these generic isekai anime, which is why it makes them mind-numbing to watch. And in the desperate attempts to incite any sort of emotions and reactions that are falsely representative of the viewers, the series has Dia, Maha, and Tarte, aka, Lugh’s harem, to perform the tedious, over-the-top, and irritating admirations of him. Now, this usually might not be a problem because after all, these tropes have been done many times. But this type of lazy-ass presentation does add up to everything else that’s appalling about this series.The World’s Finest Assassin comes from the same author as the infamous work: Redo of Healer. If there’s anything to be learned about this dipshit is that he’s obsessed with the concept of rape, and he incorporates it into his narrative in a way that neglects the responsibilities regarding the real implications and consequences.Maha, before she was recruited by Lugh, was kidnapped along with other girls to a secluded area where nobody could reach them. In there, Maha and the other girls were basically fed like pigs so they could be used as sex objects to god knows what. This single episode in the series went out of its way to demonstrate how each of the girls were mentally and physically destroyed each day after being raped. Although this part of the depiction was seemingly handled with authenticity and care from the author, it’s the conclusion that ultimately turned everything that the girls went through meaningless, and disclosed the true intention of the writer. After Lugh exposed the sex traffickers and had them detained, the girls were suddenly uplifting and completely erased of their past trauma. They were written off as a one-note thing. They were used so that Maha was the only one left in the group who was saved from what they'd gone through to justify her being part of Lugh’s harem. But the real issue is that the girls and Maha were used to blind the viewers from seeing through the real thing: The elements of rape, sexual assault, and human trafficking were ill-handled not only in this garbage of a series, but in today’s Isekai anime in general.You could say that anime is fiction. You could say that I’m being overly dramatic about all these things. But in my eyes, if a series is to incorporate these elements, it’s the duty of that particular series to handle these real-world systemic problems with the utmost care and justice.As it is common with these self-insert isekai anime, the protagonist is portrayed to be this smart and witty man. He can solve any conflict of affairs with ease because of the author’s pretentious writing. The world which Lugh inhabits has never encountered the product of moisturizers because it just never existed even though the fantasy world was very well into the likes of the late middle ages of our own, and that the usage of moisturizers was long-established of our own. Because Lugh was the first one to have invented a moisturizer, he was able to successfully form a business selling his novelty to quell the disputes between a noble house and his. The writing then treats this as an absolute accomplishment by touting Lugh to absurd heights. It may look like I’m nitpicking, but I swear I’m just highlighting the moronic writing that’s dispersed in this series.The World’s Finest Assassin is just another installment of abhorrent works by the infamous author, much like his other notable works, it offers nothing of value in not only its writing but enjoyment as well.Score: 2/10 series if it actually intended on carrying out its original narrative.Cause once the former assassin was reincarnated into a new family of assassins, he was given a new identity: Lugh Tuatha Dé.

After skimming through the first 10 chapters of the manga, I can proudly admit that this is one of those rare cases where ….anime >>LN>>> mangaProbably follows LN to a better degree from what I have heard and cuts most of the questionable ecchi stuff (sasuga author of Redo of healer)Honestly, I did not expect much after reading the manga and having seen the authors other work i.e. Redo...of healer (which is a failure in the story department but, has its own charm :3),I was sure this would be another MID isekai power fantasy ,the sole decision made by animators in episode 1 has had such an impact .Episode 1 changed my,and many others' perspectives .Episode 1 is basically an anime original , you can't find the content of episode 1 in the manga (not sure about LN), episode one has scenes that do a very good job of introducing our main character and letting us get a feel of what kind of guy he is, Instead of Truck kun immediately killing him of in episode 1, we get used to his character and hence engrossed in the changes he went through when he died.In any isekai story, If we do not have a main character whose past circumstances are not clear we have a hard time following his newer story, sure some like saihate no paladin and spider isekai try to keep it unclear because it is a bigger plot point for them, but this and mushoku tensei make it inherently clear that people don't change just because rebirth.In episode 3 finale there was a scene that made it very clear that the MC has not forgotten his roots, something that would have melted any of us did not make him stay his blade . and it made it even more interesting to follow his character development and what he will have instore for us later onAh well as for the general stuffStory seems to be good , although a clear end goal is set like many generic isekai , the end goal in this one is rather interesting . Something tells me that there will be a couple of changes in the MC that may make the end goal change but that remains to be seen and that is why it is interesting , nothing is set in stone yet the anticipation remains.Art and animations , Art is not the strongest here, clearly a very generic artstyle that you see in many isekai. The animation ,however is not very high budget but is enough to make fight scenes interesting and make the impact feel real , there haven't been any fights as of yet only training so this area remains to be explored.I have talked enough about the MCs character , the secondary characters are not bad eitherCharacters so far have just been the MC, his parents and his mentor , a very interesting dynamic between him, his mother and father is present . The family has lost their first born and are hence very protective and attached to the MC and it would be interesting to see how he breaks through this shell.The time with his mentor made it very clear that she will be returning as another Main character at some point so that one is still unexplored.As a gun nut  I was very happy that the guns had realistic effect and sounds in ep1, after the truck kun as well the magic chants have a very distinct and unique sound , the explosions and effects are nicely portrayed by their sounds. The OP is very very good. Both art and music are unique and quite the bangers.The ED is weaker in the art department but the tune is not very bad either.Overall a great adaptation of a very Mid-LN so far, I Have great expectations of it since it's not completely ignoring the LN ,if it follows and improves it , which I believe is a very important thing that many anime studios can learn by this anime example. I recommend all isekai trash kuns to watch this already if you have not , the others may need to read the synopsis and give the first four or at least three episodes a shot to see if this is to their taste. of healer (which is a failure in the story department but, has its own charm :3),I was sure this would be another MID isekai power fantasy ,the sole decision made by animators in episode 1 has had such an impact .Episode 1 changed my,and many others' perspectives .Episode 1 is basically an anime original , you can't find the content of episode 1 in the manga (not sure about LN), episode one has scenes that do a very good job of introducing our main character and letting us get a feel of what kind of guy he is, Instead of Truck kun immediately killing him of in episode 1, we get used to his character and hence engrossed in the changes he went through when he died.In any isekai story, If we do not have a main character whose past circumstances are not clear we have a hard time following his newer story, sure some like saihate no paladin and spider isekai try to keep it unclear because it is a bigger plot point for them, but this and mushoku tensei make it inherently clear that people don't change just because rebirth.In episode 3 finale there was a scene that made it very clear that the MC has not forgotten his roots, something that would have melted any of us did not make him stay his blade . and it made it even more interesting to follow his character development and what he will have instore for us later onAh well as for the general stuffStory seems to be good , although a clear end goal is set like many generic isekai , the end goal in this one is rather interesting .

It has some of the new elements added to it. And, yeah I enjoyed while watching it.Story 8The main point would be does this anime have a good story? I mean yeah sure it does have a good story. Who doesn\'t like a super badass assassin. The whole point this anime is based on is kinda cool. I mean almost all the isekai shows us how a powerful hero is always good & kind. But, this anime also explores the...dark sides of what happens when someone is suddenly stupidly overpowered. So 8 in story.Art 9No complains in art & animation. The studios did an amazing job animating this thing. Each and every thing where properly & well animated. And while the fight scenes where amazingly animated all the other normal scenes where also pretty neat. And that leads up to a solid 9 for art & animation.Sound 8Well, the opening and ending were fairly good. The OST\'s where a little lacking behind. But, I am sure most of you didn\'t notice that thing that\'s totally fine by me too. The OST\'s weren\'t the worst thing I heard. They were just fine I would say. So 8 is the best choice in sound.Character 8Now we get to juicy part. Well, I didn\'t expected this anime t have this good character development. I mean I don\'t know how much others expected of this anime\'s characters. But, I seriously didn\'t expect anything. And here we are with a good character development & fairly decent screen time to almost all the side characters as well. So an 8 in character.Enjoyment 9After reading all this you might have a good idea that I enjoyed this show. And you are not wrong I enjoyed this series a lot & I think this is one of the best shows to come out this season considering the garbage shows we saw . So I would give it a 9 in enjoyment.ConclusionFinally I would like to say I didn\'t expect this much from this anime so I would give this anime a solid 8 considering all the points. And regarding should you watch it or not. Then I would say yeah if you like isekai shows. This will entertain you quite a lot. dark sides of what happens when someone is suddenly stupidly overpowered. So 8 in story.Art 9No complains in art & animation.

In a following episode, the girls have told the mother about this for some reason. She then...enters her teenage sons bedroom early in the morning because she wants to see it, and alludes that she is disappointed that it hasn\'t happened again. Yes, the boys mom wants to see her son erect, with a mess of semen on his bedsheets. This anime...is absolute f*****g dog-shit.There are two reasons I open with this. Firstly, is because this is the caliber of writing you should expect should you choose to watch this show, and a strong indicator of the quality. And secondly it also happens to be a good analogy for the anime itself in that it is clearly written as some middle-aged mans gross wet dream of being young, capable, over-powered and surrounded by a harem of well-endowed underage girls. I enjoy isekai as a genre, I\'m sure most of us can think of examples we enjoy, and I\'m equally sure we can all think of examples of trashy, generic, poorly written, dime-a-dozen isekai that are responsible for the bad reputation that the genre attracts and this one would be an example of the latter.The MC is a cardboard cutout, no personality, no jokes, no flaws or limitations, he\'s great at everything all the time always, and everything always works with little or no effort and always with a perfect understanding of every new thing he tries. He\'s not fazed by his death, speaking with a goddess, reincarnation or the properties of magic. All the girls he meets join his harem because he\'s a perfect genius. His reincarnation, mission and how he interacts with this new world is the same as every other isekai ever. I don\'t dislike the OP character trope but you need to give them something to make them interesting and there is nothing here. The harem girls, similarly, are just blank and paper thin personality wise and their only role appears to be as harem girls doing harem things.Other reviews seem to indicate that being an assassin is somehow a twist on the genre, but I fail to see how that is so. The beginning of the anime has the MC and his harem foiling a group that are selling sex slaves, and then later he saves another young girl to add to the harem, and then dismantles another sex trafficking organisation saving more girls a few episodes later. The writing seems to want to paint the picture of this character being some kind of anti-hero, but as far as the plot is concerned, he\'s just a regular OP hero/savior like any other generic isekai. So I fail to see where there is any semblance of originality or spin on the genre. The skills/magic ""system"" is video-gamey too, just like any and every other isekai.The writer here seems to think that throwing in some rapers or torture will create tension or high stakes, but when everything is so tropey and predictable, it just doesn\'t work. It\'s also hard to be invested in a tragic, abusive back story when an episode or two later that same character is a jizz-sniffing nympho.There\'s no fun to be had because the MC doesn\'t have any fun or reaction to the world and plot around him, there\'s no excitement to be had because there\'s no stakes, or surprises in store. And there\'s no enjoyment to be had because it\'s all so bland and lacking in any kind of developing plot. Forgettable, trashy, low effort stuff. enters her teenage sons bedroom early in the morning because she wants to see it, and alludes that she is disappointed that it hasn\'t happened again.

Forgettable, trashy, low effort stuff.', ""My parents used to tell me 'life is too short, so make every second count'. Maybe you've heard of that familiar advice before too. What if I told you that the protagonist in this show lives his life as an assassin and takes other people's lives? Sounds daunting, I know. Well, that didn't stop the author introducing us to Lugh Tuatha De, a character who lives by his code and lives his life as an assassin.Before diving into the juicy details, I do want to mention that this is the same author who wrote Kaifuku Jutsushi no Yarinaoshi. If you don't know what the means,...it basically means this anime may have some sensitive ideas and draw controversy. Luckily, it's much more tame because rather than using ecchi as a major selling point, it uses its main cast and the plot. Yet, there's something also not hitting the correct marks for this show, so let's get into it.Watching an anime like this tells me of several flags to be wary of. For instance, why is the main character an assassin? Is this show going to be a full on revenge story? Oh and with three pretty girls on the cover with a protagonist, is it one of those mystery harems in disguise? Well, I'll let that last one slide since at its core, an anime adaptation usually can masquerade itself to be something more than it appears to be. Yet, here we are, introduced to a show about an assassin. And to be honest, the first episode did unexpectingly grab my attention despite how action packed it was. Throwing us into this show's fictional world evokes a variety of feelings ranging from excitement to also, somewhat confusion. It begins when our main character is seemingly betrayed but gets a second chance at life and reborn yet again as an assassin. Like most isekai, he develop new skills and lives a new life in a new world. When working as an asssassin, Lugh uses a combination of his ruthless personality, cunning nature, and manipulative tactics to get close to his target and finish the job. Deep down however, Lugh is fundamentally a kind person as witnessed when he helped characters such as Maha and Tarte during their past. However, the show also makes it clear that he is among the strongest of assassins in the world. Combined with his previous past skills, Lugh is what people may call out as a Gary Stu.Joining him by his side are the two lovely yet dangerous girls, known to us as Maha and Tarte. Through flashbacks, we see why they are so devoted to Lugh. Unfortunately, beyond their character background stories, both characters are flawed with barebone personalities. In essence, Maha and Tarte practically worships Lugh as his savior and there's no doubt they are in love with him. Lugh's feelings towards them are somewhat more complex but the anime doesn't truly take time to commit romanic relationship building. However, the anime does attempt to get Lugh to open up more, such as with the talented mage Dia Viekone. The relationship is rather limited due to the short amount of episodes the show offer and honestly, isn't much groundbreaking. In essence, the anime's story mostly devotes on Lugh's character and his role as an assassin, just as the premise speaks for itself.And finally, we can't have an isekai without a God-like entity, can we? After all, Goddess is the entity that made Lugh who he is in the new world. She tasked him with the goal to kill the hero but it's ambigious about what her true objectives are. Furthermore, the anime makes it clear that she is manipulative, sarcastic, and overall, a character that can't be trusted, if at all. To be clear, I believe Goddess exists was added a source of entertainment. Even as she is relevant to the plot, the show makes it so unclear about her true intentions that we can only guess from our imaginations. And yes, that is a major drawback of the anime. It really doesn't know how to spell out the main plot overall or resolve the premise in the end. With a mere 12 episodes, you might have predicted this from the beginning.With a collaboration between studio Silver Link and Palette, I have to admit the anime itself does have polished visuals in terms of character designs. Lugh looks like a badass and his clever disguises often protrays him as a pokerface, decorated with whatever suits for his target assigned. The female cast are lavishly designed with alluring figures, suitable for combat needs. And before I forget to mention, this anime does not escape from a beach episode. Yes, it has it. Fan service is actually minimal but there are some obvious adult themes alluded. Let's just say, the show does whatever it takes to attract our attention even if it doesn't always rely on ass and boobs.For a title this long, you'd probably think this anime has to more to offer than what meets the eye. But no, don't expect some sort of complex storyteller with deep insightful characters. This is a show that relies a lot more on pushing the main character to do what he can do as an assassin. What started as a revenge story turned into something less and less entinicing with each episode.

Then it tediously explains world mechanics. Then there\'s ""splash screeN"" of censored breasts (why) of random female character in the middle next to advertisment break. Then it tries to be creepy, then tries to be too dramatic and pushes it too hard, then it tries to be some sort of harem, except that EVERY female character is incredibly stereotypical and...annoying.Overall it feels like a mess, and it certainly lacks something that would make it stand out, and it is not exactly clear what that ""something"" is. The visuals aren\'t bad and at times it uses ""colored lines"" style which reminded me of ""no game no life"" a little. Character style is a bit stereotypical and some of them resemble ""denpa onna"" characters a little, sans awkward neck angles. The music has some nice faux-medieval, but those are at odds with the intro. So everything is sort of odds and does not fit together nicely, and it doesn\'t help that source material wasn\'t great either.One thing that did stand out is that this anime consistently portrays female characters poorly. There are several important female characters in the first chapter and they ALL act in exaggerated fashion, trying to be over the top coquettish or just being impossibly silly. It shatter suspension of disbelief completely. Which is a shame, as at least one of them uses a good voice actress whose talents are wasted on this sort of character.So all things combined, there\'s an oddball of a show that tries to be something but does not feel great to watch.4/10 story, 5/10 art, 6/10 sound, 3/10 character, 4/10 enjoyment, 4/10 overall.I\'m dropping this and do not recommend it. annoying.Overall it feels like a mess, and it certainly lacks something that would make it stand out, and it is not exactly clear what that ""something"" is.

MC agrees to help which is followed by an explanation of the other world and the hero the MC will need to defeat. The twist is that the MC must defeat a powerful hero instead of a powerful demon king. The MC is then reincarnated into the body of an infant named Lugh and retains all of...his memories to prepare for the final battle from the start. The premise itself is different, but clumsy writing hurts the story. Admittedly the studio is trying it’s best to work with the source material and was able to add a lot including an expansion of the absent backstory in the source material into a full-fledged episode, although the core problems remain.Art: The art is average. Character designs and locales are all very familiar. If you’ve seen any fantasy isekai series, then you’ve already seen the art and animations before watching this.Sound: The opening and closing songs are forgettable, except for the backgrounds while they play which are nice. Sound effects are what you’d expect and have matched expectations.Character: MC is an assassin that retains his memories as he becomes Lugh. He goes through the usual steps for standard isekai heroes. MC picks out the skills he wants and starts off at a high level. MC is immediately overpowered but this is explained as necessary because the Hero will be stronger. The other characters are generic and par the course for an isekai. There are several girls who immediately take a strong liking to the protagonist forming a harem and there is plenty of fanservice. MC doesn’t care and instead is focused on his mission. This single-mindedness means the MC can be quite bland as a small part of his old life is most of Lugh’s personality.Enjoyment: This series has its ups and downs. Sometimes you’ll get the “so bad it’s good” feeling, other times you’ll be bored at the exposition or pace, and other times you’ll enjoy Lugh remembering helpful info from his past assassin life. This isn’t an anime where you’ll be having a blast every minute, but you’ll find every episode has it’s highlight. This review has assessed the anime as it is in the first several episodes, though the cour is not over so the anime could improve. I would also like to point out this series has dark moments in it with graphic content including gore, if that’s your thing.Overall: The show doesn’t have the comedy of Mushoku or depth of Overlord, in fact it’s relatively lacking, but still has some strong points. The former life knowledge and memories are entertaining. The magic system is interesting. While it is yet another isekai series which isn’t distinctive, it can still be a fun watch.

Story was was written by a teenager. Few examples:*The MC and his doctor dad do a house call for a sick patient and the dad asks MC what he thought and MC is like ""I made sure to take note of his security incase we need to kill him later"".*MC as a child becomes the family head, one of his family members is drunk and challenges him so the MC literally teleports behind him and breaks his arm. And then says ""Don\'t worry. I made sure it was a clean break.""*MC...strips naked for his dad on the reg to be felt up, so his dad can make sure all of his muscles are developing optimally. Ok.*MC picks up the first girl in his harem by saving her from some wolves and talks to her before recruiting her. He caps this off by thinking to himself ""Brainwashing complete.""*MC spars with his dad, usual edgy stuff like I can triangulate his position by the sound of wind deflecting off of his hair. MC got a sharingan in episode 1 or 2 btw.*MC\'s harem girls catch a spy.  They strip the spy and he tells them ""Good job. I see you\'ve remembered the basics of torture.""So the MC is a reincarnated middle aged guy who has had a pretty stressful life as an assassin. They make the point that he spent his whole life being super careful and acting as a perfect tool for assassination. He is tired of this life, and after his enemies finally get him, he remarks he no longer wants to be a tool. When he reincarnates, the goddess asks him if he wants to keep his memories but he has to do a job for her. Two major problems with this. First of all, it instantly goes against his character, because from this point on, he is a soulless feelingless killer again, acting as a perfect tool for the goddess, which is exactly what he regretted from his first life. Other problem, he has the mind of an experienced middle aged man, but he doesn\'t act like one ever. An older professional dude would not be super edgy. And when he had the wet dream, an older guy would not sperg out like a 14 year old. He would not be constantly awkward and annoyed around his busty mom. He never acts in character, he is just a blank slate and from his past life the only thing that carries over is his knowledge about modern science and he can invent lotion and stuff. Sometimes between scenes, there are shots of other men the goddess sent on the mission like the MC, and they all just stayed in bed and got drunk or lost sight of the goal. You would think a guy who is tired of his hard life as an assassin would also take some time to wonder at this new world and have some fun. But nope, he is a perfect killing machine who is min maxing everything.A lot of people have praised this for being an isekai with an actual pre-isekai character story, but it\'s pointless because they discard everything except for his keen knowledge of chemistry. 100% of the time the MC is doing anything, it\'s not the way the old guy would have done it, and they are supposed to be the same person, his consciousness was supposed to be unbroken from his past life. And it hurts the show in a lot of ways, because whenever you remember he has the mind of a middle aged man it\'s just messed up, like whenever he\'s sharing a bed with the underage girls.There\'s some other problems with the show. They spent almost a whole episode on a tragic backstory of abuse for one of the girls in MC\'s harem. It\'s so messed up because on its own this could be part of a mature story. But in this show it\'s just disgusting because as soon as he shows up and literally buys her she is super in love with him and wants to service him. Her personality from her backstory is just erased, a person who has been through that would not act this way.Stuff happens in the show, but the MC is obviously insanely OP so there\'s never any challenge, nothing ever goes wrong for him. There is sort of a plot, but it\'s not that interesting, and the show regularly makes me feel hatred and disgust. I can live with some edgyness but this show is constantly making me think ""oh my freaking god.."" Only thing I liked was the side scene where a rapper got reincarnated and the goddess had a little DJ stand with ""funky megumi"" written on it. Otherwise aggressively bad show, negative rating out of 10 for most episodes. strips naked for his dad on the reg to be felt up, so his dad can make sure all of his muscles are developing optimally. Ok.*MC picks up the first girl in his harem by saving her from some wolves and talks to her before recruiting her. He caps this off by thinking to himself ""Brainwashing complete.""*MC spars with his dad, usual edgy stuff like I can triangulate his position by the sound of wind deflecting off of his hair. MC got a sharingan in episode 1 or 2 btw.*MC\'s harem girls catch a spy.  They strip the spy and he tells them ""Good job. I see you\'ve remembered the basics of torture.""So the MC is a reincarnated middle aged guy who has had a pretty stressful life as an assassin.

With more than likely a possible end goal in sight. This is no different, but it puts an interesting twist on the whole thing, of which may interest someone. So let's get talking about it!You know the drill, character ends up dying through certain means, and such....But what if instead of the usual, they're tasked with taking out the hero, rather than being the hero itself?

This one is an attempt of making the same anime you probably have seen countless times, but trick you into thinking the main character was well written.Don\'t be fooled. Up until ep4, this anime has had a total of zero decently written characters. I didn\'t read any source material, so i am only looking at the anime. I still don\'t get why most reviews here say the mc is a good character. Yes, his backstory was interesting, and yes, to our surprise he wasn\'t a total NEET loser in his previous life. But...this is about what sums it up for the MC.He was a pro assassin, that was always loyal to his organization. But he got betrayed and killed by them the moment he decided on retiring. This filled him with regret, as he supposedly decides to live a different life with the isekai opportunity. He only has to do a simple task for the goddess: Kill the hero.This is the point that his character falls for me. With all this backstory, you would think MC would show some changes. Maybe he wouldn\'t be so loyal to this goddess, after being betrayed by the organization he was loyal to all this  time. Maybe he would cherish a little that he\'s got a supporting family. Maybe he would make friends, let himself feel a joyful youth, while still focusing on his mission. But so far, he is the same emotionless killing machine he was before. All his experiences mounted to nothing. This is not a well written character, this is just an edgelord.To make things worse, you don\'t need to care about the other characters. None of them do anything extraordinary because our OP MC does better. He has everyone licking his boot everytime, and no one is intelligent enough to suspect why this 8yo kid is so good at everything. His parents are specially dumb for a family of traditional legendary assassins. His magic teacher could have been interesting, but ended up being just a goon, compared to our MC. The whole episode was him flexing how he was better at everything his teacher tries to show.Even the moments the MC uses his previous life knowledge feels like stupid pull offs. This sums up to the feeling that there will be no conflict whatsoever during most of the anime. I could be wrong, but honestly at this point it wouldn\'t be any different from other isekais you\'ve seen. People shit on Slice of Life animes, because they have no plot. But to me, overpowered characters that are better than everyone without even trying make any plot you come up with useless and stupid. And this anime is no different so far.I got to praise sound and art on this one tho. The animations and models are pretty good. You can see a shift in style from the isekai world, and the normal world. Op is cool, and Ending is good.To end things, it seems there is a harem coming. And don\'t tell me this is any different just because MC doesn\'t care about girls. This anime takes EVERY SINGLE aspect of general dreadful isekais, and tries to tell you it doesn\'t by making it\'s protagonist uninterested in them. But at the end this is just another isekai that unfortunately came up with an idea to convince people it is ""more"" than it. It isn\'t.To sum it up, i have no problems with the genre. Sure, it is not my favorite, but i guess it is successful for a reason, given how much of those we get every season. What i don\'t like is animes that are dishonest.

Not even the side characters seem to know of this so-called hero. For a main antagonist in a story, the world-building is practically non-existent and leaves something to be desired, and also isn't helped by the generic representation of the typical settings found in most isekai titles. If this...is a one-off 12 part series, it's probably too late to hype up this aspect of the story.The potential for character growth; especially for the main character is squandered by the fact that his overpowered skills carry over from his previous life, combined with his selection of overpowered abilities before reincarnating into the alternate world. Despite expressing the need to become stronger to defeat this hero who apparently is MEGA overpowered in comparison; he doesn't seem to experience any struggles or weaknesses whatsoever in order to justify this; everything he does is a walk in the park from the outset. How much more overpowered can the main character get?Because of these reasons, it's difficult to put any emotional investment into the characters or the story.

Who thought of this bullsh*t story- No good soundtracks and the animation is also rather average for what I have already seen in other anime- So much unnecessary fan-service that just disgusts me in every way possible (not talking about the rape scenes since those actually had some place to be there)- The system with the skills he gained in the beginning of the story don\'t matter anymore -> the anime just doesn\'t put it into account anymore- Not only does the main character do everything perfect but everyone loves him as well? So incredibly bad story and character writing.- The main character is an assassin and the anime just treats it like it\'s something good or honorable to be an assassin? Okay.

Most Isekai fail and this one did good at failing as well.', ""Repost of my deleted reviewThe World's Finest Assassin is your typical power fantasy isekai. What separates this one from the rest? Cool mc and I guess more of a focus on horny characters. Stuff like mc's harem of mindless zombies, that this anime pretends are characters, which are trying to convince our protagonist to sleep with them, his mother being very interested in his genitalia, Lugh having a problem with his build up desires, his dad checking his 'growth' as an assassin by examining his naked body (which later he copies by doing the same thing with one of his waifus) and so on...Many will...claim that this show is different from your usual isekai because of the interesting mc and all of the cool assassination stuff, but it really isn't as good as it may seem to some. Lugh's arc boils down to changing from a mindless calculated killer to a calculated killer who murders only bad guys and creates a harem. Is there something more to that? Not really. Did his limited growth was determined by some sort of interesting conflict and/or challenge to his ideas? He just got reincarnated and talked it out a bit with his father. What is even more frustrating is the fact that author had a good setup for a meaningful choice which would be tough either way for our protagonist, but he instead decided to turn down this opportunity and replaced it with revelation of half incest.Are there any cool assassinations were he has to make some preparations, infiltrate his targets estate or face some interesting problem? Well fortunately for our assassin he was apparently a master of cosmetics in his spare time before he died so now he can create an empire in this industry thanks to which he can easily get whatever information he needs. When he does have to do the deed he can just pull out his op magical weapons and kill his target undetected from distance and even if he would get into close combat he is still op... Also it is funny how hard this adaptation is trying to create drama. They were so desperate that they made a running scene emotional which failed even further with how bad the dialogue is in this series.Of course the biggest problem with Lugh is how overpowered he and his harem are. Not only he starts his life with some of the most op skills/powers in this new world, but he also apparently can create whatever he wants like a super magical sniper rifle or a fucking cannon... a modern cannon. Why can he do that? As it turns out one of the most important informations for any modern assassin is to memorize values of melting point, gravity and atomic weight of any material,with this knowledge and one of his op skills he can create whatever he wants.So what about other characters? Well there are three waifus in the harem of our brave assassin. Each one of them mindlessly serve and worship him while also trying to convince him into having sex with them. What makes it even weirder is the fact that he decided to adopt one of them as his sister. We don't get to see Lugh's relations with Dia (main love interest) instead time skipping most of the bonding they had at the beginning of their relationship and thus we don't really care about her or understand why Lugh cares about her, making romance in this anime bad as well. Then we have new parents of our protagonist with his father being just a stoic teacher and mother as an infantile comic relief who is always looking after Lugh while also trying to get into his pants. There is also the goddess which is basically a boring version of the mother.Soundtrack for this anime is very forgettable but serviceable at the same time (although opening is really nice). Animation and action are fine but fights often have a problem with lack of tension which is typical for op protagonists. Some battles are just to show of how our waifus fight like when random bandits show up to be beaten by Tarte and establish that she is now powerful as well. Scenes like that could very much be cut out and no one would notice. Also I need to warn you that while cgi in this anime is pretty rare/not noticeable when there is a lot of it it is really bad.In terms of the plot other then some slight development of characters, few meaningless assassinations and a bit of boring training we get nothing. There is a goal with some time restraint involved but this idea is only beginning to be explored and we have to wait for a sequel to see it develop more.So The World's Finest Assassin presents to you a basic power fantasy with some fan service and assassin theme that maybe is appealing if you are looking for some simple, mindless fun. Waifus are pretty with a lot to look at, protagonist acts cool while being op, baddies are being killed and when rape is brought up anime takes a more serious and appropriate tone (although the fact of rape being in there in the first place can be enough to discourage you from watching),.To be honest with you if it wasn't an isekai I might have given it a 4/10. The problem is that with how much isekai we are getting I need something more than a badly executed slight variation on an idea I've watched a thousand times. claim that this show is different from your usual isekai because of the interesting mc and all of the cool assassination stuff, but it really isn't as good as it may seem to some.

We don't get to see Lugh's relations with Dia (main love interest) instead time skipping most of the bonding they had at the beginning of their relationship and thus we don't really care about her or understand why Lugh cares about her, making romance in this anime bad as well. Then we have new parents of our protagonist with his father being just a stoic teacher and mother as an infantile comic relief who is always looking after Lugh while also trying to get into his pants. There is also the goddess which is basically a boring version of the mother.Soundtrack for this anime is very forgettable but serviceable at the same time (although opening is really nice). Animation and action are fine but fights often have a problem with lack of tension which is typical for op protagonists. Some battles are just to show of how our waifus fight like when random bandits show up to be beaten by Tarte and establish that she is now powerful as well. Scenes like that could very much be cut out and no one would notice. Also I need to warn you that while cgi in this anime is pretty rare/not noticeable when there is a lot of it it is really bad.In terms of the plot other then some slight development of characters, few meaningless assassinations and a bit of boring training we get nothing. There is a goal with some time restraint involved but this idea is only beginning to be explored and we have to wait for a sequel to see it develop more.So The World's Finest Assassin presents to you a basic power fantasy with some fan service and assassin theme that maybe is appealing if you are looking for some simple, mindless fun. Waifus are pretty with a lot to look at, protagonist acts cool while being op, baddies are being killed and when rape is brought up anime takes a more serious and appropriate tone (although the fact of rape being in there in the first place can be enough to discourage you from watching),.To be honest with you if it wasn't an isekai I might have given it a 4/10. The problem is that with how much isekai we are getting I need something more than a badly executed slight variation on an idea I've watched a thousand times."", 'An ok concept to start with, but incredibly stiff dialogue —to the point of being frustrating and annoying. A few episodes in and the dialogue has still not improved. There is also increasingly frequent fan-service and suggestive (though still clunky) phrasing in dialogue. Worse, this suggestiveness is frequently targeted towards characters who are clearly established as minors and even occurs between biologically related family members (parent/child). It includes both verbal inuendo and “camera shots” of underwear, bras, breasts, etc, again including characters who are stated minors.If you can get past all of that, the music and action sequences are ok, but there’s nothing overly...unique to warrant watching this… unique to warrant watching this…', 'tl;dr original, but lacklustreFirst thing I just need to get off my chest is if I hear another mention of cReAm StEw I\'m going to send a strongly worded letter to the studio. Really feels if that\'s the only piece of cooking the author even knows.Anyway, back to the planned programming. Ansatsu Kizoku is by no means a totally terrible show. It\'s got its moments, with points for an original backstory and MC. Yet somewhere between script and screen something went horribly wrong. What exactly? I hope to analyze that below.The originality in MC is to be commended, but at the same time it\'s to...be detested. For the most part the show ignores the MC\'s main quest as well as his background besides using it as a simple explanation for some of the MC\'s more specific thought processes and abilities. When the MC\'s background and mission do come up it\'s in such an obtuse way that it feels like an afterthought.For the most part, Ansatsu Kizoku is a waifu collection show though it does make some feeble attempts at hiding that fact under the special abilities of the MC\'s companions. But speaking of companions it\'s an absolute mess. We\'ve got a brainwashed maid that MC essentially enslaved, a supposed business genius MC saved from a sex trafficking ring (I won\'t go into that one but suffice to say that arc was horribly conceived and executed), and main love interest magic genius who turns out to basically be his cousin.But by and large the chief complaint I have is that the show is simply all over the place. It\'s like filler training montage for a few episodes, then suddenly he\'s a huge entrepreneur, then he\'s off fighting what the show creators would like you to think are important assassinations. I don\'t quite mind the training episodes but surely in a show about an assassin there should be more actual assassination missions?Second complaint for me is how the show felt there was a need to bring in modern weapons and try to explain them using ""magic"" hocus pocus. Please. If you have magic surely there are enough ways to be creative about pulling off assassinations that you don\'t need to whip out the .50 cal. Besides that it\'s my usual complaints about the lack of secondary character development, though I suppose since it\'s only a waifu collector it can get away with a single episode per waifu.I certainly don\'t recommend this show. There are better shows out there to watch and not be angry at the amount of cReAm sTeW being served and consumed. 3/10 be detested.

The male characters just talks about how...amazing Lugh is and all the female characters want to have sex with him (borderline his mum who mentioned something about wanting to see his erect pen*s).Story: Seriously nothing happens until like ep 10 where you finally think something interesting happens where the episode ends alluding to Dia\'s betrayal. Rip my hopes, that\'s not what happens but at least the plot moves forward.Also, this ""assassination"" business is laughable. So many moments where I had to look-up the definition of \'assassination\' especially where Lugh pops out his magic cannon out of no where and launches a magic bomb thing.Also the only moderately decent part of the show, being Lugh and Dia\'s kinda cute relationship also ruined by in ep 11 when we find out they are cousins lol.

I quite like the main character but I wanted to see more character development scenes, and more moments of insight with him. Often it feels as if I'm not experiencing the story with the main character and just observing it as an outsider, with little emotional attachment or investment. Not a lot stood out for me in this anime series except for episode 6. If you're not great with witnessing trauma, this might be an incredibly tough watch. There are moments of brutality here and there throughout this series but...episode 6 was entirely focused on it. Overall, a solid anime but not something I would really recommend to others. episode 6 was entirely focused on it. Overall, a solid anime but not something I would really recommend to others."", ""As someone who has watched a good chunk of isekais, I think it is safe to say that the formula has become pretty niche over the years: Guy reincarnates in a fantasy medieval world where swords cross magics with stupid broken abilities and he attempts to do some large-scale thing while scooping up cute girls along the way. Does this anime sound like that description? Perfect.Now, I admit, there is going to be a bit of bias in this review. Possibly because I've seen my fair share of isekais and have gotten pretty bored of the formula, and possibly because I'm a sucker for galaxy-brained...strategies, but let's see what World's Finest Assassin did right.Starting with worldbuilding. The general world is pretty generic-sounding. It's a classic medieval style monarchy where lords and nobles controls the general well-being of their region. There is uniqueness in the fact that some families have a reputable heritage, such as the Tuathe De Family for being the Monarchial Hitmen, or famed doctors. That's a fair element of uniqueness, but other than that, not much until the later episodes. There, you see into the backstages of these seemingly glistening cities. Maha and her group being homeless and abused in the orphanage, forced to sell their bodies for some snobby lord's pleasure, or the rampant drug abuse in another region, where its so dire that children struggle just to make sure their parents inhale another line of the stuff. Nasty stuff, and something that an assassin would definitely understand, which would play perfectly into our MC Lugh's development. So even in this repeated environment they managed to find something to build up out of. That's pretty good.Speaking of Lugh, let's get to the characters. Lugh is your classic Jack of All Trades character, smart as hell and physically capable literally because he has an ability that lets him do so. On top of that, he has an unparalleled affinity of magic so potent he literally creates a howitzer cannon three seconds after learning how to make copper. To any, that would've been a shake-off right there, but this is where the magic of screenwriting comes in: When you see the tape rewind, you know its big brain time. All of Lugh's actions are carefully analyzed and an explanation is given on his thought process, meaning its not just him abusing tf outta his powers and hoping something works, but rather him utilizing his powers to his full extent to complement his abilities. Sure, the guy was the world's finest assassin in his previous life, so his development looks bland physically, but when you look emotionally, you observe what is mentally an old man learning how to love for the first time in his life. His first signs of remorse appear not in his previous life, but in this life, along with a desire to protect those he loves. Which transitions nicely into the other people he metI don't think I'm gonna warrant Dia as a main character, she's given a basic breadth of character, but otherwise I think she feels too significant to warrant a discussion. Maybe if this anime continues and we see her operate as part of the assassin team we can come back to this later. Meanwhile, since both Tarte and Maha share similar trends I'll just talk about them both.The biggest problem I have with the both of them is their undying allegiance to Lugh. Sure, he saved their lives, but did you really have to go to Albedo-levels of obsessiveness over that one matter? Its reasonable for Tarte, since she's been with Lugh the longest, but Maha, the researcher, the recon, really? Its one thing to be undyingly loyal, its another thing to be Albedo. Tarte, on the other hand, suffers from the whole insignificant issue where she feels like she isn't doing enough. And frankly, she isn't. Not only is she only there to poke a spear at some people occasionally, we rarely get to see Lugh capitalize his right hand woman to her full potential. Sure Lugh liked to act alone because of his past life, but you really gotta do your girl like that? From the opening sequence of the show alone Tarte couldve been so much more. So Lugh, you better start using your queen in that 5D chess game of yours.Music and Art. This one's decent. The music scores during the most dramatic moments definitely had a play in getting my blood pumped and the clean and refined art of the music really gives a vibrant feel to the entire show. Other than that, the CGI is a bit clunky at times, especially at places like the soldiers scene, that's really my only complaint.I think in summary, The anime did wonderfully at capitalizing off of the vast potential of the characters. There are definitely a few complaints I had, but nowhere near enough to call it a bad isekai. In fact, I think that because of the vast amount of detail and thought that went into the anime, especially the progression and abilities, as well as the literal galaxy-brain that goes on behind Lugh, this anime trumps over traditional ones as one to properly utilize the genres to their advantage. I look forwards to season 2 when Lugh can properly utilize everyone to their best potential strategies, but let's see what World's Finest Assassin did right.Starting with worldbuilding.

An old man in the body of a 12 year old who basically acts like an old man as well.Don't even get me started on the whole picking up 3 girls to join his quest of defeating the hero. It's fan service of girls who's bodies have matured beyond their age which seems to be 12 to 13 by the way. This whole anime seems to be stopped at one thing only which is a harem show from the beginning to the end. A lot of naked bodies, boobs and everything is going on in this anime....I get the whole nudity thing that is really persistent in this anime because the main character is reincarnated and there is this whole being born naked etc etc, but oh my god i started to visibly cringe by about the 7th episode.This anime has wasted potential where the whole storyline could have been used to better the character of the old man into someone who has more gratitude for the whole new life being given thing, but nope once an old man always an old man. Like why aren't we introduced to the hero who he is supposed to defeat. There is none of that but only a harem full of girls accompanying this one annoying old man stuck in the body of a 12 year old.The art work and animation is beautiful, absoultely amazing and is quite frankinly the only thing that kept me watching this until episode 7. I was hoping there would be more action, and more time leaps rather than this little boy being around a bunch of boobs and girls who are his age but seem much more older than him due to the way their body is presented.Don't even get me started on the whole mom's obsession with her young child who clearly acts older than her... there is one scene where the mother is like Do you want milk. You're not that old to not have milk from me now, are you and then she proceeds to shove his face into her breasts and I immediately thought of Freud and his oedipus complex theory and he would have been fascinated by this.The Goddess being a female seems to have been greatly in contrast to the whole harem of girls who are sexually exploited throughout this anime by the creator of this managa. I would have expected the girls to be stronger physically and mentally rather than being seen as an object of sex, but Nope. It seems the creator of the orginal manga only made God a female character because they like girls with boobs and wanted to draw that. The prostitution episode was disgusting and i had to skip through it to get done with it because here you have a girl with magical abilities but she can't use it because ultimately a 12 year old boy has to save her It made the girls look so pathetic and weak and after going through something traumatic surely they would come out stronger and fight back especially if you have fucking abiltites to do so.Overall, terrible anime and fuck yall for ever making it.

'English:""The World\'s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat"" is another entry in the isekai genre. I quite enjoyed it, with several standout elements worth highlighting and a few aspects that warrant some criticism.The protagonist\'s mission to prevent the world\'s destruction by slaying its hero provides a strong initial driving force, although it later merges into the more mundane yet equally enjoyable aspects of the plot.One aspect that intrigued me was the protagonist\'s journey of transformation. Evolving from his ruthless assassin persona in his previous life, he becomes a character who must navigate the intricacies of nobility while honing his skills...in secrecy. This character growth adds depth to the narrative and raises questions about identity and morality.The interventions of the goddess, especially when recounting stories of past resurrections, were somewhat distracting.

It didn\'t sit well and seemed out of context. Similarly, the relationship with the mother raised eyebrows – her motivations seemed questionable and inappropriate for her son\'s age.In general, the protagonist always seems overpowered, making it difficult to believe the hero won\'t meet his end in the next season.

I enjoy how so much effort was made to put a good backstory for the characters. As someone who enjoys development so much in any anime rather than battles all the time, i found this anime amazing. Lugh, who was raised as a tool found his way to being a human. He didn\'t just obey orders, he tought about them and decided if he was gonna do the mission or not.Altough he manipulated the girls so they would be loyal to him it raises the question, ""Was the girls loyalty towards him purely due to him...manipulating them or was it the result of his action of providing for them?"" As the one who appeared before them in their most desperate times, even if he himlsef said, i just want to use you as tools to fulfil my assassinations they wouldn\'t bat an eye, because despite having his own agenda, he saved them, gave them a home and a new lease in life. Even though Lugh said he brainwashed the girls to be always loyal to him, as i said, it sounds almost like a joke, because it was unecessary from the begining as the girls didn\'t have any reason to betray or abandon him.I like the pace of the anime, the opening, the side characters, which have their back stories and their values and are valuable assets to the MC and are not just beautiful faces for the horny ones watching. They are figthers and i enjoy this very much. I always hate when women are treated like food for the mc. and i am glad they are helpful to him besides being beautiful. manipulating them or was it the result of his action of providing for them?""

I love this anime as a typical isekai can turn out well if it is well executed as is the case. With this it also comes hand in hand with a very good character development. Each character is very different from the typical construction of co-star and companions that is usually seen in anime that I like a lot. I love the personality of the protagonist as over time he adapts his vision of things. I like it a lot. I recommend an amount if...you like isekais.En español:La animacion me parecio muy buena, la banda sonora a compaña perfectamente y homogeneamente a la animacion haciendo una obra audiovisulamente hermosa.

Lo recomiendo un monto si te gustan los isekais.', ""It's been a while since i wrote review of my favorite anime series. Now,i wanna talk about isekai anime that blew my mind in so many levels in terms of storytelling and characterization: Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru,also known as The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat.I seen lots of isekai anime and i been reading few isekai light novels and many of them share same kind of story or same kind of characters with same motivations,but there are very few unique isekai that have protagonists with strong backstory or story that you don't see in...your typical basic isekai. This anime is one of them. Why is that? Let me explain why i think of World's Finest Assassin as an good anime adaptation and why i think it's unique.Let me get on main topics,story and characters.Story of World's Finest Assassin looks simple on surface,but the more you watch it,you realize that this isn't your typical isekai story. Most of isekai have stories where characters need to defeat Demon Lord or something like that to save the world,end some wars so they could return back to their world or characters where they want to do something they are passionate about,but they have to go through big struggles and pay price to,for example,read a real book,but there are too many obstacles through that (Ascendance of a Bookworm) or want to enjoy their lives to fullest in peace and protect people and family they care about and do anything for them,no matter what price they must pay (TenSura) and there are power fantasy stories made for escapism,where protagonists don't have motivations and they are overpowered for fanservice and lack strong features and characteristics or only one of these things. (In Another World with my Smartphone,Death March to Parallel World Rhapsody,The 8th Son,Master of Ragnarok,Isekai Cheat Magician and Conception) and there are isekai where protagonists had tragic life,lost what they cared about,gone through serious depression and abuse until their time has came then they reincarnated in another world to start from zero,to have happy new life without same pain and struggles they had in previous lives,but there are also times when things don't go by their favor in another world (By the Grace of the Gods and Jobless Reincarnation) and isekai where protagonist is reincarnated into world of game,book or any media as villain and wants to do whatever they can to reverse their fate. (HameFura)Story of Assassin is about assassin,who is claimed as world's finest assassin,who is reincarnated in another world after being betrayed by organization who raised him to be emotionless killing machine by goddess with one purpose: to kill a hero who will go insane after killing Demon Lord. This is probably the only isekai story i know where protagonist is tasked with killing someone before reincarnation. I seen lots of isekai and none of them had a story where god reincarnates someone to kill a hero. This may seem basic to anime elitists who prefer something that stands out,but for me,it's completely stands out. Assassin,now named Lugh Tuatha De,is reincarnated as baby in family of aristocrats,which may seem to make protagonist little bit overpowered,but aristocratic family weren't only family of asssassins,but barons,one of lowest noble ranks of aristocracy,which means that Lugh wasn't born in some super overpowered family,which is good and would make him balanced. Ever since the his birth,story focuses on Lugh training,growing up and training to get strong enough to kill a Hero,meeting new people that became important to story and meeting girls who would eventually become part of his harem. Then,there are episodes where focus more on introduction of this anime,characters,character developments and shows us a lot of lore to be amused and intrigued by. I would go as far to say that World's Finest Assassin got one of the best isekai stories so far,and one of unique ones as well. I could go on,but i want to make this review spoiler free to make sure that my review gets more attention and to get anime fans into watching this anime.Now for the characters. Let me start with Lugh first. Most of transported or reincarnated protagonists are either NEET,typical high school students,salarymen,office workers,dudes with random jobs,middle aged men,et cetera. This is only isekai i know where protagonist is an assassin,and old man to boot.He was born and raised into organization of assassins,where he trained to be assassin,to kill flawlessly,to be killing machine. He never had any emotions or expressed them. He never showed any regret,compassion or any these kind of emotions when he was killing people. He never learned to love or any emotions because to assassin,emotions get in the way and makes asssassin's skills rusty. That's what he thought until he was betrayed by organization. Upon his death,he felt an emotion for first time: frustration. After being reborn as Lugh Tuatha De,he vowed to live his life not as the tool like he was in previous life,but as human being who can express any emotion,to live with his own choices and decisions.As i expected from author of Redo of Healer. Lugh is not a joke. His personality is really good. I would go as far to say that he got more personality than every personality of generic power fantasy isekai protagonist combined. This anime contains harem,but in most of isekai which have harem,protagonists are often spineless,dense and don't have guts to do a hard thing when girl asks him nicely to sleep with her (in normal or sexual way) or when girl says that they wanna marry him. Lugh is Chad when it's comes to women and anything that most of isekai protagonists don't have guts for. Where else can you find this kind of isekai protagonist? As for his power level,well,it's not on same level as power level of battle shounen protagonists.Some think that Lugh is Gary Stu because of assassination knowledge he had from previous life and knowledge he learned in new life,but that's completely wrong. For me,Gary Stu is word you use for stupidly overpowered self insert protagonist who got no special motivation,no genuine backstory,got generic character design,generic and bland personality,always overpowers his opponents without paying any price,without any struggle and without breaking a sweats. Touya Mochizuki from In Another World With My Smartphone is perfect example,god of Gary Stus. I highly recommend to everyone reading this review to go read light novels or watch anime adaptation to see why is Touya Mochizuki a definition of Gary Stu and self insert.To me,knowledge doesn't make a Gary Stu. To me,what makes Gary Stu is unbalanced brute strength.immeasurable magic power and bland personality. Take a look at Senku from Dr.Stone,who uses his knowledge to restore humanity and to build many things that do not exist in stone world. Is he Gary Stu because he is super smart? No. Can be world's greatest scientific minds such as Stephen Hawking,Albert Einstein,Nikola Tesla,Isaac Newton,Marie Curie called Gary/Mary Stus? No.Unlike Touya,Lugh struggled with several opponents in light novels and paid price for using overpowered abilities and suffered a injuries from using them or fighting opponents that only Hero can defeat. He wasn't overpowered from very beginning,he worked hard to develop abilities that goddess gave him,to develop new spells for assassinations and trained hard to develop his body so he could withstand attacks that would be fatal to normal human beings.He doesn't cheat out everything like Touya does with his smartphone and overpowered abilities that World God gave him. Also,Gary Stu characters can defeat opponents alone. There are many times in light novels and this anime where Lugh couldn't do anything without his lovers or Hero. Also,unlike Touya,Lugh have personality and guts to do hard thing when it's comes to women. In conclusion,Lugh is balanced powerful character with enjoyable personality that assassin characters needs to have.Now let's talk about main characters. Most of isekai characters that are part of protagonist's harem barely have a genuine backstories or good reasons to fall in love with protagonist. Some fall in love just because protagonist is ''nice'' to them. Dia,Tarte and Maha are one of most well written female isekai harem characters,they have a good backstories and good reasons to fall in love with Lugh. I'd like to talk about them,but i can't give you spoilers,it's best that you watch this anime or read light novels to see for yourselves.As for the supporting characters,some are well made,some are hilarious,some are not worth talking about in my review. Lugh's mother,Esri,she is great comedic relief character. Every moment with her is so freaking hilarious that i can barely stop laughing. Lugh's father,Cian,he is pretty cool. He is teaching Lugh everything about Tuatha De style of assassination and to not assassinate as tool,but as human being. He have helped Lugh to grow up not only as human,but to grow strong as assassin. Maha's friends are pretty cute,that's all i can say about them and supporting charactersNow about antagonists.Goddess that revived veteran assassin as Lugh Tuatha De,who told him to kill the Hero,she is very mysterious character and her motivations seem malicious rather than noble. I don't know whether is she real goddess or puppet made by bigger entity,but we will find out soon as more volumes get English release. In very few isekai novels/anime,gods are evil beings who treat everything they create as board game pieces.There are certain antagonists i wanna mention,but they are related to Maha's backstory and final episode,so,again,no spoilers.Is World's Finest Assassin good anime adaptation?I been reading light novels since anime started airing because i was too impatient to wait for new episodes,so my answer is: YES.This is one of the only isekai anime adaptations i know that do not skip any important dialogues or character developments. Most of isekai anime made to promote light novels they are based on or by request of light novel fans take 3-4 volumes,make 12 episodes of them and skip a lot of good dialogue and character developments because of limitations of anime adaptations. On what volume is World's Finest Assassin based on. One. Just. First. Volume. And they did it a justice. I can't think off any anime that is based on only first volume.They did a great job,despite being based on only first volume.Now for animation and art. Not gonna lie,they nailed it. Characters look great,some of items are well drawn,designs are top notch and animation is very good. It's not outstanding like ufotable's animations,but still very good in many ways possible. If i were to say what i didn't like about animation in this anime,there's only one thing,but not a big deal. Sadly,it's spoiler,so i am not able to talk.Music is great as well. Opening song is total fire. It's fits main characters and story perfectly in every way and visuals are god tier in opening. This song is so outstanding that it's replaced one of my top 10 anime opening songs of all times. Ending song is pretty good,i liked the visuals,melody,but i skipped it most of times because it's wasn't outstand like opening song.Voice acting in this anime is great as well. There aren't many familiar names among cast of Japanese voice actors,but some of them voiced memorable anime/video game characters.Dia is voiced by Reina Ueda,who voiced Ganyu from gacha game called Genshin Impact. Goddess is voiced by Yukari Tamura,who is well known for role of Rika from Higurashi When They Cry,Qiqi from Genshin Impact,Jibril from No Game no Life and Suzuha Amane from Steins; Gate. There's much to talk about voice actors,but i need to get to the points about important aspects of anime and World's Finest Assassin.This anime is really fun to watch as long you don't have high expectations. Lugh never ceased to surprise me with his personality,faces he made and how much of a Chad he is. Esri really made me laugh when she is such a doting mother to Lugh,lol! Oh,there are many funny moments with Lugh's harem as well,he he heh. There are many comedic reliefs that makes me enjoy anime even more and more badass,cool stuff that gets me hyped. I always enjoyed every second of every episode.And that's covers it. Now let me share my final thoughts.In my opinion,World's Finest Assassin is not a masterpiece,but it's great anime in general and adaptation is good. After liking it more,reading light novels,i got charmed by it's unique style like no other isekai novel or anime did this to me. Some may disagree with me,but i think of World's Finest Assassin as deconstruction of isekai genre. Many isekai fans debate which isekai is so unique that it's deconstruction of isekai genre,and most of them say it's anime called ''Ima,Soko ni Iru Boku'',but that anime was made in 1999,which was way before isekai craze because isekai genre was blooming early and mid-2010's,so it's can't be counted as deconstruction. Why i think of World's Finest Assassin as deconstruction of isekai?Well,because plot is not what you find in your casual isekai,protagonist was old man and assassin in previous life and was given task that no other protagonists were given,which is usally to save the world,his motivations are look special,main female characters in most of harem or isekai harem barely have strong character,also have no luck with protagonists who are spineless or dense and villains in Assassin are mysterious,but in unique way. Also,World's Finest Assassin is written by Rui Tsukiyo,author of Redo Of Healer. When he was writing Redo of Healer,he came up with most ridiculous ways for revenge plot and to make best and coldest type of dish called the revenge. It's same with Assassin,Rui turned isekai tropes upside down and created mind blowing plot with mind blowing characters. That's why i think of World's Finest Assassin as deconstruction of isekai genre. It's a great series that i found read or watch anytime if i am tired of basic isekai with basic stuff.Some may not agree with what i said in review,but MyAnimeList doesn't have option to use video clips of anime as evidence so i could prove my points. Some of things i said were my personal opinions,but most of them are facts. Please give a this anime or light novels a try,you won't regret it as long you don't set your expectations too high. Have fun! your typical basic isekai. This anime is one of them. Why is that? Let me explain why i think of World's Finest Assassin as an good anime adaptation and why i think it's unique.Let me get on main topics,story and characters.Story of World's Finest Assassin looks simple on surface,but the more you watch it,you realize that this isn't your typical isekai story.

Many isekai fans debate which isekai is so unique that it's deconstruction of isekai genre,and most of them say it's anime called ''Ima,Soko ni Iru Boku'',but that anime was made in 1999,which was way before isekai craze because isekai genre was blooming early and mid-2010's,so it's can't be counted as deconstruction. Why i think of World's Finest Assassin as deconstruction of isekai?Well,because plot is not what you find in your casual isekai,protagonist was old man and assassin in previous life and was given task that no other protagonists were given,which is usally to save the world,his motivations are look special,main female characters in most of harem or isekai harem barely have strong character,also have no luck with protagonists who are spineless or dense and villains in Assassin are mysterious,but in unique way. Also,World's Finest Assassin is written by Rui Tsukiyo,author of Redo Of Healer. When he was writing Redo of Healer,he came up with most ridiculous ways for revenge plot and to make best and coldest type of dish called the revenge. It's same with Assassin,Rui turned isekai tropes upside down and created mind blowing plot with mind blowing characters. That's why i think of World's Finest Assassin as deconstruction of isekai genre. It's a great series that i found read or watch anytime if i am tired of basic isekai with basic stuff.Some may not agree with what i said in review,but MyAnimeList doesn't have option to use video clips of anime as evidence so i could prove my points. Some of things i said were my personal opinions,but most of them are facts. Please give a this anime or light novels a try,you won't regret it as long you don't set your expectations too high. Have fun!"", ""I've been on this site since 2015. I've never written a review before. I know that not many people will read this, as there are plenty of other reviews of this show that are probably less biased than mine will be. Let me explain.There are three fantasies that I have had for as long as I can remember. Number one is the ability to master a system of magic that allows me to create objects out of nothing. Number two is being sent back in time so that I can use knowledge from this era to my advantage, speeding up the development of that...world in the process. And the third is to save a broken girl, destroyed by poverty and horrifying circumstances, who is at the lowest point in her life, yet who retains a heart of gold; in this scenario, I would be the prince who purchases her from the slavers and saves her heart from darkness, so that she would love me in return.Can you guess the three major plot points that form the basis of this anime's story? Yep, you guessed it. This anime feels as if it were specifically targeted at me, as if someone out there had peeked into my mind and said to themselves: I'll make an anime for this person!I was brought into anime, I must admit embarrassingly, by Sword Art Online. The reason is that it hit one and a half of my core fantasies. I've been searching for anime that could fill that purpose ever since. Never, however, have I found an anime that personifies them as well as this one.I can't say anything about how other people will like this anime. As a show without particulars, it is handled well enough to earn its score on this site. But to me, this show is something I've been looking for--and trying to create--for a decade. I've written two whole separate novels whose purpose was to fulfill exactly what this anime delivers. A modern man goes back in time with the power to create objects from nothing using creative assembly of the magic system and, in the process, saves a poor slave girl from a life of horrible destitution. Through doing this, he brings new technology to the people of the world and in the process earns a place in that society.  This is exactly the perfect story for me.Finally, I must mention the biggest thematic draw for me as I consider this story intellectually. It already caught me by the throat with its emotional aspects, but there is one intellectual thing that really seals the deal for me. I must mention that I am an avid fan of Ayn Rand. I know most people won't understand what that means.The main character is utterly, completely, and totally selfish. Everything he does is to serve the single purpose he desires to achieve. Through an application of his mission, he shows that the best way to achieve his goals is to be kind, caring and loving to those who can help him. On the other hand, he shows absolutely no mercy to those who work against him. I believe that this kind of character, a veritable Howard Roark, is the pinnacle of what I consider to be good characterization. While no real human being could act like him on all emotional and physical levels, he personifies the goal that individual humans should strive for; that is, complete and total honesty with the self in a manner that, instead of denigrating his relationships with the world, improves them instead. The main character is a demonstration of beneficial selfishness.I've made my point. I love this anime specifically because it feels as if it were created to target me. At this point, having watched three quarters of the show, I don't care how badly they screw it up. It's a ten in my book, even if the ending somehow tanks. This is my fantasy; one that is so specific to my tastes that I can't imagine it came from anyone other than myself reincarnated into the life of a Japanese light novel author. world in the process.

The protagonist is not the classic good boy hero but rather an assasin who is ordered to kill the hero of this world.Honestly...this anime gets 8/10 becuase the rest of animes i seen recenlty...were pretty trash. If HxH is a 9/10 then this one is a 7-7.5/10. But i hadn't watched anything good and unique these days so this one got my attention which is pretty hard to do the past few years.More SPECIFIC:STORY: 8/10A 50 yo elite assasin get Reincarnated in an Aristocrat family of Assassin with all his memories preserverd, he chooses 5 different skills from a skill tree before reincarnating and starts training from young age in order to later on assasinate the Hero of this world(the reason is explained in the anime). Pretty unique story, haven't heard about anything similar to this.ART: 9/10There hasnt been any crazy fighting scene so far but the world and the details are really beautifull.SOUND: 5/10The music pretty much does not exist and when it does its nothing uniqueCharacter: 8/10The character is pretty unique and really likeable unlike most of shonen protagonists. He is not the classic dumb,pure, innocent protagonist but rather an inteligent and stoic 50 yo who has been supressing his feelings all his life and decides to actually live in his new life.Enjoyment:8-9/10It's been quite the time since i watched 2 episodes of an anime without getting bored and stopping every 2-3 minutes to check soemthing else so...Overall: 8/10This anime does not deserve 8/10. Maybe 7 or 7.5 but considering the fact that most animes are SO SIMILLAR WITH EACH other these days and all have the same cliches this one scores higher just for being original. were pretty trash.

Because this... this is damned near brilliant. Indeed, if I had to hazard a guess, I would say Redo of Healer was written solely for the purpose to get the writer some money so he could focus solely on this - because, frankly, Assassin Isekai looks and smells like a project of love. I think this was what he actually wanted to be working on, and just had to get a foundation to do it. And, frankly - you can tell.Because Assassin...Isekai is blooming marvellous. Story? Intriguing. Art? Amazing. Sound? It has kinetic bombardment, for pete's sake, and the intro is amazing. Character-wise, it could use some work - the highlight of the characters being Lugh's dad, Kira Yoshikage - and the whole harem thing developing is a bit cliche for my taste (not that I'm complaining, it's a hell of a step up from Redo). Indeed, for once I can forgive a dumb incest, cousin-loving plotline - after all, Lugh is an aristocrat; if the Habsburgs are anything to go by, aristocrats kinda always go for the Alabama aesthetic.If anything, my largest complaint is that this wasn't a two-cour show. 12 episodes doesn't do it justice, and what few episodes there are leave me begging for more. It's not a masterpiece by any account, but it's darned brilliant either way - and, honestly? Seeing something that is clearly a work of love, a piece from the heart, gives me some small glimmer of hope for anime of the future. Isekai is blooming marvellous. Story? Intriguing. Art? Amazing.

So, if you\'re looking for a show that brings something that hasn\'t been done before:Do not read this review.

(I wrote more than I though so if anyone cares to read my conclusion summed up, it is in the very end, on ""Overall"", which doesn\'t have spoilers)In summary: the protagonist doesn\'t have any difficulties for anything ever; like, from birth. If you want to watch somebody always be perfect in every single thing they do while everyone loves them, maybe this is for you; but good stories try to convey deep, interesting, often realistic, characters WITH struggles. This is none of it. This review...may contain spoilers.Art: 8 (Spoiler free)Let\'s start by the least worse. The art isn\'t bad and the animators aren\'t doing a bad job overall — sometimes they do major f**k ups though and it looks very jank. The character designs are a bit bland, but passable. I feel the same for the backgrounds, although I admit some places feel more detailed and it\'s a good thing. For me, the best thing about the art are the colors: they mostly feel vibrant and beautiful. Sometimes I\'d say they\'re plastic and unnatural, but usually they are well made. I honestly feel like this strong point is actually a detriment for the show due to how much of a waste this it feels; how much resources they put into such a lacking, uninspiring story.Sound: 5 (Spoiler free)The opening feels like an K-pop or J-pop song and I hate it; it isn\'t bad, but I heard this a million times, just not in anime. I wouldn\'t prefer a generic anime opening but I don\'t like this either. The background music isn\'t bad but it is \'generic classic inspired music\', or \'generic fighting music\', which doesn\'t get in the way but doesn\'t add character either (not even the MC has it, why was I expecting that from the music?). The Ending feels like a dream because it means my suffering has stopped for a brief moment until I remember I live in Brazil.Story: 2 (Contain spoilers)Let\'s go where the fun starts and I trash everything. The story is as uninspiring and as hollow as it can get. It\'s a dreadful, extremely rushed, harem power fantasy.The very beginning is a bit interesting, when we see the protagonist living his real world life. His isekai death is dumb (like most of them), which would be fine if the show wasn\'t trying to shove down your neck that the MC is the most intelligent, expert, fine, smart, skillful human in existence.The ""Goddess Moment"" is cringe, she is really annoying and I hate it — also in every episode the is a short scene with this goddess and, though rarely funny, wouldn\'t be a bad characteristic of the show; had it been done well (funny, interesting or meaningful), I would have praised it.The MC\'s childhood arc is mediocre since he never has any issue ever and whenever an adversity appears in his path he easily overcomes it, no challenge at all; a magic system he has 0 contact and expertise from his previous life is easily conquered, and, of course, the child tutor gets in love with him. Also, he\'s a assassin, not a chemist, why the f**k does he know atomic weight, fusion point and other bulls**t from memory???The \'trading family exchange\' arc feels the same way, but with a new smoking hot waifu. Also the villains in this arc feel very forced: they are bad people because they are bad and ugly, they like money and torturing little girls, that\'s why they\'re p3d0s (ignore the fact that the MC has the mind of a 60+ year old man and young girls are hopping on him like moths with  l ä m p ).Since the show isn\'t over yet — and hopefully I won\'t be bored to finish it when it is —, I can only hope this trend will change and he\'ll actually have some difficulty fighting the hero or whatever. But I know better and this won\'t change. It will be mindless until the very last credit roll and another season of this bulls**t is announced.Characters: 1 (Contain spoilers)I gave it that score because that is the number of characters there are in the show. You see, despite the attempts, the hollow shells that speak and move have no more character than a rock you kick in your way to school or work, thus, I would rather call them ""husks"". Of these, there are many.The worst husk, by far, is Lugh, or how I like to call him: Jesus-Kun. He\'s perfect in every sense and never makes mistakes ever. Even the most powerful chess engine can\'t win against the sexy embodiment of God. He wants to live a life with emotions because his last life sucked a**, but then procedes to give us the most boring, lifeless show ever. He\'s so cold about everything, living life with the only goal in mind of killing the hero, that I\'m surprised the writers didn\'t retroactively change his desire for something else. Like, he\'s 14 or something by episode 8, but all the emotions he felt by then are the most shallow I\'ve ever seen a character in anime have.I don\'t want to talk about the parents because I forgot everything about them and I don\'t want to remember, just know that they\'re very not good.The MC\'s harem is as bad as him, but since we don\'t hear them think too often, it hurts a bit less (even though they speak what they think like 5 year olds so perhaps it\'s just as bad). The blonde husk with big milkers is the most cheery one and is annoying as hell. The MC feels very accomplished when he ""brainwashes"" her and it\'s the most cringe, edgy scene I\'ve ever seen. I had to pause and go smoke to relax after that s**t. The white hair childhood friend one is the cutesy girl. The worst thing about her is that she loves Jesus-Kun unconditionally from the get-go, never feeling jealousy or anything by the fact that the MC is younger but better than her in everything, including magic, which was her strong point. The blue hair one is his step-sister (you know where this is going) and is the quiet one. She is saved by the MC and calls him her enchanted prince. I hate my life and regret my decisions.Enjoyment: 1Why is this on the front cover of Crunchyroll?Overall: 2 (Spoiler Free)This feels like a waste. A waste of the viewer time. A waste of the studio resources. A waste of story potential. Frankly, I cannot understand where the praise for this trash comes from. Has the anime public become this ignorant to storytelling? This isn\'t a anime for children; the show has torture, death and sexual themes all over it. I hate this anime because I\'m afraid that if Ansatsu Kizoku can be successful, the bar is already too low. This is weird coming from the land of perfectionism. may contain spoilers.Art: 8 (Spoiler free)Let\'s start by the least worse.

I thought it was a strange premise for an Isekai but I added it to my list because I enjoy Isekai in general and thought I'd give it a try.Hands down, this is one of my favorite Isekai anime and I'm already hoping that they will do multiple seasons.It has a decent pace (MC is reincarneted as a baby but by episode 5 he's 12), a really great, grounded main character who is completely unflappable, and a story I really want to follow, in a decently fleshed out world.It's not...overly ecchi or pervy, it's very entertaining, and once again, the main character is awesome. He's just OP enough to get the job done, but not so much that everything just comes easy.This is truly one of my favorite anime of the season. Definitely worth a watch for anyone who likes Isekai. overly ecchi or pervy, it's very entertaining, and once again, the main character is awesome.

Definitely worth a watch for anyone who likes Isekai."", ""Another isekai has arrived and once again, we ask the same questions: Is it good? Is it entertaining? Will it bring something new and unknown? Does this show finally give isekais a new standard, like Re:Zero did in 2016?   No, no, no and no.For those who watch anime regularly, the concept of dying and respawning elsewhere (mostly a fantasy world) with the help of a god/goddess/supernatural entity etc. must sound familiar. Why? BECAUSE ALMOST EVERY NEW SHOW USES THIS IN SOME FORM! Seriously, 90% of the modern anime’s stories have been borrowed or literally copied from an older one. Not only does this...question the meaning of copyright, but it also makes almost every idea a cliché. And this show is no different.“The world's best assassin, to reincarnate in a different world as aristocrat” or “Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru”. Already the name gives many people cringe vibes, but when you read the description, it even gets worse. Our lovely protagonist, whom we know almost nothing of, gets resurrected in a different world, where he is tasked by a goddess to kill the hero. And of course, our protagonist agrees! No questions, no complaints, nothing. Because he is an assassin, duh. With this juicy introduction, what can go wrong, right? But okay, let’s put these “prejudices” on hold and look at the show itself.As expected, the show is not good. The first and most important aspect, the story, has failed miserably and the show hasn’t even finished airing yet. Putting the above mentioned reasons aside, the story is still lackluster. Our protagonist is overpowered. While this concept works well in for example One Punch Man, it is not good here. This way, his training is short, he has absolutely zero character development and even the side characters, who are supposed to be weak, get insanely strong in like 1 episode. Plot holes, bad writing and questionable events happen frequently.And talking of the characters: As mentioned before, the MC is bad. Really bad. He is a “master assassin”, with no emotions or anything that roughly imply, that he is a human being. This just doesn’t fit a show like this, where meeting new characters and developing oneself is supposed to be important. While this changes a little bit during the show, the beginning still suffers greatly from it.The side characters are even worse. His accomplices (girls, what a surprise) have basically no importance and characteristics so cliché and shallow, that I could just summarize them in 1 sentence each. And that’s what I’m going to do: Girl 1 was saved by him and now loves him. Girl 2 was saved by him and now loves him. Does this ring a bell? Yes? Good, because that is what happens in almost every isekai. Except, that in some of them, the girls actually do have a personality, other than just love the protagonist without conditions and follow his orders like mindless dolls.

Yeah, this often leads to awkward and senseless situations, but I guess that was pretty obvious.On the animation part, this show once again creates nothing new.

Therefore, a rating of 2/10 seems appropriate. question the meaning of copyright, but it also makes almost every idea a cliché. And this show is no different.“The world's best assassin, to reincarnate in a different world as aristocrat” or “Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru”. Already the name gives many people cringe vibes, but when you read the description, it even gets worse. Our lovely protagonist, whom we know almost nothing of, gets resurrected in a different world, where he is tasked by a goddess to kill the hero. And of course, our protagonist agrees! No questions, no complaints, nothing. Because he is an assassin, duh. With this juicy introduction, what can go wrong, right? But okay, let’s put these “prejudices” on hold and look at the show itself.As expected, the show is not good. The first and most important aspect, the story, has failed miserably and the show hasn’t even finished airing yet. Putting the above mentioned reasons aside, the story is still lackluster. Our protagonist is overpowered. While this concept works well in for example One Punch Man, it is not good here. This way, his training is short, he has absolutely zero character development and even the side characters, who are supposed to be weak, get insanely strong in like 1 episode. Plot holes, bad writing and questionable events happen frequently.And talking of the characters: As mentioned before, the MC is bad. Really bad. He is a “master assassin”, with no emotions or anything that roughly imply, that he is a human being. This just doesn’t fit a show like this, where meeting new characters and developing oneself is supposed to be important. While this changes a little bit during the show, the beginning still suffers greatly from it.The side characters are even worse. His accomplices (girls, what a surprise) have basically no importance and characteristics so cliché and shallow, that I could just summarize them in 1 sentence each. And that’s what I’m going to do: Girl 1 was saved by him and now loves him. Girl 2 was saved by him and now loves him. Does this ring a bell? Yes? Good, because that is what happens in almost every isekai. Except, that in some of them, the girls actually do have a personality, other than just love the protagonist without conditions and follow his orders like mindless dolls. Oh, and of course, how could I forget this, they both try to become his concubines! Yeah, this often leads to awkward and senseless situations, but I guess that was pretty obvious.On the animation part, this show once again creates nothing new.

It wants to be too many things, but none of them work well with each other. It tries to be slice of life, lighthearted comedy, harem, psychological, dark, power fantasy, action, political, proper fantasy, romance drama and more, but the entire thing is like a jigsaw-puzzle completed by forcefully hammering together disparate pieces from several different puzzles. It has too many themes, but does not commit to or fully explore any of them. The result is a shallow-feeling anime that gives you constant tonal whiplash, like when most of an episode is spent on vacuous slice of life, then suddenly, bam! A couple of ridiculously scantily clad girls torturing a man for some reason.Speaking of. The girls. I don\'t know about you, but me, I don\'t think it\'s ok to sexually objectify children just because you made the in of itself questionable choice of depicting them as having like a third of their body weight consist of tits. And also, just over and over stating that the age at which one is considered adult is lower in that world does not, in fact, make it any more ok. We judge things based on our own values, not those of others. There are several other issues of similar nature that I do not feel like talking about, but they all add to the constant sense of unsettling creepiness. Over all, this anime\'s approach to sexuality just feels gross, like it was written by one of those disgusting people calling themselves ""pickup artists"".Then there is the magic system. It is very poorly conceived. For some reason, saying some words backwards makes magic happen. Annoying, and dare I say it, lazy. Now, it seems magic can do pretty much anything, so what do you think they choose to use this magic for? Making guns. Yup. They crammed a magic system into this bloated mass of themes, only to use it to make guns. Not even cool magitech guns or anything, just normal guns that they can make out of thin air. But that\'s not the worst part. There is also the skill system, that they added just to tick the ""game-like"" box, but even though this system has apparently been giving special abilities to people seemingly always, no one seems to know about it. It was used only as a way for the protagonist to be op, to tick the power fantasy box, and to point out just how powerful this hero the protagonist is supposed to kill is. After that, after the first two episodes, it is completely irrelevant.Speaking of the hero, well... At this point you may ask why I bothered to watch the whole thing, as I quite clearly dislike it. I like subversion of expectations, is why. I know it\'s not anything original, but still, I wanted to see what they were going to do with the ostensibly central theme. The supposed core premise. Little did I know that the hero, after the second episode, would not be introduced, relevant or even mentioned in more than passing until the very last episode, where they were unceremoniously crammed in at the very end as nothing but a hook for a second season. Seriously, it\'s like no one in the world, until after the end credits of the final episode, knows that the hero, or the demon lord they are supposed to fight, even exists. Relying on a second season in order to have any time at all for your advertised central theme is not a good thing. The wait was not even slightly worth it.The characters have no depth at all. The girls are all dull and pointless, the goddess acts ""quirky"", or perhaps just inappropriate, and the protagonist\'s parents are two flavors of creepy. The protagonist himself acts like a machine, like a robot trying to infiltrate human society, which one could perhaps argue is appropriate for the story, but interesting or engaging it is not.The art is technically well enough made, but the art direction is questionable at best.The music never quite manages to hit that middle ground between too little and too much. Either it is too little and adds nothing to the scene, or it\'s too much and takes away any tension the scene might have built.Over all, watching this anime made me feel unclean and dissatisfied.

So far, I haven't felt bored and surprisingly this is one of the anime that I really look forward to watch every week along with two others. The anime, as the name suggests, is about an assassin who gets reincarnated to another world as a noble assassin. In his previous life he lived like a tool and now he aims to live like a normal human....So here are my scores:(The review might have some spoilers but they are marked so you can skip reading them)There's a TL;DR at for all those who don't wanna read this long comment.Story: 8/10The story is really good. A simple story line but it's captivating enough to keep entertained.SpoilerThe best part of the story is that the one of base stat that he gets to choose to get in his new life is kept secret. It is said to be a D tier stat but by the way he says it, it looks really over powered. That's what piques my curiosity the most.Art: 8.5/10 (leaning towards 9)The art is really really good. The character design is really great, animation at the times of action is superb. But it's not at a level of 10/10. For reference I would rate Demon slayer to be 10/10.Sound: 8.5/10 (leaning towards 9)The opening and ending songs are good and feel like are meant for the anime. The in anime sound is to the point. Voice cast is also really good and feels like they are really made for the job.Character: 9.5 (leaning towards 9)The best part of the anime are the characters. The MC is really good in my opinion. He is very rational and has the personality fit for the best assassin of the world. His father and mother also have a really fitting personality.SpoilerIn ep 3, when his father tells him about the importance of human feelings for a assassin as he has to judge the person if he is really a threat to kingdom or not. That's what I felt like is the defining point for his father. I really liked it.Enjoyment: 8.5/10 (leaning towards 8)I really enjoyed the anime. There are moments where you feel like wow that's so good, or that's so intelligent, or that's really touching, or thats really cute. I mean you can enjoy a variety of emotions. Its more enjoyable then Mushoku Tensei but not fairly not less then that.Overall: 8/10Tl;drIt's a really good anime. A must watch especially for isekai fans.

Instead of trying to use twenty paragraphs of high vocabulary words by referencing a thesaurus to make completely senseless reviews like some people, I am just going to put my thoughts into a Pros/Cons list.Pros:-The artwork is awesome, I am actually quite fond of it, even though it is kind of similar to lots of other anime.Cons:-The story seemed enticing at first, but literally the ""Hero"" (who was the protagonist\'s goal to kill) was basically not...even mentioned until episode 10 or 11 after being brought up as his assigned task by the Goddess in episode 1.-What filled in this gap in the story? Yep, fan service. It is true that along his journey, Lugh (main character) did make some ""progressions"" by acquainting 3 girls to help him fulfill his goal. But by acquainting, I meant an extremely unnecessary amount of fan service that made me wince at every moment. I mean seriously, there was no time in the show that went about 6 or 7 minutes without cringey fan service.-What in the world was the magic system. In the beginning, this strange card system was introduced for Lugh to select his abilities. These abilities were supposed to play a large part in the show, but I feel like their presence was greatly overlooked when the story was made. His selected cards are mentioned briefly in battles in the anime, but rarely discussed. Oh yeah, and uh apparently the main character has literally everything in the world memorized, included average atomic weights of elements, which is also funny because the world seems to have many luxuries except gold, titanium, etc. It is also funny how the spells that were cast are literally just the japanese words backwards.I could go on, but after struggling through 10 episodes to see some improvement, I think that pretty much sums up what I think. Of course, there are definitely some cool aspects in the show that I probably missed, but in the end, I would give this show a 2. even mentioned until episode 10 or 11 after being brought up as his assigned task by the Goddess in episode 1.-What filled in this gap in the story?

The little twist is that now he has magic, but the concept still seems unimpressing.That said even dull plot could be made into enjoyable anime, but that was not the case here. It will be a tough watch even if you're a fan of assassination.The biggest issue of this story apart from its key selling point being incredibly generic and unimaginative is that everything is displayed in poor manner, with daunting 'noble' habits, manners, events and mores.All that with pinky/flashing color palette and art and characters looking like dolls.I watched...a few animes with nobility in it and not a single one of them had this poor doll-like shallow art style.Although its description of art more than of story, I believe it had to be included here. Lets now talk about the actual story.In my opinion every episode should be interesting on its own, yet here every episode resembles a filler. Apart from being uninteresting, episodes are pulling the story forward towards the climax and MC's aim, instead of themselves being substantial in any way.Unfortunately most screentime is wasted on manners of the nobility, on small talk and doll-like girls trying to tease MC. Its a total harem with boring characters and story.Art 2/10:As mentioned above, everything is 'cute' and 'sweet', every girl including mc's mom looks like 10year old. Not only that but color palette is barf inducing, and generally everything looks as bad, plastic, fake, shallow and unrealistic as possible. Didnt see a single good looking character or scenery.Sound 1/10:So annoying, every female including mc's mother has a 'cute' voice of an 8 year old girl, intentionally speaking in 'sweet' and annoying manner. I dont remember any good songs eitherCharacters 0/10:As said above, all the girls are doll-like and lack personality, and all of them are in love with MC. there are only 2 male characters besides MC and they arent interesting either. EVEN MC is just bland and overpowered. The moral of the story is supposed to be that even assassins can have soul and free will, yet we are getting a soulless, OP MC without personality.I dont know why I watched it. And i dont know why it has a score above 7 when it should be somewhere around 1-4. a few animes with nobility in it and not a single one of them had this poor doll-like shallow art style.Although its description of art more than of story, I believe it had to be included here.

(an actual line for the show)So, world\'s finest assasin is a pretty good isekai and does stuff pretty good actually. It has a decent standard story and surprisingly good and deep characters. However, the show felt like an exposition, it kinda is, it built the world up and it gave questions that were unanswered, and planted seeds to build up future plot points.This anime follows the standard isekai story; strong guy is born, but as a baby this time, and builds his skills and harem as he goes. Mc is very serious...and calculated, as an assasin should be, but I have 1 flaw with his character, well get to that. The rest of the characters are well built and have pretty good depth to them. Also, that horse cg is garbage.I have some problems with the series. First, it left many unanswered questions, we don\'t know what that skill was in ep 2?, who was their son before? and how does the god system work?. Second, it\'s episodes don\'t really have much suspense, for an anime about assassination, I\'d expect more stakes and more thrill. Though, as I said before, this story is basically an exposition and the real stuff happens in the future, but at least have a little and not just the ending. Last, it keeps being stated that Lugh (mc) won\'t be used as a tool anymore and act on his own accord. He does and that\'s kinda the theme of the show. However, he also keeps stating that he chooses who to assassinate and who not to, and I find this weird, since he is always given the right choice. All his missions are morally and naturally acceptable, all his kills were bad people. When I thought the show had fixed that problem in its final mission, it becomes convenient for both parties. I had hoped that mc would actually have to make a choice, to save his target, or to go through with his mission, but we didn\'t gwt any of that, we did get him feeling regret afterwards tho.The show just does a good job in all aspects, it manages to balance building up the characters and advancing the plot really well. The later episodes had more cliffhangers and left us wanting more, and the world building was handled nicely. It\'s characters are really well written, and have their moments. The wholesome moments like Lugh\'s interraction with everyone around him, make us feel satisfaction. Generally, it\'s a pretty good isekai and does stuff well.

In fan service department there is plain and very few booba flashes, nothing exciting or interesting besides that. Anime probably includes all of the tropes of your average isekai harem power fantasy only excluding protagonist being school student/otaku/neet.Overall execution is as average as it gets. This anime is not ""bad"" and it is definitely have nothing good to talk about. Probably best example of 6 rated anime: ""meh"" quality, but does not...suck enough to be dropped. Also huge chunk of character development is off screen and just talked about between characters post factum. What is left to be shown is as stereotypical as it probably could get. suck enough to be dropped.

The story is simple, the character's art style is good, fine animation, and the opening is really good. Every small incident really affects the plot, Isekai elements are as usual but they didn't affect the anime, Ecchi and harem contents also surfaced as regularly in the anime, and some romance is also shown in the series.In short, definitely watch it.What I like about the series is the Plot, Character art styleThe story is also unique never thought Isekai would be this good.I give it...7/10. 7/10."", 'The World\'s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Incestual Lov-*cough* I mean-Aristocrat.... is yet another isekai but this time it\'s about an assassin. Also, fun fact (if this is what you call fun fact), it\'s made by our boi Rui Tsukiyo. That\'s right... the MF who made Redo of Healer... wonderful.Joking aside, this is no Redo of Healer, you will not be scarred by watching this, I promise. You just may end up being a little bit uncomfortable with the slight sweet home Alabama mixed into the protagonist\'s romance (unless that\'s your thing).Anyway, let\'s start with the story...You\'ve got this grizzled...veteran of an assassin... real badass this guy... but he gets isekai\'d hardcore. It gets all Konosuba-like after his death when he is face to face with this hot goddess (only she isn\'t useless this time.... I think) and she basically shits on this man because how could the greatest assassin allow himself to get murked as he did? So after her absolute savagery, she explains that he gonna get reincarnated into a world of magic and swords (you know the drill) only if he accepts the task of killing the world\'s hero within a certain amount of time. Really, this is not a bad plot for the dead horse that is isekai and I was really happy with it. It was exciting and had great world-building aspects... up to a certain point. The first episode is really deceiving since it shows you a snippet of what you assume you will see later in the season, but nah... I don\'t think that scene had anything to do with this season. It was such a badass scene too, so you expect each episode to build up to that, but it kind of fell short. Without spoiling too much, the protagonist has got quite a while before he can even think about killing the hero, so understandably, most of this story is just him preparing or going on side-quests basically. After a while, I feel the story loses focus on what the main goal is though, and honestly, I kinda forgot about it all myself until they suddenly bring it all back in the last couple of episodes. The other issue I had was, for an anime that is supposed to be about an assassin, I felt like I was watching a rom-com after the first few episodes. Now, I love my rom-coms, but I came here for cloak and dagger, espionage, assassin shit. The episodes that focused on our protagonist working on his skills or a mission were great but it just felt minimal compared to how much was focused on his relationships or... *MINOR SPOILER* building a fecking cosmetics business??? Yeah, it was for his ""connections"" and ""influence"" to use for his future missions, but they dedicated like 2-3 episodes (if I remember correctly) to that bullshit and it was kind of boring my lads. After finishing this and looking back though, I realized that this season is most likely just to set the stage for some serious shit to happen in the next season (I can only assume there will be another since the ending was a small cliffhanger) in which case, fine, we had a boring first season, but if the next is gonna be all about assassination missions because we got the boring shit outta the way, then cool, I\'ll live with that. The only thing that really took the life out of the story (for me at least) was the romance issue as I said earlier. It didn\'t feel necessary and it made things uncomfortable near the end when the... reveal (you\'ll understand that later)... is made. Other than that, it was a solid ""okay"", story... I just wish it had more fighting like that last episode.The characters, boi oh boi the characters. We got giga-chad assassin, his MILF of a mom, his John Wick father, his servant/underlings/helpers (I don\'t know what to call em bruh) with unnaturally large plots [as anime always does( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]  for their age... there are just some really cool characters in this story, and that\'s where I start to dislike the story because it doesn\'t show all the badassery that some of them SHOULD be doing. Therefore, these interesting characters you would want to see more of, just get pushed in the background, don\'t resurface for a long time, then they come back for a small scene or a tiny bit of dialogue... like Jesus Harold Christ, just fecking kill someone please and satisfy this violence boner I have (I\'m sorry, I just expected more action from this than there actually was). Otherwise, they all had... good development? IDK, it was kind of weird how stuff unfolded. Naturally, the protagonist is the one you see grow the most (obviously), but other than like... one other character... no one else really makes a huge development or has some kind of impact that leaves you going, ""Wow, that was awesome to see how they grew"". Because we follow the protagonist so much, I just want to say... what a massive asshole. He very blatantly monologues how he essentially brainwashes these girls (the underling/servants with huge plots...) into dedicating their lives to him so he can use them for his gain. Look, in any other situation, this is f^cked... but it\'s kind of a cool trait they gave this guy. Think about it... a dedicated assassin trained as a killing machine and to have no emotion is not gonna care about making a genuine connection with someone and THEN politely ask them for help or something... nah, he totally would use a (pretty slimy) method like that to guarantee he will get what he wants in as few steps as possible. Of course, he somewhat loses this emotionless side to him as the story progresses, but still, it was an interesting detail. I hope a second season will give the protagonist and the other badasses some more badassery to do so it could finally be a badass anime like I feel it could be. That would be badass...Do you know what else is badass? The art/animation in this show. It isn\'t like Violet Evergarden level, but it was still very good, smooth, and the action scenes were not clunky. The characters looked real clean, sharp, and full of color for sure. \'Twas easy on the eyes to say the least, but nothing that will blow you away.Now, would I recommend this? I don\'t know... but... I lean towards a yes. Only because, as I said, I think a second season is what\'s gonna feed us the meat and potatoes of the story. This season was just a building block, a slow one in my opinion, but sometimes that is necessary. I just hope it will follow up with a banger and for f^ck\'s sake please assassinate more people in the next one, I mean, you have ASSASSIN in the title... please use it dammit. So yeah, if you like inces- I mean... intense (but not really) isekais, assassins, and an anime with (I genuinely believe this) good potential... then Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru may be a watch for you! veteran of an assassin... real badass this guy... but he gets isekai\'d hardcore. It gets all Konosuba-like after his death when he is face to face with this hot goddess (only she isn\'t useless this time.... I think) and she basically shits on this man because how could the greatest assassin allow himself to get murked as he did? So after her absolute savagery, she explains that he gonna get reincarnated into a world of magic and swords (you know the drill) only if he accepts the task of killing the world\'s hero within a certain amount of time. Really, this is not a bad plot for the dead horse that is isekai and I was really happy with it. It was exciting and had great world-building aspects... up to a certain point. The first episode is really deceiving since it shows you a snippet of what you assume you will see later in the season, but nah... I don\'t think that scene had anything to do with this season. It was such a badass scene too, so you expect each episode to build up to that, but it kind of fell short. Without spoiling too much, the protagonist has got quite a while before he can even think about killing the hero, so understandably, most of this story is just him preparing or going on side-quests basically. After a while, I feel the story loses focus on what the main goal is though, and honestly, I kinda forgot about it all myself until they suddenly bring it all back in the last couple of episodes. The other issue I had was, for an anime that is supposed to be about an assassin, I felt like I was watching a rom-com after the first few episodes. Now, I love my rom-coms, but I came here for cloak and dagger, espionage, assassin shit. The episodes that focused on our protagonist working on his skills or a mission were great but it just felt minimal compared to how much was focused on his relationships or... *MINOR SPOILER* building a fecking cosmetics business???

Some characters experience things that would leave a person broken, but there is no trauma whatsoever.All characters are 1 dimensional.First episodes were very interesting, reminded me of jobless reincarnation, but it went downhill from there.If characters are evil, they are so evil with no redeeming qualities it's comical.Main hero has girls...falling in love in him, their personality is then further reduced to slave waifu 'I'll do anything for you no questions asked'Very disappointing falling in love in him, their personality is then further reduced to slave waifu 'I'll do anything for you no questions asked'Very disappointing"", ""'The World's Finest Assassin' is a wasted opportunity that won't reward your attention.

Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru didn’t really make any sense and it wasn’t enjoyable.First of all, the introduction episodes were void of any logic. The assassin was killed in an airplane crash by “the organization”. I know that the whole plane was destroyed to show the influence of the organization but then you have to ask… “why?” The protagonist is only a normal human being and has no superpowers. It would be easy to kill him in a non-flashy way like sending a hitman or even doing a Michael Corleone assassination in a restaurant. I...mean even if he is a strong assassin, he is still a human. And since he is a “tool” then he doesn’t have bodyguards since even he is aware that he is just a tool. Who the fuck assassinated him on the plane, Emiya Kiritsugu?! Heck, even Kiritsugu probably won’t destroy a whole plane to kill one person who doesn’t have powers.Then the show has the common problem of most Isekai shows: they exist just to show how OP the protagonist is. You come into a world where you have advanced knowledge of science and probably an OP skill or two. That kind of story could actually still work. But the problem with these shows is that there is no “real story”. We don’t have drama and that makes the characters superficial, one dimensional, and fake. The characters don’t seem like people. For comparison: Mushoku Tensei has a somewhat OP protagonist, but the show tells the story of Rudeus Grayrat, not the story of another OP Isekai protagonist.Then characters and dialogues are badly written. Even if there was an actual story, the show would fail because the characters in themselves are just badly written. Their interaction with each other is just plain boring. We have girls who he manipulated and they fall in love with him even if they know they are being manipulated. I mean probably one would be somewhat acceptable, but this show just liked to shove that personality in all girls in his harem… The characters are unmemorable, with zero personality.And the last that I would complain about would be the CGI animations. I rarely focus on the animations and I focus more in the story. But the CGI animations for the siege were just so distracting that I started to feel off both in the story and in the visuals.Overall, bad show, terrible writing and badly written characters.Overall Rating: 1/10Personal Enjoyment: 1/10 mean even if he is a strong assassin, he is still a human.

The majority of the story is just building up the characters which make sense for a season 1. They did it very well and I can't believe I compared it to other generic Isekai anime. Sure the protag has a small harem going for him, as well as being overpowered, or rather looks to be overpowered. But looks can often be deceiving. As long as they tell a good an interesting story then it's good in my book. If they release a season 2 I can see the story...having more focus than the world/character building they mainly had in this first season.

It seems like any other Isekai at first, but there's just something different about it that makes it entertaining. Maybe it's because the story is a bit different from those general Isekai animes like Isekai Cheat Magic, or Saint's Magic Power is Omnipotent.Art: While the story isn't like the general Isekai animes the art kinda reminds me of some of those general ones. To me the higher quality ones are like Jobless Reincarnation, Overlord, Konosuba, etc. Because they're unique. Though I do like the look of some of the characters.Sound: Opening is kinda catchy.Characters: I mean the MC is an assassin so showing any type of emotion doesn't really suit an assassin, but it does make some elements of the character boring, however they keep you interested in what the MC can do, and how he is practically building himself to fulfill his mission. As for emotion the girls got that covered with being overly happy.Overall: I can't say it's a good or bad anime as of yet, but so far it has been good and I look forward to seeing another episode. having more focus than the world/character building they mainly had in this first season.

As an isekai junkie, I am set to watch all isekai. This is one of those that explore the trope. I would say, this is an interesting watch with a bit of the so-called "" weird anime thing™ "". It is surprisingly good for such a simple concept. Great execution, So I would place this in a solid ""really good"" tier. However, I don\'t recommend this to a normie or someone who just started watching anime. But for us isekai connoisseur, a must watch.Short conclusion: 8.25/10Driving deeperArt: Not super flashy but the action sequence are...pretty good, there\'s some good effort in the production scene. If we are not counting the horrible anime CGI, I would say it is very solid for its quality level. Also, bonus point for the style. 8/10Character: There\'s a character development to some degree. Some are relatable in a way, and some are not. There\'s also the harem + weird anime thing™.  7.5/10Plot: Pretty standard for an isekai, you have the MC who is super OP in some standard. But the twist this time is that the guy is an assassin who pretty capable of manipulating people and plan out some scheme. The narrative is pretty focused on our MC going around ""helping"" the main girl. It is pretty cliche, I can see the flag and predict plot from miles away. If you are a seasoned isekai connoisseur, I am sure you can see it coming as well. Aside from that, the climax moment is a very well execute one, one worthy of getting my ""hell yeah"" shout.  8.5/10Conclusion:I wouldn\'t called it a prime treat but it is pretty close to being one, it is just a good anime to watch as an isekai enjoyer. A ""watch if you are up for a weird anime thing™"" to a normal anime enjoyer. Not recommended for mainstream enjoyer.8.25/10 for me.Lots of thing that make me as an isekai connoisseur enjoy. But the weird anime thing™ is preventing me from recommending it to my normie friend. pretty good, there\'s some good effort in the production scene. If we are not counting the horrible anime CGI, I would say it is very solid for its quality level. Also, bonus point for the style. 8/10Character: There\'s a character development to some degree. Some are relatable in a way, and some are not. There\'s also the harem + weird anime thing™.  7.5/10Plot: Pretty standard for an isekai, you have the MC who is super OP in some standard. But the twist this time is that the guy is an assassin who pretty capable of manipulating people and plan out some scheme. The narrative is pretty focused on our MC going around ""helping"" the main girl. It is pretty cliche, I can see the flag and predict plot from miles away.

But the weird anime thing™ is preventing me from recommending it to my normie friend.', 'This show is weird. The premise is interesting enough as the isekai genre actually sends someone who is not only a competent human being but also not a ""good guy"" into another world.The premise is that a world class assassin is reincarnated into a magical world as an assassin with the express purpose of killing the hero before a catastrophy occurs. This idea is fascinating for several reasons:1) the MC is not given a noble task by any stretch of the imagination. While the context surrounding this at least makes the act necessary, the act itself is not something that is ever shown...to be a good thing, again only being classified as a necessity.2) The MC is not a good guy. A major point in the story is his transition to be at the very least a normal human being with a fairly reasonable conscience. Even the MC himself speaks of his lack of humanity and his acts within the show are sociopathic in nature. Despite this, it is interesting to see him making an effort to attempt to break this way of thinking and watching his slow transition to someone who is less of a mindless tool and more of a human being capable of thinking for himself.3) This show does a pretty good job at making sure everyone within the world are not complete idiots. Unlike other isekai shows where everyone who is not the MC are brainless fools who barely can form a cohesive thought, this series does a good job at making sure the all the characters within the series are at the very least knowledgable with levels of competency in different fields. There is noone in this series who acts in a particularly stupid manner, and even acts that you mat view as questionable have some level of reasoning and logic behind them.While the premise is the strong point of this series, the characters are pretty hit or miss. I do not believe there is anyone in the show who is absurdly annoying, but there are a few here and there who are not particularly likeable. And while the harem aspect of the story exists with a small hint of purpose, it still feels relatively out of place compared to everything else.Overall, I would classify this series as a show that you should watch when you are on standby for other shows to watch. It is not something worth going out of your way to see, but it enjoyable enough to be worth a watch to pad out your yearly anime lists.Did Like / Would Not Recommend to be a good thing, again only being classified as a necessity.2) The MC is not a good guy.

It would be an adaptation of what he considers his best work: World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated In Another World As An Aristocrat. Now I have Completed it, Do I think it's better than Redo Of Healer? Yes, it is. Time for me to share my thoughts.Story: 8What I appreciate about Rui Tsukiyo is that this man can make you think about what other anime have done wrong, that nobody really seems to consider, and such...is the case in this anime, where a goddess now has chosen someone to reincarnate in an isekai world not because he is an otaku protagonist, but actually for his skills that are necessary, and to also give him a family that will actively support him reaching his end goal. Normally, this would feel pretty generic, but in this case, it totally makes sense to do so. Chekov's Gun is also definetly not a stranger in this anime, even when you least expect it, something I can only appreciate.If there is one problem I have here is that for some plot elements, you might want to rely on some suspension of disbelief, as some of the things might require a good Google search session to double check, but that means Rui Tsukiyo actively did research.Art: 6Bad CGI horsecarriages and knights aside, this show doesn't really have anything noteworthy in regards to animation. Character designs and backgrounds look solid and fights look good.Sound: 7Again, nothing to necessarily complain about the sound design. The sound effects were solid and there was a good musical score.Character: 7Before anyone calls Lugh a Mary Sue/Gary Stu, keep in mind that he is the world's finest assassin, so at least his skills are excusable, unlike with other Mary Sue characters, who can do anything without a proper explanation. I also liked how Lugh was established in his previous life, making you believe he is such an amazing assassin, and his memories and experience are maintained in his new life. I do get why some people would think Lugh is, as he hardly has any struggles in his fights, but again, he is an amazing assassin so it's at least justifyable. Other characters also have clear personalities and/goals and are solid.Enjoyment: 9This show is definetly a fun watch. I really enjoy stories that make you think and that really is what this show does.Overall: 8Rui Tsukiyo really has proven himself as a writer. The animation may have its flaws, but the story makes up for it. it's not flawless, but at least justifyable. is the case in this anime, where a goddess now has chosen someone to reincarnate in an isekai world not because he is an otaku protagonist, but actually for his skills that are necessary, and to also give him a family that will actively support him reaching his end goal.

There are so many great ideas presented, but it's like the author just forgot to follow through every time. First of all, mc doesn't really do anything to complete his main quest. The hero being op could've been used to subvert the op mc status, but the mc not seeing or tracking the hero for 14ish years really makes no sense. There needed to be more about the mc's inner thoughts and how he is dealing with his new emotions, especially when he completes his first job. The girls are surprisingly ok for the loli/maid/sister trifecta,...but I wanted to know what mc thought of them as (if they are just pawns, would be interesting change from standard harem). Summary: This show could've been the next shield hero (rational underdog mc that has to work against the odds), but falls flat due to the main points (hero, emotions) being sacrificed in exchange for power fantasy harem. Man literally steals Kirito's look with that dark hair and neck buckle black jacket smh. but I wanted to know what mc thought of them as (if they are just pawns, would be interesting change from standard harem).

Man literally steals Kirito's look with that dark hair and neck buckle black jacket smh."", 'I have no idea whatsoever where this show came from or why I decided to watch it, but it had no right to entertain me as well as it did.As the premise goes, the title pretty much lays it out. Right when our world’s greatest assassin is about to retire, he is betrayed by the organization he was raised by and killed. He had spent his whole life dulling and burying his emotions, but in his final moments, he regrets living his life as a tool. Luckily, a Goddess pulls him into a purgatory-type place with a proposition. Normally, when a human dies, their soul...gets their memories and personalities reset, then reincarnated, but she is willing to make an exception for him, reincarnating him with all of his memories and skills intact, just as long as he is willing to do a particular job for her. In his estimation, fulfilling her one request seems like a small price to pay in order to get a second chance at life, this time not the life of a tool, but rather a life lived on his own terms. He accepts and the isekai story proper commences.This is neither here, nor there, but the aesthetic of the Goddess’ realm reminded me a lot of No Game No Life’s eccentric color palette. The show’s visual identity is otherwise pretty generic, with the exception of the shiny texture a lot of the hairstyles got, which reminded me of studio GoHands’ Hand Shakers.What I appreciated first and foremost is the fact the character’s origin in the origin world is given a proper amount of oxygen. Much like with Tanya von Degurechaff, you become invested in his origin story and world to the point that the isekai trapping makes sense. Is this story a necessary masterpiece that will forever enrich human culture? No. It is a pretty middle of the road power fantasy show. It is not a story that needed to be told. However, given the desire of the author to tell it, he or she, at the very least, makes proper use of the isekai genre. As it stands, the story could not have been told as a legitimate high fantasy. This is something I greatly appreciate, what with the ungodly cornucopia of isekai shows having a completely irrelevant origin world that’s part of the story for a grand total of 10 seconds, give or take. They do that just for the sake of cynically injecting themselves into a genre they know is popular. I respect isekai stories that actually give a compelling reason for being isekais.Ansatsu Kizoku is not a story you could ever accuse of moving too quickly, but it is always moving, and I found the protagonist’s progress fascinating. There is no timeskip from birth to adulthood. The show’s first 7 or so episodes deal with his development at ages 6, 8, 10, 12, and finally, 14, which is as old as he gets by the end of the season.There is some child nudity in there that is, there’s no two ways about it, just fucking weird, but it is what it is. If that disqualifies the show for you, that’s completely understandable and probably healthy. There is much ado made about how his relationships with the people in his party are strictly utilitarian, so as to enable him to fulfill to Goddess’ quest, but the anime wants to have its cake and eat it, too, because he falls into genuine love with one of the heroines, who is 14 or something, meanwhile he is effectively a dude in his 60s. Yeah, I mean, Japan, y’know… what can I tell you?Still, as I mentioned before, what attracted me to this show and kept me invested was the sense of progression of the protagonist’s various ventures. While he is certainly overpowered, and his knowledge of modern physics and chemistry absolutely comes in handy, the point is made very specifically that he is not this world’s top dog. As such, in stark contrast to Ainz from Overlord, who literally has no adversaries in the New World, and the only reason a story exists there at all is his own paranoid and overly conservative temperament, the careful and calculated nature of Lugh’s (our assassin protagonist) plans makes perfect sense as the quickest and most logical way to approach his goal. Unlike Ainz, he wouldn’t be able to conquer the world overnight if he wanted to, so the show mercifully doesn’t birth all that many “Well, why doesn’t he just…?”-type questions.If Ansatsu Kizoku has one meaningful problem, outside of the moral challenges outlined above, it’s the fact that the reasons the various supporting cast members join Lugh’s party are fairly thin – and I’m going to reveal right here and now that when I say ‘supporting cast’, what I actually mean is just his harem. Yeah, this is a straight-up harem story – literally. That’s all fine and dandy. All I’m saying is that the reasons them bitches become loyal to him, and the degree of devotion they suddenly show him because of his actions towards them, that are honestly not that big of a deal, is pretty ridiculous and had me raise an eyebrow every now and again.I would hesitate to even call this an action show per se. Through very similar in concept to Eminence in the Shadow, it focuses a lot more on the political and economic aspects of the protagonist’s evolution. The lack of action is one of the elements that has attracted a lot of the series’ criticism, but I found it enormously engaging nonetheless. Naturally, don’t expect something on the level of the 1st 4 seasons of Game of Thrones, but it’s certainly better than the rest of it. gets their memories and personalities reset, then reincarnated, but she is willing to make an exception for him, reincarnating him with all of his memories and skills intact, just as long as he is willing to do a particular job for her.

EXCELLENT even. By episode 2 I was psyched to see what would happen next. Up to episode 5 it was very good.-Members of the harem are likeable if a bit trope-heavy-The gunplay, combat and magic are all fun to watchReasons NOT to watch this:-Episode 6 handles contentious, unnecessary rape themes very poorly-Protagonist is an OP Mary Sue...-CGI horses completely break immersion of the beautiful art style-the mom is an unbearably cringey would-be-Milf-seeing 'fitness' scenes was also deeply uncomfortableThe protagonist Lugh is likeable; very ironic given what he starts of as: a jaded cold-blooded mercenary whose life begins anew as an aristocratic boy is charming to watch unfold. Seeing him abuse the system of the world he's granted access to is genuinely entertaining to watch at first. There are also genuine feels to be had with this anime with almost every major character. Seeing him learn to love his world as a second chance and want it to succeed from EVERY conceivable angle makes it legitimately unlike anything I've ever seen. Down to making sure he optimizes cooking for IRL experience STATS from a young age.Why I'm disappointed in TWFA (The World's Finest Assassin etc) is that while the character grows up from a little boy to a young man somewhat gradually, he is so good at abusing foreknowledge from his world and despite having the prior mind of a militant sniper, he still somehow has atomic numbers and whatnot memorized to abuse the heck out of magic. And this would be incredibly fun if ANYTHING ever went wrong, or if there was PAYOFF to any of the emotional stuff you endure trying to get to know the main characters of the harem. But you don't.Some REALLY REALLY bad people they make you hate, simply do not get their just desserts despite ASSASSIN in the title and I was pissed about it, so I probably am not alone.Out of all the characters, Tarte is my favorite, but she really gets the short end of the stick being just a means to an end. In a perfect world, she would get the happily-ever-after she CLEARLY DESERVES.Overall, this anime has a strong start before falling flat on its face, and then manages to keep you satisfied enough with what buildup occurs before a very short encounter with the antagonist.

I'll be giving you all the necessary information about a show in just a few sentences and a following recommendation.Today featuring: Sekai Saikō no Ansatsusha (SSA)SSA features a good isekai backstory. There's a valid reason why the protagonist gets reincarnated. There's some depth behind the reincarnation with bits of teases thrown into the plot.The overall plot is fine for the most part. Features various story arcs that are all somewhat exciting to follow but are nothing overwhelmingly well written.A big part of the power system is magic and particularly spell crafting. This is a bit of...a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's unique and entertaining on the other however the processes and outcomes are a bit ridiculous if you take the setting medieval fantasy setting into consideration.The worldbuilding is a bit lackluster. The show plays in some kind of early renaissance time with different kingdoms and different houses but there's little to no connections, story or political conflict between them that drives the story.There's barely any focus on the main narrative which is killing the hero of the world. We don't see the hero, we don't know what he's doing, we have little information on why he needs to die. That's unfortunate because it is somewhat of a unique quest that's not (yet) embraced in the story.The main character is a bit of a fresh take to the isekai genre as he is not a former neet, shut-in, antisocial creep, or what else. He does however bring 2-3 cliche isekai tropes with him. There's a solid connection to his former self.His reincarnated character is a basic protagonist with no outstanding qualities but I found nothing of his character particularly bad either.The side cast varies heavily in quality.The relationships throughout the whole of SSA between the main character and his female harem cast is really bothersome as it kills the otherwise rather mature and reasoned setting and narrativeI could literally show you dialogues from which you would think they are out of hentai.The animation is basic, nothing special nothing to fancy. It's sufficient in every way. Some vfx look really cool in fights.Music is meh. The ost is there when absolutely needed. Didn't stick with me at all though. The sfx are good.Recommendation?: As my points already suggest this is a mediocre anime. Won't blow your mind. Won't make you feel bad for watching it either. If you especially like isekai it's a worthwhile watch.My score:Story: 6.0Characters: 6.0Animation: 7.0Sound: 5.5Enjoyment: 7.4Overall: 6.6(Also refer to my profile for scoring criteria) a double-edged sword.

It is one of those series where you NEED the plot to be short, to the point and fast, rather than being a soap opera. always making us feel like there\'s something coming up, but turns out to be nothing. the primary plot seems to be who\'s the goddess and why she wanted our MC to kill a certain character in...exchange for the reincarnation. but as this is just the introduction, we mostly don\'t touch that part of the plot. but in this season, we just mostly have MC growing up as a genius (which is beaten into you again and again, so that you won\'t forget), while increasing harem count along the way, and it just gets progressively generic as time goes on. most of the subplots are him just being ""sherlock"" like and executing perfect plans.Art: 6The better part of the anime is that the characters are gorgeous/cute. goddess who ccosplays a LOT, MC\'s mother and harem are really cute. the color pallete is pretty generic, but its still at an acceptable quality. we rarely see any messed up frames, even during the blasts of magic/firepower. and the consistency helps us keep on watching the series.Sound: 8The OP and ED are great. not much to say here. average tier background music.Character: 5MC:too many people get baited by the ""MC is not a loser shut-in, but a world class Assassin"". don\'t expect much. its a self-insert power fantasy character. he\'s more a Movie type Assassin from hollywood, who\'s great looking, cooks perfectly, talks perfectly, knows everything (including making a missile from scratch), executes perfect plans and any mistakes that happen along the way also happen ""to be part of his mastermind plan"". steals the heart of every woman he talks to. he\'s sort of manipulative, which some might like. but its still an old man\'s mind playing with 10 year old girls, not exactly what i like to watch.Goddess:She\'s the one character that sort of has any mystery element to her. we have zero idea as to who she is, but every time she is on screen, we are having fun watching.Family:The father is pretty memorable as he\'s serious but also a good family man. he\'s one of the few characters who does not fall into any of the tropes imo. Mother is doting, loving, pouting sort you see in every other anime.Harem:The first one\'s trait is that she is loved by MC. I remember nothing else that makes up her character.The second one is ""saved"" by MC and is basically a puppy that follows him. no personality except that she loves him.The third one is the only character that has a lot of exposure and actually has a life even without MC. ofcourse, still saved by MC and loves him, but she is smart and if her character is not ruined, she might actually be a great supporting character in the whole series after the father.Enjoyment: 4It was pretty okay at first episode, but as the plot progresses into the ""filler"" mode where we are just going through a list of subplots while waiting for main plot to progress, we start feeling like our time is just better spent elsewhere. it is hard to know whether you should watch a series. but if i could go back in time and tell my old self about this, I would recommend to avoid this. I\'m not saying that this is bad, but if you think watching soap operas is a waste of time, then consider this in similar taste. if you are a newbie, then you might be fine as you won\'t notice the overused tropes or sloppy writing of Isekai which you will observe eventually as you watch more and more.OverallMy review is not based on any biases like the Author writing redo of the healer. I didn\'t watch that, and I prefer to judge the series by itself, rather than what kind of a person the Author is. especially as Anime is its own thing with a LOT more input from a LOT more people than just the Author of the novels. exchange for the reincarnation. but as this is just the introduction, we mostly don\'t touch that part of the plot. but in this season, we just mostly have MC growing up as a genius (which is beaten into you again and again, so that you won\'t forget), while increasing harem count along the way, and it just gets progressively generic as time goes on. most of the subplots are him just being ""sherlock"" like and executing perfect plans.Art: 6The better part of the anime is that the characters are gorgeous/cute. goddess who ccosplays a LOT, MC\'s mother and harem are really cute. the color pallete is pretty generic, but its still at an acceptable quality. we rarely see any messed up frames, even during the blasts of magic/firepower. and the consistency helps us keep on watching the series.Sound: 8The OP and ED are great. not much to say here. average tier background music.Character: 5MC:too many people get baited by the ""MC is not a loser shut-in, but a world class Assassin"". don\'t expect much. its a self-insert power fantasy character. he\'s more a Movie type Assassin from hollywood, who\'s great looking, cooks perfectly, talks perfectly, knows everything (including making a missile from scratch), executes perfect plans and any mistakes that happen along the way also happen ""to be part of his mastermind plan"". steals the heart of every woman he talks to. he\'s sort of manipulative, which some might like. but its still an old man\'s mind playing with 10 year old girls, not exactly what i like to watch.Goddess:She\'s the one character that sort of has any mystery element to her. we have zero idea as to who she is, but every time she is on screen, we are having fun watching.Family:The father is pretty memorable as he\'s serious but also a good family man. he\'s one of the few characters who does not fall into any of the tropes imo.

Therefore, certain parts of the review are based on speculation from watching the anime without knowing what is happening in the LN.Story: The story for this isekai has a similar setting as to other isekai anime where the main character (MC) gets summoned by a divine being (in this case the gods/goddess) to either save or explore the other world. However, unlike other isekai anime where the MC is more distracted by the otherworldly environment that he/she is experiencing the MC in Strongest...Assassin immediately gets down to business and tries to grasp the options he has in his current situation. This interaction reminded me of Cautious Hero where the MC in that anime also tries to understand his situation with the options he has. This method of execution (for both Strongest Assassin and Cautious Hero) immediately tells the viewer this isekai anime has little to do with exploration and more to do with setting a road map/achieving objectives to achieve the ultimate goal, in this case, the Strongest Assassin is to kill the hero whereas Cautious Hero is to kill the demon lord. However, a crucial difference between Cautious Hero and Strongest Assassin is the limitations the summoned MCs have for achieving their goals. Cautious Hero takes it for granted that the summoned MC will always have the support from the divine realm with his safety in mind whereas the Strongest Assassin only has ONE chance at getting this right (in other words death = failure). Therefore, the Strongest Assassin provides a more serious tone where everything rests with the MC\'s capability to provide himself the greatest advantage possible over the hero - who is considered as the most overpowered character in their world.The anime\'s execution of the story throughout the anime is very structured and well thought out since the viewer is always aware of the MC\'s thought process and reasoning (in every episode) on how he would take any minute opportunity to provide himself the greatest advantage over the hero. As a result, many of the characters that we are introduced into the series have a specific role that would aid the MC in the story in completing his ultimate objective. This makes this anime more interesting to watch since there is little need to ""show off"" the MC\'s talents by making him go through against mob characters. Any character that the MC interacts with only highlights his strategic thinking and characterisation with the said character themself having relevance since they will have a minor/major role later in the story, such as the three heroines you see on the poster art. This style of execution is very similar to The Irregular Magical High School Student where the MC in that anime also does something very similar where each character he interacts with all have an important role in the story and the contrast between him and them highlights the MC\'s skills and talents all the more powerful. However, there is a major difference between the MCs in Strongest Assassin and Irregular Magical Highschool Student which is that one thinks of themself as a tool and the other does not (simply speaking, it is a little more complicated in the Irregular Magical Highschool Student). This contrast of the MC being a tool for assassination on Earth is constantly brought up to his present (isekai) assassin lifestyle and provides many key character moments throughout the story - this is expanded in the ""Character"" section.One interesting note in the world-building is that the magic system used highlights a potential design done by the goddess (or higher beings) that prevents the people from discovering more powerful spells as well as loopholes that can make them stronger. This gives a glimpse that the goddess has more influence than she lets on (further proven when we are shown her previous summoning attempts to kill the hero) and if that is true displays a more complicated story where killing there is more than killing the hero.Character: The main selling point for this anime is that all the characters have a specific role for the MC either directly or indirectly. It might seem an exaggeration but given the circumstances, the MC requires every opportune moment to get a slight advantage over the hero even if it is just using them to gather information on civil or national affairs (as they say information is key). Furthermore, (like I have mentioned before) the constant theme that keeps being mentioned is the MC being a tool for assassination on Earth to his current isekai life where this difference involves the characters the MC has interacted with. This constant comparison between his two lifestyles does bring some interesting insight and character development about the MC but it does get predictable since we know the MC wants more than just being a tool for assassination, thus human emotions such as romance and dependence become a very prominent (and predictable) variable that would influence the MC\'s actions. Although, this makes it all the more interesting and fun to watch since we are seeing the MC grow and gain new experiences that he has not had before (in his life on Earth).As for the other (human) characters, in exchange for their simple personalities (which I mean their complete devotion and support to the MC thanks to his techniques on making them willingly support him) each have a decent backstory and characterisation that makes you believe that their support to the MC makes sense, even if you say that it is just pure luck that he met them (which he does admit himself... later averted when you consider the goddess). Of course, the fact that there are three heroines that support him does make it a little annoying considering it is very predictable that they will not only be his allies but something more (...hint...hint). In my opinion, I would prefer more balanced allies where it is not only just the heroines but some male friends that he can also place his trust in (or manipulate).Apart from the MC the only other character that (I believe) is interesting is the goddess. Like I have mentioned earlier the world-building and the story implies the goddess is hiding more than she lets on and despite her saying that she has little involvement with the world it does not seem to be the case, when you take into account how the MC and (one of) the heroines first meet, Tarte. Therefore, this brings the hero and demon lords into question considering she wants both of them gone. As such, she could redefine the plot of the story if what I believe is true. On the other hand, I do find that her intelligence is severely lacking since we were given a glimpse of her previous summoning attempts where each one failed dramatically. (I know those were meant for comedic purposes BUT this does lead her decision on choosing the MC so it does have some relevance on her intelligence). The reason was that every other person summoned was clearly not adequate for the situation either because of their lack of understanding or her lack of sympathy/empathy on giving them a clearer picture of the situation. Therefore, you can argue this could all have been over if she was a little smarter in her choices and decisions since she could have sent multiple talented individuals (who have a similar mindset to the MC) to kill the Hero. BUT that is also why I doubt her true cause considering she can always send summoned people from other worlds (implied to all be from Earth) to the isekai world implying she has more influence on the isekai world than she lets on.Art and Sound: The art and animation look decent. The battle animation has a decent quality though not ufotable level it does covey the power and speed the MC and other characters have when fighting. The OP was fitting for the anime since it conveys a feeling of a person trying to complete a mission through any means possible (further reinforced with the animation). Whereas the ED provides an opposite contrast to the OP where it brings the feeling of someone waiting for a treasured person which could imply human emotions that the MC will develop in the story.Overall: Despite being another isekai anime it provides a different angle to the summoning system in isekai genres. The majority of isekai anime typically do not have a reason to summon the person to another world apart from convenience. It is rare to summon a character based on their character traits and/or achievements in life. Therefore, this anime is one of the rare ones that do just that, summon the right person for the right job. I enjoyed the story and the character development of the MC (if you ignore the fact the goddess was being a little idiotic) but I do believe it would be better if there was a more complex magic system. The magic system was easy to understand but due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of how the magic system works in that story, I do not see its effectiveness apart from enabling the MC to have access to modern technology that was on Earth. If there were more complex layers in the magic system then it might be possible to do something similar like in Irregular Magical High School Student where the MC in that anime finds potential loopholes in the magic system to create overpowering magic spells that no one can counter. Although, these points are just me being nitpicky so in the end, I recommend watching this anime if you prefer an isekai anime with a more thought-out plot with a little more all-rounded characters.

MC is summoned to fantasy world, not as a hero, but as an assassin who is tasked with assassinating the OP hero.Did I enjoy it?This show does things better than I believe most in the same genre do. While he is OP, he has to defeat the hero who is supposed to have like 6 times the abilities he has. Not to mention that there's ACTUAL romance. There's some heavy topics like human trafficking and implied rape which was no bueno but that arc only lasted for 2 episodes and was able to carry on afterwards....This is definitely meant for a more mature audience,  especially since the BD will likely have uncensored scenes.

Nonetheless, the main character is very plain. It does not show any character development from his previous life as an assassin. In addition, the female characters in this show are simple as hell. Furthermore, I can not understand why the characters have such a young age, especially when they are being sexualized constantly; why not only make them young adults or in their final teenage years. It is hypocritical to have an episode related to pedophilia and human trafficking. Then the protagonist...manipulates two girls to join his freaking harem. On top of that, the relationship does not seem from someone just thirteen.Suppose they want to reinvent the isekai genera. In that case, they should write better female characters that are not only there to constantly praise the main character. Additionally, age should matter, and they can get rid of their weird fetish. manipulates two girls to join his freaking harem.

They rush to put it on a pedestal and talk about how it truly is the redemption story of a true monster, yet what they claim simply isn\'t here. The protagonist is reincarnated and proceeds to train extensively as an assassin, warding off praise and simply becoming the pro-typical isekai protagonist. At least in Redo of Healer, we understood the motivations for becoming the unapologetic monster that the protagonist there became. In...this series, there is tons of inner monologue about being more than Assassin-kun was in his past life, but none of it amounts to anything.Oh, you read that right. The protagonist dies in the first episode, is told by the isekai goddess that he has to kill the Hero at a certain point, and that he can do whatever he wants before and after. The protagonist gets born into a family of assassins and begins training almost immediately, with seemingly zero desire to have a social life. The only indication we are aware of that he does anything outside his family\'s manor is a couple scenes of him hunting and the peasantry of his realm begging him to help with their problems. All of this, of course, to serve his ultimate purpose.Tell me, how does healing the upset stomach of a cow help you learn how to kill the OP hero?But, I\'m probably being unfair, right? I mean, maybe Lugh (our protagonist) is really changing into ""more than a tool."" Well, if he were, he\'s made as little effort as possible in his dialogue and demeanour to express it. Hell, the only thing approaching emotion we see from him comes from his first assassination, and the guy had a moment post-kill where he saw the wife of his target weeping over her now-dead husband. He even monologues about how he regrets nothing about the job, so why it would ""stick with him"" at all comes off as confusing. Why should this job matter if you can rationalize that it was necessary?The world-building is weak. A good series has set rules for what magic can and cannot do, and the restrictions on individual capabilities within that system. Lugh took very mediocre abilities during his skill selection process prior to reincarnation, but somehow managed the miracle of such a ridiculous power level that he ends up besting his father at the ripe age of 12. I want to put forward that his father is a practising assassin and surgeon besides, so precision and patience are key concepts he should be familiar with in spades. Yet, a child whose combat experience can be summed up as ""I fought a pack of wolves and won"" managed to best him. Oh, right, he\'s reincarnated with his memories. Obviously, he\'s the superior assassin guiz!!And, to continue with the world-building bit, they have make-up, but somehow never figured out how moisturizer works. The fucking Roman\'s had moisturizer down to a science before the time of this setting. Also, they have magic and even a language and numerical system for the different Earth-based elements, yet only Lugh has ever attempted to craft his own spells. Heck, one of his waifus, Dia, ends up crafting a few of her own, but the magic system is so inconsistent that one spell nearly screws her up, and another just happens to work fine.The world is far too inconsistent, and the inner monologues of the characters blatantly contradict their motivations, yet no conflict arises at any point to effectively challenge this cast of tropes. The ""Hero"" in episode 12 is basically nuked from orbit, and I have to laugh at the author\'s lack of understanding about the real issues relating to an orbital railgun. Hey, bud, it wasn\'t that the rods would disintegrate in the atmosphere. That could be dealt with easily. The issue has always been the logistics of setting up an orbital railgun.Ultimately, this wasn\'t a story worth telling. In perhaps the worst display of self-awareness, either the script-writers or the author put a line in episode 12 to summarize the show in its entirely: ""I don\'t even know how assassinations work anymore.""Neither does this show.

The issue has always been the logistics of setting up an orbital railgun.Ultimately, this wasn\'t a story worth telling. In perhaps the worst display of self-awareness, either the script-writers or the author put a line in episode 12 to summarize the show in its entirely: ""I don\'t even know how assassinations work anymore.""Neither does this show. Skip it.', ""I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I had such high hopes for this one. But like most isekai of this era I was quickly faced with the harsh reality that you cant have an anime geared towards greasy dudes without the oversexualization of 12-14 year old girls.The overall plot is really interesting and anime where the MC is really smart and powerful have never really bothered me but GOD the addition of 1. the MC blatantly manipulating one of the girls and 2. said girls being incredibly sexualized was just not needed at all. Fan service is chill if it's of y'know....Adults?I had a couple more gripes with this anime but they're not that bad and don't really ruin the show much.

But nothing is in your face bad throughout the show. It just lets you enjoy what's going on and you don't need to think too much about it. It uses a pretty soft magic system which may appeal to some more than others. Personally I'm partially to pretty hard rules in a magic system, but in this case I wasn't bothered by it. I finished this in a single watch which was just dreadful for work the next day but it kept everything fresh...so I can tell you honestly...Do not watch for the plot and don't watch for the characters. It succeeds in not being a fun concept by name that burns off quickly and is better than most isekai in my opinion where it doesn't rely on the tropes. But if you're going to watch this, then do so to have fun. If you're looking for something plot heavy or character driven then this isn't the show for you. I rate it as a 6/10 but that's by no means a bad thing. It's just a fun anime to watch. I look forward to watching the second season but there's not all that much deep to analyse. so I can tell you honestly...Do not watch for the plot and don't watch for the characters.

As mentioned the concept behind the story was unique but overall the story itself wasn't, this anime could've greatly improved by focusing on training, the combat and magic system, and the realities of assassination.Instead what we got was to be teased at all of those things only to receive an average isekai story involving the importance of family and of course a few ecchi esque love interests helping the protaganist overcome his weaknesses.The last third of the anime felt rushed only to end on a cliffhanger, making the anime about the defeat of a hero only reveal the heros looks and name for about five seconds at the end, this would've worked much better as a 2 cour, which is a question for the studio really.Some episodes/parts of episodes were out of place, for example the orphans being abused was just unneeded when it was completely irrelevant to more than about 5 minutes of the skincare brands plotline and the main side character of that part having seemingly absolute no trauma from it.The story just wasted places to be dark and overall ended up blander than it should be, with too much of a focus on ecchi and typical family/friendness.The art of the anime was nothing special, very average and none of the characters had any particularly outstanding designs or features, I'd say the most interesting design was actually the assassin as an old man before the isekai aspect even starts, and possibly the god/automata that has to report to a higher being.However there was nothing bad about it either, and some of the landscapes were decent. The design of magic circles and the impact of magic and weaponry was designed fairly well as were the fight scenes however these were more limited to training so were not really put to use as much as I wouldve liked.Sound wise I'm not really qualified to comment as it's something I dont really focus on so its harder to review unless its really poor or really outstanding.Again I would say just average, I came into this anime knowing nothing, and I do not know much about anime sound teams anyway so I cannot comment on sound design or voice acting in comparison to the other works of the teams.However it got the job done for what it had to do,I mentioned a lot about the characters in the story so I'll just reiterate the most important points.As I've said I think the biggest issues are the wastes in characters potential, specifically with the main character and his three love interests, who were dumbed down from potentially cool assistants to love interests who help for the sake of it and are just there.No character specifically stood out apart from the protagnists original life, there weren't too many involved and there were not any particularly memorable ones nor were the main characters motives very strong, bringing in the issue that we don't even know anything about the main antagonist or his motives, the hero, again questioning why a 2 cour wasn't pushed heavier for this, but maybe thats just a reflection of the shift from mostly 24 episodes to 12 in recent years.Overall this was still a decently enjoyable watch and I will watch a second season if it is to be released, especially as I enjoy the concept of the isekai genre, but it is not an anime I will remember and rave about.If you enjoy the isekai genre I would reccomend a watch, especially as it is only a short 12 episodes so is easy to breeze through, if not though, you are not missing any groundbreaking concepts or ideas.5/10 was squandered uneccessarily, the story ended up being oversimplified, but yet it still had potential with the focus on training to become ready to defeat the hero; The synopsis certainly drove towards that direction.

From the get-go, I could already tell this anime was going to be another dumpster fire but I trekked on regardless.The biggest thing that has always dumbfounded me with the isekai genre is the people who are transported. I know the reasoning behind the people is to have them be like the people that enjoy this genre like the otaku from Muskoku Tensei but the reasoning never ever made sense to me. In Konosuba at least it made sense because they reincarnate multiple people...but why reincarnate a lazy good-for-nothing as the hero? So they can live out their fantasy? Sounds like a loud of bullshit to me. Then you got this anime, where the person being reincarnated was the best assassin in the true world, at least it makes sense, that is literally the only thing this anime has going for it.I will give the anime props by going through some darker themes such as human trafficking as presented in the first and later episodes but that in itself also falls into the isekai trope of all the villains just being rapists. Furthermore, one of the main girls who was in that position could have had some major character development but they completely ruin any chance they had with her by simply making her the number 2 in the main character\'s harem. It\'s just a load of hot do-do.The art is the same copy-paste style that\'s in every single anime these days, remove the hair, change all the eyes to black and they all look the exact same. The main character is just another ""enter op mc here"" style that\'s just a copy-paste from SAO and Smartphone Isekai. There is absolutely no originality put into this anime and you can tell from episode one. I truly can\'t think of a single thing I liked about this anime or that made it stand out from the others in the genre.If I had to say one thing, however, it would be the premise behind the main character getting resurrected. To avoid spoilers I will not say what it is but it\'s quite literally the only thing this anime possibly has going for it.2/10, Dumpster Fire. but why reincarnate a lazy good-for-nothing as the hero?

The anime started with a good note presenting the MC as a ruthless mature man, but unfortunately, rather than helping to create an interesting character it serves the sole purpose of making the main character overpowered. Yes, solely. Other than that it, it is not reflected in the behavior of the character; someone might say ""But look, he is still ruthless, cold, and manipulative, which is not something you see in young boys"" and that would have been a valid point had the main character not been able...to turn his companions into the same ruthless and cold killing machines. This brings me to the second disappointment: the characters. First and foremost, the MC is NOT likeable at all: even when he ""saves"" the day, it is revealed through his thoughts that he did this not out of good will or compassion, but to make people serve his needs, he even says that he brainwashes people. That makes him relatable, doesn\'t it? Then we get his companions, or to call it by what it is, his harem: somehow in the course of a few months he managed to turn a horrified little girl that was about to be raped into a sadistic killing machine, who tortures people without as if it was nothing. Looks realistic. And for the plot, the anime keeps two things a secret: what was that fifth skill that he picked and considered overlooked by the gods and who is that hero that he is supposed to kill. And these are being kept for a reason: because there is no other intrigue to this anime. No matter what happens in any episode: the MC is so good at everything that he doesn\'t face any challenges at all. to turn his companions into the same ruthless and cold killing machines.

While I can say its definitely an improvement in his writing, but he still trips over himself several times. Other reviews have this show near 8 or near 2, but both are not telling of this anime. It has elements of anime you would give an 8 and elements of anime you would give a 2.It is an isekai, with an overpowered edgy MC....This show will have 1 good idea that makes you invested than 2 bad ideas. It falls into tropes and clichés more often than the times it subverts them or has an original idea.Story: 7The story of the isekai mc being summoned to kill the hero is a very simple, but engaging story. Watching the MC grow in this world is the main draw and it delivers. Its nothing ground breaking and it never gets into a next gear but its good.Art: 6The character design is good for an isekai like this. It doesn'exceed in anything visually, but it looks good throughout the whole runtime. The color palette is very dull, but the variety of areas helps this.Sound: 8The VA work for the Japanese cast is very good. The sound effects are very good and probably the best thing about the sound design. The op and ed are good, but it will depend on your taste. The OST is hit or miss, but mostly just there.Character: 3This is the weakest category for this anime. The MC isn't basic, but he isn't well written either. You understand his thinking most of the time and his actions line up with this. But in the end, you will find no difference between him and any other edgy MC in any other dark isekai.The girls are all cute and do have more than just one character trait so it has that over most isekai. However, these girls usually lose a lot of their personality after falling for the MC. They very much become basic harem girls which was disappointing to watch.The side cast is fine, but there isn't many of them and the few that are there are just passable at best.Enjoyment: 5The most important category imo is enjoyment. Writing can be bad, animation can be bad but if the show is fun to watch that's the main point. My initial points reflect this score. The show does a decent amount of things right and I was genuinely interested at some point, but the show would always manage to pull me out. Episode 5 is a perfect example.|  Spoilers up to episode 5  |1/3rd through the show and the plot is starting to really move. The MC is making his first big steps into this new world and then episode 5 starts. One of the most unnecessary episodes in anime history. The episode painfully and slowly goes into massive detail of the kidnapping, abuse, rape, and forced prostitutions of a group of girls. This is the entire episode. Nothing is explicitly shown. A plot point like this in a dark fantasy isn't out of place, but the level of detail and time that was given to this episode leaves a bad taste in your mouth.Its cheap and lazy writing. Forced rape scenes are the biggest sign of a bad story with bad writing, Its a very lazy way to gain artificial sympathy for a character and a lazy way to add fake stakes to the story. Especially if these events have little impact on the wider story. This event is never brought up again, it has no impact to any of the characters after it, and the only thing that came from it is another girl to like the MC.I personally recommend everyone who watches to skip episode 5. Similar to how everyone said skip episode 1 of Goblin Slayer. Its just for shock and provides no value.Overall: 5The show isn't horrendous, but I would not call it a good anime. Every positive is cancelled out by 1 or 2 negatives and it leaves the show feeling mediocre to me. There are some watchers who are desensitized and just enjoy the MC looking cool and being an assassin. If that is you, watch this show. But for the majority of other people who wouldn't be able to sit through episode 5 or don't like generic isekais, avoid this show. It is not worth your time.

That’s the only fitting world to describe it in every aspect.Narrative/Story - For some reason, this anime is so proud about the premise that they named after it “The world's greatest assassin gets reincarnated in another world as an aristocrat”.Having a protagonist to kill someone just because he is a natural born killer is not exactly what anyone would call “unique”. Even more when you put it in an isekai aspect. The trama does not hide and seeks around the whole motivation of him being there, so you just are stuck with the fact that you’re watching an anime about someone getting prepared...to kill his target.The preparation itself turns out to have really short, uncommon moments, but nothing that crazy. I honestly would prefer to not see the preparation, like Batman did on his HQs. Because here, you just watch this MC getting praised because of how good it is.Characters - . The tools to tell this story don't have any emotion at least to make it look interesting. Just put some girls around the protagonist, make them stupid love him while he uses them as combat tools and that’s it. You put some generic romance on the screen and that’s the whole character for you.The MC himself is emotionless on purpose, because he is an assassin that is trying to have some emotions, that sometimes is kind of cool to see, but does not come around as it should because everyone else around him is just blend as he is.Art - When you have such a basic corpse to go around, you at least expect great animations or nice design… Well, not in this case. There is only one character in this entire anime that has a cool visual (only appears in the last episode for a few minutes).

I honestly would prefer to not see the preparation, like Batman did on his HQs. Because here, you just watch this MC getting praised because of how good it is.Characters - . The tools to tell this story don't have any emotion at least to make it look interesting. Just put some girls around the protagonist, make them stupid love him while he uses them as combat tools and that’s it. You put some generic romance on the screen and that’s the whole character for you.The MC himself is emotionless on purpose, because he is an assassin that is trying to have some emotions, that sometimes is kind of cool to see, but does not come around as it should because everyone else around him is just blend as he is.Art - When you have such a basic corpse to go around, you at least expect great animations or nice design… Well, not in this case. There is only one character in this entire anime that has a cool visual (only appears in the last episode for a few minutes).

Where Do I Start?Old assassin dude was reincarnated in another world as a teen with a very little emotion trying to explain every single thing he does like a story (because he is already smart, so why not?), gaining trust of people while blabbering to himself how they are more like tools to him and when girls start getting too close, he wonders if he actually cares for them as a person with the most awkward reaction.There wasn't much of any character development and the story was nothing much interesting. You already knew what the Main Character was supposed to do. The only question...was, how? But that's not even the reason why this Anime was not that interesting and enjoyable.

The MC was talking about that how he would try considering his feelings and emotions in his new chance at life but maybe I might've missed that part.

Unfortunately, this anime doesn\'t belong to one of them.The main character is someone who has no weaknesses, is instantly overpowered, and is just very generic in general (a common sight in isekai animes). Other characters that accompany him don\'t really have any good qualities that make them stand out either. They all have it in common: painfully generic, and just boring.Another gripe I have with it is its attempts to raise the stakes in...the last few three episodes. The first episode already showed us that the main character and his \'harem\' will all survive and live life together doing what they are good at most, yet those last few episodes aren\'t really exciting or have any reason to be compelling since we already know what happens to them after that. Now, that\'d be forgiven if only the story was actually told in a profound and compelling manner, but the story, combined with its generic ""beautiful characters who are in love with the protagonist and have no weaknesses"" is just hard to look past. And, the characters don\'t really have any memorable qualities that\'d make us root for them or be worried for them.Technical wise, it\'s nothing special either. The OP song might sound good for a few times but it loses its touch once you hear it a couple more times. Animation isn\'t anything special, and it\'s painfully obvious when CGI is used as well.

Also, this review is very subjective (notice all the first person); however, I do provide reasonings for my opinions, so please stick around.When I initially watched this anime, I played a game with my friend. Who could point out the most cliches? The game went on in the...tens, twenties, fifties. Of course, I won because only I really cared, but that really demonstrates the appeal of the show to me. I find shallow content enjoyable because I can interpret it. While I always love watching Seinen, they usually end up to deep and/or rely on prior knowledge of Japanese culture that I simply do not have. So, I enjoy diving into fun little anime like these. Now, onto what I found interesting.First, the writing was too clean. This show ain't messin' around. Only the top tier isekai trash for GinkoFan6. He he. I hesitate to call this anime generic because it would be like calling Black Clover generic (don't quote me; I don't really watch shounen). My point is Assassin includes its own flavor despite being a perfectly generic formula. It's sort of like putting spices on scrambled eggs. While all scrambled eggs are the same, the heart and soul (the spices mmmm) are special. While several narous do this, this one seems to do this to a significant extent. As a result, I was able to enjoy my little game with my friend and also pay attention too.

Boring.The rest: This anime respects extremely well its secondary characters, a wide spectrum of individual is represented, from the most vile (disturbingly, in some cases) to the heroic.Enjoyment: 10/10Except for the rare, forced ecchi moments, I had a lot of fun watching these first 11 episodes, mainly thanks to the story, art and characters.Overall: 9/10Unlike most isekais, Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha\'s strong points far outweigh the weaker ones, offering an isekai that, although not extremely original, is special enough to provide a nice feeling of novelty while being extremely enjoyable to watch as the story unfolds and the battles get more intense.If you felt that ""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"" was a good isekai, please watch this one and enjoy the far superior quality. - Sound: 6/10Doesn\'t have the worst generic/outro of the anime universe.

So why is it then that I don't recommend it? Because it doesn't do anything... literally. During these episodes we've been told and prepared for big payoff which never ends up happening and we never get any conclusions. During the world building part we get to see all the typical oooh and aaaahs issekai loves to throw but they amount to nothing. Literally nothing. I can only assume end goal writers had in mind was some sort of romance ending but it feels very empty and pointless.Character development is just...unbelievable but for the most part entertaining.

OP MC falls in love but story ends before anything happens. The end."", 'So for being an extremely popular anime with a promising premise this anime did feel like somewhat of a disappointment. If you don\'t want spoilers don\'t read the rest of this review. Starting with episode 1 and the first few episodes we really had a promising start where the show gives a beginning that feels like mushoko tensei light vibe without all the weirdness of 30-year-old loser sexually harassing 9-year-olds setting up a beginning training arc with a clear love interest in the future that doesn\'t feel as weird (initially). The introductions of the characters are nice and the world establishes how magic works, which...for once isn\'t hand-wavey or explained with an overly complicated system that makes no sense. That said the first issue I have come up with tarte\'s appearance. I completely understand that the author wants the mc to be a manipulative assassin man but this feels a bit comedic especially when it contrasts with the scenes of his past where he feels more like solid snake meets agent 47 without the comedy aspects of either. At the very minimum, the author does manage to make what is usually a hand-wavey nonsense scene somewhat explained as ""the gods guided her there to be an asset for the mc"". With that said tarte starts out fine as a character and her adjustment to her new life is unrealistic but not too crazy compared to what\'s to come (because near-death experiences do not leave a person\'s psyche unscathed). Along this time we see her combat skills grow but see nothing of dia who is supposedly important to the mc but apparently, he does visit her we just never see any indication until later. It would be nice if this part of the anime was a fair bit longer to better establish the personalities of the characters and the mechanics that define the setting and the schemes were less juvenile or at least not be presented in such a way but overall these issues are inoffensive.Now on to the part where the anime goes off the rails. After working his way up and somehow surpassing his father the mc is sent off to another city to get a false identity going and build some relationships with some somewhat important people. Fair enough. As he goes to do this he works with the family he is sent to live with to be good at business and gain information. As he\'s there he starts a business selling expensive moisturizers because he figured that rich people would buy it, allowing him to establish relationships with more rich people. Fair enough even if it is a bit silly feeling. Now here\'s the real problem part. The anime changes perspective to focus on a group of homeless 10-year-old girls that offer to be tour guides for the city in order to make ends meet. Putting aside the fact that people would somehow even in the middle ages be taking a 10-year-old as a tour guide, which is silly, the main girl of the group is supposedly business giga-brain girl that\'s able to make enough money for the group to afford expensive attire that allows them to better convince customers and somehow can\'t make enough to get a form of housing, which would be the first thing anyone who\'s actually homeless would probably focus on. After that, the girls are kidnapped by pedophiles that want to sell them. Over time each girl gets raped except the main one and one of them cuts her face up pretty badly after having a mental break. Sure there are aspects that are complete bullshit like the girls magically overhearing the fact they\'re gonna be sold to be raped and being able to walk around freely instead of being thrown into a cage or some shit but those things aren\'t huge details and honestly the mental state of the girls is on point enough to not be bad. Then the main girl finds out she\'ll be raped next after like 2 years because they apparently take 2 years to sell children into child prostitution and she considers suicide. All of this feels somewhat realistic honestly but there is some issue I want to clear up before getting to the big problem. The show does way too much camera focus on the girls\' breasts and stuff like that and for reasons that can only be described as ""its anime"" 12 year olds now have F cup boobs, which is an issue for the show in general but felt more when it\'s trying to portray rape and child trafficking.After the main girl is about to kill herself the mc comes in and says the cheesiest line in history ""you\'d look better with a smile"" or some shit and the girl then calls him her prince that\'s come to save her. Not only is this the weirdest tonal shift it\'s honestly just offensive how bad this is. This is the part of the anime where you can really feel it was made by the guy that wrote a redo of a healer and unlike that, this is a serious story instead of rage-bait revenge porn 50 shades of grey anime edition. A person who\'s watched her friends get raped and nearly been subjected to it herself for 2 years is not going to do that and would not trust a man for shit. She isn\'t gonna be like ""oh my god prince charming save me"" she\'ll just want to still kill herself and assume she\'s still getting raped but by someone a bit nicer looking. The mc doesn\'t even say he\'s getting her out of this he says he\'s buying her, which comes with the implication of sex slavery given the context. I genuinely don\'t understand how we went from a girl nearly killing herself and somewhat decent writing for a genuinely fucked situation to worse than western teen YA and isekai levels of writing. This is worse than the weird tentacle rapey shit in SAO by an immeasurable amount. The story didn\'t need this. You have this depiction of child prostitution and rape and then out of the blue, it\'s revealed to be the plot device for a fucking harem. You don\'t need to do this to simply say ""and then the harem member joined the harem"". This plot point honestly feels like it\'s just there as bait to sell copies on shock value and if it isn\'t it\'s some of the worst writing I\'ve seen and it demonstrates one of the show\'s biggest issue, its lack of focus. We went from an assassin training to kill a demi-god of a hero to a slice of life, ecchi, romcom, and then this shit. Not only is it written poorly and easily offensive to many due to its poor handling of the subject matter it\'s a complete deviation from the plot without adding to it at all. If the author could actually focus on assassin man pulls off vaguely agent 47 type strategies to take out the main enemy with build up in opponents over time and him building his way to the end goal through establishing a network and allies and all that without oppai lolis, harems, and other dumb shit this anime would be perfect but instead, we focus on shit that just bogs the plot down. Now I\'m not saying a romance subplot couldn\'t exist, it already does with dia. The only improvement on that end is not having the mentally 60-year-old man at this point dating a 16-year-old. Idk wait until she\'s at least 18 to have her make out with the mc? You could argue that that\'s too long into the future as the plot more or less spans 18 years but the author could have made it longer and just pushed the romance for a later age without it getting as dicey (it\'s still questionable by a lot but at least it\'s not a literal child). I mean fuck it the author does that with the B plot where other potential heroes have more than 18 years. The author just got lazy and decided it wouldn\'t work unless it fits the development from childhood to adulthood so that he could use that to pace character development.For the last episode, I agree it was rushed but honestly the whole thing was rushed. Pulling a poor man\'s lelouch strat at the end to kill the enemy was sorta fun and I definitely got the feeling the author was joking around when calling the ballistic equivalent of a nuke an ""assassination strategy"" which no one in that world seemed to buy. It felt a bit contrived and I wish the schemes were a lot longer and more detailed but it\'s not the worst ending.All in all, I rate the show a 4. It would be a 7 for being a solid isekai, even if its plot was not well-paced or the best written and a bit contrived, but the sheer awfulness of episode 6 sort of sours it by a lot. I\'m not against trying to handle darker topics but this came off as edgy redo of a healer style bait and it was pretty awful considering it handled a very serious and sensitive subject that way while also clashing with the story at large. If you cut out the awful stuff and also the incel bait with lolis, harems, etc. the story would be a lot better for it. for once isn\'t hand-wavey or explained with an overly complicated system that makes no sense. That said the first issue I have come up with tarte\'s appearance. I completely understand that the author wants the mc to be a manipulative assassin man but this feels a bit comedic especially when it contrasts with the scenes of his past where he feels more like solid snake meets agent 47 without the comedy aspects of either. At the very minimum, the author does manage to make what is usually a hand-wavey nonsense scene somewhat explained as ""the gods guided her there to be an asset for the mc"". With that said tarte starts out fine as a character and her adjustment to her new life is unrealistic but not too crazy compared to what\'s to come (because near-death experiences do not leave a person\'s psyche unscathed). Along this time we see her combat skills grow but see nothing of dia who is supposedly important to the mc but apparently, he does visit her we just never see any indication until later. It would be nice if this part of the anime was a fair bit longer to better establish the personalities of the characters and the mechanics that define the setting and the schemes were less juvenile or at least not be presented in such a way but overall these issues are inoffensive.Now on to the part where the anime goes off the rails. After working his way up and somehow surpassing his father the mc is sent off to another city to get a false identity going and build some relationships with some somewhat important people. Fair enough. As he goes to do this he works with the family he is sent to live with to be good at business and gain information. As he\'s there he starts a business selling expensive moisturizers because he figured that rich people would buy it, allowing him to establish relationships with more rich people. Fair enough even if it is a bit silly feeling. Now here\'s the real problem part. The anime changes perspective to focus on a group of homeless 10-year-old girls that offer to be tour guides for the city in order to make ends meet. Putting aside the fact that people would somehow even in the middle ages be taking a 10-year-old as a tour guide, which is silly, the main girl of the group is supposedly business giga-brain girl that\'s able to make enough money for the group to afford expensive attire that allows them to better convince customers and somehow can\'t make enough to get a form of housing, which would be the first thing anyone who\'s actually homeless would probably focus on.

The concept of reincarnating a badass IRL into a properly-built badass in another world is a pretty niche yet good idea. Unfortunately, the adaptation is on the disappointing side. Sure, the MC's goal and growth plan is present, but the explanation of the growth system and progress is vague. The pacing of MC's development and progress feels too rushed, and the results he acquired became more questionable rather than mysterious.A few episodes in, the MC is surrounded by cute girls,...yet the presentation of their characters are plain. Tropes and cliches are used too plainly. Character and chemistry development is almost non-existent, and plot developments are too sudden. This may be caused by your typical adaptation's limits towards the source material, but I'm sure things could've been presented a lot better.Based on Mushoku no Tensei-tier standards, this one's average.

I thought that manga will be adapted perfectly but this iss something else like professional life's of assassin too much serious  Well it was good till the end ! There were some unsatisfactory things Here and there(like I thought it would be a harem but turn out to be a romance and heart breakups ) mc is not op but smart enough to take down op foes which is kinda rare in anime nowadays ! So as for me it's - 6.6 stars/10 stars.. I think the teaser which was there in ending confirmed that there...will be a next season but that will be too long to come so am waiting I guess! will be a next season but that will be too long to come so am waiting I guess!"", 'Tl;dr at the end!Story 6/10: My main complaint is the lack of ANY struggle the MC faces after coming into the world. The show is just plot after plot of him building his master plan and manipulating cute girls. Even when he struggles, it’s just part of his plan. Rarely his is shovked, rarely he’s even flustered.The premise itself is okay, I liked the way it began and the show had lots of potential. This show just falls into “male fantasy powertrip” syndrome where you’re supposed to project onto the protag and be pretty much invincible. The villain was introduced FAR too late to...make any impact, either, so during the climax I felt… basically nothing.Not to mention, in a setting with political undertones (literally the fact that MC was an aristocrat is in the title, yet barely anything political is dealt with), there’s lots of potential to foreshadow big plot twists, political changes, etc. Making high society an obstacle would have been great! Instead assassination is just a normal thing to literally everyone and the banes of being tied by social standing come into play maybe twice in the whole series.Art 8/10: Very inconsistent, but the promotional art is gorgeous, the character designs are pretty good (Dia’s is especially pleasing), and the use of colours is okay. The backgrounds are very standard, but usable. Overall not stellar, not bad. Standard isekai anime budget art.Sound 6/10: Honestly nothing about the soundtrack struck me as good. The opening is okay, but the OST is often reused and really lacklustre. Sound effects are also… kind of mediocre at best. The voice acting was only average, mostly because there weren’t very many emotional moments to display talent in.Character 3/10: Paper-thin cookie cutter characters. Even the MC has exactly 1 goal. The harem members have pasted-on sad backstories, but do we get any semblance of trauma, or those backgrounds influencing their character? Nope. Their sad backstories could almost no exist and it wouldn’t matter. In fact, one of them three girls don’t even have a backstory, and literally is just there for the protagonist. Once their backstory episode is over, they do next to nothing. Well, they could basically not exist and there’d be a reasonable way to get the actions they take done. It makes me wonder why the protagonist even brought them on board. They barely helped him.This anime could also do with about 80% less pseudo incest. Like seriously, it’s made somewhat incestual for no reason and nobody in the show seems to care. Not even the MC, who literally comes from the modern era where that stuff isn’t normal. The author definitely has some screws loose.Enjoyment 4/10Made me feel nothing. Very mediocre and trashy anime obviously pandering to degenerates who want the power trip and cute anime girls obsessed with them.Tl;dr story is just a virgin’s daydream, with no struggles or actual drama to speak of. Art’s okay, soundtrack’s unnotable. Characters could be summed up in three sentences, with backstories that are unnecessary and tragic for the sake of being tragic. Could use a lot less pseudo incest, since none of the pseudo incest was necessary and it’s obviously just there because the author has some sort of kink for it. Watch if you want to project onto a protagonist who’s OP and gets all the girls make any impact, either, so during the climax I felt… basically nothing.Not to mention, in a setting with political undertones (literally the fact that MC was an aristocrat is in the title, yet barely anything political is dealt with), there’s lots of potential to foreshadow big plot twists, political changes, etc. Making high society an obstacle would have been great!

Watch if you want to project onto a protagonist who’s OP and gets all the girls', ""I will start by saying; that this anime was too short. When one considers just how much the twelve episodes included in this anime cover in the time it is given, it becomes easy to say that it feels as though many opportunities to develop characters and deepen the plots, were missed. We begin, and spend almost an entire episode with the Main character, in his first life, as the number one assassin on the planet. And in that one episode, enough time is spent for us viewers to understand who this person is, what his motivations are, and indeed, enough to understand him, and...the sort of personality he has, while also making the promise that this character will deliver on these personality traits later in the show. The first episode was well structured if somewhat lacking in any groundbreaking character design in terms of personality and motivation.Yet, with the remaining eleven episodes, we are rushed through an entire childhood, various tests and trials for the character to get to where he needs to be in order to really take up the titular mantle of the show itself. For me, the pace was rushed, and really a lot more time was needed to develop both the world from the offset, the rules of the divinity involved, and indeed for the development of this character from who he was, into the person that he was inevitably going to become; as such the relationships between the characters often times feel disingenuous, fake, and thinner than gossamer.Putting those issues of pacing aside, one must, as it is a fantasy Isekai anime, look at the world itself, the magic, and indeed how it all feels and is put together. For me, and this is entirely subjective, the visual look of the magic, as with a lot of isekai and fantasy anime, looks far too flamboyant. I just don't see the need for the symmetrical magical circles that are never explained, and just pop up whenever they feel like it, with no real relevance to anything going on. This is an issue for me because while there was a distinct mention of people having different physical capabilities to that of the world where the main character comes from, there is little distinction between these physical abilities and the use of spells, other than the non-appearance of these circles. That aside, I think this anime had some great potential to really explore magical mechanics more than it did. I enjoyed very much what we did get to see, but there was very little actually explained. I understand this from a narrative perspective, but it becomes difficult to really assess the impressiveness of the abilities of a character when the only description of said impressiveness is the perspective of the main character.Yet, the result of all of this is a magic system that feels somewhat lackadaisical, somewhat lazy, and somewhat interesting, but really fails to deliver on anything concrete.To top off my complaints in this area, I think the world feels somewhat cobbled together with little real reference to where anything is, what anything means, and the significance of the places that are put into the story. For an anime that boasts a story of political intrigue, in a Mediaeval/ Renaissance setting, you would expect to get more details on the things I've just mentioned. I feel that this is very much a victim of the lack of time that this anime was given to develop anything that feels concrete.However… for all that this anime fails to deliver, it delivers wonderfully in other ways. Visually this anime was very good, nothing special I will admit, but indeed, the characters were, for the most part, well-designed… two moustaches, and a few hairstyles aside (which by the way, in regards to Lugh’s father, made him look like a character straight out of a Pokemon anime). Even though I think the magic was flamboyant, I have to admit that it was visually pleasing to look at… the set design and art were all very solid. My Biggest issue with the animation is actually the eyes and eyelashes, I don't understand why you would go for such soft shapes and colours for the eyes, while also going for what appears to be a sort of golden hue to everyone's eyelashes. The eyelashes being such a contrasting colour to what one would come to expect in an anime, that I found it extremely jarring, and just a weird choice overall. I do however think the outfit designs of the character were well put together for the most part, if somewhat boring in some areas.Moving on to the plot and storytelling, I found that there was a lot of unnecessary nudity where really there could have been considerably less, and would have made for a far more natural way of telling this story. The scenes with any nudity in them felt contrived. That aside, I think the plot was really well put together for the time they had. And with the references back to previous elements of the story, all coming together for a final, the payoff was substantial and felt suitably epic for what the show was trying to achieve. The entire premise of the show being about a main character who isn't the hero of the world, but indeed the person who will save the world by killing the hero, is both fresh and interesting for the isekai world (Yes I'm aware I'm coming to this anime considerably later than most).What this show does really well, is gripping the attention of the audience, and making us feel invested, not just in the main character himself, but indeed the side characters around him. This story dives into some dark places that we don't often get to experience in anime. I’m not here to say whether certain episodes were ethical or not, but rather to say that it's refreshing to see dark topics dealt with in an anime. The resolution of such was positive and handled in a fairly decent way. Was it perfect? No. but then I would never have expected it to have been so.In each episode, from one to the next, we see substantial development of the character and those characters around them, even if at times that development feels somewhat unearned, there is constant movement within the plot and characters, with enough moving elements to keep the audience interested to see just how all of these different elements come together. I do think there are certain elements that aren't really utilised as fully as they could have been, even with the short time given to this anime in only twelve episodes, but that I think can be forgiven.Ultimately, this anime delivers on its titular premise in a cool and satisfying way, that I believe will leave most viewers wanting to watch more, wanting to see more of the world, and wanting to see just how things unfold between the characters and the world around them.Also, I thought the cliffhanger was very well done. It left us wanting more but did not undermine the satisfaction of the end of the series in the finale.So…for all this anime does badly or wrong, I think it does a lot more right. I think it's a lot easier when writing reviews to only point out the negative, and seemingly the opposite is true. The finer and best qualities of an anime often get overshadowed by these things and as such people like me often fail to appreciate what they have seen because of them. For me though, I really enjoyed this anime, it was refreshing in many ways and interesting in many more.For me, it's an 8/10 the sort of personality he has, while also making the promise that this character will deliver on these personality traits later in the show.

I do think there are certain elements that aren't really utilised as fully as they could have been, even with the short time given to this anime in only twelve episodes, but that I think can be forgiven.Ultimately, this anime delivers on its titular premise in a cool and satisfying way, that I believe will leave most viewers wanting to watch more, wanting to see more of the world, and wanting to see just how things unfold between the characters and the world around them.Also, I thought the cliffhanger was very well done. It left us wanting more but did not undermine the satisfaction of the end of the series in the finale.So…for all this anime does badly or wrong, I think it does a lot more right. I think it's a lot easier when writing reviews to only point out the negative, and seemingly the opposite is true. The finer and best qualities of an anime often get overshadowed by these things and as such people like me often fail to appreciate what they have seen because of them. For me though, I really enjoyed this anime, it was refreshing in many ways and interesting in many more.For me, it's an 8/10"", ""It was ok. if you're looking for an isekai anime that has badass concept and cute girls, this fits the bill.I've finished and dropped many isekai anime and manga and this one is ok. it ticks the box of what the anime is trying to be. the visuals is great, i love the gradients and the shots feels dewy to look at. The plot is good, it's driven by a cool concept. The mechanics of the world is very well thought out. It had explanations on how the magic works. I liked how they linked knowing the details of an element works on creating spell,...the new spells doesn't feel like made of convenience but rather a compilation of loophole and developed.Great story, great start, bad dragging middle and end. It was almost made for hyping up.*spoiler starts here*It's ok for for me because I feel like it lacks on execution especially on the supposed heartfelt moment. On the first few episodes, it was wonderful. The delivery of how much of an expert he is in the real world works well with the newbie foil. When the gang was saving girls, It established a dark setting, i was hoping it bended on that. As the story progressed it lost its good deliveries. almost like a drag on how the author leads to the ending. some of the moments felt abrupt and didn't give much time to brew well. When the protagonist falls in love for his cousin, it was too sharp and rather made me question if it was genuine or he was going to use her too for his assassination. would be cool if that was the purpose of it but the character has an almost death and it didn't move me one bit. the new spells doesn't feel like made of convenience but rather a compilation of loophole and developed.Great story, great start, bad dragging middle and end.

One of the things that got me really invested in this show is the 1st episode, Episode 1 was such a good introductory episode about the MC's past life and what kind of person he was, It isn't like most Isekais where the MC gets immediately gets sent to heaven by truck-kun or whatever. If I we're to complain about anything it'll probably be the pacing of the show, some of the things that happened we're way too fast in my opinion they could have taken their time a bit but considering it's only 12 episodes I can't really blame them.No one was really remotely that interesting from the characters aside from the MC himself which was the most note worthy character in the show, The others we're okay but not anything note worthy hence aren't really that interesting. However they had good designs, all of them looked cool and cute, I guess if anyone bothered me it would be the MC's mom for sneaking up to the MC's room looking forward to seeing her own son after having a wet dream.. although it definitely isn't the weirdest thing I've seen yet so yeah there is also that. For the soundtracks I thought they we're pretty good but not to say that it made me go wow, they we're good and they did a good job with the music is all I'm saying.Lastly the animation itself, The animation wasn't top tier or anything like that but it was good enough for fights to not be lame and uninteresting, Art is okay as well it gives us a kind of typical approach in terms of the art and designs but regardless they we're quite nice and the characters looked cool and cute as I've said before so :pOverall I have great expectations about this anime and hopefully it gets a 2nd season because this is one of the better power fantasy stuff that we've gotten. by the very organization he worked for, He then dies and meets god who made him choose between reincarnation or being reborn in the same world and start as a new person, He chose to be reincarnated in a different world but however there was a catch which is to assassinate the Hero of that world.

After halfway through episode 4, I just got uncomfortable and stopped watching, since I knew it wouldn't stop. A real shame too, since I think a fantasy assassin plot could've done a really good job, especially with the skills introduced in episode 2. Just a shame it follows every other isekai and devolves to what can only be described as softcore CP.Story is decently interesting, I would've finished it had it not been for my main...complaint.

At first it was really engaging and had a very unique storyline. The art was great, pacing was great, very mature and complex...But as the story got further along, it suddenly became a very showy HAREM?! Which was super unexpected.Most anime that follow the harem troupe down the rabbit hole make me physically cringe from secondhand embarrassment. While I sort of edged on this feeling a couple of times, the show always pulled back into a normal place. We will se ', 'this season i feel like i watched a million and one isekai, some that made the top of my list while others made a new bar for the low.for what it’s worth, there were parts of this show that i enjoyed. mostly revolving around the dialogue centered around the ethics of being an assassin and what it means to choose to kill.there were other moments in this show that were really emotionally packed for me and they took me by genuine surprise.i’m no fan of fan service, particularly when it’s reiterated plenty that the characters are written to be minors. (i don’t...care what you think about the world’s lore, it’s still kinda weird.) this show has a great art style though and i never got bored watching.the final resolution didn’t leave anything that resonated with me, but maybe that’s just the burnout of having watched so many shows that follow similar premises. care what you think about the world’s lore, it’s still kinda weird.) this show has a great art style though and i never got bored watching.the final resolution didn’t leave anything that resonated with me, but maybe that’s just the burnout of having watched so many shows that follow similar premises.', 'Don\'t know why or how I enjoyed this, it may be because I like to just watch a pretty anime where everything goes perfectly in the end, or because I barely watched any Isekai to care about it\'s repeated plots and tropes. Either way, I do recommend to people who aren\'t die hard weebs that expect only originality and masterpieces.It\'s in the end a story that plays out a fantasy to escape reality, specially for those that like cute pastel colors and ""violence"" in the same package. It does remind me of my own childish stories, which is genuinely nostalgic. ', 'An isekai different enough that seeing it through is not a complete waste of time, but not without some of the usual cringeworthy gremlins that permeate many.The main character, named Lugh in his reincarnated form, maintains the memories of his previous life, and so from a young age already demonstrates extreme proficiency and potential. OP main characters are not always bad, but are better suited for parody/self-aware isekais such as The Misfit of Demon King Academy. When the show takes itself even remotely seriously however (such as this one), it becomes a bit of a drag to watch a character that knows and can...do anything, always.Beside that, while the formation of harems seems inescapable in this genre (for the most part), this one felt especially gross since our MC is basically a guy in his 50s inhabiting a 14yr old\'s body. The worst offenders are Maha and mostly Lugh\'s own mother. Maha just meets this guy and immediately refers to him as ""my prince."" Lugh\'s mom wants to see his pecker and talk about ejaculation. Maha at least was an interesting character at first, but loses the edge when she joins the harem. Somehow, with these atrocities, the later scenes with Dia and Lugh managed to be properly infectious and adorable, and I enjoyed every moment she was on screen.The other main pitfall would be that the anime doesn\'t seem to know how to spend its 12 episodes. It was interesting to see the main character develop from childhood, but again, with just 12 episodes, it was an arc that, along with his journey to become a merchant, took entirely too long. By the time the story returns to its main thread (kill the hero), there isn\'t much time left, and the final episodes feel incredibly rushed. It seems as if they paced the first 8 (or so) episodes as if they had been given a 24-30+ episodes budget and had to turn things up to 11 when they realized there\'s suddenly only 3 left.In conclusion: not a waste of time, but frustrating at points along the way, and the best parts to take away from the anime are the moments Dia is on screen.

So why am I putting this anime as middle of the road?  Ho boy, this is where it gets complicated.He is in love with and wants to marry Dia, so presumably he's saving his virginity for that.  But he's a...noble, so that doesn't matter all that much, and his basically willing slave girls (who literally sleep with him) straight-up volunteer to take care of his morning wood.  But this isekai actually does right by acknowledging it'd pretty much be a young teenage girls/dude in his 40s scenario to go for it, so he declines.  But he does so out of some odd sense of professional respect mostly rather than that reason, and the girls act and look like someone isekai'd Pamela Anderson's tits along with the very concept of puberty itself and made both OP with their supernatural physical, mental and emotional maturity.  Not that he acknowledges that because he's playing 5D chess on a checkers board in this world.  Oh, and his mother who isn't really his mother because isekai kinda wants him too, which he declines.Basically, if you want the world's most morally confusing boner, give this a watch. noble, so that doesn't matter all that much, and his basically willing slave girls (who literally sleep with him) straight-up volunteer to take care of his morning wood.

There is no tension, no risk to our good guys. If there is no risk, they don't need us to cheer for them. So we don't. And what's a TV show, a basketball game, a football game where you don't cheer for your guys? It's empty. The victories ring hollow. They're meaningless with no struggle.It's the difference between the original Star Wars and the sequels. Luke got his ass kicked for two movies. The girl had half an hour of being down on her luck before things got too easy.That's what I thought this...show was going to be. And it was. The MC is basically invincible. He knows all, sees all, and all the ladies love him. Oh yeah, he invents guns and moisturizer lotion.But I have to admit. The show grew on me in the later episodes. Early on, it seemed like he was just spinning his wheels. He does some training, learns magic, rescues and woos the ladies, and is basically an effortless winner. Boring. There were some hints of tension and difficulty in the last two episodes. No spoilers here.I'm sure everyone knows this, but I writer of this show also wrote another manga that got turned into a controversial anime. I have to say that I was intrigued by this and wanted to see what the guy had for us in a less salacious story.Story 5/10Standard isekai with a theme: He was an assassin in his prior life. Not much to say about it.There was an interesting twist with the goddess - She has been sending people into the world and may not be entirely truthful about her wanting to kill the hero.I didn't like the frequent expo dumping.I'd say that the story isn't the strong point of the series. I don't watch many isekais but this felt like a basic isekai story-wise.There were a couple of points that were interesting in the later episodes of the show:1) There is a point where the MC is told he needed to kill his friend. This one could have been compelling.2) They talk about being a tool versus serving their own interests. I don't think they explored this concept in a meaningful way because the MC does what he's supposed to do anyways.3) The MC declares his love for the one waifu. Good job making it known. The other waifu cries and it's a sad but beautifully animated moment.Those plot points could have been expanded into something engaging. Instead, they just touched on them and proceeded with the story in a standard way.Characters 5/10The characters were the better points of the series.The MC is the stoic know-it-all. Kind of a dud if you ask me.He rescues his side kick - a pig-tailed, blonde, big-titty bitch. She worships the guy.His magic teacher has long silver hair and worships the guy.He rescues up some blue-haired street urchin. She worships the guy.See a pattern going here?Personality and character-wise, I didn't see much difference between the female characters. They were sweet, magical, and madly in love with the MC.A point: they really like saying the character names. I lost count of how many times they make it a point to say the full first and last names. I'm guessing the writer was proud of himself in creating these quasi-interesting-sounding names and needed them spoken alound as much as possible. Little on the strange side.Art 10/10Everything looked great. So many bright colors, beautifully rendered backgrounds, and the characters were cute. The cuteness threw me off when they did the episode on sex slavery. I guess it's the same with anime in general. They match the cuteness with the bloody and gruesome stuff.They did a good job with the CGI horses and people. It was easy to spot but it wasn't bad at all.The OP was stylish and matched the music. Had some symbolism, quick cuts, playing card imagery (like Casino Royale), and showed off the characters impressively. It was real slick.The ED matched the music. The frames were really nice to look at.There were frames from each episode that looked absolutely gorgeous. You get the medieval castle settings, villages, wildernesses, the sun and the moon, and the waifus of course. Splendid stuff.Sound 6/10Sounds were standard.The voice acting was okay. The MC had a voice. The harem girls had them too. Nothing really stuck out.The OP was an sly, moody number. Not the most catchy but it matched the slick visuals. I didn't dig the ED as much. I don't like it when songs are sung in the super high-pitched loli voice. I think it may be a character voice, but still.The sound effects were there.Average sound all around. +1 for the OP being outside the norm.Enjoyment 6/10I rolled my eyes at this show for most of the run. The MC was overpowered, invincible, all-knowing, and all the ladies wanted to bounce his jock immediately and without reason. There was no risk to him and he just cruised to W after W.I hoped that he'd meet a challenge and things would get interesting. The last two episodes provided a little bit of it. But, again, there was no real struggle, no tension, no wondering if our MC was going to make it out of there alive. So this show mostly misses on this point.I will give it +1 point because I rarely watch current anime and I felt like I was participating in a community with this one.Overall 5/10It has all the production value, the setting, the sounds, the art.

My least favourite...part of the show is probably the characters. they aren't overtly annoying, but they are 2 dimensional and not very interesting. part of the show is probably the characters. they aren't overtly annoying, but they are 2 dimensional and not very interesting."", 'Just a normal isekai anime and it was overratedFrom the start, Lugh had amazing skills of assassin, which helped us to know the rest of anime\'s story. Too strong, too smart, too good, too powerful, too perfect making three girls fall in love and story go in a straight line Hahahahahaha!About three girlsJust look at Tarte! From a poor girl lost in forrest, Lugh helped her become to ""grow up"" her above boddy. Pathetic!About Maha, who lost virgin and became to erotic as well as Tark....And then, i realized that this hentai anime had the same author as Healer. Oh my god!Goddess Lady is my favourite character.I hated 3D parts in animated actions so much and they broke my enjoyment....Overall, Sekai Saikou is overrated, brings to watchers busties with many offensive bodies.

This show is very much just a classic isekai. I mean you got the dude who lived a somewhat tragic life, as the Assassin (which is his official name apparently because???) was born as a tool, not a person as it were. This becomes the whole sort of exigence of the show and is the sort of message that the show is trying to push. You ought to enjoy life and not live as a tool or something like that. I don\'t...think it\'s a bad message at all but it\'s just quoted so oddly throughout the show. It\'s almost ironic, yet the show clearly tries to take itself seriously. The way they use the quote would be like if everytime Batman came on screen, he said ""I am the Dark Knight Rises."" It\'s goofy as fuck and gives me horny dreamer vibes. There\'s no clear reason for the show to exist. The story is mid as all hell and the final villain is literally named ""Hero."" Oh but don\'t forget, before the ""Hero"" becomes bad, he has to slay the ""Demon King."" The show just falls into the tropiest cliches and still tries to take itself seriously. The main character is some fuckin Joker Shitsona 5 rip off with silver hair instead of black. Oh but in the middle of the series he dyes his hair black when he has to disguise as someone for two years. I don\'t wanna see Joker anymore! I admit Persona 5 Royal Third Semester is good, please just stop making Joker ripoffs! This show is white bread as fuck. I don\'t dislike it, but it\'s just so predictable. The whole twist at the end is that he has to assassinate Dia Viekone, who is basically his girlfriend but is quite literally his cousin. It was such a predictable thing to guess, but I will admit, the cousin thing did slightly catch me off guard. I noticed the little foreshadow at the beginning of the show, but I just completely did not connect that when Esri (MC\'s mommy) said something to Dia, that meant that Esri was doing aunt things and talking to her niece. It made me enjoy the show a bit more because of how fucking nutty that is but it\'s not really that important. The story is very disjointed, and there were many times when I thought I had skipped an episode. If you turn off your brain, I think that you could be inebriated enough to give this show an 8 or a 9. If you actually use your brain and stop looking at the cute girls, you\'ll realize that this show is pretty dogwater. The art is pretty nice though, and the characters are kinda awesome actually. Not MC, but the girls are pretty neat. Tarte is a character you can feel really bad for and still like. Maha is smart and pretty horny. Oh yeah everyone is actually very horny. MC is very bland but not unlikeable. His mommy literally suffocated him with her tits while he was blind after a surgery. Dia is fun but she gets shockingly little screen time. Tarte gets the most, which is probably why she\'s the most developed but that\'s also why you feel so bad for her actually. This show sucks a lot more than I\'m giving it credit for. Well the OST kinda fucking sucks. The outro is dog, the music that plays during the show is forgettable, not even because of a poor melody, but because there\'s not even a leitmotif in this show. Or if there is, I forgot it completely because of how poorly music is used in this show. The intro is nice though, kinda like King by Kanaria. It\'s ebic. There is one really interesting episode though in episode 6. It kinda completely diverges from Lugh (MC) and Tarte, but it basically follows a gaggle of girls that get kidnapped into essentially a sex trafficking ring and shows their struggles there. A girl stabs herself in the face and it\'s an extremely uncomfortable episode in a good way. I don\'t agree with exploring discomforting concepts such as this just for the sake of it, but I think that it\'s a story told very well in the episode. A definite highlight that is then ruined by Lugh coming and buying the girls out of slavery and then killing all the bad people with no consequence at all. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ is all I have for this show. think it\'s a bad message at all but it\'s just quoted so oddly throughout the show.

Although I still stand by my 1/10 review for Healer because it is a poorly written, overly edgy, sad male masculinity trash fire that took itself so seriously for what it was, I will concede that I was wrong when I said he was a bad writer because Worlds Finest Assassin proves that he can in fact write a pretty unique story (for light novel isekai) with interesting...characters (again, for light novel isekai).That said, this is still a *sigh* light novel isekai anime adaption so there are still the cliches and hallmarks to be found that binds the genre down. You have your reincarnate in a fantasy, medieval-european type world with magic and video game like skills, a harem, a “God”, “the Hero” and “the Demon Lord”, all the things I am and you are (probably) sick to death of in fantasy an isekai (no level system though which gets a thumbs up from me). This is also the same person who spunk Redo of Healer into our eyes over winter earlier this year so you can expect dark subject matters like sex slavery, child abuse, drug addiction and more to be present within the plot with varying degrees of tastelessness.However, what really makes this show works is what’s in the title. Instead of a stupid, useless, idiot high schooler who was hit by a truck or something for the common, loser weeb to project themselves onto, the main character was a hardened, cold, 40 year old, tool of the government, 007 type assassin who completed his missions by any means necessary and has seen worse things than the common viewer could possible imagine making him un-projectable.As Lugh Tuatha Dé he still has the cold, calculating personality from his old life and his assassination skills become even more improved after being trained by his assassin father, but as he actively tries to live his new life his own way instead of being just a tool it’s fun to watch when he gets thrown off by his doting mother, his childhood friend and magic teacher Dia, his assistant Tarte and his proxy Maha. It’s also totally understandable when he does things like brainwash a poverty girl into becoming his life long servant or buying a sex slave out of sex slavery for the purpose of using them for their magical power to help him in his mission. It’s a well written balance between old professional habits and new life integration struggles.The story is good at knowing where the line is drawn between horny, male power fantasy and serious, disturbing subject matter. Uncomfortable content makes sure to focus on the psychological suffering of the people involved and doesn’t try to titillate the audience inappropriately. The characters (women, let’s face it) are given personalities and contextual circumstances so that they’re not just props dropped in a horrible situation. The Maha introduction episode was uncomfortably heart breaking because of this. When it wants to be horny it can be and the show can also be pretty humorous at times.The animation is good. There’s not a lot of fast combat, but when there is it’s smooth and dynamic. The cgi background characters and horses are the only thing that stand out as sloppy, but they don’t come up enough to activity harm the viewing experience.I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I’m recommending an isekai written by the same guy who wrote Redo of Healer. When you look at it as a James Bond fantasy adventure it’s an interesting take on the isekai genre and I’m all about it. I hope it gets a second season.7/10 Good. characters (again, for light novel isekai).That said, this is still a *sigh* light novel isekai anime adaption so there are still the cliches and hallmarks to be found that binds the genre down.

I hope it gets a second season.7/10 Good.', ""STORYI became interested in watching this anime because this anime has a quite unique concept. This anime tells about the world's greatest assassin who reincarnated in another world. Actually I can already guess that there will be harem elements and the main character will have overpowered powers. But this anime still intrigues me because the majority of isekai anime, the main character will reincarnate into another world and become a hero. But in this anime the main character actually reincarnated in another world to kill the hero.ANIMATIONThe animation in this anime is actually pretty good. But I think the animation in this anime can be...improved. I'm saying this because the last 2 episodes showed the battle near Dia's palace. And as we can see they use CGI to animate the existing soldiers. This makes the atmosphere of war lessen.OPENING & ENDINGAs for the opening theme, I won't say much more because the song is so perfect and the animation in the opening song makes me feel hype when I hear it. In my opinion, the opening song in this anime is one of the best opening songs for the fall 2021 season. Unfortunately, the ending song itself sounds ordinary and nothing special.CHARACTERWell, for the characters in this anime there is nothing unique and special because the main characters in this anime are very intelligent, don't talk much, and have a harem. This kind of characterization has often been in every isekai animeOVERALLOverall I still enjoy this anime. But I will say some of my hopes about this anime. First, I was very curious about the hero figure in this anime, and I was a little disappointed because it turned out that the hero figure was only shown at the end of the story and it made me feel unsatisfied. Second, for some reason I think that romantic scenes in this anime are unnecessary. Because I expected the story in this anime to focus on the main character who works hard to train his skills to kill heroes. Third, this is my last hope. I hope that the fighting scenes in this anime can be made more epic. In episode 12, Lugh had absolutely no difficulty in fighting the final boss. I wanted Lugh to fight longer and look overwhelmed at the end of the episode. But this anime also has some mysteries that make me look forward to the second season such as the past of the hero, the mystery of Lugh's D-level skill, and the way that Lugh will do to complete the task given by the goddess. improved.

The World's Finest Assassin may have one of the mouthful titles in Japanese media to date. However, the concept for the story is different than other isekai series. This anime can be a hit-or-miss depending on the content, and it has its positive and negative aspects the anime adaptation is known for in this season. I was ready to drop this anime, but I eventually stuck to it in the end, and I found it to be a unique change of pace among other isekais. With...that, here are the good and the bad that I found in this assassin isekai.The plot is very intriguing as the protagonist's goal isn't becoming a hero and saving the world from a demon lord, but to assassinate said hero to prevent that world's destruction. The central aspect of this anime is the protagonist's buildup from specific events in his new life that allows him to develop his assassin skills. It focuses on the protagonist becoming an assassin and an aristocrat while gaining knowledge from those titles to improve his plan. The pacing was decent, showing tidbits of the protagonist's previous life and eventually moving forward with his new life in another world. I'm very interested in seeing a prologue series on the world's finest assassin, as well as looking forward to seeing how further in the story will get progressed. Even though the Hero assassin plot point is going slowly, I'm hoping this anime sticks with that aspect to keep the anime consistent. In total, I loved how the story's central goal is the opposite of what a generic isekai would contain.The story itself is simple from reading the title. The world's finest assassin from earth dies an unexpected death and gets reincarnated in another world as part of an aristocratic family. After the prologue, the anime shows the protagonist learning how to assassinate his targets while understanding his feelings from his previous life. During each of the episodes, the protagonist meets three girls, who he developed a connection in those episodes. Eventually, they were considered his tools, except for one of them. Although I'm still anticipating for the hero to have more importance, I found the plot points in this first season to be unique even without the hero's reveal in the last episode. However, I also found the story too generic as the protagonist is similar to other fantasy anime protagonists in terms of power scaling. But I still had no problem with it at the same time. With the way the story in the first season ended, I hope there's a second season to show more on the hero and why they're a massive threat to the fantasy world.The characters have their charm in terms of their character traits and importance to the story. I love the character designs in this anime, especially with how their eyes are colored. For the main protagonist, Lugh, not only does he have that drip, his personality has its moments. At times, he acts calm and composed when planning his assassins, but he also breaks character whenever he's around the three girls occasionally. The other three girls, Dia, Tarte, and Maha, not only have unique designs, but their backstories are intriguing as well. One is royalty, while the other two had to endure hardships until they met Lugh. However, the relationship between some of them can be controversial, especially Dia and Maha being somewhat related to Lugh, even though they aren't blood-related. However, I liked how Lugh has his standards as he loves Dia but still treats Tarte and Maha with respect as his comrades. Overall, the characters' backstories are tragic, and their likeability is consistent throughout the show.The animation is questionable at specific parts of the anime. One of the studios, Silver Link, is well known for other fantasy anime, but their quality for this series wasn't the best. At times, the animation is incredible for the magic, but at the same time, the use of CGI for the horses and the knights was awful. However, there were certain moments where the CGI was done right, such as the missiles shot, but it still wasn't enough. For some reason, the lack of lining around the characters bothered me, but it still wasn't as bad as it looked. The only thing that needs to be improved is the consistency of good animation, but if the CGI is necessary for living this, I understand since those may be hard to animate in 2D.The reason why I got into watching this isekai is by how amazing the music is, mainly the opening. The soundtrack during the episodes, they were pretty generic. Each of the music sounds like any fantasy anime, but at the same time, it made some references to the title card sound that plays in Dr. Stone. However, the opening is a different matter compared to this anime's soundtrack. The opening song sounds incredible, the beat and the vibe it had is similar to K-Pop music, and it was catchy at the same time. The fact that it also got me to repeat the song multiple times shows how much of a masterpiece it is with each play. The ending song is more peaceful as it calms the anime down. Because it focused on Dia, it had a relaxing tone which also contains a note change to show how each episode changes Dia's face in that ending.Overall, The World's Finest Assassin is a generic yet intriguing fantasy isekai created to date. The soundtrack sounds incredible, and the characters are intriguing to watch. The only things I wish were that the animation and certain parts of the story could've been better, but some aspects may be hard to fix for the studio. Aside from those flaws, this isekai has the potential to develop into a finer story and grab the attention of those who love watching anime such as this. With the way this anime ended, I'm hoping a second season gets revealed soon to explain more about the Hero and continue Lugh's plan to assassinate them. that, here are the good and the bad that I found in this assassin isekai.The plot is very intriguing as the protagonist's goal isn't becoming a hero and saving the world from a demon lord, but to assassinate said hero to prevent that world's destruction.

If you still watch the show and you got triggered don\'t tell me I didn\'t warn you.No let\'s start the unpopular review. Well, when I saw the review scores I already knew this will be a good one. I\'m not disappointed. When you see the scores switching between 1 and 8-9 you know that the show is controversial, and usually those are the...best ones. It has a lot of similarities with Redo or Mushoku, and in some aspects I think this is even better than those two.It has the same contrasting vibe as the Redo. On the surface the world is perfect, but under the hood everything is rotten by its core. Full of injustice, disturbing, abberated, disgusting and unfortunate lifes. So if you want to escape from the reality don\'t watch this. I mean seriously. You\'ll be deeply disturbed by it.The good things:- It had much less funservice than I originally anticipated and even when it happend it was at least somewhat founded (except the mother...)- The harem aspect of the show was not in the forefront as usual, moreover it was founded in the historical aspect of the world, additionally their attraction was understandable toward the MC. Lastly they had function as well not just brainless funservice.- It was much more mature than I expected- The final boss fight. **Minor spoiler alert** I was honestly expecting that the villain will stand up at the end or something like that, but no. The show was built up for that one moment, and it was executed pretty well.- I really liked the aspect of the show that you can act good even if your intentions are ""morally questionable"" at best.- The main hero were understandable. It was really nice to see how he finally found a reason to fight for after a whole life of an emotionless killing.- Visual quality is really good. Most of the fights scenes were spectacular in my opinion. (Note: Not the best one ever though)- Maha. Cool and useful character. I was honestly suprised how well developed and whitty her character was despite being a harem sidechick.- The MC was cool, but not overly edgy. The near perfect balance.- Personally I liked the magic chanting sound effects. At least something unique.- Honestly, this show had quite a few good momentsNow the bad part:- Some dialoge were pretty trash, and it took away from the drama- A few times the tone changes were not paced correctly- This is a typical isekai, so yeah the story arc and the world building itself just the usual quality (it had a few intersting aspect though).- This is a power fantasy as well. So you know, if you saw one of these you saw all of them. Even though the spin is interesting here. The MC were OP as hell, however the main villain is considerably more OP.- Tarte... Well the character itself were well develeped and likeable, but unlike Maha her exsistence was completly unnecerary. She did nothing, just a forced scene in the last episode.- The filler godess scenes..- The story is unfinished.

It has a lot of similarities with Redo or Mushoku, and in some aspects I think this is even better than those two.It has the same contrasting vibe as the Redo. On the surface the world is perfect, but under the hood everything is rotten by its core. Full of injustice, disturbing, abberated, disgusting and unfortunate lifes. So if you want to escape from the reality don\'t watch this. I mean seriously. You\'ll be deeply disturbed by it.The good things:- It had much less funservice than I originally anticipated and even when it happend it was at least somewhat founded (except the mother...)- The harem aspect of the show was not in the forefront as usual, moreover it was founded in the historical aspect of the world, additionally their attraction was understandable toward the MC. Lastly they had function as well not just brainless funservice.- It was much more mature than I expected- The final boss fight. **Minor spoiler alert** I was honestly expecting that the villain will stand up at the end or something like that, but no. The show was built up for that one moment, and it was executed pretty well.- I really liked the aspect of the show that you can act good even if your intentions are ""morally questionable"" at best.- The main hero were understandable. It was really nice to see how he finally found a reason to fight for after a whole life of an emotionless killing.- Visual quality is really good. Most of the fights scenes were spectacular in my opinion. (Note: Not the best one ever though)- Maha. Cool and useful character.

A solid 7, a good anime to watch in one evening because you have nothing else to do and forget about it one week later. Like all Isekai anime it\'s not anything special, for an anime about assassination it had a very concerning small amount of assassinating. It was enjoyable to watch for sure. Not much else really to say about it. That\'s just the way animes like this go. Would recommend watching since it was still pretty good but kind of underwhelming in the action department, not in quality but in quantity. I\'d still probably say that among the Isekai genre...it would probably land somewhere in the top 40% maybe even top 30% due to it\'s unique idea of being an assassin rather than your classic ""hero reborn in another world, go kill demon lord and save the world, big poggers"". it would probably land somewhere in the top 40% maybe even top 30% due to it\'s unique idea of being an assassin rather than your classic ""hero reborn in another world, go kill demon lord and save the world, big poggers"".', ""!I've delved into this curious concoction, and oh, the controversies it brews! The juxtaposition between fervent praise and critical disdain echoes throughout the reviews, each offering a glimpse into its polarizing nature.My appraisal, tethered to a middling rating, stems from a yearning for substantial narrative progression. I adored the concept—an assassin reincarnated, bestowed with a second chance in this world. A promising foundation, indeed.Yet, the immersion shattered like a fragile illusion. The gaming-style skill set felt ludicrous, even by fantastical standards, and the enchantment of spells tested the limits of credulity.Despite the questionable nuances, I strived to look beyond. Alas, it transgressed into a quagmire....The romantic entanglement with a cousin, a misstep akin to straying into the labyrinthine dramas of Sis x Sis. A lamentable misfire, akin to a shoddier rendition of Darling in the Franxx.An anime I endured, not without a sliver of regret, but it lingers, leaving a distasteful residue.

I enjoyed his characterization and the worldbuilding of the magic system in the new fantasy world (which was quite unique), but as time went on the MC's character began to fall flat and it felt like the show regressed into its more comfortable wish-fulfillment harem isekai origins. Horrific events, such as child sex trafficking, seemed to...be used for nothing but a plot device and an opportunity for MC to come in and save the day. This treatment of the topic truly turned me off the show. The relationships he builds with the people he recruits for his mission feel one-dimensional, and their subservience towards him, though logically understandable, don't feel rooted in any proper relationship development.Of course, there's nothing wrong with the show evolving into a more standard harem isekai, but it felt like it had been promising something different, so it was pretty disappointing for me and I ended up dropping it. be used for nothing but a plot device and an opportunity for MC to come in and save the day.

Truly, I was looking forward to this anime. The trailer seemed good but, I decided to stop after I saw the ""uncensored"" tag on the fourth episode. I just finished watching it because I was extremely bored but it sucked.2. The anime itself was so pointless. First Harems suck. A woman\'s value does not equate to their ability to mold themselves to the MC\'s taste or beg for the MC to fuck them. He is using the women around him how he pleased and he is basically a psychopath.3. This anime tried to touch on...many adult themes such as rape and human trafficking which in some ways I think was portrayed decently for a second then it becomes let bygones be bygones.I would add this to the horrifically long list of anime that hypersexualized and objectified women made by presumably misogynistic and horny creators. many adult themes such as rape and human trafficking which in some ways I think was portrayed decently for a second then it becomes let bygones be bygones.I would add this to the horrifically long list of anime that hypersexualized and objectified women made by presumably misogynistic and horny creators.', ""Despite not being a huge fan of the Isekai genre, I really enjoyed what is out(as of Nov 13) of 'The World's Finest Assassin'. I usually find myself growing bored of Isekai's and even the fantasy genre because they always share the same tropes and generic characters; this is different. I hurried to the next episodes and dreaded coming to the end of my binge. The series has a long way to go but already has a good start.Story   8- The story and pacing was probably my favorite part of the experience so far. It's quite refreshing to see that the main character...was OP before being Isekai'd with a bunch of power up's and magic. Although i want to see him older and defeat the hero, I'm happy with how slowly its going, unlike others that solve a problem within 2 episodes. It takes you through every experience he has, from learning spells, training, and even his thought process.Art/ Animation   7- The art was boring. Yes, it is appealing to look at and the scenery was lovely but also very generic and rather ununique. I loved seeing all of their facial expressions and clothing designs but I cannot point out anything extortionary about the art style.The animation is nothing impressive either but also very clean. It doesn't look choppy, become low quality, or unrealistic but nor did I ever go back just to see the characters movements and analyze the impact the animations made towards how the scenes flowed.Sound   9- I adored the soundtrack. The opening is already one of my favorites, sound and visuals. Every episode had a tune that you could argue fits the scene but none really stand out to me, they all remind me of each other but despite that, I found myself zoning out into the music rather watching the show.Characters   7- I was extremely fond of the fact that it didn't introduce you to every character in episode 1. I do complain that most of the females have the same personality traits and that 'depend on the main character because he's so amazing' type of mindset. Other than the few flaws, I found them pretty enjoyable and have already begin to dislike and root for certain characters. Although I am hoping Lough will be less straight faced and show his emotions more often.Conclusion- Considering the state of the anime, I cannot give a 100% review on my opinion, but I do feel very few things will change. It is not my idea of a perfect show by any means but is definitely ideal and can for sure see myself getting engulfed in future episodes and any characters/ arcs to come. was OP before being Isekai'd with a bunch of power up's and magic.

TL;DR at the bottom.First of all, the MC is the most perfect person in the universe and this leaves no further room for character growth.  The Mary Sue trope is based on him, everything he touches turns into gold, every girl he wants becomes his groupie.  He is Deus Ex Machina itself!  The only character flaw I find is that he is chaste.The story is an amalgamation of the author's sexual fantasies.  There's child sex trafficking, rape, Stockholm Syndrome, harems, etc.All the side characters are fans of the MC....Everyone is cheering for him.  He is so perfect!Now I remember... There was an actual plot presented to us in the first episode , I won't spoil what it is, but it's never given any consideration throughout the anime (maybe until the last episode, but I won't be watching it).TL;DR: OP MC, boring AF.

The synopsis got me hooked, and I thought I would really enjoy this. I'm not really a guy that can express a lot of words properly so I won't be saying as much as I want to. Extra short thing: love the opening, though it reminded me too much of the beat of Cigarette Ahegao so take that as you will.The first 3 episodes, not gonna lie, I thought were interesting. It set up the premise and goal...to a tee. Not much said there. Episode 4 and 5 were...okay. Proper training and introducing some main characters, acceptable to me. But episodes 6-11 are where it REALLY slows down.A majority of those episodes were very much background. I don't really mind that part actually, hence why I thought Mekaku City Actors was underrated for a good amount of time. It was made clear Maha would be important from the get-go. With her background episodes and having finished the anime, it physically pains me how minor of a character she really is during the season. There were also points during watching I actually forgot this was supposed to be an isekai plot and it felt more like harem (despite the fact every single character is underaged). I really didn't want to have this become background noise but that's what happened, I didn't care about what was going on because it didn't feel important.Then I watch Episode 12, which I think is the best of the season. In fact, that episode is why I'm giving this 8/10 instead of 6/10. The final battle being over that fast was...something. Not that I hate it. The wrap-up felt appropriate in my opinion. However, there is still a major problem with it. I actually got fooled the large guy was the Hero (good job me) but like...who was he??? That is the first time he appeared and I like knowing the character at least. And the reveal of the real hero was...rather underwhelming.All in all, this was just disappointing to me, and that sucks because everything outside the relevance and plot of the middle episodes are what drags this down.

I went from binge-watching it to having to take multiple breaks throughout episodes because it couldn't catch my attention as much. I think it has a lot of potential, and I acknowledge I have a slight bias against 'harem esc' animes, finding them cliché and boring since i'm not their target...audience.

But, if there ever comes a day where season two is released then the pacing for now is fine.I am very biased towards this anime, despite my dislike for the fanservice, because it features an 'overpowered' main character who is an anti-hero and an assassin with some dark topics as well as more heartwarming moments with things such as family and found family.So if youre a fan of the isekai genre, I recommend you watch this anime. It has a nice premise and a great magic system with a lot of promising potential. However, be aware the main plot point introduced falls off slightly at points.

Instead we got kinda cute busty animewaifus who barely give the story any substance. Why are they there?

It gives a reason for the main character having a past life, makes it a core part of the character, and actually makes good use of the ""Isekai"" portion of that insanely long title instead of just using it as a lazy excuse to establish a fantasy world.While the show as a whole is a pretty fun watch, it\'s not without its fair share of problems. And though I do still...recommend this show, it is quite unfortunate that so many of this show\'s positive qualities are also some of the show\'s only issues. So many good things are done either in excess or are lacking in some way but was also not enough to ruin my overall watching experience. As always, this review will be looking at this show from a purely ""anime only"" perspective as I have not read the original source material.PROS:1. The main character is actually interesting. This really shouldn\'t have to be a pro worth listing but with the way so many shows are right now, this feels like a genuine accomplishment. If you couldn\'t already guess from the highly descriptive title, the main character used to be a trained assassin in his past life. We see him use whatever means necessary to gain the upper hand almost exclusively through incredibly underhanded tactics. That being said, the character is still likeable. He isn\'t obnoxiously sociopathic despite being as ruthlessly rational and cold as he is in the show. The whole point of the main character\'s development is that he\'s trying to use this reincarnation as a second chance to live out a life where he is no longer a mere tool to anyone and can make decisions for himself. He\'s still characteristically calculating and rational but not so much so to the point of constantly sacrificing others for his own sake. He is a likeable sociopath, well done.2. The art and animation is pretty top notch. It isn\'t Ufotable or MAPPA level but it\'s still much better then your average isekai show, especially the first few episodes. The art style isn\'t the most original thing neither is it particularly offensive in any way, it\'s pretty safe for the most part, but there are certain moments that just stand out from the rest. Some might call it ""sakuga"", I call it ""spending most of your budget on the first few episodes to reel people in"", but these moments look gorgeous regardless of what you decide to call it.3. The story doesn\'t pull its punches. With the complete oversaturation of same-y shonen shows that are all about ""believing in yourself"" or ""winning with the power of love and friendship"", it\'s refreshing to see a show like this every once in a while that likes to dive a little deeper into its world. When done correctly, dark and gritty plot points in a fantasy world do so much to ground the story and make it feel like a much more complex world than it would have been otherwise. It doesn\'t have to be Goblin Slayer or Beserk levels of dark in order for it to be effective, although this show does get there at some points, but even a little bit of twistedness is enough to be immersive. That\'s why shows like My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, and Jujutsu Kaisen are so good at being immersive shonen experiences, they have a level of depth that most other shows don\'t have because of a lack of any real consequences.4. The worldbuilding is pretty well developed and quite interesting despite the show only being 12 episodes long. They do a pretty good job establishing the world and its land. The magic system is well explained even though it isn\'t the most interesting or unique thing. So many fantasy shows neglect the worldbuilding aspect of creating a fantasy world and it\'s nice to see when it\'s actually considered in some way by the writers.CONS:1. While the main character is quite interesting at first, the novelty starts to wear off quick and we\'re just left with a character that\'s largely unmoved by and unreceptive to emotionally impactful moments. To bring back a previous comparison, the reason why My Hero Academia and Demon Slayer have such great moments is because of a main protagonist that\'s prone to emotional outbursts like a normal functioning human. Deku vs. Todoroki and episode 19 of Demon Slayer are almost completely driven by the emotion of the characters and that emotion resonates with the audience as well. However, when the main character just doesn\'t feel anything during these moments, the audience won\'t care either, or at the very least would create some really strange narrative dissonance.2. While the art and animation is pretty good, the CG is a completely different story. Most shows nowadays utilize CG for heavily populated scenes or assets of a scene that might be difficult to animate such as a large crowd of people or a horse-drawn carriage. Normally, this would be completely acceptable if the show didn\'t rely on the CG for close up shots as well. I can understand rendering an entire army in CG just because it would be a pain in the ass to animate that, but at least animate the soldiers when you\'re giving them a speaking role. The quality of the CG is also quite shit. Movements are stilted and no effort was made to even try and blend it in with the animation in any capacity.3. While I like the fact that the story doesn\'t pull its punches, I would like it a lot more if it made cohesive sense with the rest of the show. The first few episodes start the show off quite dark and gritty especially with episode 6, but they seem to have forgotten that there needs to be a reason for those moments beyond the sake of having it for shock value. The show only ever embraces these darker moments at the very surface level and never gives us a reason to care. I can understand if you want a character to have some kind of tragic backstory with a tortured past and checkered history but if those things are never brought back up and addressed in a meaningful way then all we\'re left with is a weird mood kill. An isekai show that does this better is Rising of the Shield Hero. While not nearly as dark as this show, Shield Hero actually manages to address the darker moments and even gets some character development out of it.4. While it\'s nice to even have any amount of worldbuilding in the show at all, there are so many plot/worldbuilding holes that just go completely unaddressed. When the magic system is essentially alchemy on easy mode, it\'s not hard to think of how that would ruin the world\'s economy. Let me give an example of this exact issue. There\'s a moment in one of the episodes where the main character was exploring the magic system and was able figure out a way to create gold. From what I could tell, this world\'s currency runs on a simple RPG currency system, that being copper, silver, and gold coins. If you could just create gold out of nothing with magic and your currency is backed by precious metals like gold, doesn\'t that instantly devalue that currency to nothing? Of course, there\'s no explanation for this in the story and this ultimately isn\'t that big of a deal, but it\'s small details like this that pile up and diminish the overall immersive experience of a fantasy world. And this isn\'t the only problem, there are tons more like this none of which are addressed in the story but to list every one of them off here would lengthen this review by an unreasonable amount.5. The ultimate con of this show is in the first sentences of the previous four. Every good aspect that this show has is followed up by a negative aspect that\'s only present due to poor execution. I made it a point to start every con with ""While..."" just to drive home the point that there really isn\'t anything that this show does wrong in particular, just fails to deliver on the expectations it set for itself.Final Thoughts:""Sekai Saikou no Ansatsusha, Isekai Kizoku ni Tensei suru"" has left me with some mixed feelings. On one hand, I definitely do think it\'s one of the better isekai shows out right now and I recommend it for those who are getting sick of the same old boring and generic isekai genre. But on the other, I feel like the show just doesn\'t do justice to the things that make it unique and different in the first place. It\'s one of those shows that you finish watching and think to yourself, ""that was pretty cool"" and proceed to forget about before moving on to a different show. It\'s memorable merely for the interesting premise alone if nothing else. It\'s a 7/10 not because it\'s generic or average but just because it\'s held back by its own shortcomings of being too ambitious.Score Breakdown:- I give the story a 7. It\'s caught my attention and was interesting enough but was not anything that blew me away.- Art and animation is an 8 overall despite the shit CG. The first few episodes really carries the show in this aspect.- Sound is a 7. It\'s perfectly serviceable on a technical level. No weird balancing issues and voice acting was good. The OP is oddly quiet, though perhaps this might just be me.- Due to the general lack of overall character development I will have to give this a 6. The characters are interesting but, since they don\'t really develop, they kinda get a little stale.- Enjoyment is a 7. Again, it was interesting enough to keep my attention all the way through and I never felt super bored during any of the episodes.- Overall, the show is a 7.

I really enjoyed this series, and will be looking forward to a next season, hopefully.The story is pretty good if I do say so myself.The art is marvelous as well. The action scenes are literally fire. Its not the same as other anime series where an episode with a fight scene is literally the same sh*t as the episode before.  I would, however, loved it more if there was more time to elaborate the details as there was a time where things progressed too quickly if I must say so.The sounds really good...too. I kinda felt cheated on though with there spells as it felt kind of lazy. They were literally reversed Japanese words. ""Do se se"" became ""Se se doo"" which was the metal crafting part. It literally blew my mind when I came to realize that it was just reversed Japanese words. As I am not Japanese nor talk Japanese. Although years of watching made me understand and comprehend words that they say. To which where my conclusion came from.Character design is pretty good too. Although as I have said, if the series was made longer, character elaboration could have been done as to make everything better, I feel like.I pretty much enjoyed the series as the genre is to my liking.

Not a salaryman or a NEET but an assassin. His personality is believable and the little scientific facts here or there based upon his actions are clever.

While I don\'t believe it is doing anything wholly amazing and at parts is questionable - I wouldn\'t blame you for disliking or even hating it - I do think giving this a shot might still be worthwhile to form your own opinion of it... as with most anime.  I really don\'t think that any one review does the anime justice (both in terms of praise and criticism).And while my own review probably can\'t guarantee...an accurate prediction of your experiences of the show, I still intend to share my opinion on this.---[ Animation & Art: 7/8-10 ]Is this anime pretty? Well, that prettiness is largely afforded only to the main cast, with villains being typically less attractive looking too in a pretty cliched way, and there is one episode where briefly the anime transforms into a bit of a slideshow as it summarises events of that period of time... but for the most part the animation is smooth and serviceable and the art is not an eye-sore. And, being seasonal, you can naturally expect consistency in the art and art style. No, the art is not unique - I\'ve seen it done before - but it is likeable and adds to the watchability of the show.Are there kickass animation moments...? Hard to say, it depends what your bar and expectations for kickass is. There are definitely some pretty well executed action scenes, I\'d say, although if you were expecting some crazy angles and turns, I don\'t recall there being much of that. Again, it\'s perfectly good, but nothing overly experimental.I will say though... the anime opening looks gorgeous.And the female cast does remind me of genshin characters in how they were designed. Especially Dia. (Before it makes you think that this means the anime is perfect for you though... maybe read the character bit...)---[ Sound: 7/10 ]While not the most memorable, the sound design, as with most things here is enjoyable and serviceable. At times, there\'s a hint of authenticity there, especially with the opening music, I think, but to my knowledge it\'s not terrible stand out. There were times where I think there could have been more sound effects or done more with the music - nothing specific comes to mind but there were moments were the sound could have given the actions taken more weight -, but during the others I wouldn\'t have changed the sound effects and background music because it worked for that scene. I will give it something over a passing grade though, since it\'s not like they could afford to have a soundtrack of the quality of big budget hollywood films, so for an anime, it\'s solid.---[ Plot, World & Premise: 7/10 ]Isekai anime is not a new concept. Older guys reincarnating into a world of swords and magic is not a new concept. However, to my knowledge, the mc being an assassin is fairly unique and makes for an interesting premise. With the MC in this case being originally only a tool that was disposed of after his service was finished, feeling little to no emotion until the very end when he feels bitterness and rage towards his betrayal, you can see why such an anime could be interesting. There is a lot of potential there for the MC to develop and become a vastly different person in this new universe with his experiences intact and with him no longer wishing to live as a tool. However, such change is slow and has to be carefully done. And for the most part you can see hints of that, with the MC being a conflicting mix of callous, even admitting aloud that he - at least partially - uses the people he helps to his advantage and certainly doesn\'t /just/ help out of some selfless desire to see the smiles on everyone\'s faces or something corny and childlike such as might have been the goal of a less jaded character... and not struggling too much with killing a person, even as a 10 year old kid - although that could be because then less time has passed from his time as a tool. And indeed, there is /some/ progress made with the MC. While in an earlier episode he doesn\'t really hesitate after he kills, in a later episode within this season with perhaps 2-4 (can\'t remember the exact amount of time) years passing from that initial kill he does seem to actually be affected by the sight of a wife of one of his victims crying over the man he just killed, showing that he might have actually opened up to feeling empathy over time.I\'d say the magic attributes in this world are standard, the magical skills being portrayed as cards is a little cheasy and honestly, the MC being reincarnated as a magical prodigy has been done before (see Mushouku Tensei), but as a fan of magic nevertheless, I can\'t help but still enjoy it. Especially since it has it\'s own twist to how magic spells work here, with the MC going with the surprisingly OP ability of spell weaving enabling him to put new spells into existence which can then be used universally by anyone with enough mana and possibly the right attribute/skill? Regardless I found that part of it rather interesting.Now the MC\'s goals are 1) to not be a tool in his next life (which is understandable) and 2) to kill the hero before his eighteenth (and after his sixteenth) year of life in this new world. The latter I think could turn out unnecessary because with the MC himself being fairly OP I really don\'t see why, since he is supposedly tasked with killing the person who killed the beast, he couldn\'t kill the beast himself and get that over and done with. It could have been an avenue worth exploring... but, we\'ll see. For now, we\'ve been red-herringed with him killing someone who given all the hints should have been a hero but as it turns out the hero is more of a pretty boy (which is simultaneously neat and frustrating to me), so who knows. Still, it does make sense if you don\'t think about it too much - with isekai it is almost always better not to think about things too much...To the goddesses\' benefit, I do think it was a good idea to have those short moments of exploring her other attempts of finding someone to kill the hero - although portraying them all as complete failures to perfect Lugh feels a bit too much.This world is pretty standard: peasants try to get by and the aristocracy is corrupt filth mixed in with a few decent or good exceptions. I think the filth part was done a bit better in MT, because there even the MC\'s new family were far from ideal people and they weren\'t a family of assassins... but it definitely makes a stab for it. Trafficking is not something afforded as a theme to discuss or show in most other anime outside of isekai, not to my experience, but it is absolutely a realistic issue... although, I\'m not sure the consequences of it on the characters involved were explored as much as they could have been. I will say, there is no gratuitious gore or needlessly overdoing the forced sex aspect of it by showing too much of something that should be kept confidential in my mind for the dignity of the people invovled while at the same time they make sure to make it certain that yes, these 12-13 y/o girls are absolutely being sold to pedophiles and scum.There is a disappointing lack of male victims of any kind though, because yes, even guys can be vulnerable, and in retrospect it makes some parts of the anime feel like a part of a saviour/knight in shining armour fantasy a guy would have where he saves beautfiul damsels in distress... and I mean, he does do that, and yeah, they absolutely fall for him over that, and no, I don\'t think that was treated as well as it could have been.However, in this particular case, I might actually reserve my full judgements until a future season - and I hope it will be a dubbed one too. There is still a chance this could be improved upon in the next season because it has been shown that actually, /some/ characters do change, be it in abiltiies or personality a little bit over time, so here\'s hoping this development will be afforded to the rest of the cast too.I don\'t actually think the pacing is slow as some would put it. It takes a slightly more Mushouku Tensei approach to things taking quite a few episodes to get going with the plot, BUT this is there to organically introduce the main players on the protagonist\'s side of the story, the world and develop his abilities before hand and I was never really bored. In fact, I might have even preferred those earlies episodes slightly, with the quality falling off a little in the later episodes. (Hopefully, the creators will realise was this show\'s main strengths were and return to them going forward though, instead of all the unncessary damsel-has-a-crush-on-her-knight stuff... unless they actually plan to make it a part of said damsel\'s development.)It should also be said, that unlike some prodigies who just happen to be good at everything this time around for ??? reasons, we know from the start that the MC was an assassin in his last life and was experienced in the field. Him being adept at killing, him having knowledge that could have been useful to his job - including cooking, to keep his health up and as a cover and his knowledge on metals, as they might have made up the weapons he used in his job - all makes sense, given that he was reincarnated with the memories of his previous life intact, not to mention that he was then also taught by masters in their field upon reincarnation.And, as a slight alternative to MT and other isekai\'s, MC isn\'t really a perv by nature... as stated he does have bodily reactions as anyone would have, but he doesn\'t creep up on anybody while sleeping, steal panties or touch boobs, doesn\'t really ""accidentally"" run into boobs and doesn\'t even really appear attracted to his harem. Heck, even though he does claim to love Dia, he really doesn\'t go to any extremes in acting like a perv at any point in time. And there are less annoying ""oopsies"" and less fanservice moment, than in some anime of a similar nature. (Still, there are a few sketchy moments where I thought it was going to take a pervier turn than it really did.)---[ Characters: (6-7/10) ]I am tempted to score this even lower, because honestly, this is probably the weakest parts of this anime, though not by much.While the MC and his new father are actually surprisingly likable for assassins, even with the MC\'s callous side... it\'s the women with whom it falls apart. And that is NOT something you want in an anime that involves a harem.The Goddess is reasonable enough and fortunately doesn\'t yet appear to hold any feelings for the MC - THANK GODS FOR THAT! - our four main females are distinguished from the rest of the female cast in 2 of the following ways: 1) they are no doubt purposefully designed to look 50% more attractive than the other women in that world, possibly because the creator felt so insecure about their ability to make the girls interesting enough to outshine the others by means of personality and development (which I mean, yeah, I can see why, having seen this season) 2) they all feel infatuated with the MC (not necessarily romantically, because there is honestly little that\'s romantic about transferrence or a mother coddling her son a liiiiiittle too much - plus I don\'t think the mom actually has a crush on him, I might be in the minority here, but I really do think she\'s just a bit of an idiot... and I mean, I have heard that in ye olden days sometimes the family would actually be privy to their child\'s first night with the person they married, so it doesn\'t actually surprise me that the mother was that interested about her son\'s wet dreams... history is weird, people, stop pulling that surprised pikachu face when anime does weird stuff, you guys do know where it got its inspiration from).To the creators\' credit, when it comes to 2 of the characters their infatuation actually makes sense... not that it makes me any less concerned. I mean, the MC - being the callous brat he starts off as - does purposefully make them feel indebted and as charmed by him as possible as a means to ensure they wouldn\'t betray him... and Blondie and Blue had both had the misfortune of being in really screwy circumstances from early on in life before latching onto the MC as their means of survival in that twisted world. But him training them to be self-sufficient as fighters and giving them jobs does not change the fact that they have been in a way brainwashed and while they do realise their status as tools they seem far too in agreement with that. Towards the end of this season, there is a breaking down moment for the maid girl who I can only see as being heartbroken to be left behind without so much as a show of affection from the MC as much as I doubt that she wishes anything bad happening to Dia, so I can only hope that something will be done with that moment and it will be used to develop that character further...But I am far too jaded as an anime person to 100% believe that will happen. Rather, I would be glad if whatever doubts I have were proven wrong in the next season with the evolution of the female cast.I actually quite like Blue. She seems more aware of her position, she does appear to want to be her prince charming\'s equal before pursuing him... and that\'s probably for the best. It reminds me of MT... if you know, you know. Despite this though, her personality, autonomy, etc. are still fairly limited to loving her prince charming and wanting to protect her fellow orphans. Oh, yeah and she also has blue hair. I do love blue, but in this world where the hair colours are usually pretty standard actually - same for eye colours - I think it sticks out like a sore thumb and I\'m not really sure it was necessary for her hair to be blue.The mother is the weakest link. She is the wife of an assassin, yet appears overly childlike. And while at first those qualities have moments where they are endearing and even relatable - yes, parents coddle their children, yes, parents can act like children at times -  there are times when it goes obnoxiously overboard. She doesn\'t appear to have nuance, or a second, more serious side to her. She\'s just 24/7 child-mother who is far too clingy with her son. No development on that front either.Dia... unfortunately turns out to be a cousin. And also a love interest. Now, I\'m not so sure that MC could not have feigned a love for her and I\'m not so sure Dia couldn\'t simply be confusing admiration with love, or that she\'s necessary in love. In fact, I don\'t think she\'s been /that/ forward about it, unlike the other two girls... But supposing I and the others are correct... that\'s pretty yikes. Cousin marriage did and does happen, but there is less of a choice - it\'s more of a pre-made choice in those situations. It often involves religion or the nobility wishing to keep their bloodliness pure... but here there isn\'t that pressure for the two of them specifically to be together. So yeah... incest, not great. I will say, at least they didn\'t grow up to- well... nevermind, actually, they kind of did. For like two weeks.---[ Overall Enjoyment: 7/10 ]It\'s an anime with potential. It\'s good on most fronts, and honestly, I\'ve seen worse even as characters go. The opening is definitely great, so even if you never watch the anime, I would suggest at least giving the opening a shot if you have a minute and a half to spare. This is by no means perfection. It\'s not revolutionary, it\'s not the funniest, it\'s not the most wholesome, it\'s not the edgiest, grimmest, etc. But it\'s not boring, it\'s not overly full of fanservice and it\'s watchable. Plus, it\'s what... 12 episodes? We\'re talking around 4 hours wasted at worst and at best a new anime to watch to pass time.And, maybe with a bigger audience it might encourage the production of a - hopefully better - second season. an accurate prediction of your experiences of the show, I still intend to share my opinion on this.---[ Animation & Art: 7/8-10 ]Is this anime pretty? Well, that prettiness is largely afforded only to the main cast, with villains being typically less attractive looking too in a pretty cliched way, and there is one episode where briefly the anime transforms into a bit of a slideshow as it summarises events of that period of time... but for the most part the animation is smooth and serviceable and the art is not an eye-sore. And, being seasonal, you can naturally expect consistency in the art and art style. No, the art is not unique - I\'ve seen it done before - but it is likeable and adds to the watchability of the show.Are there kickass animation moments...? Hard to say, it depends what your bar and expectations for kickass is. There are definitely some pretty well executed action scenes, I\'d say, although if you were expecting some crazy angles and turns, I don\'t recall there being much of that. Again, it\'s perfectly good, but nothing overly experimental.I will say though... the anime opening looks gorgeous.And the female cast does remind me of genshin characters in how they were designed. Especially Dia. (Before it makes you think that this means the anime is perfect for you though... maybe read the character bit...)---[ Sound: 7/10 ]While not the most memorable, the sound design, as with most things here is enjoyable and serviceable. At times, there\'s a hint of authenticity there, especially with the opening music, I think, but to my knowledge it\'s not terrible stand out. There were times where I think there could have been more sound effects or done more with the music - nothing specific comes to mind but there were moments were the sound could have given the actions taken more weight -, but during the others I wouldn\'t have changed the sound effects and background music because it worked for that scene. I will give it something over a passing grade though, since it\'s not like they could afford to have a soundtrack of the quality of big budget hollywood films, so for an anime, it\'s solid.---[ Plot, World & Premise: 7/10 ]Isekai anime is not a new concept. Older guys reincarnating into a world of swords and magic is not a new concept. However, to my knowledge, the mc being an assassin is fairly unique and makes for an interesting premise. With the MC in this case being originally only a tool that was disposed of after his service was finished, feeling little to no emotion until the very end when he feels bitterness and rage towards his betrayal, you can see why such an anime could be interesting. There is a lot of potential there for the MC to develop and become a vastly different person in this new universe with his experiences intact and with him no longer wishing to live as a tool. However, such change is slow and has to be carefully done. And for the most part you can see hints of that, with the MC being a conflicting mix of callous, even admitting aloud that he - at least partially - uses the people he helps to his advantage and certainly doesn\'t /just/ help out of some selfless desire to see the smiles on everyone\'s faces or something corny and childlike such as might have been the goal of a less jaded character... and not struggling too much with killing a person, even as a 10 year old kid - although that could be because then less time has passed from his time as a tool. And indeed, there is /some/ progress made with the MC. While in an earlier episode he doesn\'t really hesitate after he kills, in a later episode within this season with perhaps 2-4 (can\'t remember the exact amount of time) years passing from that initial kill he does seem to actually be affected by the sight of a wife of one of his victims crying over the man he just killed, showing that he might have actually opened up to feeling empathy over time.I\'d say the magic attributes in this world are standard, the magical skills being portrayed as cards is a little cheasy and honestly, the MC being reincarnated as a magical prodigy has been done before (see Mushouku Tensei), but as a fan of magic nevertheless, I can\'t help but still enjoy it. Especially since it has it\'s own twist to how magic spells work here, with the MC going with the surprisingly OP ability of spell weaving enabling him to put new spells into existence which can then be used universally by anyone with enough mana and possibly the right attribute/skill? Regardless I found that part of it rather interesting.Now the MC\'s goals are 1) to not be a tool in his next life (which is understandable) and 2) to kill the hero before his eighteenth (and after his sixteenth) year of life in this new world. The latter I think could turn out unnecessary because with the MC himself being fairly OP I really don\'t see why, since he is supposedly tasked with killing the person who killed the beast, he couldn\'t kill the beast himself and get that over and done with. It could have been an avenue worth exploring... but, we\'ll see. For now, we\'ve been red-herringed with him killing someone who given all the hints should have been a hero but as it turns out the hero is more of a pretty boy (which is simultaneously neat and frustrating to me), so who knows. Still, it does make sense if you don\'t think about it too much - with isekai it is almost always better not to think about things too much...To the goddesses\' benefit, I do think it was a good idea to have those short moments of exploring her other attempts of finding someone to kill the hero - although portraying them all as complete failures to perfect Lugh feels a bit too much.This world is pretty standard: peasants try to get by and the aristocracy is corrupt filth mixed in with a few decent or good exceptions. I think the filth part was done a bit better in MT, because there even the MC\'s new family were far from ideal people and they weren\'t a family of assassins... but it definitely makes a stab for it. Trafficking is not something afforded as a theme to discuss or show in most other anime outside of isekai, not to my experience, but it is absolutely a realistic issue... although, I\'m not sure the consequences of it on the characters involved were explored as much as they could have been. I will say, there is no gratuitious gore or needlessly overdoing the forced sex aspect of it by showing too much of something that should be kept confidential in my mind for the dignity of the people invovled while at the same time they make sure to make it certain that yes, these 12-13 y/o girls are absolutely being sold to pedophiles and scum.There is a disappointing lack of male victims of any kind though, because yes, even guys can be vulnerable, and in retrospect it makes some parts of the anime feel like a part of a saviour/knight in shining armour fantasy a guy would have where he saves beautfiul damsels in distress... and I mean, he does do that, and yeah, they absolutely fall for him over that, and no, I don\'t think that was treated as well as it could have been.However, in this particular case, I might actually reserve my full judgements until a future season - and I hope it will be a dubbed one too. There is still a chance this could be improved upon in the next season because it has been shown that actually, /some/ characters do change, be it in abiltiies or personality a little bit over time, so here\'s hoping this development will be afforded to the rest of the cast too.I don\'t actually think the pacing is slow as some would put it. It takes a slightly more Mushouku Tensei approach to things taking quite a few episodes to get going with the plot, BUT this is there to organically introduce the main players on the protagonist\'s side of the story, the world and develop his abilities before hand and I was never really bored. In fact, I might have even preferred those earlies episodes slightly, with the quality falling off a little in the later episodes. (Hopefully, the creators will realise was this show\'s main strengths were and return to them going forward though, instead of all the unncessary damsel-has-a-crush-on-her-knight stuff... unless they actually plan to make it a part of said damsel\'s development.)It should also be said, that unlike some prodigies who just happen to be good at everything this time around for ??? reasons, we know from the start that the MC was an assassin in his last life and was experienced in the field. Him being adept at killing, him having knowledge that could have been useful to his job - including cooking, to keep his health up and as a cover and his knowledge on metals, as they might have made up the weapons he used in his job - all makes sense, given that he was reincarnated with the memories of his previous life intact, not to mention that he was then also taught by masters in their field upon reincarnation.And, as a slight alternative to MT and other isekai\'s, MC isn\'t really a perv by nature... as stated he does have bodily reactions as anyone would have, but he doesn\'t creep up on anybody while sleeping, steal panties or touch boobs, doesn\'t really ""accidentally"" run into boobs and doesn\'t even really appear attracted to his harem. Heck, even though he does claim to love Dia, he really doesn\'t go to any extremes in acting like a perv at any point in time. And there are less annoying ""oopsies"" and less fanservice moment, than in some anime of a similar nature. (Still, there are a few sketchy moments where I thought it was going to take a pervier turn than it really did.)---[ Characters: (6-7/10) ]I am tempted to score this even lower, because honestly, this is probably the weakest parts of this anime, though not by much.While the MC and his new father are actually surprisingly likable for assassins, even with the MC\'s callous side... it\'s the women with whom it falls apart. And that is NOT something you want in an anime that involves a harem.The Goddess is reasonable enough and fortunately doesn\'t yet appear to hold any feelings for the MC - THANK GODS FOR THAT! - our four main females are distinguished from the rest of the female cast in 2 of the following ways: 1) they are no doubt purposefully designed to look 50% more attractive than the other women in that world, possibly because the creator felt so insecure about their ability to make the girls interesting enough to outshine the others by means of personality and development (which I mean, yeah, I can see why, having seen this season) 2) they all feel infatuated with the MC (not necessarily romantically, because there is honestly little that\'s romantic about transferrence or a mother coddling her son a liiiiiittle too much - plus I don\'t think the mom actually has a crush on him, I might be in the minority here, but I really do think she\'s just a bit of an idiot... and I mean, I have heard that in ye olden days sometimes the family would actually be privy to their child\'s first night with the person they married, so it doesn\'t actually surprise me that the mother was that interested about her son\'s wet dreams... history is weird, people, stop pulling that surprised pikachu face when anime does weird stuff, you guys do know where it got its inspiration from).To the creators\' credit, when it comes to 2 of the characters their infatuation actually makes sense... not that it makes me any less concerned. I mean, the MC - being the callous brat he starts off as - does purposefully make them feel indebted and as charmed by him as possible as a means to ensure they wouldn\'t betray him... and Blondie and Blue had both had the misfortune of being in really screwy circumstances from early on in life before latching onto the MC as their means of survival in that twisted world. But him training them to be self-sufficient as fighters and giving them jobs does not change the fact that they have been in a way brainwashed and while they do realise their status as tools they seem far too in agreement with that. Towards the end of this season, there is a breaking down moment for the maid girl who I can only see as being heartbroken to be left behind without so much as a show of affection from the MC as much as I doubt that she wishes anything bad happening to Dia, so I can only hope that something will be done with that moment and it will be used to develop that character further...But I am far too jaded as an anime person to 100% believe that will happen. Rather, I would be glad if whatever doubts I have were proven wrong in the next season with the evolution of the female cast.I actually quite like Blue. She seems more aware of her position, she does appear to want to be her prince charming\'s equal before pursuing him... and that\'s probably for the best. It reminds me of MT... if you know, you know. Despite this though, her personality, autonomy, etc. are still fairly limited to loving her prince charming and wanting to protect her fellow orphans.

If you are one who likes eye candy then you will certainly enjoy the opening forays as we see a bunch of action-girls kick butt with no shortage of teaser shots. These moments send a clear signal on what the target audience is so if you do not take a fancy to such things then it is best to drop the show as while the tone does change later on these are the primary draws to this series.That’s not...to say there are no other redeeming qualities to World’s Finest Assassin. To the shows’ credit they do deliver a main character that is driven and accomplished and is not simply your standard NEET/loser MC who gets shoved into a fantasy world. As the name of the series implies, he is a skilled assassin but what really makes him stand out is his anti-hero personality who is a cold and calculating man who is not afraid to get his hands dirty. This adds a fresh twist to the standard isekai formula as the early choices he makes and the way he conducts himself means you are seeing something new and different; it is not a simple rehash of the usual isekai affair. This calculating even manipulative personality does have its flaws however and this issue is put in the spotlight when he manipulates some key characters. It won’t go down with everyone but personally I had no issue with it considering the circumstances of the event.What can prove to be more problematic however is the pacing of the show as whilst the end goal is clearly defined early on, much of the series is devoted to explaining how he recruited the girls to form his team. Whilst these introductions and backstories were welcome (although a note should be given with one which I will explain later) the issue here is by the time we are done with the introductions we are almost past the two third mark. This meant the time devoted to the actual promised plot line is rather limited. I will say that if you have concerns over the opening plotline being forgotten then rest assured the final confrontation does come albeit at a very late point in the series running.As for the ending itself, it is as dramatic as it is sudden. The final fight ends with a blast and the nature of the conclusion was surprising but it is not something that is totally out of the blue given that this sequence is rooted to earlier events that took place in the show. To eagle eyed viewers, you can spot the early cues so there are rewards to be had in keeping your eye out for the finer details. There is even a twist tossed out to add some further drama but personally I did not like it.Perhaps the biggest weakness of World Finest Assassin is the character relationships for whilst the backgrounds and characterisations of the individuals weren’t bad it is their interactions that left me head scratching. You see, many of the girls simply fall head over heels with our MC and whilst some explanation is given for this undying devotion it was not entirely convincing. What was also hard to grasp was the romantic aspect added towards the end which was never given enough screen time. As a result, the relationship was hard to understand and feels even forced given he spends way more time with other loyal companions.As a final note I would say one notable character comes with a very troubled background so if you are sensitive to matters like rape and child abuse you may want to skip this. It is not a main theme of the anime so do not worry about this being a lingering issue. It is just that there are two episodes that take a decidedly grim, perhaps even depressing tone that can be hard to stomach. In fairness those scenes are treated in an appropriate manner although some criticism could be levelled on the lasting impacts these events later in the story.Animation/music:One of the finer points of the series is its animation. The character designs are all appealing and was one of the big draws to watching World’s Finest Assassin. If you like cute and beautiful girls then it will count doubly so as pretty much the entire cast of women in this show can be considered attractive (even the MC’s mother is a hottie). In terms of action scenes, it also delivers well so if you like action then those fans are also well served. The only aspect that was left wanting was the various CGI shots that looked very out of place fortunately this was limited to various horse carriage scenes and some foot soldier animation making it relatively easy to overlook.The animation sequences for the opening and ending parts are also very strong with the contrasting black and white tones used in the opening theme that do an effective in conveying the contrasting morals of our main man. The opening track of ""Dark seeks light"" by Yui Ninomiya is a bit of a mixed bag with me with some parts of the songs being difficult to stomach whiles other bits being good. The ending song ""A Promise"" by Aira Yuuki on the other hand was a more enjoyable but all in all the opening and ending parts were very good and added to my overall enjoyment of the anime.Summary:This is a series that caters to action fans who have a taste for good old eye candy. If that is your thing then lots to be had here as most of the cast is simply breath-taking in the looks department. The fact that the standard of animation is high in both the character modelling and action scenes means the impact is all that bit greater which will please its target audience even more.In terms of story development there is a lot of early promise with its interesting premise but for the most part it fails to deliver as much of the anime screen time is devoted to character exposition. Whilst this is nice, I felt it took too much time from the series. I would also say some caution should be exercised as the story does cover the issue of rape at some point. The other weakness is the suspect character chemistry with most of the cast holding an unnatural devotion that breaks immersion. This was not helped with an unconvincing love story. All things considered this was a pretty good series but won’t be appealing to people outside the core audience it was intended for. The fact this story is left incomplete means it begs a second season or a reading of the light novel. This show would have certainly have been better if it was covered in two cours.Story 7 – The fact the main protagonist is ordered to kill the hero of this new world adds an extra dimension to the tired isekai formula. Whilst most of this early promise is squandered what we get instead is some interesting character exposition. The ending is also dramatic and whilst the events are seemingly random it is all foreshadowed with various earlier scenes littered throughout the show. Does beg for a sequel so keep that in mind when watching this.Characters 6 – Outside of the interesting main character much of the cast is pretty bog standard. You have probably seen it before and the undying loyalty from the girls whilst useful for fanservice does hurt immersion and believability. I also questioned the romantic relationship that seemed forced/tacked on.Animation/music 8 – Strong point of the series. You get very nice character models that makes this an easy series to watch. The big standouts are the great range of beauties that ensures if you are after fanservice then there is plenty to be had here. World’s Finest Assassin also produces some very strong opening and closing sequences.Overall 6.5 – If you like action or fanservice then this is a show I would recommend to you. If that is not you then best to stay away. That is the simple bottom line. Much of this series follows the standard tropes of isekai series with its overpowered MC, an increasing cast of cute girls that fawn over him and everyone else also loving him. The biggest changes to that formula are the MC’s personality who sparks some life in the usual formula but is that enough to get non-isekai fans onboard? Personally, I don’t think so. to say there are no other redeeming qualities to World’s Finest Assassin. To the shows’ credit they do deliver a main character that is driven and accomplished and is not simply your standard NEET/loser MC who gets shoved into a fantasy world.

If that is your thing then lots to be had here as most of the cast is simply breath-taking in the looks department. The fact that the standard of animation is high in both the character modelling and action scenes means the impact is all that bit greater which will please its target audience even more.In terms of story development there is a lot of early promise with its interesting premise but for the most part it fails to deliver as much of the anime screen time is devoted to character exposition. Whilst this is nice, I felt it took too much time from the series. I would also say some caution should be exercised as the story does cover the issue of rape at some point. The other weakness is the suspect character chemistry with most of the cast holding an unnatural devotion that breaks immersion. This was not helped with an unconvincing love story. All things considered this was a pretty good series but won’t be appealing to people outside the core audience it was intended for. The fact this story is left incomplete means it begs a second season or a reading of the light novel. This show would have certainly have been better if it was covered in two cours.Story 7 – The fact the main protagonist is ordered to kill the hero of this new world adds an extra dimension to the tired isekai formula. Whilst most of this early promise is squandered what we get instead is some interesting character exposition. The ending is also dramatic and whilst the events are seemingly random it is all foreshadowed with various earlier scenes littered throughout the show. Does beg for a sequel so keep that in mind when watching this.Characters 6 – Outside of the interesting main character much of the cast is pretty bog standard. You have probably seen it before and the undying loyalty from the girls whilst useful for fanservice does hurt immersion and believability. I also questioned the romantic relationship that seemed forced/tacked on.Animation/music 8 – Strong point of the series. You get very nice character models that makes this an easy series to watch. The big standouts are the great range of beauties that ensures if you are after fanservice then there is plenty to be had here. World’s Finest Assassin also produces some very strong opening and closing sequences.Overall 6.5 – If you like action or fanservice then this is a show I would recommend to you. If that is not you then best to stay away. That is the simple bottom line. Much of this series follows the standard tropes of isekai series with its overpowered MC, an increasing cast of cute girls that fawn over him and everyone else also loving him. The biggest changes to that formula are the MC’s personality who sparks some life in the usual formula but is that enough to get non-isekai fans onboard? Personally, I don’t think so.', 'tl;dr: An isekai that has a lot of interesting aspects but feels like it’s only beginning to scratch the surface on using them well.This is yet another isekai light novel adaptation, and though it’s typical in many aspects it has enough unique aspects to make it stand out. The central premise is that Earth’s greatest assassin is reincarnated into a fantasy world with the goddess given task of defeating the world’s Hero after the Hero goes berserk. The protagonist is reincarnated as a baby named Lugh in the Tuatha Dé family of nobles, which works very well for him considering they are a family of...assassins. However, the goddess very clearly conveyed how difficult of a task it is for a human to defeat the Hero, and thus from the moment he’s born he begins planning and working towards his ultimate goal of killing the Hero.The cast in this anime overall don’t have much depth to them. Lugh doesn’t really have much of a character arc. Over the course of the anime he progresses in terms of getting stronger, both in terms of abilities, but also in terms of connections. However, his personality remains largely the same. The anime begins with him regretting his life of living solely as a tool of death in previous life with a strong desire to live differently in his new life. However, this isn’t emphasized much. In the original world he simply got targets and killed them without asking any questions. As a Tuatha Dé assassin, he’s first supposed to evaluate whether they should be murdered before killing them, which is obviously a major change. But this is never actually fleshed out, he’s never actually shown having to struggle with such a decision or feel guilty about the aftermath. The closest it gets to any moral ambiguity is showing a good person in love with an evil person, devastated due to the the assassination of said evil person.Furthermore, Lugh claimed he wanted to live as more than an assassination tool, but the writing seems to try to portray him as someone that’s still entirely focused on his job. He does a lot of things outside the bounds of what one would traditionally consider as the work of an assassin. However, it all ties back into things he needs for assassin work in the end. But more bizarrely, he helps out people completely unrelated to his work, but almost always finds some sort of explanation for how it actually has to do with his work. This is most prominent with two of the heroines, Tarte and Maha, who he saves the lives of then brings under his wing. His explanation for why he did so is that they have powerful mana and thus they’re useful to him, which would make sense, but at the same time based on his interactions it doesn’t seem quite right. However, it doesn’t feel completely wrong either. His character feels somewhat nebulous and mysterious, but not always in a good way. For the most part, the narrative seems more focused on making him cool than actually developing him properly as a protagonist, which can certainly work well sometimes, but also makes it somewhat hard to get invested in him long term.The heroines are interesting in that they were developed properly, but in a way that feels strangely sterile for lack of a better way to explain. Two of them, Tarte and Maha, are very formulaic. They have dark backgrounds that make them easy to sympathize with, very straightforward relationship development arcs with Lugh that make it clear when and how they fell in love with him, and incredibly simple but likable personalities. The relationship between them and Lugh is weird, in that by all accounts it makes sense and is perfectly solid and fun to watch. But at the same time, it feels too smooth and thus like there’s something kind of off about it. It doesn’t help that the way things are set up the three of them are way too rigid with each other and thus it doesn’t feel like they have very good chemistry. The third heroine, who seems to be the main heroine, Dia fares a bit better. Her story and personality are a bit more rough and thus she feels more like a real character, though not by much so she doesn’t seem to have all that much complexity either. With that said, as a group they certainly do seem to be making progress, though very slowly. The anime actually begins with an in media res that showed them working really well together. However, the anime ends before it gets back to this point. I suppose they will eventually make much more progress, which makes me excited about where the story will go, though to be clear it hasn’t quite gotten there.The world building also seems somewhat lacking. There’s a lot of interesting concepts thrown around such as the Hero and Divine Treasures, but it seems to gloss right over them, and thus it isn’t really quite clear how they fit into the world. I don’t know if this is a result of adaptation or whether it’s there in the original, but it definitely felt like an issue. Similarly, there’s a system of skills as well as a system to how spells and mana operate, but we’re given very little information on them outside of the minimum required in the moment to explain what’s going on. As such, things can feel pretty random a lot of the time. This results in a lot of the action feeling pretty weak. The big exception to that is the final fight, which was built up much better in terms of the mechanics used as well as just in general flowing much better than any of the action in the rest of the series. That fight alone is enough to bring up the action in the anime from just okay to pretty good, which makes me hopeful for where things go in the future.The plot overall is very character focused for the most part, just showing how the main group comes together and is growing stronger in order to defeat the hero. It has it’s highs and lows but overall felt somewhat slow. However, things start to finally get moving in the last arc, and the anime ends on what is not quite a cliffhanger, but it does set things up for next arc in such a way that it feels like things are getting a lot more interesting, so I suppose it’s somewhat similar in effect. It seems to be getting better in terms of the plot, characters, and world building. Thus, overall while the anime clearly does have some issues, it feels like there’s a lot of potential and it feels like its moving towards properly leveraging it, so my final impression of the anime is more positive than I thought it would be, and I’m really looking forward to where things will go in the future.The art and animation are pretty solid with decent enough character designs. There’s some bad CG usage at times for things like horses and carriages, but it’s generally not that prominent so it’s not an issue. The exception to that would be the big battles between armies which are entirely bad CG, and thus as one would expect look pretty bad. The OP has really cool visuals that work incredibly well with the song. The song itself I originally wasn’t fond of but it really grew on me and now I really enjoy it, even outside of the OP. The ED has an okay song and okay visuals, though it’s kind of weird that it focused entirely on only one of the heroines. The rest of the soundtrack was pretty solid with a couple good insert songs. assassins.

This was my first reaction after someone recommended this anime to me, since it is an overly produced genre (imo) at this point. Isekai\'s can really be enjoyed to the next level when they are executed well, or have some kind of specific thing or theme going for them. This is what was promised by the one who recommended me this series. And in a way, it does have a few things going for it opposed to other isekai, and I enjoyed it, but this series still somewhat disappointed. The animation is not something to write home about, nor...is the voice acting or the story and its progression(although the premise is interesting). The characters make the show, especially the protagonist who has some development. Overall, this anime is enjoyable and a bit above average isekai\'s, but by no big margin whatsoever.One thing I found the isekai had going for them was the logic of the characters decisions and motives. They are by no means special or original, but it is executed  better than other isekai\'s. Starting with the main character, as is tradition, he is very strong, and of course stronger than most in the beginning of the anime. This however follows from the conditions he is reincarnating in the new world together with his own strong will: the goddess reincarnates him with above average specs, he has his experience as the best assasin in his previous life as well as general life experience, and he knows he has got to train and prepare himself to face someone who will be ultimately the most powerful being in the new world he is reincarnating in. He is not some kind of generic young boy who get\'s overly overpowered out of nothing, but has relevant skills from his previous life as well as his own choice of skills he before he reincarnated. He also has clear reasons for his actions, and is not a super-good-hearted force for justice just out of nowhere.Staying on this trope, you can\'t say ""no bitches"" to the protaganist of an isekai. Normally it is one minor happening or just love at first sight with a few lines uttered from the protagnists mouth. Here, the protaganist\'bitches do be like that, but you can make an argument it is different. The events the protaganist takes part in have major impact on his girls, future changing events he plays a big role in. This must have some consequence, be it gratitude or admiration, or some form of love.Another positive for the main character is that his beliefs from a previous life are challenged, and he has to deal with that. Deciding whether 90% of how you lived your previous life was fundamentally wrong is swept over swiftly, but at least it is present. You are not getting some empty shell generic schoolboy who says ""violence bad, unless I am the one blasting you out of this universe"".Within a fantasy setting, not all the scenes and events are random bullshit go, but within the realm of possibility, which was a needed refreshment. The story is not great, not terrible. The protagonist is an interesting main character to follow, how he behaves in a new world with a new mission combined with his years of experience as an assassin.

It does have some qualities that every isekai has like a strong main character and lots of girls but don’t judge the book by it’s cover.We get to see this assassin go from being a tool to actually thinking for himself and developing feeling for others. He doesn’t just blindly kill on demand anymore, he determines it himself if the target is really guilty or not.One thing to note is that if you expect this show to just be killing then this...is not the show for you. You’ll get to see him assassinate some characters here and there but it’s not the shows main focus. The show is more about Lugh becoming human.

I know they will hopefully elaborate on more of this in the next season but it sucks having not a single thing to really look forward to.The art was kinda bad in alot of spots, especially with the faces.The characters started out complex but ended up just being generic harem girls, with...a bit of umph.The best parts I enjoyed were getting to see the assassin trainings. It added this more cynical view point and darker tone as our main characters were subjected to some pretty extreme scenarios.  I would have liked to see more of these slightly darker takes with more assassinations and potential undercover work. However, it would need to be a bit more 007-esque and less 2-year-boring-business-work.I was a bit disappointed with the magic as well, I was hoping his skill of making new magic would amount to more than just creating modern weapons. The last few episodes didn\'t feel like they were part of the same show, the vide was completely different as they went from plotting and planning and preparing to.... saving the princess and living happily ever after. The ""plot twist"" was expected and also fell flat, imo.Overall, like most Isekai, great concept, bad execution. Still enjoyed some parts 7/10. a bit of umph.The best parts I enjoyed were getting to see the assassin trainings.

Hell, I think it might be THE BEST. I haven't enjoyed watching an anime like this in so long I forgot how great isekai's can be.To sum up the plot quickly- the most badass assassin gets reincarnated and his set by the goddess is to kill the hero because the hero becomes corrupt/evil. To start off- the plot is interesting alone. It's different from most isekai protagonist having to kill the Demon Lord. So that's a plus for me. What really makes the anime great is the MC.Lugh is one of the best MC of all time. He's very...straight forward. He's hard working. He's kind. He's also not a dumbass like Subaru from Re:zero. And he's a complete badass. Even before he was reincarnated, I liked his character already. It's honestly refreshing to see characters who actually use their brain in combat. He brings it all to his new life and some. Lugh really grows as a character. What I like is that  Lugh is OP, but he also knows he's not invicible, and he doesn't use some lofty sense of idea like righteous to act like an idiot. Lugh is always very careful and calculating. After all- he IS an assasin.Support characters are also amazing. Lugh's father- Cian, stands out. Very strict, but loving. And he sure as hell trains his son to the max. Lugh's mother is basically MILF eye candy, which to someone like me is always an A+. Lugh's has 3 main girls. First is Dia Viekone. She is the the one who taught Lugh how to use magic, which Lugh obviously surpasses her easily. Dia is also Lugh's love interest, although I find her to be kinda boring. She doesn't have a interesting back ground and nothing about her sticks out. But she's not entirely bad/useless- outside of being a damsel in distress the last arc. Tarte is the second main girl. I really like her and I like her back story, even though it was relatively short. Saved by Lugh, she basically becomes his personal maid/assistant and dedicates her life to him. The most interesting of the 3 to me is Maha. Lugh saves her from a life of being kidnapped and sold off as a whore to disgusting rich folks. Oh yeah, did I mention most of the nobles in this isekai are disgusting pieces of crap? Anyways after she is saved- she repays Lugh by taking over his business, expanding on it- and now is one of the greatest merchant in the world. She is the only one from Lugh's main that can stand on her own two feet. But enough about that. They're all good in their own way, but Maha is the one I am most interested in if this anime gets a continuation.How is the story though? IT'S GREAT. The fact they can fit SO MANY stories and arc in 12 episode and still make it this good is A+. Nothing feels rush. You get to see characters develop. Lugh becomes conflicted at times beacuse he is trying to be more humane after his last life.How about the action? Most of the time it's short, but honestly it's still AMAZING. Again, Lugh is an ASSASSIN, so of course the battles are going to be short kills. But one thing I really like is that this anime takes the time to explain how magic works in this world. It's not entirely believable and sometimes it feels like you can too easily make it broken, so there's that.Speaking of- I think that is this show's main negative. Alright so spoiler alert- Lugh can basically create any metal substance he wants.....INCLUDING GOLD. He also shows Dia how to do this. I mean,  the world is run by gold and he can create gold so Lugh and Dia are basically the richest people in the world. Yet they never mention this skill again. Maybe the two know about inflation and are avoiding that aspect. Dunno. Another negative is that we don't really get introduced to any powerful adversaries. Towards the end of the season he fights Macness, which is great. But we only see the Hero at the end. Shucks. But excited.In summary, an amazing anime. Really hoping for a season 2! straight forward.

The simple ecstasy I get from watching a trained killer basically making himself an unstoppable killing machine, experience real emotions for the first time, and still be as cold, calculating, and efficient as he was in his past life is just pure bliss.It's well animated, it's enjoyable, and if...any of the things I stated above don't draw you in then pass it.

However, after his death he becomes reincarnated into an aristocrat family under the name Lugh Tuatha De. The family is known for their skill in human anatomy and operations; However, they are also known for their skilled assassin techniques. Lugh is able to carry out his profession in this new world however, he decides to be more empathetic in his jobs...when needed which leads him to accumulate a group of followers to help in his journey to eliminate the hero.Story & Characters :7/10An assassin in another world is a pretty new concept in Anime and it appears the Anime industry is experimenting with different isekai plots. The story of this series is really entertaining at almost every corner with meaningful encounters, satisfying closure to events and especially a calculative prodigal main character. However, the story suffers from inspiration; Most of the season is dedicated to character establishment and not really an interesting sense of conflict until its final episode. The story could definitely involved a main antagonist in the beginning to add more inspiration for Lugh and his team. As it stands though, that is the only aspect I felt was missing; In terms of Lugh's team it does feel a bit extra having a female harem in his assassin and commerce businesses and a weirdly clingy Mother but it was bearable.Art & Sound: 7/10The art style is aimed to be more softer on the eye with pastel colors and messy linework. I am a fan of the particular art style since it is more eye candy even with still-shots; The fight scenes are nicely choreographed and entertaining as well. Beyond that, I think there is a lot more to go in terms of quality and consistency but given the quality I've seen it is a pretty irrational assumption to have.Sound in the series was good, nothing bad but also great. Lugh's voice actor suits his monotonic and poker-face demeanor which stuck with me while watching. The father character voice also stuck; The female characters wasn't noticeably different.Enjoyment & Overall: 7/10I have high hopes for the series; There isn't that much sense of conflict but the ending episode definitely leads into a possible future story goal. Would like to see more modern applications in the next season - Really enjoyed the playful modern re-creations in this season. Also, I choose not to acknowledge the mental age gap and incext going on in the series; I could personally do without them. when needed which leads him to accumulate a group of followers to help in his journey to eliminate the hero.Story & Characters :7/10An assassin in another world is a pretty new concept in Anime and it appears the Anime industry is experimenting with different isekai plots.

The main character engaging to me since he was methodical, experienced and knowledgeable in his previous life and he stayed consistent with that in his reincarnation. The supporting characters like the mom, dad, goddess were also interesting.I generally dislike harems...but the 3 females here were at least not overly abundant like other anime and the trio were well-drawn. There was a romance angle, which is a must for me, but it was (correctly) tempered by the “mature” personality of the MC.***SPOILERS AHEAD***I understand why the MC chose the 1 of the 3 but my heart ached for #2 girl. And in a later particular scene, the (unintentional) callousness of the MC to #2 girl was hard to bear for me. Also, unlike harem ladies #2 & #3, the #1 was a bit loli-ish, IMO.My last complaint is about the “sister solution” in the last episode for hiding the identity of #1 female MC. They already did that for #3 and if the male MC loves #1 … romantically … how will that be able to progress in the future (between bro & sis) ?? but the 3 females here were at least not overly abundant like other anime and the trio were well-drawn.

Like a real assassin has stabbed you in the back and twisted the blade until your insides are nothing but jelly.The production, music, visuals, and animation are all utterly stellar. The opening especially is just magnificent as-well, but all of these solid elements only serve to heighten expectations to an insane degree, along...with the first episode.When I watched the first episode, I couldn't believe this was made by the same bastard who conceived Redo of Healer. That slop truly is from the darkest hell-pit of his insane, logically deprived mind. One of the biggest stinkiest turds on the anime market.Until the final couple minutes, the first episode sets expectations far higher than the stupid long winded title ever could imply. It serves so well in introducing our MC, Jon Assassin, who is able to show character and even point towards future character development throughout the episode in an efficient manner. This culminates to where he finally gets Isekai’ed, in the most grandiose fashion a man of his talents could ever ask for. Everything up to this point is good and well presented,  I simply couldn’t believe it.“They did it.” I thought, “They made slop that is kind of watchable! Yeah, there was some weird crap at the very beginning, but, I can watch this, and maybe not be afraid that a family member sees me watching it!”But then, along with the most irritating ear-splitting voice you could ever hear, we’re reminded that this is an Isekai, and the slop gets back to business as usual. Time to roll around in the mud and squeal like a piggy.From the final few minutes of episode one, and the opening stretch of episode two, what looked to be something unique quickly becomes another isekai, borderline ecchi harem show.The Goddess character, I want to see her dead. Simple as. Her shrill, obnoxious, annoying voice is still ringing in my head. She claims to have summoned Jon Assassin to her from death -  in order to assassinate “”“The Hero”””, preferably after they defeat “””The Demon Lord”””. This is all because of an inexplicable and unexplained reason that “The Hero” will apparently become an evil idiot, and unleash chaos upon the world afterwards.Why, God? Why must it always be this way?I will say this, the world building it at-least is for the most part competent further on in the fantasy world. Maybe I’ve just been deprived of decent world-building for a while, though. But, unnamed characters with generic isekai crap names like a nondescript Demon Lord and Hero should be a red flag for any work of fiction. It exposes a lack of care or just laziness for a world in its entirety. Don’t name the Hero, sure, maybe save it for later, but come on, what good ‘big bad’ doesn't have a name of any sort? There is a ludicrous amount of demon names from all forms of culture and language. Just pick one, for god's sake, and at-least give “The Hero” a name as-well. Wanna know why you should? Because by introducing these two elements as some kind of prophecy, it is then intrinsically part of world-building. Not naming these two elements or elaborating on them in ANY WAY further is then a disservice to the world in its entirety, and loses engagement. I know this is a crime committed by many slop Isekai crap, and just anime in-general. But it did it to itself by setting the bar to a decent standard and then instantly dropping miles below it.But anyways, why are we doing this, like this? Jon Assassin was showing signs of a real character, and now we have to cut his nuts off for almost ten minutes so he can ask out-of-character, word soup sounding questions about all the world's skills and magic and whatever the hell else. I appreciate the explanation job for many things, I really do, because it's all extremely contrived. But Jon Assassin’s now core motivation is the most unexplained of all the world's elements, and for otherwise there might be juuust a bit too much explanation regarding anything else.The drastic turn from the first episode had me and my fellow Slopoholic shook badly. We were COPING like, “nah bro, maybe it’ll get better again?”. For the most part, I can at-least say it doesn't get much worse at least but really, it's just another Isekai. One who’s events and characters you’ve seen time and time again.All but one woman character is massively annoying, with shrill voices and giant comedy breasts (and of course the child characters have some of the largest breasts of all.) As far as I’ve seen, there's a lot of build-up, and a lot of explaining, but you can still form a story alongside these things. The story is mostly Jon Assassin learning and ‘adapting’ to the different elements of the world alongside his new parents, but otherwise there's not really a plot going on. Not that a reincarnated child would be expected or able to take on the overpowered “The Hero”, as despite how powerful Jon Assassin is, as its said “The Hero” is basically multiple times stronger than anyone else in the world.There are still some little nuggets of interesting concepts and ideas in the world and Jon Assassin’s re-upbringing. But comparing that to the interest generated by the first episode alone is like Coughing Baby vs Hydrogen Bomb.I’m not gonna sugar coat it. At first I thought this was missed potential, but now my third eye has opened, and I see that isekai as a whole has no potential for anything other than coomer bait harem slop.A stupidly long winded title, with an interesting opening episode that does nothing unique or interesting with the core premise. It merely falls back on the usual tropes of isekai, because the creator of this slop is a coward, but his success is not truly his fault. It's the fault of the coomers and teens of Japan and the world who slurp up this slop without a second thought. This is what you’re forced to watch in purgatory, we are all in Isekai hell forever and there is no escape. A massive budget and impressive production value cannot save isekai from reverting to its true self, no matter what promise it's shown to have.Just make what sells. Creativity and money simply cannot co-exist. This is ultimately just another Isekai, and if that intrigues you, then the world has fallen - and Billions must watch Full Metal Alchemist. with the first episode.When I watched the first episode, I couldn't believe this was made by the same bastard who conceived Redo of Healer.

That writer that came up to the spotlight thanks to the controversial-yet-edgy ""Redo Of Healer"". I did a little skimming in Novel Updates about the author and has a lot of good stuff (Even three or four LNs that share universe). Must confess I read Redo Of Healer web novel (almost 6 volumes). But that\'s not the case! I praise Tsukiyo for being prolific and having that piece called ""The Best Assassin Incarnated as an Aristocrat"". Does it make justice to the novel? Gotta bet your ass it does.In a whole plethora of Isekai that floods the marvelous world of japanese fiction,...this one stands out not only to keep the cliché of dying just to get summoned by a Goddess (And said Goddess repeated the same process with others.

This however is not the case in the anime, the protaganist breezes past every challange without breaking a sweat while somehow charming every attractive female to uphold the harem trope.The biggest sin of the anime are the many unnecessary and overly detailed sexually suggestive scenes. The portrayals romanticises rape, sexual assault and victimizing powerimbalances with the camera lingering as a stand in för the male gaze.

The story was written well and had an intriguing main character. Because of that, I was willing to keep watching till the end. 4 episodes in. Here are my thoughts.Story: 7/10Like how I stated before, it has a compelling story because it's actually a coming-of-age medieval anime where a modern mind meets fantasy and magic. I was personally surprised at how the world expanded and subsequently became more interesting...as time went on. This is thanks to the main character, Lugh, who was once the greatest assassin, who has a brilliant mind, allowing him to grow further.This anime reminds me of Mushoku Tensei, another similar anime that follows how the main character grows. They both grow faster, are treated as prodigies, and have an ulterior motive behind their actions to gain an advantage. And the good thing is, the formula here works well over this one. The reason it gets a 7 is that there are questionable scenes that can strike controversy or basically, it made me uncomfortable like the ones that happened in Mushoku Tensei too.Art: 7/10To be exact, the art isn't bad. But sometimes it doesn't look all that amazing and may appear as a generic isekai anime, but it can subvert that expectation and actually try to animate the action scenes. When SILVER LINK comes to mind, I wouldn't be expecting grandiose animation or breathtaking choreography, because their past works don't usually involve those things, but when Studio Palette came into the picture, I would say one good thing, the animation looks good and I hope to see more of that in the next episodes.Character: 6/10The other characters felt like a 2d character of their personality. They don't exactly resonate with others because their dialogues, actions, and backstories were predictable, only to exist helping the main character in the end. At least, the main character was intriguing to watch, due to consistent writing on his character being an assassin, taking measures, calculating the perfect move, and stoic expressions are just what I like about an assassin.Enjoyment: 8/10I'm a literal sucker for isekais, and for an author that can write an interesting fantasy world who was also known for writing a dumpster fire? What a sudden change in atmosphere. I do hope that the story gets more interesting as time goes on. as time went on.

I was expecting an anime where the protagonist engages in various battles, but seriously, he doesn't fight even once. He is introduced as an assassin, but doesn't assassinate anyone. There's no character development, just a basic introduction followed by a time skip. The anime tries to sell a skilled protagonist who will do amazing things with his strategy, but the assassinations aren't even properly depicted. In the end, the anime attempts to address many elements and ends up accomplishing nothing effectively. There is no development for any character, including the romantic partners of the protagonist. There are no battles...beyond the training with his father, and the lack of romance is noticeable, as relevant scenes are simply skipped. Seriously, it's the worst anime I've watched in the last 2 years. beyond the training with his father, and the lack of romance is noticeable, as relevant scenes are simply skipped.

Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 3 - Hi no Ishi wo Tsugu Mono,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6325/Naruto__Shippuuden_Movie_3_-_Hi_no_Ishi_wo_Tsugu_Mono,"['First of all, don’t watch this movie unless you’re interested in Naruto because it’s a movie that mainly appeals to Naruto fans. I’ll assume you’ve watched to at least episode 120, Kakashi Chronicles, of Naruto Shippuden because there are references to Kakashi’s old friend. There are also references to Asuma. Just like the previous movies, Naruto goes crazy with his rasengan and shadow clone techniques in this movie too. But this is the best Naruto movie that’s been released so far.The main enemy of this movie is Hiruko, some ex-leaf ninja that wants to become the perfect ninja by absorbing ninja with bloodline limits....He starts out having four out of five bloodline limits, but he needs one more ninja with a bloodline limit to become the perfect ninja, and that’s Kakashi. Kakashi decides to sacrifice himself for the Leaf in order to defeat Hiruko. But guess who doesn’t want Kakashi to die? Naruto, of course. “Those that break the rules and regulations are scum. But those that abandon their comrades are worse than scum.” That’s pretty much Naruto’s reason for trying to stop Kakashi. Friends over mission.If you’re a fan of Kakashi or Shikamaru, you might like some of the lines they say in this movie. Of course, Naruto has some good ones, as well as cheesy lines too. Many of the other characters have their lines too, but nothing that great.There are some light comedy, some good references to Naruto Shippuden, characters going all out with their ninja techniques, and of course the animation is good. You’d be able to tell how much effort was put into the animation if you compared it to Naruto Shippuden. All of that in one package makes a good Naruto movie.The music was great. The music of the movie soundtrack fit well with the background to fit the mood of the scene. ""Dareka Ga"" by Puffy, the opening song, was pretty good to listen to.The strong point of this movie is the references they make in this movie. The involvement of many characters is also a plus in this movie. This movie is a good watch for Naruto fans.

This movie is a good watch for Naruto fans.', 'I had relatively low expectations for this movie, seeing how all the previous ones were pretty bad. They all followed the same formula, which is to say Naruto preaches his views onto some filler character causing them to change their ideals and it would always end with Naruto rasengan-ing the big baddie. It was alright the first time, but it got stale after the 2nd movie and became absolutely abysmal for the next 3. Needless to say that asides from maybe a couple cool moments, all the Naruto movies have been bad, definitely not worth a watch. But than this movie came along and sorta...changed things up making it slightly more fresh and enjoyable.The story is pretty much standard fare, a disgruntled ninja named Hiruko is hunting down ninjas with Bloodline Limits and absorbing their abilities to become the perfect ninja and start the 4th Ninja War. He soon has his eyes set on Kakashi, and the next thing you know the movie becomes a Kakashi rescue arc. Now this isn\'t really a bad thing since there are no filler characters and Kakashi is a pretty likable guy (unlike Sasuke) so its easy to empathize with Naruto\'s gung-ho attitude about the whole thing. There are no real twists to speak of, so don\'t go in expecting a really good plot because you won\'t find one. This movie caters to the fans, so people who aren\'t really into Naruto won\'t like it either.However that\'s not to say that they\'re isn\'t any meaningful dialogue or characterization. Sure Naruto is the same and preaches his ideals to anyone who bothers to listen but its still pretty entertaining. There\'s quite of bit of cheesy lines but some of the dialogue between Naruto, Shikamaru and Kakashi is well written and delivered. Naruto actually thinks his actions out and his speech towards the end is inspiring enough for us to get behind him, ignoring all the fat in between.Anyway the biggest reason why anyone of us would watch this is for the fights, animation and production values, since hey, this is shounen after all. The animation is MUCH better this time around compared to the last two movies. The fights are good and the Konoha 9 get plenty of screen time. If you\'re someone who likes the side characters, you\'ll probably enjoy the movie quite a bit. Though the final fight is kinda disappointing, the animation is good enough to keep it together.The music was surprisingly good. I didn\'t expect much at all from Pierrot, but they did a good job in creating a solid soundtrack for the movie. There are plenty of epic orchestrated pieces that that add quite a bit to the mood, especially during the fights. There\'s also a lot of good typical ""Naruto rock"", which is to say up beat songs, which are hot-blooded enough to get the job done.In the end, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. If you\'re a Naruto fan than its worth checking out, its definitely the best out of all 6. If you don\'t like Naruto than this movie isn\'t going to change your mind. Not that they could ever make a legitimately excellent Naruto movie, but its good mindless fun. changed things up making it slightly more fresh and enjoyable.The story is pretty much standard fare, a disgruntled ninja named Hiruko is hunting down ninjas with Bloodline Limits and absorbing their abilities to become the perfect ninja and start the 4th Ninja War.

He had perfected the ""Chimera Technique"", which absorbs opponent chakra and skills, and starts kidnapping ninjas with Blood Line Limits. The final target of Blood Line users is Kakashi, who possesses the Sharingan from Obito. To prevent the impending 4th Ninja War, Tsunade sends Kakashi on a suicidal mission to stop Hiruko.ANIMATION: 7/10The animation is impressive. I would describe it as...`extreme fluidity`. In fact, this film probably has the smoothest character movement I have ever seen. Battle scenes and leafs/wind effects were stunning. Unfortunately, the drawings of characters are very simple, and backgrounds lack detail. Some scenes were so bad that it seemed like the poor drawings from the original series filler episodes.Still the director Murata Masahiko did a great job in this film, with some breathtaking scenes with CG-assisted camera movement, and wonderfully choreographed action sequences.SOUND: 5/10The voices are same as the original series, and generally fine. Kakashi`s voice was exceptionally well done.There was very little music, and not very effective. I still have no idea why they replaced MUSASHI for musical scores since the flute and drum instrumentals in the original Naruto series was epic in my opinion.Theme song is also very weak despite being sang by Puffy. I miss the days when top artists like Hamasaki Ayumi and Every Little Thing sang those touching and memorable songs for anime films. Even the theme song for the first Naruto movie by YUKI was better than anything I`ve heard from anime movies in the past 3 years.STORY: 6/10The theme for this movie is pretty good: the clash of moral values. Is sacrificing one person for the welfare of the village a right thing to do? This is what the entire story is centered around. Pretty much the whole movie is about Naruto and Sakura chasing after Kakashi to stop him from sacrificing himself to save the village.There were couple of major plot holes.==============SPOILER==============- Why did Sand Village advance its troop to the border? Sand Village has a strategic alliance with Konoha, and Gaara of all people should know that Hiruko had nothing to do with Konoha, and that Tsunade would never try to invade other countries. The whole thing was just an excuse to bring out the popular Gaara to the movie, since he had a very limited appearance in ""Shippuuden"" series so far.- Why did Hiruko have a child-form? Tsunade even mentioned he should be much older by now, but it was never explained to the end. We are left guessing that maybe it had something to do with the Chimera technique, but there is no apparent advantages in having a child-form.- Isn`t `give your life for the village` an honorable thing to do and what all the great Konoha ninjas did? The Third Hokage gave up his life to stop Orochimaru`s invasion. The Fourth sacrificed his life to seal the Kyuubi. Itachi gave up his life and lived as a traitor for a secret ANBU mission. Jiraiya also died on a clearly suicidal mission. In fact, Naruto himself was sacrificed as a vessel for the Kyuubi as a baby. I`m sure there are more that I can`t think of at the moment, but it seems to me like sacrificing one`s life for the village is what Konoha is all about. It also creates heroic and legendary figures that children can look up to. Naruto`s argument was severely flawed.- Wasn`t Fuuton: Rasen Shuriken devastating to Naruto`s arm? I can understand him using the forbidden technique in that situation, but he seemed to be completely fine after using it.- I understand Kakashi\'s desire to leave a keepsake for his apprentice, but with everything those bells stood for, it was like saying \'please break the rules and come after me\'. Just a dumb thing to do if he really wanted the mission to succeed.=============================The story also repeated the same old theatrical Naruto battle formula: Three villain ninjas ending up in head-to-head battles to buy time for the last boss. Only this time they were 1v3s instead of head-to-head, and some Kuchiyose (summoning) were used.Still, the story is well-structured with an introduction, story development, climax, and a comical ending. Following through the central theme. Flashbacks from the anime series were used very effectively, with the animation completely redone from story board. \'Will of Fire\' and \'Obito\' cards were played especially well.CHARACTERS: 2/10There are very little character developments in movies for series. In fact, I don`t really expect too much from them. ""Will of Fire"" still managed to completely bomb this section.They made a fatal mistake for movies: Making every single character in the series appear. Pretty much all the ninjas in Naruto`s generation showed up, only to make their signature move and used as action fillers. They ate away precious screen time that could`ve been used to develop the main characters or the story. As a result, the main characters remained paper-thin, with Naruto acting like a stubborn child and Sakura a tsundere who kept beating up Naruto and Sai.I did like Gaara`s involvement though, since his action sequence was very cool, and his role supported Naruto`s determination.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL 7.5/10Theatrical releases of continuous series (as opposed to episodic series like ""Doraemon"" or ""Crayon Shin-chan"") are always going to be a side-story, and should be expected as such. There will never be a good animated movie for series.Despite all the criticisms, ""Naruto/Shippuuden"" is my favorite 100+ episode anime series after ""Yuu Yuu Hakusho"". The 3rd Shippuuden movie ""Will of Fire"" was a great side story for me, even though the story and characters would be terrible for a stand-alone film.I didin\'t really agree with Naruto\'s decision that could\'ve destroyed the entire village over one person, but I guess as a movie, they had to push the friendship over responsibility.Sometimes I feel these movies are targeted toward younger audiences than series or manga itself due to their corniness and deliberate attempts for inspiration, but compared to all previous Naruto movies, ""Will of Fire"" was by far the most well-directed, and personally the best Naruto film since the very first Naruto movie ""Snow Princess"". `extreme fluidity`.

At this point the whole show turned to a slow ass war drama with overblown tragedy that had no consistency in power levels. The movie tries to build on that by keep mentioning all the people who have died so far in the show. In theory that is good for reminding us of all the cool stuff that have happened so far and the various sacrifices that were made for the sake of maintaining peace. Unfortunately the story in this movie is doing a...crappy job about it. In fact, it has by far the most uninspired scenario in all the current movies, since despite the world shaking events it’s supposed to include, it happens in a most simple and dried up way.So there is this Orochimaru/Pain hybrid villain who hypnotizes powerful people and intends to turn to a god by stealing their powers. Kakashi is the last on his list and Konoha feels that they should sacrifice him in order to use some weird technique which when used will kill both him and the villain. Naruto disagrees and against all attempts to stop him, he just storms in to save Kakashi. As simple as this sounds, there are many things that make the movie to feel like it’s the end of the world when it otherwise feels like just a minor skirmish.A unique feature of this movie is how there is no movie-only emo kid that Naruto feels obligated to help. It is just Kakashi and the rest of the usual gang having some issues regarding honor and respect; so in a way the whole film was mostly a civil war. Other than that though, there is absolutely no twist or anything else to look forward to. Half of the film is an uneventful build up where Kakashi reminds everyone of all those who died so far before deciding to do the same for Konoha. The other half is mostly wasted on the characters fighting amongst each other because of that. So just expect to see things you have already seen before everything ends with Naruto using a Rasengan... as always.I must say that the whole film felt like it was full of pointless action.- The Suna village is ordered to attack Konoha just because the villain Hiruko was once part of it. Without any proof of them being allies they are ready to fight one another while the villain is calmly fulfilling his devious plan. That felt completely uncalled for and too forced to accept. Why not just teaming up against him? And as you can guess, that is exactly what Naruto does to save the day.- The characters are fighting amongst each other, something which results to nothing other than proving what a thickhead Naruto is.- There were the usual cardboard evil henchmen that needed to be defeated but they might as well not be there at all since the villain was powerful enough not to need any help and the heroes were busy fighting each other instead of the bad guys.- And what exactly is this friendship and teamwork they keep talking about if Naruto does everything alone? It sounds like a contradiction. Ok, they are working together in order to defeat the underlings but those were completely useless to the plot and winning or losing had no effect on the Big Bad’s plans.- Naruto pretty much wins by being a stubborn traitor who uses a hax power which for some unexplained reason can’t be absorbed by the enemy. That felt cheap and anti-climactic.- The villain in his dying breath has a change of heart. Which is pointless again since no time was invested on getting to like the guy. He remains as nothing more that an Orochimaru wannabe. Heck, we never even understand why he looks like a kid half the time.So as you understand, apart from the rather good production values the whole film was boring, uneventful, and full of events that made no sense. It is once again a very bad addition to the franchise. crappy job about it. In fact, it has by far the most uninspired scenario in all the current movies, since despite the world shaking events it’s supposed to include, it happens in a most simple and dried up way.So there is this Orochimaru/Pain hybrid villain who hypnotizes powerful people and intends to turn to a god by stealing their powers. Kakashi is the last on his list and Konoha feels that they should sacrifice him in order to use some weird technique which when used will kill both him and the villain. Naruto disagrees and against all attempts to stop him, he just storms in to save Kakashi. As simple as this sounds, there are many things that make the movie to feel like it’s the end of the world when it otherwise feels like just a minor skirmish.A unique feature of this movie is how there is no movie-only emo kid that Naruto feels obligated to help. It is just Kakashi and the rest of the usual gang having some issues regarding honor and respect; so in a way the whole film was mostly a civil war. Other than that though, there is absolutely no twist or anything else to look forward to. Half of the film is an uneventful build up where Kakashi reminds everyone of all those who died so far before deciding to do the same for Konoha. The other half is mostly wasted on the characters fighting amongst each other because of that. So just expect to see things you have already seen before everything ends with Naruto using a Rasengan... as always.I must say that the whole film felt like it was full of pointless action.- The Suna village is ordered to attack Konoha just because the villain Hiruko was once part of it. Without any proof of them being allies they are ready to fight one another while the villain is calmly fulfilling his devious plan. That felt completely uncalled for and too forced to accept. Why not just teaming up against him? And as you can guess, that is exactly what Naruto does to save the day.- The characters are fighting amongst each other, something which results to nothing other than proving what a thickhead Naruto is.- There were the usual cardboard evil henchmen that needed to be defeated but they might as well not be there at all since the villain was powerful enough not to need any help and the heroes were busy fighting each other instead of the bad guys.- And what exactly is this friendship and teamwork they keep talking about if Naruto does everything alone? It sounds like a contradiction. Ok, they are working together in order to defeat the underlings but those were completely useless to the plot and winning or losing had no effect on the Big Bad’s plans.- Naruto pretty much wins by being a stubborn traitor who uses a hax power which for some unexplained reason can’t be absorbed by the enemy. That felt cheap and anti-climactic.- The villain in his dying breath has a change of heart. Which is pointless again since no time was invested on getting to like the guy. He remains as nothing more that an Orochimaru wannabe. Heck, we never even understand why he looks like a kid half the time.So as you understand, apart from the rather good production values the whole film was boring, uneventful, and full of events that made no sense. It is once again a very bad addition to the franchise.', 'The plot is very lousy, seriously. Here\'s a very breif summary...Tsuade, Jiraya and Orochimaru had a weak childhood friend we didn\'t know about. This person later becomes and evil villan, a threat to all nations.When Kakashi was a teenager, this person put a curse on him, a curse he still carries to this day. Kakashi is destined to die! He undertakes a kamakaze mission.It\'s up to the Hidden Leaf\'s youth to save the day.What\'s lousy you may ask?...It\'s unoriginal:- Like Orochimaru, this character becomes a \'mad scientist\', carrying out inhumane experiments in order to get strong- This villian is \'invincable\' and \'immortal\', just like most villians who end up getting killed- Yet another person after the shiringan- The \'curse mark\' has been done beforeWhat else lets the film down?:- Sakura\'s typical \'violence toward friends, useless in battle\' trait- Chemeria\'s are the theme great, time to get creative? NO, all the chemeras seem to look more robotic then organic- Outright silly stuff occure also, such as Naruto creating a chain bridge of shadow clones, Tsunade knowing how to tamper with the shiringan, Naruto having a mild heal/repair abilityI\'ll leave you on a high not however, what\'s good about the movie...- The fight scenes are great; each team gets some attention- Naruto\'s determination to ""Bring Kakashi back"" is realistic (don\'t we know)- We get to see what Gaara can do without the 1 tailed badgerThese elements make it worth watching and are the reason I gave it a good score.;) It\'s unoriginal:- Like Orochimaru, this character becomes a \'mad scientist\', carrying out inhumane experiments in order to get strong- This villian is \'invincable\' and \'immortal\', just like most villians who end up getting killed- Yet another person after the shiringan- The \'curse mark\' has been done beforeWhat else lets the film down?:- Sakura\'s typical \'violence toward friends, useless in battle\' trait- Chemeria\'s are the theme great, time to get creative?

This one involves the whole of Konoha 11 and allows us to see more of the other characters as well as their combination of jutsu's that I just love and seeing all of them work together.A really good movie that has a good amount of action and focuses on nakama power which I always love. "", ""I haven't been a huge fan of many of the Naruto movies.  I find the missions have felt pretty pointless, even though most of them deliver with regards to flashy fights and don't take forever to finish.  Naruto Shippuuden 3: Inheritors of Will of Fire feels like the first good Naruto movie, which would be their sixth attempt at doing so.Story: Naruto Shippuuden 3: Inheritors of Will of Fire would see Hiruko, an Ex-Hidden Leaf ninja, who was essentially exiled due to the experiments he was performing in order to create the perfect body - which should sound familiar to some older Naruto...fans.  In order to do so, he found that he could attain a desirable body by absorbing the bodies of five ninjas with Bloodline Limits, also known as Kekkei Genkai.  When they were younger, Hiruko put a curse on Kakashi that would forcibly draw him to Haruko's location.  He finally decides to use this to try and obtain Kakashi's Sharingan, which would complete his fifth Kekkei Genkai.  Kakashi gives into this curse, but Naruto can't believe his ears when he gets word of this.  This is due to the belif that Kakashi instilling in him years ago: Those who abandon their teammates are worse than scum.  So Naruto tries to drag Kakashi back to the Hidden Leaf, even though his opinion in doing so sit in the minority.The story itself is pretty straight forward, but I need to be honest, much of the fun in this movie is the fact that you get to see basically Naruto's entire gang engage the enemy at the same time.  There are multiple villains, even though the early ones kind of only act as a body in the way.  The storytelling from Kakashi's viewpoint was well told though, and there were points that involved his old friend Obito Uchiha.  This gave the story more meaning.It wasn't flawless though.  There were story elements surrounding Hiruko that causes the Hidden Leaf and Sand Villages to almost engage in a large scale fight, and I really thought the entire thing was completely overblown.  It's not terribly laid out to us, and it almost feels like it was done just to give certain characters more screen time.  They could have done away with the entire thing and audiences wouldn't have felt like anything was missing.  It just feels overdramatic.  (7/10)Characters: They really do push Naruto's belief's in this movie, supporting that he cares about his friends so much.  Many of the other chuunin from his year also get brought into this ordeal, and Naruto acts as the beacon of hope when some of them don't believe in what he does.  Hiruko is a fine character, but will likely remind audiences of Orochimaru a little too much.  Regardless, I loved the abilities they introduced into this character, and that's one of the key reasons I enjoyed this movie - they're just so much fun to watch.  His followers Ichi, Ni and San don't have any background story to them so it would have been nice if they both they gave them more story, and involvement into what was going on here.  I liked their abilities in general, but considering how much thought gets put into other villains in the series, I would have liked to see more from them, and with slightly longer fights.  (7/10)Art: Naruto Shippuuden has a long history of very lazy animations, especially late in the long series.  That shows up much less here, which is good to see.  Fights in the series are always really fun to watch and match some of the best in history, if you can ignore the fact that some of them drag on forever.  The movie obviously doesn't have this limitation, and the result is one reason I liked this movie so much, especially when Hiruko gets involved.  It's not stunning, top of the line animation, no, but there's something that makes me love these fights that make them special.  (9/10)Sound: The OST has typical Naruto music, though the ED, Dareka Ga by Puffy wasn't one to my liking.  I have had problems with the casting for Naruto for years, but that's obviously not something meant for this review.  Instead, somehow, they got all of Todd Haberkorn (Hiruko), Patrick Seitz (Ichi), Laura Bailey (Ni) and Matthew Mercer (San) voicing the villains.  All four of these are top notch VOs with long histories of outstanding performances.  It's just a shame that the latter three didn't have a ton of voice lines.  (9/10)Overall Enjoyment: Despite some weird things going on with the story in the middle, Naruto Shippuuden 3: Inheritors of Will of Fire is a ton of fun to watch.  I'll be honest, much of my enjoyment comes from the fights in this movie, and that brings it above the previous movies, for me.

Someone who has never seen the series or any other movie might find this ok, hence my score.The story in this movie seemed like it would...be interesting, although it really wasn\'t. It had a lot of cool fights and action, and since the characters are from a popular series, the characters are already liked. Basically, I am saying that I already liked the characters so I may have given this an extra point on it\'s score than it deserves. The story was the swiss cheese of stories. It had so many holes that at one point I just laughed out loud. My LOL was because I finally had excepted that this is just an action flick filled with fan fare.The story is like most Naruto filler stories. A villain comes out of nowhere and is extra powerful. There\'s a world threatening plot, and the village gets attacked. Things happen that shouldn\'t. plot holes open, then there\'s an action filled finale.

One of the Kekkei Genkai members plans to become an immortal perfect ninja by using his chimera technique and the only thing left to complete it is to absorb Kakashi....Now, Naruto and his group must go save Kakashi. One of my main problems with the story is how many of Naruto's allies didn't want to save Kakashi because they taught that it was the only way to save everyone even thought if they let the person absorb Kakashi and become immortal it could mean death of everyone because of how Hiruko has villainous motivations that are shown throughout the whole movie. There were many moments that I felt that were meaningless to put in and took up a lot of time and some are found near the middle of the movie. I thought that the ending to the movie was very absurd with all that it showed.Art and Animation: (7/10)The art in the movie was good with it being able to keep every character's design consistent and good, the backgrounds were good, and all the different powers that were shown looked good. The animation in this movie is the best thing about it and is LEAGUES better than the animation in the anime. The fights were all animated fantastically especially the fight with Gaara and the final fight.Sound: (5/10)The soundtrack is nothing to write home about with the ending song for the movie being fine. The voice actors did a good job with all the characters and the sound effects were average.Characters: (4/10)I thought that many characters that were included in this movie were unnecessary like all the side characters from the ninja teams with only Shikamaru being the only one out of side characters that contributed anything to the plot and having a interesting conflict with him that is shown throughout the whole movie. This movie gave some amount of spotlight to Sai who is supposed to be the replacement of Sasuke in the Shippuuden anime which was cool to see but he is quickly pushed to the side in the later half of the movie kind of like in the anime. Sakura did nothing in the movie again. Kakashi who is our main character in this movie was given a small amount of screen time with some of his scenes consisting of him remembering his past when he was in a team with Obito and Rin. All the villains that were in this were all very one dimensional and underdeveloped especially the main villain.Enjoyment: (5/10)The animation in this movie is really good and all action scenes benefit a lot from this.Overall: (5/10)Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 3 - Hi no Ishi wo Tsugu Mono is a movie that lacks  many things in many departments but the animation in it solely caused me to give this movie a 5 instead of a 4.

This one is no different. I really appreciated how each of Naruto\'s peers had at least 1 attack / time to shine, if only for 3 seconds. I gave it a 6 because that was the average of my other scores (4 story, 10 art, 8 sound, 5 character, 6 enjoyment).Also let me preface that a 5 isn\'t bad, unlike so many mal users seem to think. use your damn heads. 5 is average, middle of the road, not good but not bad. There are an equal number of things worse than it as there are things better.4 for story because it was less than average, but not that bad. It was more a vehicle for carrying characters into cool events and cheesy messages about friendship.10 Art because it\'s the best Nartuo\'s visuals have and will ever be (Referring to all the movies as a whole)5 for sound because it didn\'t stand out.

Also Shino is sassy as f***', 'Like pretty much all other Naruto films, the third one follows the same template. Sadly, it too suffers from a lot of problems. **Minor spoilers**We are introduced to a new character who supposedly were a friend of Jiraiya & co, although never mentioned or seen in the main series. This character and his story is basically a copy-paste of Orochimaru\'s, though we are not told what happened to him after certain events. Suddenly, he appears with his new over-powered abilities which he got using a technique that up to this point has been unheard of. Being a mediocre shinobi back in the day, it is...unclear how this man managed to obtain the sources of these powers and nothing is shown to explain this. Hiruko, as his name is, wants to declare a 4th great war once he gets a hold of some more strength. This is the main plot but again, the film simply will not explain why he wants to do this. One would think this guy has moved on to another village after all those years ...but apparently not. Since this guy is from Konohagakure and probably was banished, Tsunade was aware of his abilities and should therefore be wary of what he is up to. However, for some reason the guys in green decide to not give a shit and claim that he is too strong to be dealt with when he shows up. Even though they could\'ve prevented the problem in the first place. Hiruko is now said to be impossible to beat, but if he\'s so dangerous, how come we\'ve never heard anything about him before? I\'ll tell you why. Because rushed and forced story.The characters are mostly poor in this movie. Apart from Naruto, who does the same thing wherever we see him, there\'s the bad guys, Naruto\'s friends, Tsunade and Kakashi. The main villain and Kakashi had the key roles in this film but for me the spotlight was shining on Shikamaru as his mind was conflicted by duty and the words of Obito. Sakura didn\'t do much to make herself shine except for comic relief (not that that\'s unusual) however the film set up a neat little reference to the ""loss"" of Sasuke once she reacts to Naruto\'s promise about bringing back Kakashi. Both Gaara and Tsunade felt out of character and considering the forced story it\'s pretty safe to say that the writers did not take their character behaviors into account. Tsunade is a wise woman, there is absolutely no reason why she would sacrifice Kakashi to Hiruko when he clearly stated that obtaining Kakashi will make him immortal. Actually, there\'s no way she\'d sacrifice him in the first place \'cause she\'s a softie. Yes, I know. They had a plan, but there\'s a chance of it being unsuccessful and it\'s totally unnecessary when they could just kill the guy and be over with it. Couldn\'t they have locked up Kakashi instead? Would have made more sense. Hiruko, Mr. Reptile Mouth, had an odd but interesting character design which I actually did not mind. The same thing can not be said about his accomplices, especially not the female. Without revealing too much, all of their abilities were stupid and one of them even looked like something straight out of Digimon. It is odd to me why close to every bad guy in these movies have people helping them as they\'re hardly likeable characters. A quick flashback on how Hiruko made these friends would clear things up.Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 3 has animation that is superior to what\'s in the main series. Although not as good as in the 2nd film, the fighting scenes has good looking effects that fly by smoothly and  look very cool. The quality of the artwork itself has only improved by a bit and things such as background images could be given a bit more detail as with all other Naruto films up to this point. The music in this film is not bad, it works well with the scenes if you pay attention to it, but that is what you will have to do to notice it since it does not stand out in any way. I did not pay much attention to be honest but my grade for the sound effects would be a 5. They are average.When it comes down to a conclusion, it has to be said that Inheritors of Will of Fire is a pretty good media-production that fails to deliver in terms of story and depth because it forces out a rushed plot as an excuse for including lots of action. unclear how this man managed to obtain the sources of these powers and nothing is shown to explain this.

Apart from Naruto, who does the same thing wherever we see him, there\'s the bad guys, Naruto\'s friends, Tsunade and Kakashi. The main villain and Kakashi had the key roles in this film but for me the spotlight was shining on Shikamaru as his mind was conflicted by duty and the words of Obito. Sakura didn\'t do much to make herself shine except for comic relief (not that that\'s unusual) however the film set up a neat little reference to the ""loss"" of Sasuke once she reacts to Naruto\'s promise about bringing back Kakashi. Both Gaara and Tsunade felt out of character and considering the forced story it\'s pretty safe to say that the writers did not take their character behaviors into account. Tsunade is a wise woman, there is absolutely no reason why she would sacrifice Kakashi to Hiruko when he clearly stated that obtaining Kakashi will make him immortal. Actually, there\'s no way she\'d sacrifice him in the first place \'cause she\'s a softie. Yes, I know. They had a plan, but there\'s a chance of it being unsuccessful and it\'s totally unnecessary when they could just kill the guy and be over with it. Couldn\'t they have locked up Kakashi instead? Would have made more sense. Hiruko, Mr. Reptile Mouth, had an odd but interesting character design which I actually did not mind. The same thing can not be said about his accomplices, especially not the female. Without revealing too much, all of their abilities were stupid and one of them even looked like something straight out of Digimon. It is odd to me why close to every bad guy in these movies have people helping them as they\'re hardly likeable characters. A quick flashback on how Hiruko made these friends would clear things up.Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 3 has animation that is superior to what\'s in the main series. Although not as good as in the 2nd film, the fighting scenes has good looking effects that fly by smoothly and  look very cool. The quality of the artwork itself has only improved by a bit and things such as background images could be given a bit more detail as with all other Naruto films up to this point. The music in this film is not bad, it works well with the scenes if you pay attention to it, but that is what you will have to do to notice it since it does not stand out in any way. I did not pay much attention to be honest but my grade for the sound effects would be a 5. They are average.When it comes down to a conclusion, it has to be said that Inheritors of Will of Fire is a pretty good media-production that fails to deliver in terms of story and depth because it forces out a rushed plot as an excuse for including lots of action.', ""Note: Before you watch this movie, I suggest you get caught up with the series up to the Kakashi Chronicles and after the Asuma vs. Hidan fight because the movie makes quite a few references towards these incidents.Now, I personally thought that this movie had a pretty good mix of all the components of a Naruto movie: character development, action, and dialogue meant to move the watcher. There are also many cameo shots of nearly every minor and major character in the series... except Sasuke ((sigh)).The plot of the movie is to follow Naruto and the rest of the gang as the chase...after Kakashi who has been possessed by a problem child looking for power through bloodline limits. At first, Tsunade orders for no one to subdue Kakashi, but of course, Naruto goes after him anyways, taking Sakura and Sai along with him. Shikamaru and the rest of the happy-go-lucky Konoha gang go along after them, planning to stop him from rescuing Kakashi.I liked the plot of the story, what having it to do with friendship and all, but maybe that's just me being a sappy girl. Nonetheless, the plot kept me attached to the screen and didn't make me pause and do other stuff, which is usually what Naruto movies make me do.The art is standard, but there's some A+ animation along with fight scenes from your favorite Konoha ninja and even come action cameos from the Kazekage himself. The 3rd Naruto Shippuden movie was by far my favorite and I encourage you all to take a gander at it whenever you can. after Kakashi who has been possessed by a problem child looking for power through bloodline limits.

Some of them are actually quite good... And some of them are pretty terrible.I\'m a little torn about this one. My opinion of the plot swung between it being bad... to it just being unnecessary. I know, Naruto is not exactly known for subtlety, but the main point of this movie-- really showcasing the will of fire and what it means to their village-- was just further expounding on something that the series proper had already handled...very well. This is one of those movies that\'s pretty heavy on the flashbacks. It felt a little like it was meant to be a recap of all the major points that had already taken place in the anime itself. It very much had the feel of some guy standing off to the side of a theater after a big plot reveal going, ""Did you get that?!""On top of that, the conflict between our protagonists felt really forced. I could appreciate that it would be a legitimate conflict in their ninja society-- sometimes it\'s not possible to follow orders and follow your heart at the same time. And I did kind of like the idea of the heroes turning on each other over conflicting ideals, but it felt all too obvious that they would all eventually side with Naruto-- and not just because he\'s the main protagonist and that\'s how the story works, but because it\'s also just who the other characters are. In fact, Shikamaru really walked the line of being out-of-character. I get it. This movie came out right after Asuma\'s death, which was a crucial point in Shikamaru\'s growth as a character, and he was still learning to live with his new motivation to uphold Asuma\'s beliefs at this point... But they really pushed that past making a point. There\'s a time where Shikamaru literally says, ""I\'ll stop Naruto... even if I have to kill him."" Um, Shikamaru? Calm down, buddy. Let\'s not go off the deep end, if you don\'t mind. Our villain is already playing that role. And speaking of...So the plot was kind of dumb and unnecessary, but this movie\'s lowest point was definitely with its villain. Don\'t get me wrong, Todd Haberkorn\'s portrayal of him was excellent, and near the end, Hiruko was genuinely creepy in an insane way, but his story and motivations were bullshit. To put it lightly. Personally, I think the best anime movies are the ones that technically could have taken place within the series itself. And then there are movies like this one... where the writers couldn\'t bother to develop their character well enough to give us a reason to like the villain, so they just tacked him onto another character\'s backstory as a sad attempt to make the viewers care about him. In my experience, this rarely works, and it destroys any hope of allowing us to believe the movie could be canon. So overall, the story was pretty weak in this one.But even so... There was something I really liked about this movie. There was something cheesy and heartfelt about it that was just... fun. I really liked that all of the Konoha Eleven (plus Sai) got some screen-time. They all had a role to play, and it just felt... right. Also, some of the fight scenes were actually quite well-done, while managing to give everyone a place. Lee and Neji combining their jutsu sounded ridiculous in theory, but turned out to be quite clever, and kind of hilarious to see. Like I said, a lot of this movie was just fun.And on one last, totally unrelated note... Is it just me or was Sai especially adorable in this movie? I\'ve always had a soft spot for Sai and how his naïve earnestness gets him into trouble, but it just really shined through in this movie. I was particularly fond of the scene where Naruto basically dragged a protesting Sai out of the hospital to attend a party on their behalf. And I had to laugh when Naruto of all people told Sai he\'d had a dark childhood. It was little instances like that, where the movie was almost mocking itself, that really won me over. very well.

It spent a lot more time with the side cast and actually tried developing some ideas from the show, particularly the bells lession from very early in the show. I liked how much time it spent in the Leaf Village proper and how the main emotional conflicts rise from the characters we know instead of randos from the other movies' escort missions. The scene where Sakura broke Naruto out of jail was great, and there were a bunch of other good individual scenes, too.But the story itself...is just not good. There was no reason to connect the original baddy to so many sets of characters. His design is bad. His gimmick is probably the least interesting of all the movie villains thus far. The tiff with the sand village was contrived. They title dropped the movie like infinitely many times. The second act and especially the third act dragged on so much that you could feel the story's potential drying up the entire time.Signing off with a gay joke was wild as hell in a bad way and I would not recommend it. is just not good.

I had relatively low expectations however I was pleasantly surprised! The story was good; it was different from the other movies (they had the same plot with different characters). I really liked how it involved most (if not all) of the characters from the series. What I enjoyed most is that the movie ties in with the main story of the series unlike the other Naruto movies.The one complaint I have is that this movie follows the formula as the other Naruto movies....Overall I recommend this film to every Naruto and Naruto Shippuden fan, It is the best Naruto yet! Overall I recommend this film to every Naruto and Naruto Shippuden fan, It is the best Naruto yet!"", ""A breath of fresh air in the series of Naruto films.This movie had an original plot and an original threat to the village. Although I knew the characters would ultimately be safe, I was curious to see how they would get out of this dilemma.Great mix of characters where everyone gets some screentime. You get to see essentially all of the leaf shinobi get in on some of the action.The film posed a moral and ethical dilemma that caused the shinobi to question where their loyalties lie. It had hints of a civil war.I didn't understand the immediate tension caused between nations. They see a...big hologram in the sky and immediately point their ballistas at their neighbor? It's clear the leaf does not associate with that man.In this film, Kakashi was like a second Sasuke. Another one of Naruto's friends under evil influence that he feels he must rescue when it feels like everyone else has given up on them.I felt that the leaf village and Tsunade were too quick to give up Kakashi. Why send the man that the enemy desires straight to them? They should've been locking Kakashi up in that cell instead.The villain was like a reenvisioned mashup of previous villains. They had Orochimaru's experimental hunger for power, and multiple abilities like Pain. Although the villain was interesting in concept, their motive fell short with the generic desire to be all powerful with no real plan if they were to get what they want.The villain's defeat was cheap and coincidental. They made him too powerful, so he could only be defeated be breaking the logic they created.The ending bit was too ridiculous, but funny. I know it was meant to be, but it's not like they could have seen through his mask and they were taking it a bit far.

Honestly, all of these movies are kind of all over the place. To be fair though, the Shippuden movies have so far been the best Naruto movies.The character interactions are pretty great, the action is fun to watch, and the animation is overall solid. The dialogue is pretty crap at times though. I was actually really surprised at the amount of character development that they had in this movie though. Shikamaru had some pretty good screen time.The worst thing about all of these movies is how underutilized Gaara is though. They include him in the movie,...but then give him next to nothing to do.This is really a movie you can only enjoy if you're really invested in the show. Otherwise, it's pretty bad.

Nihon Animator Mihonichi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28149/Nihon_Animator_Mihonichi,"[""(This review is based on the assumption you have not watched these already. I will explain the four current shorts briefly without spoilers, so you can get an idea if you want to watch these or not.)Edit: As this review was posted at the time where only four shorts under this franchise were released, I will update and review the other titles after I have watched them and caught up. Thanks, feel free to read the current four posted here.This is a very interesting set of shorts, and it's the first time I've every approached something in this genre. I've never written a review before,...but I figured I'd make one because there aren't any on this site at the moment, so if this can help someone that'd be great. Let's get started.At the moment, there are four shorts: The Dragon Dentist ,Hill Climb Girl ,Me!Me!Me! ,and Carnage. I'm going to give my brief thoughts on all of these separately below.Dragon Dentist is a very interesting short. It has a concept on... well... a dragon, and some people who appear to be training to become the dragon's dentists. The short has an interesting concept dabbling in different realms of some sort, interesting and good, but not my favorite of the shorts. Moving on. 7/10Hill climb is about climbing hills, if you couldn't guess that. It follows the journey spanning about two days of a school girl who loves bicycles, and she seems to be racing her friend every morning to school. This short has a CGI style that is similar to that of RWBY, the characters don't look like your traditional or modern anime, but they don't look bad. If you like racing anime, this might interest you. 7/10Next is Me!Me!Me!, my favorite of the current four. It follows a story of the main characters inner struggles with a hallucination. This short has the most superior animation out of the group, and is actually quite impressive. The themes are very odd at first, but there really are some deep concepts here if you're looking for something to really interpret and think about after watching. I think almost everything is symbolic for something if you really look at it. It shoulders some themes of purity/diluted views and loss and regret. 9/10Finally, is Carnage. This is a very interesting short indeed. It follows the story of a girl in an old western setting who has lost her arm, and concerns the path she takes for revenge. I won't say much more, because anything else would pretty much spoil most of the plot. 8/10.Overall I give this an 8, being very good. I tend to rank things rather highly though; if I liked something, it usually scores high. Maybe I'm being a little generous with an 8, but the shorts are worth a watch although Me!Me!Me! and Carnage are both very graphic and contain nudity, so if you don't like that, just watch the first two. Those are pretty much clean, although do not have as heavy of an effect as the later. but I figured I'd make one because there aren't any on this site at the moment, so if this can help someone that'd be great.

But hopefully all of us can get an appreciation for some gorgeous, if brief animation, right? Of course, that fails to do NAM justice.Nihon Animator Mihonichi plays host to a number of unrelated shorts with storytelling as varied as the artstyles of each piece. The one common factor is that the stories themselves are rarely direct and you\'d be forgiven for wanting to watch it again until you have an understanding for what it is. This isn\'t a bad thing, as it\'s sign of the rare occasion...where quality has been condensed into a brief seven minutes. Quite like the budget. The first short is about a girl who\'s hoping to become a Dragon\'s dentist (quite literally) and the requirements and training to be one involve her dying on the battlefield. Are you lost? It makes contextual sense by the end, but you\'ll want to watch it and a lot of the others (The infamous ME!ME!ME!) at least a second time or recall upon them in your memory banks a few hours later at work, school, or just while having a drink.The animation alone is why I personally keep watching. Even when a story doesn\'t invoke my attention enough or fails to impress me from a story level, the animation is always expressive in one way or another. Hill Climb Girl, for instance, utilizes pure CGI, but it\'s nigh flawless on its own, while Carnage is not done justice by words. Others utilize still images, these ones being those directly related to actual full-length anime, i.e. the Gundam and Evangelion franchises. They\'re interesting in their own right and, especially if you\'re a fan, should take a look at.This is where I should mention the naked breasts.Following the third and currently infamous ""ME!ME!ME!"", which uses so much sexual symbolism to the point of numbing the viewer to it within its short run time or bringing a more sensitive person to smash their computer, two of the next, and presumably some in the future, contain nudity. Quite a bit, in some cases. While I\'d personally call ""ME!ME!ME!""\'s breast turrets as enough a sign of satire as any, Carnage and 20 Min Walk should convince you with their artstyles that it is not so much along the lines of fanservice as an artistic appreciation for the human body, such as art used to contain before the idea of sexualization confused people on what ""offensively sexualized"" even meant.

A number of still frames taken from the animation studios of the original Mobile Suit Gundam team are put up next to each other slowly for the audience to observe the process of animation itself.If any of these interest you, I cannot give you a higher recommendation than to continue with the rest.

It, at the least, is worth a gander.', 'Now before we get into this I just want to take the time to say this is my first review so have mercy.Now if your wondering ""Yo what\'s up with this Nihon Animator Mihonichi?"" Well look no further as I\'m hear to give you a general idea of what this collection of short films has to offer.Story:Let us begin with the stories of Nihon Animator, I feel that there is a special short film waiting for everyone in this collection. There is a huge variety of types of stories that are told here, some are just little fun shorts to watch while others have a...deeper meaning. Some are happy and others are sad, some are simple and others make you think. I believe this is the best feature in this collection because you can connect to a bigger audience. There might be some short films that are not for you in this collection, there will be some shorts that just end without an explanation but this also makes you think harder about the film which is what I think they want you to do. I don\'t want to talk about any of the films, because first of spoilers and second off its interesting going into this with no clue what you are going to get. (Nihon Animator is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get.) So I will just let you experience the shorts for yourself.Art:The art of this collection is exactly how I explained the stories.  Each short film has its own unique art style put into it. It really comes down to the watcher\'s opinion on art whether they think it is good or bad.  I think this also adds to the feeling the short film gives off, so it makes the experience all the much more unique.Sound:I think the music will have a strong impact on the viewer because most of it captures the feeling of the short film its in. Also the voice acting was good so thats always a plus.My Thoughts:There were some shorts that I didn\'t care for but I understand that they were not meant for me so I didn\'t judge them too hard. Some of the music in this collection is AMAZING! *cough* ME!ME!ME! *cough* Girl *cough* There are alot of beautiful visuals in this collection. After finishing all of these short films it feels as if I\'ve been on a journey. I had so many feelings felt when watching all these short films: happy, sad, confused, relaxed, and weirded out at some points but I\'m glad that I watched all of Nihon Animator Mihonichi and I hope you feel the same way by the time you finish it. deeper meaning.

I think it should be watched by all, anime fans or not cause this series is anime in entirety encompassing all flaws and beauty...in the nutshell. Sure it is just a promo material but the quality is just remarkable.Story: - a 9 out 10Each episode is independent with story of its own, some with too deep meaning that makes you to think, some everyday life like slice of life, heck some even don't have story at all and are just promo material, which leaves u with annoyance ,anger ,happiness, joy and some intriguing .This might be going a little generic so let me give you an example (no spoilers of course) The first episode is just a prelude to a whole saga  like  a first 10 minutes of whole Avatar the last air bender, meaning You can't say it is good or bad until you have seen its entirety .And then in third episode which looks like your average (but beautifully animated) booby-Chan Moe anime with a somewhat catastrophic plot which just boggle your mind turns out to be a great philosophical anime with gr8 message hidden if u connect it to the life of certain group of people. And then if we move further forward we goes on a tour of an anime in creation, to a poop... ....oh (sorry) pop idol pv, to a daily life okabe Chan , with some mind twisting plot and blood pumping Sci-Fi (boys goanna dig it) stuff .Sorry I almost forgot to mention it also have gr8 sex ,violence love,.....you will see. The only reason for giving a nine was almost all of them doesn't have a well-defined end rather a prelude to something big which sometimes put you off(But I didn’t expected a gr8 ending from a 6min anime anyway which in some cases is not the case.)Art: - a 10 out 10well as I said earlier it a festival of anime out there you will get your anime selection from early 80s to latest CGI animation all in super packed episode with less than 6 min per episode what greater do you expect , though every episode is a feast to eye some episode really deserve the mention especially Evangelion (ep ..I think 12 or 11).All episode a very vivid imagery which varies from a super simple dark imagery of kanon to bright and beautiful colour of High Climb Girl .Everything is quiet intriguing to me in term of art .Hand downSound: - a 8 out 10I am not a great listener of music but I can say that there is not a single uniform but each track fits its own image with the episode like the pop and electronic music me!me!me!  and a super simple monotone of onishi so it was  quiet good .Though in most of the episode it was not quiet striking, but each music in its own serve it its purpose and  were quiet pleasing. Though there are only some tracks that you can hear independently.Characters: - a 9 out 10There is not a definitive character which , but a whole bunch of them for example let us say....we have a otaku , Adam (literally human creator),a cyborg, A girl from Honey I shrunk The kids, An electric town, a futuristic police , a whore , a cute grim reaper and your average Kill Bill woman .There is whole bunch them, therefore I will say of though some were annoying , some were equally enjoyable  and with such a great selection I think you will definitely find your pick I surely got mine.Animation:- a 10 out 10Although it is not a new point to make from my perspective but animation in this series is fluid you can find it just by watching the opening the quality of work this s series have done. I am not goanna say more just that the anime in each episode was fitting and beautiful.Enjoyment :- a 10 out of 10On a scale of ten I gave a ten because of mainly two reason:-Firstly, because I was in on it without expecting anything out of it and man I am just stunned enough to write my first review here.Secondly. Because I find it engaging and entertaining .Though for those who don't like half ended they might give it a 4-5 out of 10 for the whole series. But I might say they are biasing it only on story point of view (which in itself is sometimes great), but in overall aspect I think this series is a real winner.Also by the time I am writing this review I have only seen 24 episodes ,but I am sure the episode which are coming in future are going to impress me rather than disappoint me.For any remarks and comment please replyHarshrox3 in the nutshell.

It almost transcends the body of humanly extinct by forming into lifeforms and once regain a new catalyst to be awaken.You’ll find your answer in the toughest streets even Martin Scorsese would be afraid to walk down, where the detective agency...of the hot headed shark Machspeed, talking blow up girl Sex, and an ape called Violence that is the definition of what it means to have a stick up your rear happened to slime its way into. Being two of the main characters are literally named Sex and Violence, you should be warned well enough of the content in Imaishi’s short film.While the events in Machspeed are extremely crude, it’s always done with strong comedic timing and style. It’s also geniusly animated like Trigger’s more well known productions, where every line of dialog, character movement, and even backdrop gels in the beat of the film. I can’t stress enough how much I love the way the Trigger team makes their animation work, it’s like listening to a beautiful, complicated Jazz number. There are so many notes you can barely keep them straight, but they flow so well the mountains of music jargon melt into pure listening pleasure.Stepping the boundary to happen, Casually attaining the insanity and each bizarre craze, Intends us to leave a huge mark without a tone. Themes can be varied in a thematic concept of such memoir abstract detail through storytelling.Visuals are hard to follow, it grasp a deniable tacky turn from every satirical mind titilating scenarios. Invoking the drastic unraveling catastrophic messed up routine can keeps you the very hype-turn the back of the seat.Fumbled, nauseating.. and so far confusing?Exactly, While depicting a trigger lore series, each shows can be classy and stylish. Unless, the cinematography suits to be pack of clashing graffiti feast.Considered as a low-key bamboozled zany type with artsy cookie cutter flaws. Can also be viewed in a eerie unpleasant schlock mundane between meth and cocaine, since apart of that seizure it ain't rough to a slew of crass gags that made up so sketchy since it never comes off as cheap or off putting like a lot of American adult cartoons, it’s deliciously grotesque in a way you can’t keep your eyes off it. of the hot headed shark Machspeed, talking blow up girl Sex, and an ape called Violence that is the definition of what it means to have a stick up your rear happened to slime its way into.

There's a love story, Asian pirates, some badass fights and a stage concert with goofy dancing. The song of Yamadeloid is a lot catchier than ME!ME!ME! and is completely safe to watch in public. The visual style uses lots of thick lines and references to Japanese art. It's very over-the-top in a way similar to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.Kanon:Based...on a Czech novel, this short is about a man named Adam who destroys everything in existence except himself, and it punished by God to become the creator of a new world. When he creates the world, and people to inhabit it, things don't pan out how he expected. It's a comedy on religion and atheism which doesn't take any unfair shots at the ideas it makes fun of. It's a good comedy because it's very honest, and nothing is funnier than the truth that we're not willing to say out loud.Hammerhead:A serial-killer turned regenerating superhero, Hammerhead, is dying after pursuing the strongest possible enemy. Hammerhead wanted to die at the hands of someone stronger than himself. Most of the short is recounting the deeds and motivations of Hammerhead, but after a new threat emerges, Hammerhead is not allowed to die and is resuscitated in order to protect the world once again.Bubu & Bubulina:A weird French-style story about a dancing ghost that possesses people using her shoes to find peace so she can move onto the next life. The art style is sketchy and doesn't use bright or glossy colours. It has a jazzy soundtrack and very creative design on the various lifeforms that show up during the short. The biggest thing going for this short is the aesthetic. The animation on the dancing is pleasing to look at, despite being quite weird and French.Robot on the Road:Directed by the man behind Jin Roh and A Letter to Momo, Hiroyuki Okiura, this short is about a hitchhiking robot that tries to get photos with and of the women that pick him up for his popular blog. The draw for this short is the character design and the animation. The animation is realistic and lifelike, and the design for the robot in particular is quite nice. It's amusing to see the robot make excuses when he gets caught, and the credit song is a silly robot-themed La Bamba. on a Czech novel, this short is about a man named Adam who destroys everything in existence except himself, and it punished by God to become the creator of a new world.

After watching the first one that expectation was already broken. After watching all of them, it was even worse. I would say that maybe 5 or so of these are good and most are just average. I was especially disappointed by the art direction, a lof of them went for a kind of western, ""realistic"" look that I did not like.A lot of these also seem like pilots for series? Where there is a...lot of buildup of the world, that indeed does seem interesting, but since we only see 7 minutes of it, it doesn\'t add much. Then there are a bunch which are just mecha shorts, which is probably very nice if you are into those.The ones I would recommend are: 3, 6 ,17, 18, 19, 25, 27 and 34 lot of buildup of the world, that indeed does seem interesting, but since we only see 7 minutes of it, it doesn\'t add much.

Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu Finale ♪,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10928/Nogizaka_Haruka_no_Himitsu_Finale_♪,"['After finishing this finale, I thought “phew it\'s finally over” and thank God for that. These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed.

To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

Well not only does it include them becoming a couple, but also closes basically all of the plot points introduced within prior seasons and returns to some old locations we never thought would be returned to. Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch!

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist.

If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride.', 'First of all I will give it a 8.The reason is i don\'t have any expectation of this anime series.that\'s why i can fully enjoy this.I won\'t say this is a masterpiece,i won\'t say this is a bad one either.It\'s good!Nogizaka haruka no Himitsu is light novel adaption written by Yasaku Igarashi .Plot(6):pretty simple.no complicated twists or anything.Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is set at the private high school Hakujō Academy in Japan and centers around the male protagonist Yūto Ayase and his classmate Haruka Nogizaka.By a chance yuto discovers haruka\'s secret of her being otaku and by his good nature is promises to get along.Amazed...by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh. by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh.', ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Finale is a perfect way to end this series and basically any anime series, but why?

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes.

Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series.

Well not only does it include them becoming a couple, but also closes basically all of the plot points introduced within prior seasons and returns to some old locations we never thought would be returned to. Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch! Please don't miss this opportunity!I did a whole 12 minute review on my...YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA"", 'So, at last the long story of one of the most gullible female MC in the world, Nogizaka Haruka, has meet its end. It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10', ""Bad finish for a bad anime.I didn't want to make a review but there is to much good comments for this.It was powerful nullity from A to Z, and the finish was so shabby that the last «season» happens to be even worse than the rest.The characters are bland and meaningless, nothing and no one is endearing.I present you a bland animated cliché and caricatural with a poor little nerd who wants to take the princess.If you want to see an uninteresting romance that will make you discover nothing but maintain the clichés on their category, well bored and not be able to chain...2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it. 2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it."", 'After finishing this finale, I thought “phew it\'s finally over” and thank God for that. These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists. (wait for the BDs)Sound: 5/10 Hardly noticeableCharacter: 7/10  - Nice to see the development going through all the way but still predictableEnjoyment: 5/10 - Average.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists. (wait for the BDs)Sound: 5/10 Hardly noticeableCharacter: 7/10  - Nice to see the development going through all the way but still predictableEnjoyment: 5/10 - Average. Don\'t take this score the wrong way as this was an average set of episodes from my perspective. I almost forgot at one point that this was a romantic comedyOverall: 5/10 - It could of been better but that\'s just the way it decided to conclude these episodes.', 'First off, I\'m writing this review more as a review for the entire series, rather than just this OVA itself, as the OVA itself does not contain the entire essence of this series. In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

Well not only does it include them becoming a couple, but also closes basically all of the plot points introduced within prior seasons and returns to some old locations we never thought would be returned to. Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch! Please don't miss this opportunity!I did a whole 12 minute review on my...YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA"", 'So, at last the long story of one of the most gullible female MC in the world, Nogizaka Haruka, has meet its end. It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation.

Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy.

To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch!

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist.

Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride.', 'First of all I will give it a 8.The reason is i don\'t have any expectation of this anime series.that\'s why i can fully enjoy this.I won\'t say this is a masterpiece,i won\'t say this is a bad one either.It\'s good!Nogizaka haruka no Himitsu is light novel adaption written by Yasaku Igarashi .Plot(6):pretty simple.no complicated twists or anything.Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is set at the private high school Hakujō Academy in Japan and centers around the male protagonist Yūto Ayase and his classmate Haruka Nogizaka.By a chance yuto discovers haruka\'s secret of her being otaku and by his good nature is promises to get along.Amazed...by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh. by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh.', ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Finale is a perfect way to end this series and basically any anime series, but why?

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it.

I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10', ""Bad finish for a bad anime.I didn't want to make a review but there is to much good comments for this.It was powerful nullity from A to Z, and the finish was so shabby that the last «season» happens to be even worse than the rest.The characters are bland and meaningless, nothing and no one is endearing.I present you a bland animated cliché and caricatural with a poor little nerd who wants to take the princess.If you want to see an uninteresting romance that will make you discover nothing but maintain the clichés on their category, well bored and not be able to chain...2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it. 2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it."", 'After finishing this finale, I thought “phew it\'s finally over” and thank God for that. These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists. (wait for the BDs)Sound: 5/10 Hardly noticeableCharacter: 7/10  - Nice to see the development going through all the way but still predictableEnjoyment: 5/10 - Average.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists. (wait for the BDs)Sound: 5/10 Hardly noticeableCharacter: 7/10  - Nice to see the development going through all the way but still predictableEnjoyment: 5/10 - Average. Don\'t take this score the wrong way as this was an average set of episodes from my perspective. I almost forgot at one point that this was a romantic comedyOverall: 5/10 - It could of been better but that\'s just the way it decided to conclude these episodes.', 'First off, I\'m writing this review more as a review for the entire series, rather than just this OVA itself, as the OVA itself does not contain the entire essence of this series. In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

Well not only does it include them becoming a couple, but also closes basically all of the plot points introduced within prior seasons and returns to some old locations we never thought would be returned to. Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch! Please don't miss this opportunity!I did a whole 12 minute review on my...YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA"", 'So, at last the long story of one of the most gullible female MC in the world, Nogizaka Haruka, has meet its end. It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy.

To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch!

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist.

Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride.', 'First of all I will give it a 8.The reason is i don\'t have any expectation of this anime series.that\'s why i can fully enjoy this.I won\'t say this is a masterpiece,i won\'t say this is a bad one either.It\'s good!Nogizaka haruka no Himitsu is light novel adaption written by Yasaku Igarashi .Plot(6):pretty simple.no complicated twists or anything.Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is set at the private high school Hakujō Academy in Japan and centers around the male protagonist Yūto Ayase and his classmate Haruka Nogizaka.By a chance yuto discovers haruka\'s secret of her being otaku and by his good nature is promises to get along.Amazed...by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh. by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh.', ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Finale is a perfect way to end this series and basically any anime series, but why?

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it.

I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10', ""Bad finish for a bad anime.I didn't want to make a review but there is to much good comments for this.It was powerful nullity from A to Z, and the finish was so shabby that the last «season» happens to be even worse than the rest.The characters are bland and meaningless, nothing and no one is endearing.I present you a bland animated cliché and caricatural with a poor little nerd who wants to take the princess.If you want to see an uninteresting romance that will make you discover nothing but maintain the clichés on their category, well bored and not be able to chain...2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it. 2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it."", 'After finishing this finale, I thought “phew it\'s finally over” and thank God for that. These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists. (wait for the BDs)Sound: 5/10 Hardly noticeableCharacter: 7/10  - Nice to see the development going through all the way but still predictableEnjoyment: 5/10 - Average.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists. (wait for the BDs)Sound: 5/10 Hardly noticeableCharacter: 7/10  - Nice to see the development going through all the way but still predictableEnjoyment: 5/10 - Average. Don\'t take this score the wrong way as this was an average set of episodes from my perspective. I almost forgot at one point that this was a romantic comedyOverall: 5/10 - It could of been better but that\'s just the way it decided to conclude these episodes.', 'First off, I\'m writing this review more as a review for the entire series, rather than just this OVA itself, as the OVA itself does not contain the entire essence of this series. In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

Well not only does it include them becoming a couple, but also closes basically all of the plot points introduced within prior seasons and returns to some old locations we never thought would be returned to. Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch! Please don't miss this opportunity!I did a whole 12 minute review on my...YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA YouTube channel!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCeKOdhVudA"", 'So, at last the long story of one of the most gullible female MC in the world, Nogizaka Haruka, has meet its end. It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy.

To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

Another great idea they did was the transition from Miran singing the OP to the N's, basically the whole cast, to sing it. If you are a fan of romance animes then this is a must-watch!

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist.

Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride.', 'First of all I will give it a 8.The reason is i don\'t have any expectation of this anime series.that\'s why i can fully enjoy this.I won\'t say this is a masterpiece,i won\'t say this is a bad one either.It\'s good!Nogizaka haruka no Himitsu is light novel adaption written by Yasaku Igarashi .Plot(6):pretty simple.no complicated twists or anything.Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is set at the private high school Hakujō Academy in Japan and centers around the male protagonist Yūto Ayase and his classmate Haruka Nogizaka.By a chance yuto discovers haruka\'s secret of her being otaku and by his good nature is promises to get along.Amazed...by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh. by his kindness haruka falls in love with him.then together move on to keep on against haruka\'s family,class and friends to protect haruka\'s secret and protect her.Character(9):in this anime everyone has different characters.Yuto Is a simple high school boy with average grades and looks but kind,caring and a perfect big brother character who always finds himself in rather complicated situation.Haruka in the meanwhile is a perfect character with good grades,good pianist on the surface but inside an airhead,clumsy,otaku,,weirdo with a horrible sense in art and has no clue when it comes to love.Shina is a classmate of their who is a panty girl that also comes to love yuto but can\'t express her feelings due to various twists.But she finally confesses to yuto in front of haruka in the finale series.Mika is the sister of haruka who has a brotherly crush on yuto and stalks yuto and haruka everywhere with their three weirdo maids to tease them.Except them we have few minor characters.Sound and art (8.5)""just your day by day art and sound.This is a Finale first episode based review,it carries on from where the second one left off and becomes your regular show but gets little exciting when Shina confesses.As i said i don\'t expect anything from this anime that\'s why i can enjoy this show.SO i won\'t say this a great one just your slice of life perverted comedy romance which can make you laugh.', ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Finale is a perfect way to end this series and basically any anime series, but why?

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack.

These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it.

I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time. It is certainly not a must-watch, and you must be prepared to not have high expectations for it. However, the important points of the story are covered, and throughout, it is best if you don\'t compare it to better series in the genre of a pure romantic comedy. It is slightly unique in it\'s own way with how it treats the problems of a rather... draggy relationship, but it will not spoil your day, and at it\'s best, it may actually be quite a fun ride. know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2.

If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10', ""Bad finish for a bad anime.I didn't want to make a review but there is to much good comments for this.It was powerful nullity from A to Z, and the finish was so shabby that the last «season» happens to be even worse than the rest.The characters are bland and meaningless, nothing and no one is endearing.I present you a bland animated cliché and caricatural with a poor little nerd who wants to take the princess.If you want to see an uninteresting romance that will make you discover nothing but maintain the clichés on their category, well bored and not be able to chain...2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it. 2 EPs so it sucks, throw yourself on it."", 'After finishing this finale, I thought “phew it\'s finally over” and thank God for that. These four episodes that debuted wraps up the franchise that began it all back in 2008.To refresh some memories, the series details a beautiful young girl named Haruka ""Nuit Étoilée, Lumière du Clavier"" Nogizaka or simply known as Haruka who attends a school and is idolized by her peers. She is smart, beautiful, intelligent, popular, and pretty much everything that a girl strives to be.At least, that\'s what she\'s like on the outside..From the inside, she is an insecure girl who has a secret she wants noboy to...know. *She is amajor otaku and loves anime and manga!* It\'s hard to imagine but it\'s true. To make matters worse, Haruka accidentally lets her secret gets exposed to Yuuto, the main male protagonist. From there, the two forms a strange bond that began from awkwardness, to respect, to friendship, and to couple.Now that trip down memory lane is over, let\'s take a look at these OVA episodes, shall we?The title of the OVA is Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu. That translates to Haruka Nogizaka\'s Secret. And like I mentioned before, Haruka\'s secret is still hidden from most of her peers and even her parents. She wants to keep her hobby because it\'s what she enjoys. However, not everything goes smoothly especially when other third parties are involved. It\'s a funny thing too since these OVA episodes were supposed to involve around Haruka and Yuuto mostly yet half the time involves other characters.The first episode is literally fan-service in your face. From the nakedness, drools, and delusions, these OVA episodes are your typical cliched and generic topping on toppings like a pizza. However, there is some drama involved later on especially involving Haruka\'s family, friends, and her hobby. It\'s painful to watch though as every time “something” is about to them, the series trolls you and the duo gets interrupted especially from other characters and circumstances.It is nice to see the duo\'s relationship and development but it quickly gets old. For example, the typical compromising like settings and the brief love triangle in these episodes were rushed. It\'s no surprise though considering the amount of time these episodes tries to cover up. Furthermore, it\'s very predictable. Hell, even the OP song is cliched with the moe features and foreshadowing of the upcoming events.Let\'s not also forget some of those delusions and the classic “oops I accidentally tripped and it\'s not like that!” scenes. It\'s so commonly used in these type of OVAs now that it\'s just a slap in the face once again. It\'s not realistic and there\'s nothing unique about it.Interesting to say the least though, I did get a few laughters in and there were a few moments between the duo. There was hardly any development from the sequel but this finale here did wrap things up and gave the viewers one of those happily ever after endings. Still, it\'s rushed and cliched. Sometimes, it should be more about than just development but these episodes didn\'t do it right from my estimation. These OVA episodes are a classic on how series like this has become recently by employing the overused fan-service and moe sequences.The artwork and soundtrack already reflect in this but these ova episodes were just meh in my estimation. It does spawn a few “lol\'s\' and emotional moments but it\'s nothing special at all. I\'m glad this is the finale and it\'s finally over. I\'m also glad that Haruka and Yuuta made it all the way. Ultimately, it was a journey and not the most insightful one to say the least. Well, that\'s just from my perspective.To conclude:Story: 5/10 - There was none really and if there was, predictable and clichedArtwork: 5/10 - Generic to the T. Oh let\'s not forget about those damn censors and white mists. (wait for the BDs)Sound: 5/10 Hardly noticeableCharacter: 7/10  - Nice to see the development going through all the way but still predictableEnjoyment: 5/10 - Average.

In addition, I have neither read the light novels, nor it\'s manga adaptation, so my memory of the anime itself is my only gauge for this.As you would know, the basic premise of this story lies in the development of the relationship between the series two main protagonists, Nogizaka Haruka, and Ayase Yuuto.Story: 6Essentially, this story is best described by the evil ""C"" word - Cliche. You can roughly expect to...know what comes next throughout this entire series, for both TV seasons, and this OVA. Twists and Turns are not to be expected, and if you enjoy that kind of story, this is certainly not for you. However, you can expect that the essential points of a series focused on a pure teenage love would be shown, and it eventually does end well (as seen in the OVA). One other big issue about the story is how when there is a case of conflict... it somehow gets resolved WAYYYYY too easily. It fails to demonstrate the problems and issues of a teenage couple being in a relationship of such nature, and often these issues are either not brought out, or are easily resolved. If you are hoping for some real good drama, this story may disappoint you (hence, lower your expectations).Art: 8The art improves with each season of the series. Not to say that I believed that Season 1 had bad art, but i certainly would\'ve given it a 6. At least with the passing of time and improvement of technology, the art for this series has gotten better. Basic character designs stay the same throughout (a good thing, because they generally appealed to me, save for a few characters), but the backgrounds and color quality improve, and in a pretty obvious way by the time it reaches this OVA.Sound: 8The OPs and EDs for the entire series do not always fit, particularly the OP for the 2nd season, but they don\'t entirely disappoint (they do encourage me to unleash my ultimate skill of fastforward  though). I\'m mainly giving points here to the overall soundtrack. The inclusion of many classical themes (as fitting of a story involving a rich ojou-sama, yes?) suits the story of each episode, and the music fits well with the series in general.Character: 6The characters are generally not unexpected. As this is not a harem romcom, we get a decent individual for a main character, and a really shy ojou-sama as the other. However, sadly, while they are given lots of screen time, they do not come across as strong main characters. The best characters in this story are in fact the side/supporting characters. I\'m not even speaking of ""almost-main,"" but definitely recurring characters that don\'t always need to make an appearance (Nobunaga!) However, even with the issue of the main characters, it is not a complete failure, and the strength of the protagonists sometimes does show, normally more with Ayase Yuuto (i\'ll attribute this to the story component).Enjoyment: 7Since the story is cliche, the most important thing that will make this series a success is the execution. However, the execution does some massive acrobatic yoyoing tricks at times. For example, the first two episodes of the 1st season were thoroughly enjoyed, but it slumped really badly for the next few, to rise again, and then fall, and then balance. However, it has it\'s moments, as when it does do well, it really can match with the top animes in terms of enjoyment. Consistency is the greatest issue here. When I got to laugh, i really did, but when it fell, it really plunged a massive hole of disappointment in me. If there\'s one thing this OVA does do that the rest of the series doesn\'t (oh, producer, why you dragging on the story?), it gives closure to the series.Overall: 7Overall, this series is not a waste of your time.

It wasn\'t indeed a smooth journey and as a romcom fan i rather like this anime, but of course there are still flaws.The anime overall (Season 1 up to the end) was what i can say a downfall. Season 1 started very promising. The male MC was not as dense as i thought and Haruka was, despite her denseness,  indeed very lovable as a character. There were lots of cute moments between the 2 and even with the absence of...love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough. Well of course to keep the relationship moves on either one of them has to confess their feeling, which i thought would happen in season 2. But no, season 2 got even more dragged along with lovey dovey moments from the 2 and with an addition of dramas and cliches at the end of it i wasn\'t sure that this anime is as good as it was in the first season anymore. Season 3 got us finally a conclusion, but again the cliches added to it was even worse than season 2 and i could almost feel cringe just like when i watched rubbish shoujo animes. And in at the last episode i was just like ""Thats it? I watched all those seasons only for this one f*cking scene?"", it was rather unsatisfying because i thought there would be at least a bit more after story development.Overall this anime\'s recipe was pretty outdated for a romcom, but i still pretty much enjoyed it. The comedic and cute moments were all there. If it wasn\'t get dragged along too much with all those cliches it would\'ve been a very good romcom anime series. 6/10 love confession from either of them i find their relationship already satisfying enough.
