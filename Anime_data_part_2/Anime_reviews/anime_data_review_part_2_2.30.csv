Are they not too bulky?Let's entertain the possibility, how likely is it that they themselves end up in a hoop?These ones can certainly fluff the ball!Maybe a bit too fluffy? ""]"

You will become sleepy.(Note: I have not read the original manga.)(+) A colorful department store and many animals appear.As you can see from the movie's trailer, it's colorful. The four seasons are beautifully painted. Also, many animals (including extinct animals) appear, so it's fun to watch.(+) A story about getting used to job.A story...about the main character getting used to her job. Episodes from the original manga are seamlessly connected. The main character's voice was also great. Watching movie warms my heart.(+) Nice script.There is a bit of secret in the worldview (background) of this work, but it was expressed very weakly in the movie.

"Hataraku Saibou!! Saikyou no Teki, Futatabi. Karada no Naka wa ""Chou"" Oosawagi!",https://myanimelist.net/anime/42387/Hataraku_Saibou_Saikyou_no_Teki_Futatabi_Karada_no_Naka_wa_Chou_Oosawagi,"['UPDATE Feb. 2021: Looks like Season 2 Eps 4-7 cover this movie, so if you\'ve already finished Season 2 of Hataraku Sabou, then there\'s not much need to watch this movie. Just want to put it out there to save everyone time!TL;DR: A 2-hour-long episode that dials the cuteness up to 11, with more than a few good laughs. Does have pacing issues and recycled animations from the previous show. Overall very enjoyable, but felt a bit stretched out.Since Hataraku Saibou is not a particularly story-driven series, I was wondering how they would try to make it into a 2-hour long movie. The answer was...by mashing 2 different stories together while adding new characters and giving fanservice for existing ones, with the end result being an enjoyable entry into the Hataraku Saibou series, even if the story felt extremely disjointed.There are 2 core plot threads: one involves a normal cell trying to protect lactic acid bacteria he found, which are the new cute mascots for the series next to the platelets (don\'t worry, the platelets still return for plenty of screentime!). The other plot thread features the return of the cancer cell, who felt kind of shoved in because the movie needed a main villain, since he isn\'t even mentioned until halfway through the movie.The end result is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, with plenty of laugh out loud moments with side characters such as the Natural Killer cell, and ""awww so cuuute"" moments with the platelets. However, the movie has massive pacing issues because the 2 main plot threads barely mesh together. It feels like the studio took 2 separate arcs that weren\'t long enough for a movie on their own and forced them together to get up to the movie run time.The other issue with the movie is the animation - several of the fight scenes were noticeably just glorified slideshows with voices, and plenty of flashbacks to the main show and even to the beginning of the movie felt like an attempt to pad the run time.Oh, and one last complaint - not enough ""ara-ara"" Macrophage onee-san!!!!!All in all, I highly recommend the movie to fans of the series. It didn\'t disappoint and I enjoyed the return of the old characters and introduction of the new mascots. Unfortunately, a disjointed plot, pacing issues, and animation shortcuts knocked it down from a ""Great!"" to a ""Very Good.""Final score: 7/10 by mashing 2 different stories together while adding new characters and giving fanservice for existing ones, with the end result being an enjoyable entry into the Hataraku Saibou series, even if the story felt extremely disjointed.There are 2 core plot threads: one involves a normal cell trying to protect lactic acid bacteria he found, which are the new cute mascots for the series next to the platelets (don\'t worry, the platelets still return for plenty of screentime!).

Hataraku Saibou!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39586/Hataraku_Saibou,"[""TLDR: if you liked the first season - you will most likely like this one. If you did not - don't waste time.Story: basically it is more of the same stuff, out cells doing their work and overcoming different situations. It is really nothing much to speak about, considering this season is only 2/3 of a normal season in length.Art, sound: the same as S1, solid but nothing stellar.Characters: once again, more of the same. Most of the characters were already established in the first season (or at least had episodical role), so you know what to expect. No real character progression if by...chance you expected any.Enjoyment: like I said, you will like it if you liked S1. I sure did and I kinda enjoyed S2, but without novelty of S1 it felt kinda stale and due to being only 8 episodes it also felt short.Overall I don't regret the time I spent on it, but there sure are more interesting things to watch. chance you expected any.Enjoyment: like I said, you will like it if you liked S1.

The TL;DR is this: our favorite body cells are back at it again, resuscitating a healthy body from many of the immune diseases as inspired and suffering from real life, but giving it the anime flare and feel that\'s basically one and the same from Season 1.The only reason why we have a Season 2 in times like now, is because the spin-off (which is Hataraku Saibou Black, or Cells at Work: Code Black) is chosen to air in Winter 2021, so both mangaka...Akane Shimizu and David Production had the perfect idea to release them both at the very same time in Japan, leading to that 1-hour back-to-back TV broadcast, and that by itself is a great call to advertise more of the mangaka\'s works.The main gripe that I have with Season 2 is that while nothing has changed (and to be honest, this works for the better), it\'s more of the same to push the near-perfect body back to health through different means of immunities and diseases, and with only 8 episodes, I\'d feel it\'s the right length to finish off this show, along with all the translated manga chapters so far (as of the time of this review). In a nutshell, you can tell that mangaka Akane Shimizu spends MORE time on her part supervising the countless spin-offs (which are far more interesting) than progressing the main series, and that by itself is kind of both a blessing and a curse. Not to say that it\'s all bad, but generally a creative mix of ideas from different mangakas is a good way to establish the main series further, however in turn, trades off for a solid foundation of ""returning the series to its roots"" and leaves no room for more creativity of what the main series could have offered as potential.But rest assured: if you like or love Season 1, this sequel is a good follow-up of the countless adventures of the main character cast of cells working together to alleviate naughty, bad cells and old enemies from raging within the body. OST is pretty much the same atmosphere as the previous season, so at least there is consistency in an otherwise well-known series.If you\'re wondering about the movie that was released before Season 2 came out, save your money (if you\'re intending to watch it), as it covers the 2nd half of the show in its entirety (from Episodes 4 to 8) for another TL;DR, you\'re welcome. I\'d thought that the movie itself would compensate for the remainder of 2 hours (or 5 episodes equally) worth of new content, but it wasn\'t meant to be, so, oh well.All in all, while Season 2 was just as bombarding as a marketing gimmick, it should come as no surprise that it\'s still worth watching all the way through. Not as amazing as how Season 1 landed the expectations, but hey, that\'s OK.P.S. Watch the spin-off Code Black, it\'s reverse gender-bender, but better.

For example, both shows may talk about hair or something. So that might be more fun for you to watch both simultaneously.Too many corners are cut in the animation department. CGI red blood cells walking around.Educational value is decent except for the last two episodes which is nothing but action scenes and a bacteria that wears a fox fursuit.Two episodes with platelets and a few more with the lactic acid bacteria.

Compared to Black, s2 has a much more colourful and bright style, while still being a little dark in areas, in case things really get heated. It's really well done in that department, with the sounds still being super fitting for each and every scene and nothing wrong from either side there.Cells s2 is really good, and you should be watching it!

Its still kinda surprising how many people havent talked about this anime, like I know that Aot and JJK are airing but I did expect a bit more popularity but that doesnt really matter, because I like underated shows, so lets talk about the anime....I am going to talk about season 1 and 2""This review is spoiler-free""Story-The story is verry simple but verry compelling and fun to watch. It is a story about 2 bloodcells doing their work and talking to eachother and always have fun with eachother....They arent in love with eachother(I believe) so its rather a slice of life instead of a romance. So there isnt really a story because its a slice of life but if you just want to see something refreshing I think you will like this anime, the anime also gives you information about the human body and its verry intressting....Characters-The characters in this show are mostly well written and have all their small arcs like Assanation classroom for example. They all share a great chemistry and I never get tired of the dialouge, not all characters are well written but for a slice of life that doesnt really matter, if you just like to see 2 bloodcells to be friends with eachother then you should give it a fair shot. Oh and dont worry, it mostly focused on them.Sound-The second Op was fine but not as good as the first one, the ending was cute but nothing really special...Art/animation-It does look cheap sometimes but for the most part it looks good. The shading in this anime was in my opinion unique and the animation is just fluid and looks good.Enjoyment-Its a fun slice of life/comendy anime that provides alot of information about the body. Some episodes are more fun to watch then others but if you have nothing else to do then try this show out. Its verry enjoyable and relaxing to watch.

Surprisingly enough, it did.I'm not sure if it was the comedy or the story moving forward that made me enjoy this more than the first season. This one felt much more relaxing and nice to watch and that could be because of the contrast between it and black. The stories about childhood embarassing pics, the cute helpful bacterium and the end of the whole cancer cells arc. The whole thing was wholesome and cute which in turn made me want to...love watching it. Even after leaving 2-3 episodes and watching them in a row thinking I wouldn't enjoy it, I was surprised at how wrong I was.

Even as a fan of the first season I didn't find myself liking much of S2's content as much as I did with the first season.I chalk most of this due to a lack of focus with its topics and plot. While the first season followed an inexperienced worker around her first day at work, having the benefit of the audience resonating with her journey of discovery throughout the human body, the second season is a lot more unfocused and scatterbrained.

I don't know if it's because BLACK is airing right now in the same season, but having BLACK as an immediate comparison point with S2 doesn't do the latter any favors. The jokes feel bland and juvenile at times and don't hit nearly as much as they once did in S1. The edutainment stuff is still fascinating, and like S1 it blends naturally into the show itself. Character-wise WBC is the blandest cell in the whole body, and the side characters aren't nearly as whimsical or interesting as they were in S1, even for returning characters. Everyone just feels bland and uninteresting. Compare this season's Cancer Arc to S1's one for a good comparison on how both seasons approach the same topic. S1's writing was good enough that it manages to humanize Cancer Cell, while S2 is just some messy action fight that isn't very much interesting to watch.Overall a rather lacking season compared to S1. With the bizarre decision to only have 8 episodes running you do wonder if the series creator ran out of steam with the overtly family-friendly Hataraku Saibou series, given that the manga also has had hiatuses every now and then.4/10 along WBC on his patrols but there is no real cohesion between each episode beyond fighting the Villain of the Week.The writing in terms of comedy and plot progression do feel weaker.

It reinforces again the importance of being healthy with the constant difficulties faced by our body.As I didn't write anything about the first season, I will describe more clearly my idea of \u200b\u200bboth seasons. It injects the “animated japonizing ray” into our body to talk about this more biological and preventive topic. This is an obvious idea, but not a simple one. I see no problem with some of the more common choices that anime makes. For example, the character design of the characters, which is more generic, their personalities...and even the narrative structure is entirely designed to bring the viewer closer to the theme through personalities we already know.Anime even subverts some things that (theoretically) don't work in other works. Deus ex machina are made in a very inventive way, when the characters are losing in some way and are saved by a medicine or a blood transfusion, it is something genius. Perhaps, he comes closer to a “shounen” structure to enact these ideas.Hataraku Saibou!! It has 8 episodes. 5 of them to reinforce the existence of good bacteria that exist in our body, and the remaining 3 episodes show an enemy that arises from our body, which is cancer. It is clearly visible that the anime exalts the importance of having a strong and healthy body to fight a strong enemy that may appear unexpectedly. And you don't have to watch Hataraku Saibou to know that cancer is something to be feared. All villains have a frightening appearance, but in their degree of importance. The cancer cell also has a characteristic tau, but with its importance enhanced by our subconscious that knows that it is something really terrible and almost irreversible. In my experience, a feeling of fear and concern about the topic was soon aroused, and this soon changed my way of thinking and acting a little.

The thing is, I loved the simple way the topics wee explained in the first season, but this season, it seemed like more drama, less science to me.

Yes she\'s still around, but I feel like the focus is less on her and her misadventure through...the body as we focus on different characters. Now is that good or bad?

I really enjoy biology and learning about the human body, and this cour of episodes gives us a whole new slew of medical scenarios to observe and learn from.Art: 8With David Production at the helm, the art looks just as crisp and great...as ever. They did a great job in all the episodes with character drawings and animation. All the shows they produce are eye candy.Sound: 6The sound effects and voice acting are good. The soundtrack is pretty lacking in my opinion. Nothing notable in that department.Character: 8The characters from S1 are back with some notable newcomers that stole the show in a couple episodes. The personification of the cells and bodily functions is creative and super fun. There's a few characters that I wish got some more screen time, though.Enjoyment: 8Watching the issues the cells go through is a super enjoyable experience. I have a blast learning about the biology behind everything. The fights are pretty great and entertaining as well, with some of them having a decent amount of emotion in them.Overall: 8I really enjoy the Cells At Work series.

It is an anime I look forward to sharing with my young child for it's educational aspect. If you liked CaW1, you'll enjoy CaW2.Compared to the first part, I would say part two is nearly equivalent except that there seems to be more depth to each story and a a bit more over arching plot lines. Yet,  when it comes to the storyline of this anime, it's all surface. In other words, what you see is what you get. There still isn't a ton of depth and very little to no...subplot. Despite that, the anime storyline isn't bad. I enjoyed the way it handled each episode and how an educational aspect was tied in. Despite knowing most of the information, I didn't find it boring at all.Comedy is present and isn't overbearing. I could stand to use a bit more though, as each time a pun or situational humor was presented, it was actually funny, but felt like I might get one per episode.Art and sound are average. That is to say, there isn't anything noteworthy both good nor bad. English acting was very good.Characters are about equivalent to the storyline, that is to say there isn't a ton of interesting depth to them, albeit more than in the storyline. However, I never felt as though I was missing something. They all felt and seemed natural. There seems to be a missed connection between the Red Blood Cell and White Blood Cell. They hinted at liking each other, but all you ever get is a bit of blushing and awkward moments.I'd recommend Cells at Work for an easy-to-watch show that doesn't require you to be glued at every turn. Each episode is easily digestible with a bit of comedy and education intertwined, that aren't linked to the next per se. Highly looking forward to introducing my kid to this show in a decade or so. subplot. Despite that, the anime storyline isn't bad.

Like…it’s usually supposed to be 12 or 13 episodes. We’ve established this. This has nothing to do with how it impacts the quality or anything else with the storytelling, but rather a PSA on the fact that it seems like the definition of ‘season’ now is ‘whatever the showrunners want it to be’. I guess.Story:While I’m tempted replicate Mamiko Noto’s narration spiel about how the body has 37 trillion cells that all work hard to keep a human body alive, I’m instead going to just let everyone know that this season is essentially the...intestine and digestion system season since that, broadly speaking, eats up a greater majority of the show’s runtime. Compared to the first season’s multitude of episodic romps that end in one or two multi-episode arcs to cap off the season, season two by comparison starts off with a multitude of half-episode episodic romps before transforming into a larger narrative picture that ends in a single multi-episode arc. Very similar on paper, but different in execution.For starters, season two feels like it flows a little better once it’s past the half episode romps. This is largely due to the fact that the series introduces four little plot devices that help move the story along. Which plays into the larger scope of the intestine’s role in the body, as well as the rest of the smaller minisodes that occur while our characters are stationed in the intestine. By contrast, the beginning parts of the season feel more awkwardly paced than everything that comes after that. Primarily due to the fact that the show plays out like Saturday morning cartoons where each episodic plot is only eleven or so minutes long. Which as a result, create some really choppy stories that narratively don’t really mesh well with each other or the other two-thirds of the runtime that’s dedicated to the digestion system. This is in part due to the fact that each of those short form stories are focused solely on various immunity cells that we’ve met in the past, but also because each of these stories are vastly different from one another since each cell’s job is different. And featuring two polar opposite short stories next to each other in a thirty minute timeframe can create a bit of whiplash.I’ve also learned that because the body is so indecisive and dangerous to itself, the plots that come out of this show, while biologically correct…need a surprising amount of suspension of disbelief to be taken into consideration. Which I guess is part of the charm with Cells at Work given its anthropomorphizing of human cells to show off the kind of harrowing crap we humans put our bodies through every day. Unfortunately, this leads to the series seeing a little nonsensical at times with some philosophy and deeper meaning that personally I don’t think needs to be there since just the concept of this show is wild to begin with. And making the cells think about their place in the world and why they’re in this perpetual cycle of work and death is a bit too meta for this mostly educational show to handle methinks.Characters:Compared to Season 1 where it seemed like our resident air-headed red blood cell got all of the attention, this season seemed to shift the focus off to our resident White blood cell and his line of work in protecting various parts of the body. (Aka just the intestine for a majority of the show.) This is partly due to the fact that every episode tackles a greater problem that the characters are notified of prior compared to the first season where our resident RBC just kind of stumbled into every major situation that occurred, screaming her way into next week running for her life while clutching onto her precious deliveries. While I’m happy the show swapped its perspective to give us the ‘other’ perspective so to speak, so too comes the philosophical aspect of Cells at Work which in my opinion is shaky at best. Which comes to play only because the story demands that the Neutrophil that’s designed only to take out foreign contaminants has human thoughts and emotions. And questions the validity of their job when they’re supposed to take out all foreign threats, but doesn’t in favor of giving alternate parties the benefit of the doubt.By contrast, we have Ordinary Cell, a normal cell that lives in the throat who wishes to be something more than just someone who gets free deliveries and is meant to just proliferate so the body can grow. His character arc feels a lot more fulfilling by comparison because he kind of has his own hero’s journey that has both a sense of pacing and closure that’s well contained within the span of his time in the show. While also contributing to the greater scope of the series by essentially being the gateway for the larger span of the show without intruding on things too much. All around probably the best aspect of the show that was also one of its most surprising aspects too.As for the rest of the character cast, the most that the various immunity or bodily function cells get are a few important scenes or an entire half episode to explain a process or function they have. And what happens if that function isn’t done or executed. All the while Mamiko Noto is in the background narrating everything that’s happening as if she’s reading off of a college grade biology textbook. They’re certainly characters that get their time of day when it happens, but serve less plot prominence beyond that.Aesthetics:David Production taking the reins for Cells at Work again wasn’t something that I thought wasn’t going to happen, and I’m glad they kept the license for it even if Black is being handled by a different production studio. Compared to the first season, the vibrancy and amount of hue we get with the color palette in the show is a lot more intense than I remember it being. It’s not all that different from Season 1, but there’s enough of one that I feel like it’s worth mentioning. This also works in tandem with the darker areas of the show where the characters appear a lot more…sinister than I feel like they should. Which creates some incredible contrast where we have bright and cheerful clashing with dark and edgy. There’s also some CGI used but it’s not that big a deal considering how rare it is.But that’s not all. Now, when I talked about the fact that Cells at Work was made by the ‘Jojo people’ in my first review, I said it really only in reference to David Production’s most popular work currently so people kinda knew who they were. I didn’t expect to have actual jojo references in this godforsaken show. This is by no means a bad thing, but it’s clear that the animators working on this wanted to do something stupid or fun, so while I’m not sure that this was their ultimate intention, I feel like someone definitely wanted to throw in a few references in there. (The lactic acid bacterium literally did the Oraoraoraora. You cannot tell me that someone didn’t want to make a jojo reference here.)“Go! Go! Saibou Festa” sung by a greater majority of the ‘important’ cells in the series is not exactly the kind of song I thought would be featured in this series, but hey, I’m not against it. Personally I think the first season OP is a lot better because that one sounded like it had the urgency of working to it whereas this one kinda just has everyone sing about their jobs. With occasional ‘Nyus’ for obvious reasons when watching the show. ClariS’s “Fight” by comparison is a song that’s much more lax and personally not one I’m too thrilled about personally. A good feel good song, but nothing that’s noteworthy enough to get an individual listen to on its own. Good tracks, but nothing immensely worthwhile.Final Thoughts:Cells at Work 2 was a show that surprised me in many ways, mostly because I didn’t really think that’d we actually get a sequel to the series, and we would only have the one season to show off the novelty of the concept. But because season 2 is actually a thing, I guess we have more of that novelty given form.Truth be told, the novelty is what I think gives Cells at Work a greater majority of its intrigue. It’s a very non-committal show, focusing primarily on education and the imagining of what the human body would look like if it was actually a sprawling society. Beyond that and the body’s relationship to various pathogens that attempt to infiltrate it, there wasn’t really a lot to say about the show when it first came out and the same holds true here. Cells at Work to me is one of those really good novelty shows that works to its strengths and offers what’s on the box, but does little else beyond that. A show that’s worthy of recommendation, but mostly because it’s good, non-offensive fluff that you can learn something from.Also the show is only eight episodes. So if you got a busy schedule but want to finish a decent show, it’s here for you. intestine and digestion system season since that, broadly speaking, eats up a greater majority of the show’s runtime.

From what I gathered of the cringe fanservice of the platelets and the overall ridiculousness of the theme, it didn't seem very interesting.Well, honestly, it's not that cringy. I only watched it off of recommendations, but overall, it's a pretty decent show. it showcases the human body in self sentient anthropomorphic cells, and it serves as a comedic but also sort of educational show. Yes, if you took college level courses, you're not going to learn anything. But, for an anime, this is quite a...bit of information. As someone that hasn't done these courses, I have learned a bit from the show. Obviously, you're better off just reading a biology textbook if you really want to know about the human body, since this show simplifies a lot of concepts, but this show does a good job of introducing biological ideas and concepts into a viewer friendly and entertaining fashion.It shows good humor, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Overall, a lot better than you'd expect. The way these cells are depicted are pretty funny, and the amount of creativity to pull it off is worth my commendation. bit of information.

And after watching, I can only think of one word to describe this season: Unnecessary.Not BAD, but I feel like this season didn\'t need to be made. A lot of the same issues are being dealt with as in past episodes with little variation to be seen. ""Bump"" is very similar to ""Scrape Wound"" from the first season, and ""Dengue Fever"" and ""Mumps"" feel like derivatives of varying parts from ""Cedar Pollen Allergy.""...There\'s just no exciting material that vastly differs it from the first season. The only ones that felt like new material to me were ""Acne"" and ""Peyer\'s Patch."" And technically, the use of cytokines and H. pylori were new, although compared to how they were used in Code Black, they felt underwhelming and dorky. (Although these shows have wildly different thematic elements, so I\'ll let that slide).Adding that in, the central conflict didn\'t feel like it posed any real threat to the body. Whereas ""Hemorrhagic Shock"" and ""Cancer Cell"" felt like legitimate issues that the body had to tackle, and were great as unique threats to the cells, I couldn\'t find anything in this season that truly felt dangerous. No, for this season, the writers just brought Cancer Cell back as the main villain, and instead of being strangely sympathetic like he was in his introduction, he felt cartoonishly evil and annoying. (And also the interaction with Regulatory T Cell was bizarre since IIRC, she didn\'t have the same reaction or role in the first season).That being said, I still think the series was fine. I wish the focus was more on AE3803 since I felt like her role in this was largely diminished. Not that I dislike U-1146, but they had about the same screentime in the first season and he vastly overshadowed her along with the epithelial cell that took care of the lactic acid bacteria.Animation was good; fight scenes felt a little underwhelming comparatively. Music still had a fun, upbeat manner and the characters were still kinda hokey, but in an endearing way. There wasn\'t much of any character growth also though, which kinda sucked.(And guys, I get this is first and foremost an \'edutainment anime,\' but I don\'t need to have scenes paused to explain lactic acid bacteria six times in the span of two episodes. We\'re not goldfish here).If you liked the first season (like I did), you\'ll like this one too, since it\'s largely a bunch of the same things with a new coat of paint.

The art isn't that notable aside from a few crappy scenes. The story kinda stinks especially when Normal Cell is the focus (The last 2 episodes are the highlights even though they padded that arc quite a bit). He is very bland (possibly with intention). What is also a shame is that Red Blood Cell is sidelined for most of the series. She just appears to exist in many episodes.

Slowly, but surely, I began to notice the insignificantly infrequent extra scenes and realized that this was the OVA I'd eagerly awaited (for about 5 minutes) to see.Basically, I wasted a valuable hour of my time. I already knew what would happen from watching the...final episode of the actual series, so Final Plus was no longer enjoyable. In fact, it was quite the grueling experience. Watching a re-do held absolutely no suspense, no excitement, and no emotion at all. The so-called &quot;newly added scenes&quot; were parts I could've lived without seeing. The only section remotely worth seeing is the final 8 or so minutes which were completely new scenes never seen in the final episode. But seriously, I could've spent my 50 minutes doing something else...So please. Do yourself a favor. Instead of watching this OVA, do something productive. Watch something else.

Karas,https://myanimelist.net/anime/389/Karas,"[""STORY: The story or stories within Karas stem from several archetypal anime genres. We have a story of redemption, a story of discovering oneself, a story of the super-natural versus the corporeal, a story of good against evil and the blurry line between. In fact there is a ton of story in here that, with proper plot development, could easily fill an entire 25-27 episode season. And therein lies the problem of Karas's story. There are just too many many plot lines being developed in this movie. Also, the show paces itself slowly, telling the audience only the bare minimum of what needs to be...known at the time and ultimately hindering the viewer's involvement. While this amount is sufficient in understanding the full story, the story loses its intrigue that draws in the viewer. There is vast potential for plot here, but this potential is not fleshed out and used.ART: Karas is a visual powerhouse with few peers to call its equal. All of the major battle and dramatic sequences are perfectly epic. If you enjoy watching superhuman battles with swords, explosions, lasers, robotics(both big and small), etc., then this is the best that anime has to offer. This OVA is one of the most gorgeous films for its genre, and few shows can live up to this caliber of animation quality. Although animation and art design can't carry an entire show, Karas's visual appeal carries a great deal and redeems most of the show's flaws.SOUND: Fortunately for the visual production of Karas, the sound develops the already epic, visual appeal into unreal proportions. The voice acting is fantastic for each character. The music gives each scene the appropriate response to each emotion. This is the kind of music that inspires roaring during battle scenes, quiet trepidation during conflicts, and cries of &quot;That was beastmode!&quot; during victory celebrations. The audio portion of the show is no pushover in relation to the visual aspect, but there are a few scenes in the show that need audio editing. Besides these few qualms, the sound is fantastic.CHARACTER: The character development of this show suffers like the story. There are too many characters, and they all have deep histories. However, the show doesn't have the time to delve into all but one or two of these characters, and those select few receive the slightest bit of detail. Ultimately, I just didn't care about anybody other than the protagonist, one of the fortunate characters to receive miniscule detail. It is unfortunate because, like the story, there is so much potential behind the plethora of characters presented. Yet this potential is barely tapped.ENJOYMENT: Karas is highly enjoyable with varied rewatchability. The battles and epic drive of this series make the experience invigorating, and several post-initial viewings are required to realize the sheer force this epic extravaganza possesses. However, there is very little depth beyond the flash-bang-awesome, and this effect does wear off over time. The initial and second viewings will be the best, and they will be highly memorable. However, there is little to take away from Karas other than, &quot;That was unbelievably cool.&quot;OVERALL: Karas's production team sacrificed plot, depth, and series longevity for visual, audio, and sensual awe. These balances have noticeable and predictable pros and cons.Also, Karas displays graphic violence overbearingly at times. To some, this graphic effect may not be a problem. However, the gore in Karas is extreme and may be too excessive for others.I hope this review has proven beneficial, and I appreciate any feedback, critiques, or thoughts through messages.

Happy anime watching!"", 'Great anime!! Its got everything an anime should have. Great story that you can reflect on with &quot;what ifs?&quot;; delivered in a partially non-linear form, superb animation, you have to see to believe it, great sound with a fitting score, characters that grow even in just 6 eps. Its starts of with a bang and ends in a satisfying yet quiet way. The story may be confusing in the beginning but everything slowly irons out and its all completed at the end. I personally like the references to japanese folklore, it made it modern with an traditional twist. ', 'STORY: 7/10In my opinion, I thought the story plot was the weakest part of Karas. It took me until two episodes or so to understand what even went on, although once you get the hang of the characters and such, the plot does come together. Perhaps one of the reasons why the plot is so difficult to understand is that the series has been condensed to a mere six episodes. If it were spread out like other anime (13 or 26 episodes), if anything, I think the plot would have been amazing. If you really do pull all the story lines that weaved Karas, they\'re...very intense, with the idea of what\'s good and evil, and the obvious supernatural.ART: 10/10For those that hate complex story plots, but still have the curiosity of watching Karas, I really do recommend that you do, because the art is beautiful. The combination of 2D and 3D animation really makes Karas more than a series, but a beautiful piece of work. The way they fused many Asian cultures together (I swear, I had moments where I thought I was looking at Korean signs instead of a Japanese city, ahaha) for the setting, and the characters are beautifully created. The details are just unbelievable. If you REALLY don\'t like the plot, then really... just turn the sound off, turn some intense music on, and just watch it. It\'s just that good.SOUND: 8/10The music for Karas was beautiful, and fit very well together. I found the ending song for the first half fitting so well, sung by RURUTIA, who puts on a very mysterious and ambient air in her song ""Selenite"". The background music for the series also was well produced, as it really helped add to the intensity.The seiyuus were also very well chosen. They really helped bring out some of the personality of the characters that they voiced.CHARACTER 7/10The characters suffered as well as the plot. Due to the whole six episodes only situation, it was hard to really see what they were like, especially since they all have an extremely complex personality and background. It took me forever to understand the situation of Nue and Otoha, two main characters of Karas, and it could just be me, but I found that it was really difficult to follow the characters, and at the same time, follow a very complex plot. It just added to the confusion. But the seiyuus did, like I mentioned before, help bring out some of their personality, but if anything, it was difficult to understand the characters until the very end.ENJOYMENT 7/10I kind of see Karas as one of those anime where you either enjoy it, or you don\'t. Personally, I loved it. It was probably due to the fact that the art really captured my attention, as well as the sound. But if anything, it\'s going to be the graphics that will capture you. The fusion of 2D and 3D is something you don\'t see, and as someone who has a deep interest for art, it truly was a wonder to see this. The plot on the other hand, I struggled immensely with, due to the confusion, and that took away some of the enjoyment of Karas.OVERALL 8/10So, I guess you could say that I advise you to watch this, knowing that the plot IS confusing. I don\'t care how brilliant you are, it will throw you off a bit, because it\'s one of those ""in media res"" moments.I advise those that really don\'t care much for the graphics, but really the plot and characters to NOT watch this... unless you have some odd love for abnormally complex stories, then in that case, go for it.But if you\'re someone who really appreciates computer graphics and art, as well as sound, then I do recommend watching it, but caution the fact that the plot is hard to follow.Those who don\'t really like blood and gore may want to be a bit cautious to starting this anime, as umm... they definitely took Karas above and beyond with the blood and gore, ahaha, and it may cause some distress for others who aren\'t very good at handling graphic violence.[Just so you know: This is my first review on MAL, so any critique, feedback, suggestions, etc. are greatly appreciated and accepted.

I was completely confused throughout the first half, we were plunged into the middle of the story with no explanation and no idea what was going on. The second half was filled with predictable cliches and I found it was more stimulating to have no idea what was going on as it drove me to continue to watch in order to figure out what was happening. Overall, the plot was boring and something we have seen a thousand times before, only a lot more vague.Art: The series is undeniably beautiful, the animation...ranks up there with the likes of Gankutsuou. I'll even go far as to say that Karas, just like Trinity Blood, doesn't deserve such beautiful animation. If you want to watch this series then just mute the DVD, listen to your favorite CD, and enjoy the beautiful imagery. Don't worry, like I said before there's no story to pay attention to.Sound: the music was all right, once again nothing special. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy the OST. The dub wasn't anything exceptional, Echo's voice actor in particular was very bland and unemotional.Character: The characters are just as cliched and vague as the plot. There's little to no development and hardly any explanation as to what their motivation might be. Everyone is shallow and two-dimensional.Overall this was a huge disappointment. It was as if Tatsunoko Productions simply wanted to show off their animation skills and threw together the story as an afterthought. With more focus on developing a plot and interesting characters this could have been an excellent series, unfortunately they forgot that good animation does not make a good series. Just like video games, it doesn't matter how amazing the visuals, it is the story that is truly engaging. ranks up there with the likes of Gankutsuou.

He is one of the titular Karas, humans appointed as superpowered agents of the land. Able to transform into a car, an aircraft, and an armored crusader; The story presents themes on the conflicts between cultural traditions and modern society and the relationship between people. The story is fast paced, maybe...not in the first 2 eps. but it could be complicated for some people to follow what's going on with the story after that, but if you get to understand it right away like i did you will find that the story is great, there were unpredictable elements that may surprise you but in a seinen you expect everything to happen, there's a lot of fighting scenes and they are amazing, there are some sequences in the story that are not explained like, the final 10 seconds of the final episode, who is that? another antagonist? we'll never know because there's no manga to research who is that and that part made a room for a full 2nd season. Very good story.Art & AnimationThe art style was the best and even more in the fight scenes, with a combination of 2D seinen art style and smooth and fluent photorealistic 3D fighting scenes and character models was amazing, it has a dark atmosphere with the ep. 5 being the darkest one, it was outstanding.SoundThe music matched the anime very well, the VA was good but with flaws, the background music was very good; The OP was really good and very fitting and the ED song was like if a movie ended, it was good to hear it and there were different ED songs, overall very good.CharacterThey were very good but i felt that the anime was too short and there were characters that were a mistery and i wanted to know more about them, like Nue or his brother, why was he that important? was he really powerful? who knows, Eko could have been given more screen time and for some reason i liked the Yurines but liked more Otoha's Yurine, i felt that she could have feelings because from where she came meaning she could be a different Yurine, and Otoha was great but they never explain that Otoha is from an incestuos realation between his father who is his older brother who fu**ed his mom, making him his brother-father, and this is not well explained but it's hinted in a weird way. Overall very good.EnjoymentI was really loving the 2D/3D combination, the fighting scenes, the story, the sound, the dark fantasy atmosphere, the badass characters, the plot twists, i wanted more from this but that won't happen, not even a manga to follow and that's sad, it was too short but it was an outstanding enjoyment. not in the first 2 eps. but it could be complicated for some people to follow what's going on with the story after that, but if you get to understand it right away like i did you will find that the story is great, there were unpredictable elements that may surprise you but in a seinen you expect everything to happen, there's a lot of fighting scenes and they are amazing, there are some sequences in the story that are not explained like, the final 10 seconds of the final episode, who is that? another antagonist? we'll never know because there's no manga to research who is that and that part made a room for a full 2nd season.

But the balance is being upset by the Mikura, demons who have taken physical form and must then kill to survive. Only Karas, the shadowy guardian crow of the city, can stop the Mikura and maintain the balance with the help of the mysterious Yurine. But the Mikura are being led by Eko, a former Karas who has turned his back on humanity and aims to destroy everything. Can Otoha, Yurine's newly recruited Karas, stop the renegade and his...forces, without drawing attention from the locals, police and others with their own agenda?This OVA (Original Video Animation to you non-otaku), is the 40th anniversary project of Tatsunoko Productions, the folks who gave us Speed Racer and Gatchaman (better known to Americans as &quot;Battle of the Planets&quot;). The show is very reminiscent of the latter, old style Japanese superhero shows from the '70s (think &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and you'll have an idea of what I mean). There's a hero who transforms into his powered-up persona with a special device, a mysterious guide/aide who knows more than she should, a badass villain with a small army of monsters/henchmen... the list goes on and on.There's even one fight scene where the monster uses the traditional &quot;faceless minions&quot; to slow the hero down. Basically, this is what you'd get if you watched a Power Rangers-type show without the editing for American audiences, with a bit more dark realism thrown in.The effort Tatsunoko put into this really shows, as its one of the best anime I've seen in a long time. The animation is a mix of 2-D and CGI animation, which really helps bring about some incredible visual effects and Matrix-style camera angles. This really helps the fight scenes, as Karas and the Mikura are done by CGI. Sure, you can tell the difference, but it still looks incredible. It goes to show how far we've come with using CGI in animation production, creating visuals that could never be done before with traditional animation.Action aside, there's plenty of drama and intrigue to be had, as well. There's Otoha as he wonders of his new role as Karas, Eko and his plans for the human and spirit worlds (not what you'd expect, trust me), the appearance of the mysterious Nue who has his own agenda, and the various humans whose lives have been affected by it all. The most affected we see are the two members of the Intervention Department of the Shinjuku Police, which handles supernatural-related cases.The two partners are rather Mulder and Scully-like in characteristics, with one believing in demons (with good reason for it) and the other, younger guy skeptical until he gets caught up in it. One even quotes the familiar tag-line from that series. There's also a girl, Hinaru, who had survived a Mikura attack and is trying to get on with her life.

The story seems to pick up in the middle of nowhere, I got what the idea was, but it just felt like I was watching an anime that was half ways through. The fights felt lackluster and overall the show just felt boring. The moment I finally said ""yeah I\'m done"" was when Karas turned into a friggin car and started shooting rockets....your armor...also turns into a car that shoots rockets? Ooookay then. Went from modern style medieval fantasy to scifi medieval fantasy. ', ""Karas is a six episode, original OVA  written by Yoshida Shin and brought to us by Tatsunoko. That's right, the same studio that brought us Kyattou Ninden Teyandee, SKET Dance & C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control. Karas was actually their 40th anniversary work, beginning release in 2005 and ending in '07. So, they must have put a lot of effort into it, right? Well, let's look and see.Story:There's an unseen world alongside ours. The world of youkai. Unseen, they live alongside us in relative peace, or they did. Youkai with physical bodies combined with machines are threatening the balance and...they're out for human blood. It's up to Yurine, the spirit of the city and her servant Karas, a being that's neither fully human nor youkai, to bring down these youkai and their leader. The former Karas, Eko.Let's start with the obvious story problem. We've seen basically this exact story before, a lot. And Karas doesn't really bring anything new to the table in terms of story telling or execution. Which results in a narrative that's very trite and predictable. Every time they introduce a plot point, you know where they're going to take it. That being said, I can give the series a little credit. They have creatures with a need to feed on blood and they actually think of using donated blood. The problem there is that it doesn't work and there's no reasonable explanation for why it doesn't.Characters:The characters in this are slightly atypical, at least, a few of them are. Otoha  is not your standard hero character. The Nue we spend a good chunk of time with is not a standard character. Eko, however, is a pretty generic villain. He's one of those “I'm going to destroy everything because the world is rotten” types of villains. His followers are pretty much the same henchmen that villain always has. The human characters are pretty boring.Art:This is  most definitely a series that favours style over substance. With the big spectacle action sequences being the best part of the series. The artwork and animation in general are really good with some very impressive visuals and a unique aesthetic presentation. Yeah, there's something in this series that actually stands out. However, you'd think they'd have done better with the final action sequence. The whole battle is like a formulaic JRPG boss fight where the big bad keeps revealing new forms only to have his actual final form be a  bit anti-climactic and the battle from there being just over way too fast.Sound:The voice acting is competent. Not brilliant or even particularly good, but perfectly passable. The music from Ike Yoshihiro, however, is really good. The action sequence music especially. It is intense and bad ass.Ho-yay:There might be a little when we find out about Otoha's past and the young man he almost ran away with.Final Thoughts:Karas isn't a bad series. It has some strong art, animation and music. That being said, it's not a good series either. The narrative itself is pretty weak, using ideas we've seen explored before and explored better and the characters are just average. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. It's an average series. If you just want to see a spectacle of action and neat visuals, you'll probably enjoy watching it but if you're more interested in seeing strong characters and a unique story, you probably won't be into it.

Next week I'm finally reviewing Ruroni Kenshin."", ""The first thing you need to do before reading this review is to decide if you are the type of person who doesn't mind CG meets traditional anime art. I know there are people who believe it's blasphemy, there are others who don't mind it and then there are those who absolutely love the intercourse between the two. I tend to lean towards the last.Assuming you don't mind, or love the CG/traditional mix Karas will rate highly on your list of anime. The first 5 minutes of the 1st episode will leave your jaw dropped on the floor. And it will be difficult to pick...it back up for a while. The characters are capable of morphing between space-fighters and iron-clad ninjas/samurai with superpowers like flashy virtual shields and duplicating swords. All the animation is superb; from the fight scenes to the hustling and bustling of the city.The characters are quite memorable, with good voice-acting and a distinct style of their own, which emphasizes their individualities. Even the body language is well attended to in order to instill character to everyone of the main personalities. This is not necessarily true when it comes to the city folk. Although the voice-acting is still quite good, the body language seems duplicated and indistinct.The story could have used a little tweaking and perhaps a less inconsistent pace, especially in comparison to the fight sequences. It felt, at times, like the story wanted to get somewhere but hesitated to do so. That made me restless at points. But then, as mentioned above, there were sudden phases where the pace picked up so quickly that it was almost difficult to keep up with what was going on. This unfortunately was also true with some of the fight scenes, where there was almost a little too much going on. Fortunately at the end I was left with a well-rounded idea of what had happened, why it had happened and how it climaxed to a very comfortable conclusion.Karas is a high energy, fast paced anime and at 6 episodes, it almost feels like it ends too soon. I was left wanting more, which was a testament to how much I enjoyed it. For a decent story-line, some high-octane action and gorgeous eye-candy, you cannot go wrong with Karas.

Enjoy!"", ""Karas is mostly style over substance. But it's the kind of style that very few anime can beat.The plot of the first movie (or the first three episodes, depending on which format you're watching) is left 100% in the dark. Bear with it. Enjoy the beautiful animation, the variety of characters, the amazing fight scenes. The second movie explains everything the first one failed to, giving you much-needed background information on top of even more amazing action. Because of this huge disparity in the pacing, it's the kind of anime that gets better and better the more you re-watch it.Even if you manage to somehow...disassociate yourself from the story and the characters, this is worth watching for the animation alone. Go for it. disassociate yourself from the story and the characters, this is worth watching for the animation alone. Go for it."", 'So a short series featuring a sort of adult orientated Power Rangers & the kind of storyline you\'d expect from WildStorm Comics. Yep, it\'s as fucking awesome as it sounds.So the story? What little there is (or I could understand, at least) was well...simple. There because it was the only way to push to the next fight scene without seeming like it had no substance at all. But pointless story is only there to waste time and make more money. So good on them for not including that! But if you came to this series (or movies depending on how you look at...it) expecting an amazing story then you\'re an idiot. However the devices it used were pretty cool. Setting up what would make an amazing universe if they ever decided to make more episodes (which they probably won\'t). However I did feel towards the end that they kinda confused themselves with their own story and decided to make stuff up to fill in the gaps. ""Isn\'t that what all storywriters do?!"" you ask. No, a storywriter is meant to work on a coherent flow, not just adding things that they deem necessary to make their mess make sense at the end. It just shows a lack of care or effort. I think much like their unregulated use of the time of the show they created, they didn\'t regulate their own time creating this either.Art? I actually wasn\'t a big fan of any of the CGI Sequences in this which is what I presume was the main spectacle and selling point for this (I don\'t know). It showed it\'s age and I found it slightly hard to follow. The complexity of the designs they created however was jaw dropping. The drawn animation though I thought was absolutely fantastic. Everything just screamed high budget long time dedication. It felt cartoony and realistic at the same time and the speed and flow made the non CGI fights the best in the whole thing for me. Too many animes come out lately with cut corners in the animation or terrible animation in general. If I wanted to see rushed still images I\'d read WSJ. It\'s nice to see something actually caring for it\'s animation, it IS anime. Such contrast to it\'s story...Sound? As always with me I never really have much to say here. I watched this in Japanese with Subs and as ever the Japanese and their voice acting is pure perfection. The music was subtly in the background but helped set the mood at the right moments. So I suppose perfection here then?  (I give nothing a straight 10.)Characters? I felt considering the length of this (about 3 hours) some characters were in it too much and some not enough. They were trying to cram too much in, but I still think they could have given everything decent amounts of screen time if they just regulated stuff better. About 3/4 of the first movie was wasted on small unimportant Machine Demons that seemed to be there to show off Karas and the CGI they made to animate him but they didn\'t really need to waste THAT much time on it, the fights weren\'t particularly epic. Karas was so much stronger than them the fights ended in basically one flamboyant attack. Although that flamboyant stuff was epic in itself. THEN they finally started moving onto the key, powerful characters (right at the END of the first movie annoyingly) and sadly it was pretty much left undisclosed what happened to most of them. If I knew more episodes to come I wouldn\'t be so harsh about this. But I think they were wasted.Enjoyment? MASSIVE! Even though this review possibly seemed quite negative I really did love this. I didn\'t know one on one fights in a city setting could be so grand!So overall? The CGI is a little weak now what 6 - 7 years have passed since the first 3 episodes were made (or the first movie, depending on how you look at it). But it\'s still pretty damn cool all the same, just a little hard to follow. The story is pretty much non existent and a lot of the cool characters are wasted. So really I should hate this, but in all honesty I still had so much fun & it being only 6 episodes meant nothing dragged. It was just epic and GAR after more epic and GAR! But I gave it this score simply because the flaws can\'t just be ignored because it was fun.

THEN they finally started moving onto the key, powerful characters (right at the END of the first movie annoyingly) and sadly it was pretty much left undisclosed what happened to most of them. If I knew more episodes to come I wouldn\'t be so harsh about this. But I think they were wasted.Enjoyment? MASSIVE! Even though this review possibly seemed quite negative I really did love this. I didn\'t know one on one fights in a city setting could be so grand!So overall? The CGI is a little weak now what 6 - 7 years have passed since the first 3 episodes were made (or the first movie, depending on how you look at it). But it\'s still pretty damn cool all the same, just a little hard to follow. The story is pretty much non existent and a lot of the cool characters are wasted. So really I should hate this, but in all honesty I still had so much fun & it being only 6 episodes meant nothing dragged. It was just epic and GAR after more epic and GAR! But I gave it this score simply because the flaws can\'t just be ignored because it was fun. But on enjoyment and fun alone this would get a 9 in my books.', ""Karas is one of those rare jems, which you don't fully appreciate until the second or third episode. The stunning artwork and visuals make themselves apparent immediately. The characters and their development is slow moving but not so slow that you lose interest. The story is really good, but very confusing at first. Just enjoy the beautiful art that this anime offers and let the story progress at it's own pace.Watch and enjoy. "", 'When most recommend a grown-up Anime to someone, they typically go for something along the lines of ""Death Note"" or ""FMA"" or ""Hellsing"" to graduate from a ""DBZ"" or ""Bleach"" or something like that. When I recommend a grown-up Anime to someone, I recommend ""Karas""""Karas"" combines a lot of popular aspects that people find appealing in adult oriented Anime. There\'s fighting and violence, interesting characters, some horror, some human drama, and a less than simple story. Add all of it up and you get a two-part series that has something for everyone. The fight scenes are the best thing about this series by a long...way. They stand up to any other series out there with a mix of sword play, dog fights, giant monsters, and flashy finishers.The art is very good with a top-notch soundtrack that succeeds in the difficult task of keeping up with the action on-screen. Sub vs. Dub is overall about even, but the English dub employs some mainstream names like Jay Hernandez, Piper Perabu, and an outstanding performance by Matthew Lillard as the series\' main villain.The big failure with ""Karas"" is the story telling. I have to admit, had I not watched the first part about 12 times on cable, I would not have understood enough to want to watch the second part for anything other than those bad-ass fight scenes. It\'s a pretty bad sign when you have to read the back of the tin to know what\'s going on- and even they don\'t seem to know! We manage to get some exposition in the 2nd part, but most would still be scratching their heads.All and all I would recommend this to any Anime fan, new or old. It\'s a lot of fun with some really memorable fight scenes. But if you want to enjoy the plot, re-watching is probably gonna be mandatory. Cheers! way.

The real problem with the story is that we just get into the middle of it. When the plot started, I felt like I missed 2 or 3 eps before it. That's why I give a 6 for this.Art:I have to tell this first, this anime has very computerish graphic. But it's amazingly beautiful. I don't really like animes with very computerish graphic, but Karas has one of the greatest animation I've ever seen in anime. From this aspect, Karas gets 10+++ from...me ^^Sound:I didn't really pay attention to this part. But from what I remember (and from the greatness of the opening and ending song) I rate this 8.Character:The characters are very nicely drawn, and most of the characters has very interesting plot, which is kinda rare in OVAs. The only thing I didn't really liked was that sometimes the way they drew the mouthes was a bit... strange.But this part gets 9 rate from me.Enjoyment:Aside from the confusing beginning of the story, I give this part 9, because I enjoyed every minute of this anime ^^Hmm...

Because this series was condensed into such a short time frame, these ova just dont get to the full potential it might have had with a classic 26 ep series.  Honestly i was just lost for the first few episodes until you finally get into the flow of the anime and just accept what is happening in each plot line try and piece everything together on your own. I would love to give a plot summary of this series but in all honesty...i dont think i could do a good job.5/10Art: Described in one word; Beautiful. I have not seen a series that can come close to matching karas.

Complicated in that there is quite a lot of side stories going on and simplistic in that the main plot exists only to link together extended action pieces. That being said I enjoyed the show a great deal, although I sometimes found myself more interested in the actions of side characters rather than the 2 central conflicting forces. This is mainly due to the fact that Eiko & Otoha are usually too busy fighting to talk much! As an action series this series excels but has...enough interesting characters to keep those who like a plot happy. I watched the 6 episode OVA version rather than the movie compilation version so don’t know how much they differ.ANIMATION: This is the 1st thing that strikes you about this show and is its main selling point IMO. This is a gorgeous piece visually – CGI is used perfectly in the action scenes, blending nicely with the 2D animation. The action scenes are beautifully choreographed and the backgrounds are rich and detailed. I loved the character designs too and there was so much blood!!MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: Voice acting was great, Karas has an excellent cast – although if I have one complaint its that some of the leads do not get nearly enough lines. The music is also top notch – a nicely put together score that highlights the action and drama set pieces perfectly.Overall Karas was a good show – it loses a few points for being a bit confusing at times and lacking in development for the main characters as well as having a pretty generic villain. enough interesting characters to keep those who like a plot happy.

When looking at the art for the series you can really see why it had taken them 2 years to finish this OVA. The art is beautiful and so is the music to each episode. I found the music to be quite the touch a scene needed to really impact the story. However that's where my compliments to this series end. At times the blend between 2D and 3D felt jarring and brought me out of the story(though this may be...due to being an artist for a living). I found the over all plot to be way too confusing and feel it would've been better told in a 12 episode series over 6. Everything felt rushed and didn't give me proper time to built up and allow me to get invested in the series. The characters all felt very bland besides the older detective, and at times the other characters came off emotionless compared to him. I feel I would've enjoyed this series more if it was longer so it gave us more time to get to know the characters.

COOL!This was one of those video-games turn anime. My friend told me about the game (hard-core gamer, most of the VG Animes I have or will watch will probably be by his recomendation) and how awesome Karas was and told me about his OC that he based visually off of Karas so I decided that I had to see this. It didn't disappoint.It would be outside my abilities to competantly praise this anime. The artwork was 1st rate, the music was calm when neccesary and vice versa with the suspence. The characters seem to have this ordinary feel about them but all in all,...they come off very intersting as they interact with the supernatural situations unraveling around them.The story was, at some times, hard for me personally to follow but maybe that's because I didn't play the game. As far as I understand, this was a continuation of the game so I may never know the full story unless they have a manga. However, as it carries along, it becomes easier to understand and the fight scenes are so fast and cool and bada**. From what I could get, a Karas is a protecter of a city; he/she is the barrier between the human reality and the invisible youkai (supernatural creatures of Japanese folklore) living hidden in plain sight among them.  But since humans believe less and less in youkai, they're disappearing. Because of this growing phenomenon, the former protecter of the setting city wants to destroy it and pruge it of the 'disease of humans'. The youkai realize that this is not in their favor since thay need the humans to survive and that he uses the lives of other youkai to achieve his goals. So they all fall to the new Karas to save them and the humans and he doesn't diappoint.The anime is already somewhat dark but it leaps into blackness as the climax comes. It's very graphic and when someone is getting sliced to shreds, they not only don't hide it but they give us 1st rate animation to show it even delving into the use of 3Dimensional characters.

Inu x Boku SS,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11013/Inu_x_Boku_SS,"[""A teenage girl struggling with her interpersonal skills; a loyal man struggling with his intrapersonal skills. Inu x Boku SS tells of the tale involving these two troubled persons. Over time, it is inevitable that one will change depending on his/her surroundings. The influences that come from peers and others are undoubtedly strong. To be able to thrive in such environments, one must be able to filter these influences and only be changed by those which they feel will benefit them. In the end, it is always others that do the shaping; one cannot merely wish to be transformed and have it happen. Whether these...changes are good or bad is a whole different story.Art (8/10)Soothing and calming visuals are few and far between. The light colors, the soft lighting, the detailed facial expressions of the characters - all these make for great artwork. Throw in some chibi drawings of the characters during the comedic scenes and the varying art styles are sure to impress viewers. Even the sparkles which are popular (and often overused) in shōjo anime/manga were moderated such that they didn't feel overwhelming. On the shōnen side of things, the handful of battle scenes and transformations were animated smoothly as far as I could tell.Characters (8/10)First off, the supporting characters of the series, though unique and interesting, were a bit underdeveloped. However, the extensive character development of the two main characters made up for this. At first, the female protagonist, Shirakiin Ririchiyo, is your typical, sharp-tongued teenage girl who often unintentionally isolates herself from others. But as the series progresses, she slowly opens the door to her heart, accepting the warmth of those around her while trying to control her tongue. On the other hand, the male protagonist, Miketsukami Sōshi, is a self-despising and deceptive man who knows nothing about emotion and feelings. But, similar to Ririchiyo, he too changes drastically throughout the series. What's most heartwarming is that the two, although having totally different personalities, are actually the ones responsible for each other's development. Ririchiyo shows Sōshi the meaning of emotion and feelings while he proves to her that he will be by her side, no matter what, even if it means being verbally abused. Along with the other characters, the two end up transforming each other for the better, resulting in two solid characters.Sound (8/10)The strong point of this category is the elite cast of seiyūs that were part of the project. All of them did an excellent job in their respective roles, with no character having an unfitting voice. The OP was quite good as well - a fast-paced song with gradual progression in pitch. The downside of having multiple EDs is that only the good ones will be memorable. However, the ones used in this series were more or less unique so, even though they weren't exactly excellent material, they were somewhat memorable. BGM did its job well, with some of the pieces successfully standing tall on their own during dialogue-less scenes, while others set the mood well.Story (6/10)To put it bluntly, for the most part, the story was boring. Save for the first and last few episodes, the pace of one manga chapter per episode caused the story to be dragged out longer than necessary. Furthermore, the anime original fillers were fairly poor in terms of entertainment value. The first couple of episodes were tolerable given that they were used to introduce the characters and the plot. In the last couple of episodes is where the plot actually picks up from the first few episodes. Those two episodes alone would make for an easy 9/10 as they were both interesting and content-filled. However, with more bad than good, the story gets a 6/10 from me.Overall (7/10)Having read the manga prior to watching the anime, I can say that this was a faithful adaption with a couple of original episodes added in. I indulged more in the characters than in the story for the most part which, although not necessarily a bad thing, is slightly disappointing. To be honest, I wasn't quite satisfied with Inu x Boku SS. I felt like it could've been better if more chapters were to have been adapted. With that being said, the possibility of a season two, which I will anxiously wait for, is moderately high given the decent popularity of the show and the remaining non-animated source material.

At the end of finishing this series, I still am unsure what this series qualify as. Inu x boku was supposedly a comedy story incorporating some supernatural and mysterious themes. However, it seems like the director changed their mind during the middle of the series.The main plot follows around a young woman named Ririchiyo. Basically, she\'s a very delicate person, so delicate and shy that she can barely express herself. In fact, to the point where she almost expresses the opposite of...what she means every time. Thus, she has no friends at school. But then one day she moves to a new environment where her lifestyle is replaced by supernatural beings. But that\'s all there really is ""supernatural"" about this series. Besides just the characters, nothing is distinctively different about inu x boku, than if you compare it to a cheesy school drama. Also, it can barely qualify as a \xa0mystery because no suspense was really built throughout the series. This series was very slow paced in this aspect.The characters were the only unique part of this series. Ririchiyo along with some supporting characters have some very interesting conversations. And, with Ririchiyo\'s personality, it just makes it so much more fun to watch. The comedy included in the show was based mostly on the stupid conversations, thoughts, fantasies, or actions some character started. It will fit the taste of basically anyone with a sense of humor. But don\'t be fooled! There really is only one character development in this series. His name is soushi, and a servant of Ririchyo""sama.""Not very much is known about soushi except that he has a strange attraction to his master until the very last few episodes, and that is why I think the characters turned out a lot worse than they could of. This goes back to my point about the series being seriously paced; therefore making it an anime not everyone will like. But this anime is 12 episodes so it\'s not a big deal.The artistic aspect of this series was probably the strongest. The producer made the characters with very cute designs, thus making the audience more connected to the characters. The delicacy put into Ririchiyo almost made it express her personality better. The music put into this anime was worth some efforts, and could be very favorable. But what I liked most about it was that they played it during some of the most appropriate scenes and it complemented very well.The results of inu x boku was definitely unexpected than what it seems to be on the surface. Although not what I expected, which was a mysterious drama about the supernatural of some sort. This series still impressed me in the end concluding with a relationship I did not think would blossom in just one season. However, it was still very slow paced for that one season. So if you\'re looking for an anime with character developments, you may or may not like it.I will end it in this paragraph and keep this review short and clean. Because that\'s what this anime really was, a short and innocent story about our kind Ririchiyo and her adventure with her air-headed friends in the Ayakashi mansion. To be precise, that\'s exactly how this anime played out until the last few episodes, then it\'s all out surprises. If you\'re going to watch this series, do keep in mind the old cliched saying ""never judge a book until you\'re done reading the whole thing."" But if inu x boku really was a book then I\'m pretty sure it could be described as one of those trending books that becomes famous after its first publish, soon to be forgotten as the decade carries on. what she means every time. Thus, she has no friends at school. But then one day she moves to a new environment where her lifestyle is replaced by supernatural beings.

This series still impressed me in the end concluding with a relationship I did not think would blossom in just one season. However, it was still very slow paced for that one season. So if you\'re looking for an anime with character developments, you may or may not like it.I will end it in this paragraph and keep this review short and clean. Because that\'s what this anime really was, a short and innocent story about our kind Ririchiyo and her adventure with her air-headed friends in the Ayakashi mansion. To be precise, that\'s exactly how this anime played out until the last few episodes, then it\'s all out surprises. If you\'re going to watch this series, do keep in mind the old cliched saying ""never judge a book until you\'re done reading the whole thing."" But if inu x boku really was a book then I\'m pretty sure it could be described as one of those trending books that becomes famous after its first publish, soon to be forgotten as the decade carries on.', 'Does a very good job on sticking with the manga. Luckily the manga is ahead so for those like me who have read the manga way before the anime was released you know how things turn out and you can focus on the artwork and seeing your favorite characters in motion :3Story: There really isn\'t a ""story"" per se. The manga is slowly picking up but as you can see from the first 11(?) episodes released currently it\'s mostly the main (what? 6-7 characters?) conversing with each other and little things between Ririchyo and Soushi. 7/10Art: Very Nice. Nice style to it. 10/10Sound: The OP...is beast. It just goes so well with the animation. If you don\'t understand then read/watch the show/manga and then re-watch the OP and tell me if you understand how it flows so well with the animation. 10/10Character: The characters are nice. Loyal bodyguard who has a past with the protagonist, tsundere protagonist, friends, etc etc. Everyone is suprisingly nice. There are times when certain people seem like ""antagonists"" but there really is no ""bad guy"". 10/10Enjoyment: It\'s a light refreshing series to watch. I high ly recommend reading the manga thought since it has the anime + more. 10/10Enjoy :) see you in my next reviewEdit: Apparently me stating that this review was created at the time of the eleventh episode, the fact that I put ""12 out of 12"" for the MAL version of when I wrote this is bothering certain people. I understand completely what these people are complaining about. Why should I be limited to 12 out 12? Why not give me 20+ out of 12. I have knowledge on the manga which surpasses the limits of the animes episodes. Therefore 12+ is all free game as stated above. It doesn\'t matter what happens in episode 12 or 50 for that matter. That\'s like reviewing a restaurant that you\'ve been to before anyone else had the chance. I\'m allowed to review it however I want.

The story was good, but from what i read from the manga difference, it could have been outstanding and thought ''why didn't they adapted the things like that?'' tho i didn't change my score on the story because of that, it's just that it was just good for a supernatural rom-com, nothing new to see but keeps you entertained, overall was good.Art & AnimationThe art style and animations were very well made, nothing much to say, i liked it and felt it was very good.SoundThe music was great, the background music matched the moments and were really enjoyable, the VA and the OP were great, there are different ED and all of the were really good, specially the one from Ep. 5, that one was hilarious, overall was very good.CharacterThe character development was good, they were really memorable even tho they have weird names you can remember their personalities and all of them were funny and interesting.-Soushi could seem the typical guy who is in love or tries to be the kindest guy with the girls but he's not, and sometimes maybe you feel he's too kind for your blood to handle but that kindness is presented with comedy and it was ok and i was surprised but kinda expected his back story.-Chiyo was really good and you can feel the chemistry between Soushi and Chiyo.-Karuta for some reason was adorable.-Natsume is funny whenever he talks.-Rensho was damn hilarious and the music they put on him everytime he transforms made it even funnier.-Kagerou was funny with his S and M division of things, and the support characters with their little on screen time were funny too, but it wasn't perfect and it showed at times, overall is good.EnjoymentI have to state that the comedy is a strong point in the anime for you to enjoy it and the romance was satisfaying even tho it's almost at the end, not to mention the music and characters made it more enjoyable; It has flaws and if you have read the manga obviosly you won't like it because the story has a lot of changes for the anime to be more happy, the ending was good and i wanted to see more after seeing their dialogues, the OVA is really great, go watch it too, overall the enjoyment was very good. she can't remember and that's where their relationship could seem close but it's distant at the same time.

That being said after having not a lot to watch i gave it ago.Story 7The concept itself was ok, nothing special, your typical romcom anime. The story had a slow start, i didn\'t feel particularly pulled into the story until about episode 11 where Miketsukami past was revealed the episodes inbetween i...felt was purely fan service and it was there to make viewers laugh, and believe me it did =D. The ending i thought was pretty nice, although it did feel a bit rushed but it was quite heartwarming and im sure romance viewers will like it. But one thing that annoyed me was that episodes 3-10 was basically just introducing a bunch of characters, and Shirakiin being all like ""Oh i need to repay and thank Miketsukami"" and when it did happen Miketsukami was all like ""I don\'t deserve your thanks""... what the fuck is up with that just accept her appreciationArt 7The art in this wasn\'t bad for an anime that came out in 2012 its to be expected, i quite like some of the character design, Miketsukami fox form is pretty cool, so is Shirakiin\'s demon form or w/e she looked pretty kawaii. I absolutely Love the character design for Zange chan the bunny ears just works so god damn well, completely suits his personality and really draws out the comical moments from him. Renshou demon form is pretty jokes, his scroll look is pretty funny and provides quite a lot of priceless moments in the anime.Sound 6The OST wasn\'t anything special, although this isn\'t exactly an anime that really focuses on music, Each character had an opening and ending, which is pretty cool in my opinion, some of the voice actors was pretty good, Zange chan, Shirakiin\'s voice actor worked pretty well and really suited them. But this anime isn\'t really focused on the sound its more about the comedy it provides.Character 7There was a wide variety of different characters each with a personality that made this anime pretty funny, Shirakiin with her bad habit of being rude to others led to some rather comical moments, that coupled with Miketsukami, who is totally in love with her is quite funny. I loved the bits when she calls him a dog and he basically acts like one =P. I Love Zange chan personality, that sarcastic attitude yet trying to act nice and innocent is pretty jokes, and his ""Love"" is way to over the top, man his love for Miketsukami is jokes. Even though i like all the characters in Inu X Boku SS it seems that there is a major lack of character development, not much is said about some of the characters past, and there doesn\'t seem to be a lot of character development between some of the side characters and Shirakiin for example her relationship with Nobara isn\'t very developed considering shes one of the first side character Shirakiin meets. It seems that the only 2 character that got the most attention was Shirakiin and Miketsukami but i guess they are the main characters, the romance between them was pretty nice as well, i would\'ve liked to see more about zange chan and the others, especially Sorinozuka and his past.Enjoyment 8This anime, is one of those ones which is just filled with comical scenes with the slight serious scenes the only really serious episodes was after 11. I quite enjoyed it interms of i was laughing quite a lot, even though most of the jokes seems to be based around the same thing taking the piss out of Banri, or Shirakiin\'s bad habit even though its so repetitive i cant help but still laugh =D, Miketsukami\'s love for Shirakiin or Nobara\'s pervertedness is just hilarious and will surely make you laugh your head off.Overall 7Overall it was an ok anime it\'s your typical comedy romance anime, where its filled with loads of comedy and then right at the end it hits you with romance. I personally quite liked the plot of the story but there wasn\'t really much development of the main story which is the problem i found with this anime =/.

If you want to watch an anime that\'ll make you laugh your head off, then Inu x Boku SS is definitely something for you.', ""Inu x Boku SS or what others may refer to as - Dog and Me.Adapted by the manga Inu x Boku SS. It′s not too long ago when I read the manga, but when I found out that there will be an anime, I thought of trying to watch it until it comes out. Honestly, it made me a little bit impatient. Because I really wanna see the animated version sooner.And of course, my hopes didn′t let me down. As I thought, the animated version is great and much like-able.If you are reading the manga, and currently at the latest chapter. You might be impatient...in waiting for the latest episodes of the anime to come out, why? It′s easy. It′s because of the scenes in the manga which is really making the anime fans (of InuBoku) to be impatient, they would want the scenes in the manga to be animated faster; and I am one of them.- Inu x Boku SS isn′t an anime that′s out-of-the-ordinary. It′s just like some Supernatural anime, but with a bit of Romance and light comedy (just a really light comedy). Living in a apartment complex, in which you have neighbors, who are not what you would call 'normal'. Instead, you have neighbors who is a demon, a nine-tailed fox, a giant skeleton and a whatnot. That′s a new pace for some watchers.But I think that it′s mainstream -- no?The story start′s of at a flashback, yes, flashback. I must say that these flashbacks which starts the story is really good. It makes you understand the story more and tell what′s the cause or reason of the problem. Flashbacks are kind of annoying, especially if it doesn′t have a connection or whatsoever from the episode of the storyline. But in InuBoku, it has a connection from the story, related to a past of the character.- InuBoku′s animation or art is rather light and soft. It′s not very unique, nor plain. But the art is just normal. The characters are really well-drawn, especially the guys or the bishounens. And the girls are cute too. It does have some flaws in it, but I can′t just point out where. Sometimes, the characters are drawn as chibis, when they are performing a light joke/comedy on-screen. Mostly, Ririchiyo′s the one who is drawn as chibi.The coloring fits perfectly to the characters, what I meant to say was, the hair color of the characters and other body parts which is easily seen. What catches your attention the most, that is.- InuBoku′s opening themes and ending themes were .. I don′t know what to say. I don′t really pay attention to the opening songs that much. Most likely, I just skip them. But I have heard a bit of the opening theme. It gives you a rock-theme feeling. I guess it doesn′t fit InuBoku at all, does it?- Here we have the not-admitting-it, the loyal one, the taciturn one, the pervert one, the sadist, the bad boy, the masochist one (?!), the brother-like one, and maybe a mix of everything and anything. The characters of InuBoku are all great, each and every one are most likely introduced, but not in a character introduction way. They really made quite an amusing set of characters here, all living in the same apartment complex, and of course, all of them are not normal. All of them have supernatural powers.They transform whenever it is needed, or by saving their masters, or people whom they serve.- InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, even though some of you might not like it, why not give it a go? I believe that it′ll improve and be more exciting in the following episodes. I agree that InuBoku is not an out-of-the-ordinary kind of anime, the story is not that unique either, it′s quite mainstream. But give it a little credit, why not watch it ′till it satisfies your enjoyment? Every now and then, all of us anime watchers should move on to a new pace. Having a rule like - I won′t watch an anime that is boring; yes, I agree, even though some anime are boring and a crap, you still need to give it a go and give it a little credit. It might not meet your expectation, but whatever.All in all, InuBoku is an enjoyable anime, though I′m looking forward into more excitement on the upcoming episodes.Please comment on my profile, whether you found this review Helpful of Not.

Thank you :D"", 'Re reviewInu X Boku SS-- ( Dog and Me) The story of this anime is about The Shirakiin house\'s daughter, Shirakiin Riricho, who has issues with her rich family as she is unable to do things on her own free will. Also with friends at her school too. I have this feeling her past will catch up to her.  She decides to break away from her family and life. In order for her to live independently she lives in this mansion ""Ayakashi Kan"" (House of Spirit/Demons/Ghosts/Youkai) where she meets her SS-Secret Service Miketsukami, Soushi who is her servant, guard etc. She rejects the SS...and him but i have feeling she\'\'s change along the way. Other members of this mansion live here and have their own personal SS. But this mansion houses"" people"" with special abilities/powers.

Looking forward for more episodes.', 'So, when I watched the last - and completely unnecessary to the plot- episode of this series, my reaction was not: ""Ooown, how cute!!!"" , nor: ""This is an amazing anime!!!""It was literally:""Wait, that\'s it?""I think that pretty much describes my experience with it, if you\'re not up to reading the entire review.Story: 5Maison de Ayakashi is this super elite mansion with wealthy kids that happen to be descendants from monsters from Japanese Culture.Not only that, but they also have one secret service assigned to each resident, for their protection and stuff.What may seem like a promising idea to explore Oriental Mythology...with some good dosis of action and adventure, turned into a mushy romance between this one girl who was socially awkward(Ririchiyo) and her rather ""stalky"" obsessive and submissive secret service agent(Miketsukami).The whole time I kept expecting some surpring twist that would actually make it… interesting.You sai t floating in between genres, comedy, romance, drama, mistery and supernatural, but it didn’t actully defined itself in the end, it was like watching someone trying to do 5 things at a time. Eventually it will go wrong.It’s not bad, I mean, is a bit of a cliché, and that really makes it a tad disappointing.Art: 7Okay, I gotta admit I love the character design, and the whole ambience of the anime was well captured.  The “alternate”/monster forms where rather cool and the sceneries where really appealing to look at.Characters: 6No matter how Much I love characters with proper background stories, in this case you had polar opposites. While the Ririchiyo told us almost her entire childhood, you really end the anime knowing practically nothing about the remaining characters, that are given the same importance – i level of story line – as the chairs and teacups used in the breakfast scenes. They can be kinda funny but that\'s their main purpose – besides the absurd ammount of fan service you get with the female characters.Sound: 8I’m givin’ it na 8 just because of all the different endings, that where not only original, but also entertaining.Overall I give it a 6It\'s not terrible, you can watch it at a saturday night when you\'re bored, but it’s not one of those titles that I would recommend watching, because honestly it wouldn\'t even occur to me, as all in all the story is kinda forgettable when in comparison with other animes in all the genres this one tried to be. with some good dosis of action and adventure, turned into a mushy romance between this one girl who was socially awkward(Ririchiyo) and her rather ""stalky"" obsessive and submissive secret service agent(Miketsukami).The whole time I kept expecting some surpring twist that would actually make it… interesting.You sai t floating in between genres, comedy, romance, drama, mistery and supernatural, but it didn’t actully defined itself in the end, it was like watching someone trying to do 5 things at a time.

Yoko Hikasa, Aki Toyosaki, and Kana Hanazawa were cast in it2. Ririchiyo Shirakiin looked cute3. The picture I saw hinted at romanceI liked how the animation style switched between normal and chibi to make the funny moments even funnier.  The story was mostly fun and light-hearted and was not about fighting like I was expecting.  They only had to fight three or four times and they were not that serious.  The story did not have that many screwed up events in it.  The worst one concerned Miketsukami but...it wasn\'t as bad as other good shows I\'ve seen.  (Gosick had worse for example)This anime pushed all of my buttons.  It was cute.  There was romance.  There was just the right amount of sex appeal, which was centered around Ririchiyo Shirakiin\'s cleavage and was sprinkled with Nobara being a creeper and Chino\'s chest.The character designs were excellent.  I loved how unique and sometimes stupid, in terms of fighting ability and functionality, their transformations were.My favorite characters were Ririchiyo, Karuta, and Chino.  I see myself in Ririchiyo Shirakiin but instead of doing that annoying, uptight ""humph"" before every conversation, I don\'t say anything.  We both have trouble saying what we mean and are honest when we write.I like Karuta Roromiya because of her voice and her love of food.  Her throwback form is unexpected and awesome.I hated and liked Kagerou at the same time.  I hated him for the type of person he was but liked and laughed so hard at him because of how he flaunted it.  I\'ve wondered what it would be like to be classified by him.  I have an idea of what he would say...Chino was so cute.  She acted cute, her other form was so cute, and I could hear and see Yui.The other workers at Maison de Ayakashi are diverse and funny.I usually don\'t like songs sung by guys but the opening song, Nirvana by MUCC, is good.  Most of the ending songs are awesome, especially sweets parade.  SM Hantei Forum made me laugh so hard.The ending made me so happy because I enjoy a good romance and it left the story wide open for development.  Out of the dozen shows I followed this season, Inu x Boku SS is my favorite.  Season 2 Please. it wasn\'t as bad as other good shows I\'ve seen.

I hated him for the type of person he was but liked and laughed so hard at him because of how he flaunted it.  I\'ve wondered what it would be like to be classified by him.  I have an idea of what he would say...Chino was so cute.  She acted cute, her other form was so cute, and I could hear and see Yui.The other workers at Maison de Ayakashi are diverse and funny.I usually don\'t like songs sung by guys but the opening song, Nirvana by MUCC, is good.  Most of the ending songs are awesome, especially sweets parade.  SM Hantei Forum made me laugh so hard.The ending made me so happy because I enjoy a good romance and it left the story wide open for development.  Out of the dozen shows I followed this season, Inu x Boku SS is my favorite.  Season 2 Please.', ""This anime 'Inu Boku SS' seems to point to 'Dog and me secret service', but, it isn't the literal meaning of course, that would be a bit boring unless you had some super cool dogs! anyway.The story is based on a girl named Ririchiyo who lacks social skills and can never say what she really thinks. The Fox Spirit, Miketsukami Soushi is her secret service agent and pledges his life to protect her. In the beginning you feel like there is an underlying story behind his commitment or a reason for his attitude towards his job.Even though she is projected, I feel that the main...character is Soushi, as he commands a certain presence in this anime that drags attention to him. Even if the anime focuses on her problems and how she evolves to make friends, it is really his character that it interesting.After finding out about him, it is like that we would go back and watch the series again, just to find out where he gives cues about his life and his reasons.It goes a bit slow when it focuses on her;  and then heats up near the absolute end only because you want to know what will happen!!Overall, I liked the anime as the ending was sort of expected but, the end scene was a bit cliche I feel. Anyway, the art of all the transformed ayakashis are really good!!! Love the little horns on Rirchiyos head :PNot too much action though, sort of wished there was a fight where we couldn't decide who would win! well, that was there but it ended unexpectedly.Anyway, enjoy and pay attention through out the anime for little hints ;) character is Soushi, as he commands a certain presence in this anime that drags attention to him.

I thought it was very sweet and enjoyable, and I really really liked it.Story:While the story was not an overarching plot-line, nor was it extremely deep, it was very enjoyable.  This series was more of a rom-com than anything else, but it definitely had some drama to it, and the supernatural aspect of it actually worked to enhance the story overall.Art:Nothing special or extraordinary in the art department, but the series had beautiful, bright colors, and the characters were unique and beautifully drawn.  The art...is a teeny bit ""bishie"" but it works quite well, no complaints here.(as a side note, while there isn\'t a TON of fan service, there are definitely a few scenes that are NSFW)Sound:The soundtrack wasn\'t too memorable, but there were a few pieces that were beautiful and added to certain scenes.Character:This is where the series really shone for me.  I was able to connect and related to Ririchiyo and her social awkwardness and inability to connect with people due to a dark childhood.  Miketsukami on the other hand is a bit harder to get a read on at first.  He seems slightly perverted and is definitely obsessed with Ririchiyo, but we don\'t really know why until the last few episodes.  But you can\'t help but like him and have a soft spot for his kindness towards Ririchiyo.  By the end of the series the character development is phenomenal (especially for Ririchiyo).  I ended up loving both Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, and the side characters are lovely and memorable as well.  The side characters have a ton of diversity as well: there is a Trans character, two gay characters, and lots of different family situations, which is very impressive and definitely added to my enjoyment.Overall:Overall I enjoyed this series a lot.

I really don\'t know, something entertaining at the very least? Unfortunately, Inu x Boku is nothing of the sort, just an episodic hodgepodge of random scenarios with little-to-no overarching plot. I\'m actually not sure what this was supposed to be. A romance? If so, it certainly lacked progression until the very end. A comedy? Well, it didn\'t really make me laugh very much, which I admit, is somewhat subjective, but the humor didn\'t work for me, outside of a few characters or episodes. Supernatural? I guess it had supernatural elements. Honestly, those were...the highlight of the show, but the supernatural powers got so little focus that they may as well have been just a plot device.Artistically, Inu x Boku is going to blow absolutely nobody away. It\'s rather basic in every way and is starting to look a little dated as the years pass. That\'s not to say it\'s not acceptable, but it may look really old in a few years. The big win for Inu x Boku was the songs. I really liked the opening and the changing endings, it added an air of personality to each episode, which was refreshing. Outside of those things, nothing about Inu x Boku is a technical marvel, it\'s only acceptable at best.Favorite Character: Kagerou ShoukiinI was a hair away from saying that Karuta was my favorite, but I had to give it to my S&M dude.

I aspire to go around labeling things as sadistic or masochistic now because of him.To be clear, I did like some of the cast, even if it\'s not as many of them as I would have liked. Sorinozuka, or the scroll dude, was really funny as well, especially with his interactions with Nobara, his perverted, lesbian secret service agent. Nobara in general was a hilarious character. However, I cannot say that I loved the main two characters very much. They kind of felt as if someone was like, ""Hey, we have these two pieces of cardboard for main characters, so let\'s give them a personality."" and then they decided to make one piece of cardboard a self-pitying loli tsundere and the other an overly attached stalker. I felt zero connection to either of them throughout the entire series. Not once did I feel anything other than boredom when they came onto the screen. If you\'ve followed my reviewing at all, you know I\'m a huge shipper and this show didn\'t even make me bother with shipping characters, because they were so mediocre outside of a select few.I don\'t even know if I\'m disappointed by Inu x Boku or just relieved to be done with it. To make a confession, I was kind of half asleep for the last 3-4 episodes, if not even longer, so I may have missed out on the best the show had to offer.

This anime was good overall. It isn't a ground breaking anime by any means but its just a lighthearted romance comedy. The female protagonist is pretty chill even though i hate tsunderes in general. What got me is the male protagonist. I hated his personality so much. He was creepy to the max. I know they tried to make his creepiness funny, but idk. It just didn't work for me. The age gap wasn't helping either. ACT YOUR AGE! Sometimes i just...wanted elbow him in the throat. His back story explains why he's that way but come on bruh!  The other characters were cool and funny which really made the anime enjoyable to me. The art was pleasing to the eyes. I think the art was the best part about this anime.

I watched the first half and told myself, another anime that has useless character interaction that means nothing to the actual story.  However I am glad that I stuck with it.  The second half of the anime proved to be worth it as a love triangle ensued.  Ririchiyo came to a new school that was for the supernatural.  She ended up getting a butler or a contracted helper named Soushi that pronounced his undying loyalty to her.  After some time they form a special bond based off of their past and realize...they have a lot more in common than they thought.

So it can be relative by a huge margin.But I digress, both were interesting enough, the story has its rythm, slowly expanding, developing and introducing new characters, and the art supported the anime very well. The OP is beautiful,...if a character needs to be portraited in a certain way, make the viewer believe in those emotions, it got it across overall quite well. A plus for the cute moments, I really enjoyed those alot, if the art sucked, it would had diminuished the enjoyment greatly.I also want to mention that while I felt satisfied with the story conclusion\'s, it felt a bit rushed in the latter parts of the last episode.And episode 11 by far was the best episode, in terms of storytelling, it gave some much needed feedback Soushi, and I was honestly touched with its story. It gave the needed development for a character, better than I though it would give.Nothing special for the sound, but the OP song is great, plus having more than 5 EDs for different episodes, that fit in nature with the content previously showed, was a good idea, and makes waiting and watching the ED more meaningfull.I said the anime was a bit excentric. The reason is due to the cast.The 2 main characters (aka MCs) are Ririchiyo and Soushi.I came to enjoy alot Ririchiyo personality, she main she too lofty at first, but that is due to her difficulty in how to approuch other people, and in fact she is a very caring, cute and kind person, despite her harsh tongue, she is a very sensitive and shy person. One of the pleasures of the anime, was seeing her develop, grown closer to others, and of course, those cute moments! Ririchiyo you soo kawaii~~For the other MC, finding for yourself would be better, but I was plenty surprised. Better than I expected for sure (reference to episode 11 again).But it is the great variety and amount of supportive cast that makes the anime so excentric, in a good way, I pretend to make it short, so you get a guy who classifies everything as either masochism or sadism, likes to put a spikey collar on his SS agent, a girl that seems emotionless, but is actually very kind and attentive person. A deliquent who keeps affirm himseld to be as so, but is probably one of the more fragile and generous persons in the anime, a guy that hears rabbit ears, and has a ""naughty"" personality, these are the main supportive cast, but I could go a bit further, with other personas, everyone adds something to the anime. On paper they may seem generic, but it really works well and is refreshing, and the whole cast is animated and interacts with each other.May enjoyment depends greatly of the characters, I would say it got even better the last episodes, with some great laughs and more emotive scenes, but looking back, there were plentyful of scenes that were very enjoyful and meaningful.But again, my enjoyment got a higher grade with episode 11, something that was left empty, finally was put into its proper place, thus the whole picture started to make more sense.I found myself liking the anime more after it ended, than when I was at the middle term of it.If I were to give the show a score, it would be a 8.4, but I do think it is more important to read the text with why you may come to enjoy the anime, so for a TL;DR, focus more on what is below, than the rating itself.OverallIt is a romcom, more excentric than usual, the cast is very interesting, dont expect much from the story, there are some cute moments, that will leave you all cozy and happy, there is romance, but IMO the latter part of the segment was a bit rushed, nothing that affected the overall experience thought.If you look to have a fun time, with something more meaningfull than some shitty romcoms, give the show a try, dont expect alot of action or amazing plot development, but something with its charm and originality that will graduality keep your enjoyment, with some minor twists here and there. Besides that just ignore the controversial aspect of the MC relationship (wait for episode 11 for the most of it), and have a good time. if a character needs to be portraited in a certain way, make the viewer believe in those emotions, it got it across overall quite well.

However Inu x Boku manages to keep them apart which means the viewer can enjoy both the seriousness of the romance and the laughter separately. Furthermore the action scenes, while few and far between, are used to help drive the romance at key moments. Just don’t expect flashy fight scenes.The characters are all fairly individual...and none are alike and often appear to be opposite to what they first seem to be. Also they all provide their own different comedy moments with their personalities and characteristics which are so varied that there really should be something for everybody.To conclude, this anime does have a familiar romance plot however it goes about delivering that in an unusual way which is interesting and refreshing. The characters are likable and will grow on you even if your first impressions of them weren't fantastic. It’s an anime that will leave you thinking about it for days after you have finished with it. and none are alike and often appear to be opposite to what they first seem to be.

There's no doubt that people of such demographic I've mentioned above will not be able to get enough of shitty comedy gags presented in this anime. The 10% of significant plot screen time will just be the icing on the cake.Plot:The story is nothing you haven't seen before (granted you're somewhat an...experienced anime viewer). Two people searching for someone to help understand themselves due to their cruel circumstances in the past caused by strict family traditions with a mix of Japanese folklore.Cast:Characters are fun and diverse, but the poor choice of gags render them insignificant and dull.Art/Animation:Animation is fluid, and the art quality is pretty much what you would expect in anime these days.Sound:Voice acting is fine. OP and ED songs are crappy to mediocre depending on your music taste, though there's one INS song I liked.Overall:In my opnion, this anime should have been a short 3-4 OVAs to maximize the romance aspect and not not be ruined by 10 episodes of crappy redundant comedy.So, I'd suggest you watch 1-3 episodes first and see if you agree with my feelings toward the comedy aspect of the show.

In turn, I loved the characters more and more the more I watched the anime.Even if you want the characters to be the same age in an anime, I...would suggest trying to imagine they\'re ""similar"" in age, which is hard to do considering the Ririchiyo is 15 and Miketsukami is 23.The only thing I disliked was the plot was very easy going with little to no action: the main plot is about finding out the backgrounds of each character. would suggest trying to imagine they\'re ""similar"" in age, which is hard to do considering the Ririchiyo is 15 and Miketsukami is 23.The only thing I disliked was the plot was very easy going with little to no action: the main plot is about finding out the backgrounds of each character.', ""Once in a while a nice romance is always satisfying to find. The art is well done with a lot of detail and the characters are different from one another. The complete differences in personality is an interesting attraction to the other characters. Other than the very slight progression between the two main characters, there isn't much to the plot. The story goes slightly into detail about the past of the leading female and male characters, only enough to lightly touch on it. Overall it was really cute, but I was expecting more depth to the story and progression in their overall growth. 7/10 "", 'That turned out to be very different from what I originally expected, but that became clear in the very first episode.  After that the plot became extremely obvious -- yes, including the Big Reveal; though maybe one has to have some vague familiarity with Cyrano de Bergerac to see that coming.  I feel most of the potential of the anime was wasted on routine comedy bits, and consequently I feel let down.Story:  Decent set-up, both in regard to the cast being half-youkai, and Ririchiyo\'s acid tongue, though the whole ""secret service"" nonsense made me roll my eyes.  But the show did...nothing much with the youkai past a couple of action scenes, and Ririchiyo\'s tongue wasn\'t all that acidic.  Instead much time was spent on weak comedy gags that I would have wanted to see spent on fleshing out the potentially interesting cast of characters.  The mystery wasn\'t very mysterious to me, and I think the writer failed in finding a good way to give us much of the information during the first 10 episodes, instead of infodumping it all in one giant lump at the end.  It tried some feeble foreshadowing by giving occasional flashes of Miketsukami, but they were actually a bit misleading.Art: Very nice art, especially the character art -- each character looked completely different so there was no need to try and distinguish them by hair color, and at the same time the art felt very unified (I noticed that especially since I recently watched Baby Steps which had very uneven character design).  Animation was fluid and smooth, and there were lots of small details that are not often animated.  Ririchiyo\'s hair was basically its own character.  The changing EDs got their own animations which was fun.Sound: Quite the star voice talent here, and while some of the comedy sounded way over the top, it was obviously designed that way.  I liked the OP but not the performance by MUCC, it sounded as it exceeded the range of the lead singer.  The ED changed frequently and was sung by one or more cast members. BGM was good.Character: Ririchiyo was the only one who got any serious development.  She was intellectually very bright, but at the same time emotionally naive, which always strikes me as odd -- how can one be so very naive if one is actually well-read?  I would have liked her to be a bit more astute, though in several important moments she was actually completely on the ball.  I liked her rather a lot.  Miketsukami started out so fawningly obsequious that despite his innate hotness (of course he also had to be a fox spirit, my favourite) I didn\'t really care for him at first because humans behaving like doormats make me very uncomfortable -- but he was also very competent, and I figured out his secret early on, that changed my mind.  got some development during the big infodump, and as I mentioned above, I would have preferred more of that during the run-up.  All the other characters get minimal personalities, and while they are well delineated, there\'s no development; they\'re just props, some more than others.  I could really do without the ridiculous tranny and camp gay characters; it\'d be nice to just once get a decent trans or gay character instead, outside of BL anime.I rather enjoyed it, but felt a bit empty afterwards.  If you like standard anime comedy where women poke each other\'s large boobs, and people totally overreact, then you might enjoy the humour.  I found the situational humour born from Ririchiyo\'s outer expressions and inner feelings funnier, though I also liked Zange\'s mischief.  Otherwise it\'s a cute, little romance (I am not bothered by the age difference; she\'s a pretty mature 15 year old, and they\'re not doing anything H yet).Oh, and if you watch the special, you\'ll see that Kagerou was right about one thing:  Miketsukami totally is an S.  ;) nothing much with the youkai past a couple of action scenes, and Ririchiyo\'s tongue wasn\'t all that acidic.

I would recommend it to anyone who likes rom-coms, action and some very emotional scenes.It is full of character development. Throughout the anime there are many scenes which look into the past to see what made the characters the way they are. The storyline was quite interesting but also quite cliche. It was a typical story of a girl meeting a guy who fell for her and she for him. However the twists and turns in the plot of the story...were quite riveting, as you do not expect what happens and the story behind a character near the end of the anime.Negatives:The plot was a little cliche.

From what I hear the manga is better, but this anime wasn\'t too bad. I mean, I didn\'t walk away with any strong feelings about it, but it was fun. I mean, the art style is so that everyone kind of resembles a lamp post, but at least they all have nice eyes.What a weird introductory paragraph that was. Anyway, let\'s start with the story. Legit, it took me half of the series to realize that this was supposed...to be a romance. Not like I didn\'t understand that the two main characters were gonna get together; I got that. I just thought, what with the whole ""youkai"" thing, that there\'d be another plotline running through this story. Turns out, it was just a supernatural Host Club. Which is fine, but I was waiting for *something* to happen for a long time before I realized what this series was.On that note, this anime was a little bit awful with making the episodes cohesive. Most of the episodes started in a random scene that had nothing to do with anything going on. And not in a comedic way. In like a ""this episode is gonna focus on *this* person for some out-of-the-blue reason"" and then the episode precedes to... not do that. It was super weird, and it made it a bit difficult to binge because the episodes were all over the place.Character-wise, this anime wasn\'t too bad. Except. The quirky characteristics of these characters got old *really* quickly. The main character, for example, was supposed to have an issue with saying what she meant and, instead, said rude things. That shit was so annoying by the end of the first episode, and then instead of developing her to show that that trait was receding as she grew, they just kept making her say annoying things. That being said, the characters without super strong traits were super funny and always fun to see on screen. I thought the humor came across well most of the time in this series because of the characters.On the positive side of things--and maybe this is something I should withhold since I haven\'t read the manga, but what can you do--the darker parts of this story were really intriguing. I know the manga does do things a little darker and less comedic, and I wish the anime had done the same thing. The end of this series was awesome because it propelled the story forward and into a place of emotional depth and character development. (Even though the characters were way too far apart in age given how young the main character was) I really enjoyed watching the two pinnacle characters interact as I learned more about them. I think, had this anime stuck to the grungy, dark storyline and also ditched the supernatural element, it could\'ve been really cool. The fighting and stuff was really fun to watch, it just felt like it was there to be there rather than being integrated into the story.Anyway, that\'s all I\'ve got to say on Inu x Boku. I will say, though I probably won\'t come back to this series as an anime, it did kind of make me want to read the manga for the drama and tragedy of it all. If you don\'t know if you want to watch it, give it a go. The seiyuu are all the best in the business, so you can\'t go wrong as far as entertainment value goes. to be a romance.

This is mainly because of the fact of how she\'s generally looked at.  Being from a prestigious family, people more often than not don\'t help her out of goodness, but for reward or recognition from her family.  So with that said she moves into a mansion that is very specific as to who may live in there, and each tenant is assigned a secret service (SS)...agent.Story 6/10:  The story isn\'t particularly compelling, it does have supernatural elements to it, but they aren\'t delved into very deeply.  They\'re certainly touched upon and a focal point of the show, but in a way that may not satisfy people who would watch this solely for the supernatural element.  That said, it\'s just enough to moves things along nicely, and throw a couple of ""curveballs"" that makes suspending belief a lot easier.Art 7/10:  There wasn\'t anything special really about the art, however that doesn\'t mean it was good and solid throughout.  The character designs were all fantastic and colorful, but the setting wasn\'t anything to call home about.  The fights in the show were actually well done for the most part, though they weren\'t ever very long or focused upon to show much off.Sound 8/10:  Surprisingly, this was one of my most liked aspects of the show.  The opening and ending were great and fit the show perfectly.  As well as the soundtrack throughout the series that played throughout the battles and more relaxed/comedic scenes, it all complimented everything that was going on very nicely.  The voice actors were also a wonderful crop, Miyano Mamoru (Okabe Rintarou, Yagami Light) was unique again, Hana Kanezawa, Sugita Tomokazu etc.  They were all perfect for their respective roles.Character 8/10:  This was my favorite part of the entire series, was the cast of diverse and colorful characters, perfectly voiced as I mentioned already.  Though my favorite part, there were a couple of recurring quirks for a couple of characters that were sometimes somewhat off-putting.  Rirchiyo I thought was a good main girl overall, but at some point I thought she got to ""cutely bashful"", and took it too far sometimes.  That being said, overall she was good as were the others given my rating, and is the backbone of this series for sure.Enjoyment 8/10:  Not much to say here other than I really enjoyed this series for what it was, a great comedy/supernatural/slice of life/romance sort of show.  At some point or other, all of these elements are prevalent and were mostly well executed.  At 12 episodes it\'s a nice quick watch, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is a fan of any of the genres I just mentioned.Overall 8/10:  For those looking for an enjoyable watch that can make you laugh from time to time and make you feel for the characters, I recommend this to you.  The first 2-3 episodes are good, but then more gets quickly introduced to the story giving it more life, so hold out until then if you aren\'t immediately attracted or pulled in. agent.Story 6/10:  The story isn\'t particularly compelling, it does have supernatural elements to it, but they aren\'t delved into very deeply.

The art looked pretty, and I wanted to watch something light-hearted with lots of humor. Mind you, this review is solely based on my opinion alone, It isn't related to the manga in anyway.So, main question: Is this anime worth watching?Well, the answer is complex. It depends on how you want the story to turn out. Lots of people have expressed their views on this anime, most of them liking how it turned out, while others wanting it to be a dark-toned anime, inspired from the dark manga. Inu x boku SS is an anime, that at...first glance, is seen as cheery. And, yes it is. It takes a different approach than the manga, being someone who read the manga after watching the anime, I see it as a light-hearted romantic comedy, with a few supernatural themes added here and there. If you like this genre of romance, then I guarantee you will like this anime, a lot.The characters are outstanding, the art is amazing, the voice actors did an amazing job voice-acting and overall, the story is eye-catching and not cliche at all.Give this a go, I promise it will not disappoint anyone who holds a strong liking for romance and supernatural anime. And those who have read the manga, this might seem okayish but give it a go, anyways. Who knows? You might enjoy it. first glance, is seen as cheery. And, yes it is.

I was totally wronge, it turned out to be a really great story, with consistant storyline and complicated yet adorable relationship between the two main charactrers. It doesn't only revolve around the two but also shows the relationship between the other resdidents of the mansion.The series has a hint of mystery in it and I've always been a fan of supernaturals so I personally enjoyed the 'monster blood' idea.The anime is really intresting, but with alot of mental dialogs in the characters heads.I personally recommned watching it because...its a really fresh anime, hope it has a second season too, so the story would actually have an ending. its a really fresh anime, hope it has a second season too, so the story would actually have an ending."", 'Ririchiyo is a broken girl, as a descendant of a demon with rich blood, she is treated like an object rather than a person. To get away from all the deceit and fake smiles, she moves to Demon Manor, a place full of other descendants like her, specifically to be alone. However, every tenant of Demon Manor is assigned a protective guard, aptly named ""Secret Service"". How will Ririchiyo react when she meets her bishounen guard?When I started watching this I felt a lot of deja vu with other series. The main heroine Ririchiyo looks a lot like the heroine from Ookami Kakushi, the descended...from demons theme reminded me of Zakuro/Inuyasha, and the unlimited-willed destined male reminded me of Kaichou-wa Maid sama and Special A. Regardless of speculative feelings, the series is a very direct girl meets boy show similar to Kaichou and Special A. The main deviation from the similar series is that the main heroine is a loli tsundere. This is a series where you will either love or hate the main character; you can either blame her for her non-stop, acrid mouth or you can sympathize with her inexperience at dealing with people. Overall, I thought it was a decent watch but nowhere near Kobato or Kaichou levels.Animation:Random characters aside, the animation here is pretty standard fare. Backgrounds are nicely detailed, colors are slightly faded, and the overall setting is believable.Now the actual residents of Demon Manor are something to behold. All the residents can transform into their demon form, be it a raccoon dog, mini-troll, or a paper scroll. Once you get over the initial wtf it isn\'t that bad as the supporting characters really take a back stage to the main action. I will never get the Japanese addiction with heterochromia and eye patches.This is a fairly tranquil series, there are a few minor scuffles but nothing that would satisfy a true action seeker. There is also relatively little fan-service/ecchi to cover up so I don\'t know how they\'re going to sell the Blu-Rays...Sound:I typically don\'t like many dude OPs, this is one of them. The EDs are voiced by the VAs and range from Ririchiyo\'s lullaby to a questionably-informative S&M description. It doesn\'t get much better when you move to the BGM. Usually I\'m fine with minimalist, instrumental BGMs; but in this case the series is already slow enough that adding a few slow pieces really is asking for bedtime.VA-wise, uber-young Rina Hidaka gets her shot at playing tsundere. I\'m not completely certain but perhaps she was trying to make the tsun sound a bit forced given Ririchiyo\'s history. The only major surprise for me was having Kana Hanazawa play such a quiet, monotone character; I still hear ""Kobato ganbarimasu!"" and ""Tu-tu-ru~"" ringing in my ears...Story:This is a very linear story with an ending you can predict after seeing the first episode. You can also predict a fair amount of how they get there as well. What you probably won\'t predict is the major mystery piece, how is it that Ririchiyo had previously saved her questionably-indebted fox-demon servant/guard/dog? This is the only thing that will probably keep you watching.Plot-wise, there isn\'t much going on in this series, you can practically jump from episode 3 to episode 10 without missing much in terms of plot. What you will be missing out on is a lot of character interactions. The climax near the end of the series, I don\'t even know if I should call it a climax, isn\'t really much of one as it\'s more of an entire episode of ""ooooooh that\'s what it\'s all about.""Character:This series is all about character interactions, specifically how Ririchoyo\'s interactions with her inu changes her personality forever. It differs, arguably in a good way, from a lot of peers in that it focuses heavily on one relationship. Apparently Ririchiyo had previously freed her inu in the past somehow. So in the middle, you get a lot of Ririchiyo trying her best to hide her dere under a lot of forced Tsun.In the end, this is supposed to be a somewhat romantic series. However, unlike Kaichou and even Kobato, I think there is just too much fiction to make it feel tangible. In that sense I never really grew attached to Ririchiyo. If you watch the first 2 eps and feel for Ririchiyo, this will be a good series for you.As for supporting characters, they\'re pretty weak and only contribute minor humor points; their backgrounds are mostly left blank and many of them leave you with just more questions.Value:As I said in the beginning, this show will be a toss up based on how well you can connect with the main protagonists. This series is very character driven as there really isn\'t even an antagonist in the series. This is a bit of an endurance run as you\'re really not rewarded for watching until the very end, and they don\'t try very hard to keep you watching.

I just remember going through each of the episodes thinking to myself what is the point of this? The episodes and the majority of the episode plots/situations were boring....Additionally, none of the characters are likeable, and some characters are borderline creepy.Character 3/10Speaking of characters, I absolutely hate the main girl. Her ""hmph\'s"" got so annoying that I could not even stand the sound of her voice by the end of the series. I honestly muted the video whenever she spoke because of how annoying she was.She was unlikeable and I could not sympathize with her at all, even when all her letters were revealed, etc.Next, the main guy. YIKES. that 7 year age gap, really freaked me out. He was in love with a minor basically. His back story was really creepy as well. Being this ""servant"" like person just to sleep around and get to the top. I think the author was also trying to make us sympathize with him, but I could not. I was just so disturbed by his manipulative behavior.Again, if a guy is like this, RUN AWAY!!!!!Art 4/10The art wasn\'t bad persay, but it was the fact that the main guy looked like he was 22+ and the main girl looked like she was 14 was super disturbing and makes me dislike the art. Turns out the guy was 22 and the girl was 15. Yikes.Objectively speaking, the art was very cleanly drawn and honestly beautiful, if not a bit bland.Enjoyment 2/10No idea why I didn\'t drop it.

Its a very sweet love story with great comedy that really made me laugh. The character designs and their monster versions were incredibly well thought and each Character kind of synergized with the youkai whose powers they posses.Art: 9It was nothing special, but I give it an 9 for the cute and funny chibi styles that were commonly used as well as the...closing sequence that each character had, its really worth it to watch each episode to the end in this show. Of course, it must also be taken into consideration that this anime came out around the 2000's so my standards for the art are quite lowered.Story: 8It got slice of life-y and each episode would sometimes get a bit boring, but the overarching story and the few moments of background for the main cast was very entertaining, although I wish i got to know other characters better as well.Characters: 9The biggest complaint about the show that I see is the 7 year age gap between the female lead and the male love interest. Albeit this is a very strange design choice, I find that it doesnt affect the story much and Its quite common among other anime like Blend S. The age gap is not ideal and I wish it was not so large, but regardless the love story and design of each character was so unique and very nice. I could not get enough of the funny lines that each character had, especially Nobara Yukinoki, who was my favorite. Each character has a very different personality and its worth it to watch the show just for the characters and their stories.I believe that what really tied the story together was the romance, Inu x Boku ss is a very cute love story and it melted my heart. I swear, I got toothaches from how sweet the love story was.

Usually I tend to see sacrificing one for the other. However this anime pulled both off amazingly. Not only did it seriously pull at my heartstrings, but it also made me burst out laughing.I would very much love a second season. It's so very good, I might read where the anime left off in the manga. "", 'Some things that this anime did correct and did really well was romance and comedy. The romance provided you with a really good happy feeling and the comedy would leave you laughing. The main downside of the anime though was how they completely ignored that all the characters living in the building were half monsters. The first few episodes put a little focus on it and even provided a little bit of action to the show, but over time it slowly faded away and left you wanting more. If they put a little more focus on it, it would have been a far greater anime. ', ""Inu x Boku SS is an enjoyable and simple romance comedy I would suggest to watch in between some more demanding anime. If you enjoy a love story that is lightweight, well-rounded and sweet while balanced with some entertaining comic relief (plus plenty handsome bishonen and cute loli girls), this anime will suit you well.Art - 8I liked the artstyle of this anime quite a bit. Fitting with the story, the art is very light and smooth; all characters are uniquely designed and memorable. The anime also picks up some art-clichés, though mainly in a humorous way (e.g. the male main character sparkling) and during...comic-relief scenes, the characters are often depictes as chibi, which I found to be appropriate and entertaining. In terms of the animation, I have no complaints. The fighting scenes are well done but nothing special, which I didn't mind since they're not the core of this anime.Story and Enjoyment - 7While I enjoyed the story as a whole, the anime felt a little slow to me at times. Many episodes seemed like fillers even though the anime is quite short to begin with. Having said that, every episode has its own entertainment value and compliments the whole story in the end; also I had a lot of fun discovering every side character's personality, sometimes even more than focussing on the main plot. How the love story between the two main characters, Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, played out, was a little predictable to me but nevertheless a pleasure to watch, mainly because of the character development taking place in the second part of the anime. For some reason, I didn't find the source of the characters' powers all that convincing and they didn't add much to the romance-focussed anime.In general -- Inu x Boku SS does not supply you with the most original love story or the most epic fighting scenes of all times, but manages to draw you in nonetheless. It is a great watch for everyone looking for a funny and heartwarming story with not too much substance to it.Characters - 8At first I assumed most of the characters, main and secondary, were based on clichés and stereotypes, as is often the case in anime of that kind, though I was surprised by how quickly they all managed to win me over within only a few episodes. Ririchiyo is quite relatable and you quickly get to discover her personality and quirks. Miketsukami seems like a typical bishonen that everybody immediately falls in love with, but his back story is quite interesting and unique. I definitely enjoyed the dynamic between the two. However, it was the supporting characters that really helped me get into the anime the most. I liked most of the comic relief they brought to the show, and the way they helped Ririchiyo's character development. In the end I would have loved some more development of the secondary characters as well, but overall I was contented.In general -- If you're not entirely sure whether to watch this anime or not, I can promise you that the characters are worth giving it a try.Overall - 8Inu x Boku SS was interesting and humorous enough to keep me watching, which is rarely the case for I'm not a fan of romance-comedy in general, and overall I happened to enjoy it quite a bit.

Though the plot wasn't all that well developed, the show was funny and short enough to keep me watching to the end. Though I think there are a few knots that need to be tied up with the supporting characters, I could visibly see character development in the two main ones, which I value a lot. The only other complaint I'd have is that the background info was kinda sparse, so I had to research on my own what the various creatures were. But that wasn't much of a hassle. Overall, I think it's...a really cute, light-hearted Rom Com that is tinged with a meaningful message.

Besides its romantic genre, we find in the story line a complex issue whereby ,Ririchiyo Shirakiin, a little girl from a royal descent wants to be accepted no matter how she is. Transferred to Room 4 of the Ayakashi Mansion, she, thus, builds up a new life and meets with new comrades. However, the one who clearly understands her inner feelings is  Sōshi Miketsukami, her loyal servant with a mysterious past. As the story enfolds, we learn to understand the characters even...if there's not much said on the two main protagonists' fellow friends. Much emphasis is on Miss Ririchiyo and Miketsukami and how their relationship strongly progresses throughout the anime.Within the plot:there is a need to mention that only supernatural human being lives in The Maison de Ayakashi.it is a high security apartment building where humans with demon ancestors or yōkai live and are protected by their own Secret Service bodyguard. So  Miss Ririchiyo is guarded by Miketsukami-khun.(Art 8)Inu x Boku treats the super-naturalistic and the naturalistic separately, whereby humans are rarely getting involved with the yokai/ demon and vice versa.We also find that humans hardly question themselves about those living in the mansions. This anime does not provide immensely distorted characters though transformed into demons. Instead some are given comic and funny transformations. Hence, the attention of the viewer is captured in a blink without being overly artistic. what makes the anime unique is the bond shared by a teenage girl and her loyal servant who is much older than her. Moreover, the anime provides us with some painful flashbacks of the main protagonists from time to time. From a personal point of view, this helps to create a high sense of pathos,likes and dislikes towards the characters. Moreover, Naokatsu Suda (director) has successfully achieved an atmosphere of love, conviviality and charm through the characters however, there is no such place to discover in the anime as the characters remain stagnate around the mansion, school and common places such as shopping mall. Finally, what i like the most about Inu x boku is how the characters are  aesthetically  drawn as expected from a 2012 production.(Sound 6)I do not recall much about the music through out the anime may be because i did not pay much attention to the music background. The characters however, strikes us the most with their voice and gestures (which i'll not describe here, see characters). The opening song remain the same from the beginning till the end of the anime series. However, the funniest is the ending songs as it changes randomly in the anime.

She is only dressed in Ultra Blue or black so that we can relate it to her painful past.She is not tall nor has an imposing body feature, the way she talks indicates directly her position as being superior and complex in the anime. Her body ironically does not fit her voice as her body is so tiny and thin compared to the roughness and coldness of her voices. At times her voice changes from bold to light when she is calm and thankful. Ririchiyo has characteristics of a tsundere ( a person who is initially cold,hostile), she is actually a tsunshun (lovey dovey) in terms of personality.Sōshi Miketsukami  Voiced by: Yuichi NakamuraThe assigned SS Agent to Ririchiyo is probably one of the most appealing character of the anime. Sōshi is descended from of the evil nine-tailed fox who was soushi's past life. He's very calm, polite, and gentle to everyone he interacts with, plus he is devoted to his Ririchiyo, blindly obeying her and protecting her with his life if the situation calls for it. Any girl out there will dare to fall in love with him due to his sympathetic cuteness and  his pick up lines were made in such a way that his charming personality attracts you.

It had some strong points, but it also had weak points.Strong pointsI think the art was superb. The characters were nicely drawn and had a very unique look to all of them. All the colors were vivid and crisp. If i had to have any style of art it would be this.There was some excellent character development. This is probably one of the most important things that either makes or breaks an anime. The characters have to go through trails and tribulations that either change them as a whole or make them see something in a...different light. The main female Shirakiin, Ririchiyo is a perfect example of a dynamic character. viewers can slowly see the difference in her personality. other characters develop as well but  she is the main focus.It has a great love story! I wont elaborate and give anything away, but its touching and bitter sweet all at the same time.Comedy. There was quite a bit of comedy as well which really made the anime seem lighter in just the right places.Characters as a whole were very lovable. I fell in love with almost every character that was introduced. They all seemed to have some intriguing quark about them.NegativesPLOT! Oh my god. This anime probably could have been one of my favorites had it actually had a decent plot. I think what happened was they thought they could just make a story and focus on only characters and good art to hold it up, not the case. There really was no direction for the story in fact it seemed like they just took it episode by episode instead of planning it out, however I would not want this to stop anyone from enjoying it.

', 'With the first episodes you would think it would be all comedy but with the revelations at the end, it slowly becomes serious and nice. After finishing the whole thing, there’s obviously a nice balance of comedy, romance, and drama.I believe literally all the characters have something to offer and interesting.Animation is not particularly explosive but it is definitely well-made and you can feel that it’s very “now”.I absolutely enjoyed every episode. It’s worth-watching again and again with its fun and somewhat light story. ', ""Prior to the anime's airing, I gave the manga a quick preview, and quickly got hooked. It feels like a shoujo romance story at heart, but doesn't have any of the excessive melodrama I hated so much. I usually like shoujo short stories because it presents the novelty of the story without diluting it with character exposition arcs and unrelated side stories. Those methods works to lengthen the serialization (more profit) and adds value to the secondary characters, but it doesn't do much for the story, or for the people that just aren't that into shoujo.Inu x Boku isn't shoujo, but it has all the...elements of what I liked about it. With a powerful ending and an interesting back-story, all it needs to do is to work on the execution, and it did. It's true that Inu x Boku is full of bits and pieces that have nothing to do with the storyline, but these bits develops the environment where our protagonist Ririchiyo settled into, which is rather integral to the storyline. Most importantly, these bits never took itself too seriously; they mostly serve as a bonus content to our secondary characters, or provide light humor, a distinct style of Inu x Boku.The characters are also the main draw of the series. There's not one character I cannot find something really unique about him/her, and most importantly none of them felt even a tiny bit cliché. The one that really stands our is our main character, Ririchiyo. She's not even a tsundere, she's a tsunshun! Which means she gets depressed after being a tsun, so says Nobara. (If I see one more loli tsundere, I would have to kill Kugimiya Rie) Her monologues aren't witty, but they certainly helped expressed her character differently. Some may say that her character is too unrealistic, but even I can see part of myself in her, so I can relate. Also, while I'm never really into lolis, she certainly is cute!And like what many other bloggers have said, the awesome ending really deserves some recognition. I'm not surprised having read the manga, but I don't think other people would expect Inu x Boku to have one of the best endings this season. Or for the past few seasons, for that matter.I won't give David Productions too much credit, because much of the value comes from the original material. I would say, though, that it's really rare that a manga adaptation was done so smoothly. They literally animate scene-to-scene from the manga, yet the end result is completely different from, say, Deadman Wonderland. DW turns out to be shit. Inu x Boku is ingenious.But the show isn't without fault. The lack of content in the middle of the season was obvious, and the speed at where the story progress is god-awful. Not that they don't try to fill up the blanks with comedy, but it couldn't totally cover it up. Having awkward pauses isn't ideal.The production values were good. Not exactly brilliant in terms of animation quality, but they got the comedic timing down very well. The OP is also definitely one of the best amongst the ones I've watched this season. And oh, I'm not sure if this was the intention in the original material, but cloning Hirasawa Yui into Chino was a stroke of genius. Don't tell me no, because someone somewhere down the production line definitely see that resemblance. Dammit, it's a same face and voice!I'm way past the point where I remember the shows that I really enjoyed, but THIS... I'll definitely remember this. elements of what I liked about it.

The main parts that I (and probably many others) was frustrated with was the lead characters as well as the story line. I was more invested in the story at the beginning because they set it up so nicely, however it barely develops at all! They have the mystery of Miketsukami\'s past perfectly set up, yet all they do every episode is beat around the bush. Comedy is fine, but every episode just feels like a filler at this point. The lead characters have barely any development in the long run and its infuriating.I have watched a total of...about 9 episodes of this anime. I would be fine with the development so far if I was half way through the anime or something, yet to finish this anime I would need to watch 2 more. Maybe somehow there is an incident that causes a huge development. Either way it\'s underwhelming. Even in episodes themselves, Ririchiyo wastes so much time thinking to herself. I know its a part of her character, but there\'s one part in this anime that annoyed me a lot. They\'re both in her room while she\'s trying to sleep, but she wants desperately to thank him. She calls out to him a LOT without actually telling him. It\'s annoying because it was a waste of time.The other thing is that I feel like the \'supernatural\' part of this anime is just sprinkled in so lightly. They just say ""Yeah, this is a thing. The characters could die at any moment or whatever. Cool back to boob jokes!"" and that\'s about it. They try to tackle WAY too much in such a short anime, they really needed to simplify their plot by a lot or make the anime longer.I appreciated the lesbian representation, they didn\'t seem to be used for the male audience either. The lesbian relationships were cute and all, but they don\'t get a medal for doing the bare minimum especially because of my next point.There were way to many \'tr*nny\' jokes. I ignored it the first time it happened, but there was a certain episode were I just got tired of it. I believe it was the last episode I stopped at (my memory is slightly blurry). The character that they ridicule (Ayumu) is transgender and very... manly to say the least. I simply find it to be bad representation.In conclusion, I simply don\'t recommend the anime unless you\'re insanely patient. Says a lot for a 12 episode anime. about 9 episodes of this anime.

', ""When I began watching this anime series not too long ago from this dated critique, it felt like this anime was trying to make us believe we knew everything about each of the character's backgrounds. Ririchiyo (the main protagonist) has the problem of being smart-mouthed and verbally abused the people around her. Then she meets Miketsukami, her new SS bodyguard at Maison de Ayakashi. He is unnerved by her verbal language, and continues to serve her as a devoted ''dog''. However, the first few episodes replay the same routine with Miketsukami waking her up, giving her breakfast, and her watching a video about dog obedience...on a flatscreen TV at the mall. The story takes a turn when she goes to high school at freshman year.There were many comedic scenes, especially Miketsukami's invisible ears and tails and Nobaru's ''Maniac'' when it comes to girl magazines.The art style was indeed enjoyable and it matched with many recent anime styles nowadays. And there were moments when the characters turn into ''chibis'' for adorable reference.I suppose the turning points would be Episode 11 and 12, explaining Miketsukami's past and how he knew so much about Ririchiyo. The two confess to each other, becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. The OVA shows the development in their relationship as Miketsukami tries to teach her on how to become more intimate. The show ends in a happy ending...for now.Spoiler:For Arc 2 of the manga, here comes the biggest PLOT TWIST.If the animation team were to animate the second part of the manga, then things go downhill fast. It becomes more bloodier than the first 12 episodes, resulting in massive trauma and pain for everybody.

The real treat of the show is its characters.Story: 8/10The story was not outstanding, but it wasn\'t terrible either. One thing that I was very glad about was that the show deviated from a standard high school comedy. The school-life itself was a very minor part of the show, and the anime focused on the character interactions at Maison de Ayakashi. The supernatural details served as a platform to keep the plot going with little...mishaps occurring to bring the characters together. The plot isn\'t the main course, but rather a means to make the characters shine. The show also has an actual ending that is very meaningful; it has a beautiful climax that really showcases the internal struggles of the two main characters.Art: 10/10Needless to say, the art style is very beautiful. The show is relatively well-animated; the parts that are lax in animation usually have cute chibis and make the scenes thoroughly enjoyable. The character designs themselves are very appealing; I think we can all agree that Ririchiyo is as cute as a button, and Miketsukami is as hot as the sun. I appreciate the little garter belts on Ririchiyo\'s thigh highs, and the fact that Miketsukami\'s gloves cover only half his palms. These small details are delicious.Sound: 9/10The background music usually suites the mood; I appreciated the heartfelt use of the piano during touching moments. Of course, each of the Secret Service ""Pairs"" get their own ending songs that pertain to their relationships. The seiyuus themselves sing the endings, and it\'s very enjoyable to hear the lyrics within the context of the characters.Character: 10/10I came into Inu x Boku SS thinking that it was going to be a generic show. Let me say this: I hate tsunderes. No matter who they are, I find a way to hate them. I thought Ririchiyo was going to be a classic tsundere, but she was far more than that. The core of the tsundere archetype is the fact that they\'re prickly, when in reality they\'re quite sweet. The latter is usually not expanded on that much, and tsunderes usually never care about how rude, abusive, and straight up mean they are. They just fill a moe, bland character. Ririchiyo on the other hand, is self-aware and even wants to change her horrible habit of using harsh words. She struggles to express her true feelings and has genuine communication issues that stem from her complex childhood. She was literally isolated her whole life and bullied at school as a child. It\'s a given that she\'s going to be messed up. It\'s the first time that I\'ve seen such expansion on why a tsundere acts the way they do. Not only that, she tries so hard to change herself and yearns to understand more about Miketsukami, to the point of throwing away her foolish pride. This aspect of her is very endearing, and this development also really adds to the meat of this romance. It\'s much more meaningful that way. There\'s also more than what meets the eye for Miketsukami as well; he\'s tasty bait for the fangirls since he\'s a loyal, handsome dog, but his obedience and questionably strong servitude exist because of his tragic backstory. At first the characters seem rather generic, but they have much more depth to them; this was a very pleasant surprise. The side characters aren\'t as well-developed as Ririchiyo and Miketsukami, but they still add to the show. It\'s particularly interesting to see the relationships of the other SS ""partners."" Even the super minor staff of the mansion are well-defined, whether it\'s the okama maid or the ""bartender"" who can always be seen shaking a cocktail in the background. It\'s nice to see such small details. All in all, it was a pleasure to see the cast of characters grow throughout these 12 episodes.Enjoyment: 10/10I\'m also a sucker for these kind of master/servant relationships, but this is the best I\'ve seen. The most healthy (?) as well. I ate up everything this show threw at me. I might be a little biased because I am definitely the target audience.Overall: 10/10Even if this isn\'t your kind of show, it\'s definitely worth a watch for these characters. Oh, and it actually ends conclusively, wholesomely, and beautifully. Very satisfying.*Note, pay close attention to the opening after Miketsukami\'s backstory is revealed. In fact, this episode plays the opening as the ending for this very purpose.

Any romance scenes felt like I was watching two 12 year olds awkwardly oodling each other. It was honestly just.. boring! The backstories weren\'t that bad even though...they could of added abit more to it then it would of been alot better. I like how they made the two end up together aswell (by this I mean the letters they used to send together and not the ending) As for how they came together, I found it really boring and emotionless.. Like wow he found a love letter on accident! Honestly it was all just boring.. I\'m pretty sure I fell asleep at some point. I\'d also like to add that the age gap between these guys made it awkward for me.. It sometimes made me sick thinking that a 22 year old would date a 15 year old.. Maybe it was just me..Art 8/10: I actually liked the art of this anime and found it quite enjoyable to watch.Sound 8/10: Nothing stood out to much to me but it all sounded good.Character 7/10: Some characters were really fucked up and some were actually alright.. The main male lead was borderline stalker/rapist, nothing about the ""romantic"" scenes were anything shy from rapey vibes... Like for christ sake he had a massive wall full of pictures of her at the end (or in the ova).. Anything he said made me cringe and also sick to the stomach. The main female lead wasn\'t all to bad and I actually enjoyed her backstory to it, she showed how her past affected her on trusting and putting up a barrier to her character. Supporting character weren\'t that bad either and I really enjoyed most of them.Enjoyment 7/10: I\'m not saying I didn\'t enjoy it.. But it was boring to say the least. Some scenes seemed pointless and thrown into just fill the 12 episodes. Some parts would get into it about the backstories and the characters but other than that..

It was more like a reality show following the main character Ririchiyo around, and witnessing the crazy events her and her friends encounter on a day to day basis. This simplicity may turn off a lot of people from watching it, however I wholeheartedly believe everyone should give this a chance.I would say comedy was the defining genre by far. It seemed like every thirty seconds, something would happen or something would be said that would cause me to laugh out loud.The romance aspect was the second...most prevalent genre and I am happy to say you will not be disappointed!There are supernatural moments since all the main characters have weird powers and weird monster things sometimes appear, just don't watch this if you want a dominant supernatural series, you will be disappointed.The last episode is actually the Inu X Boku SS Special. I got my hopes up when I saw they had a special, until I found out it was just the 12th episode.Art: I would personally say the artwork is pretty simplistic in relation to other series I have seen. The majority of the time is spent inside buildings, especially the house, so there was no real need to spent lots of time on scenery.I thought the character designs were creative and different whenever they transformed into their youkai forms. As normal humans, they looked pretty normal and usual for anime characters.Sound: Like the majority of series, I skipped the opening so if you want a detailed review of the openings and closings, I don't have one.There were quite a few English voice actors I recognized such as Chris Patton, Brittney Karbowski, and Monica Rial. I thought they were amazing in their parts and they fit together quite well.Characters: My favorite character was Kagerou Shoukiin who is played by the amazingly talented David Matranga. Every time this character appears, it is so freaking hilarious, especially when he goes on his Masochist/Sadist tirades.There was such a diverse field of personalities, it was sometimes overwhelming but that shows it was done correctly. There was the main character who spoke her mind, but felt bad whenever she hurt someone's feelings. You have the perverted SS agent who gets a nosebleed every time she sees one of the girls in a cute position, or fantasizes about such. There is the quick tempered character that always seems to be up for a fight in order to look good in front of his crush. This list goes on and on.Enjoyment: In all, I gave this series a 9 out of 10.

Inu x Boku SS is the perfect anime to break my silence. This anime sat in my watchlist for a few years, probably due to the fact the cover art just doesn't look interesting. I randomly selected it to watch this morning and binged the show the entire day. I was grabbed by the first episode in which a house burglary revealed the main cast to be something other than human. But I stayed for the cute butler/man/dog with heterochromia. Appearance wise he reminds me of Tomoe from Kamisama Kiss (one of my favorite anime to...date). The love story between butler and snotty schoolgirl actually developed a great deal of depth over the series. It wasn't a purely physical connection and teenage hormones, but a story of two people who fell in love with the others insecurities and mysteries. I knocked the anime by one point for the primary love story being between a high school girl (perhaps 16 years of age) and a 20 year old man. Had they both been older and past their developmental years I wouldn't bat an eye, but something about an immature high schooler (true she is portrayed as more mature than the average) being groomed into a relationship with a 20 year old... yeah it just doesn't sit right with me. date).

There were parts I liked and parts I disliked, a few that made me smile and rather more that made me cringe. On the whole I gave it a 6, which is not a bad score by any means. It just shows that I didn’t enjoy it as much as some other anime.First off, just let me say that the opening and endings are great. Catchy and fun, and it was a really nice idea to have each character sing one personalised ending song – it brought a little more life into the anime....The other sounds complemented the setting, and the voice actors suited most of the characters well (it was a talented cast, after all).I can’t find much fault with the art or animation either, the art beautifully detailed (especially in regard to the main characters), generally matching the mood (and actually quite cute in the chibi moments 😊).The story started out interesting enough (with the idea of a mansion full of part-humans who need protection) and became interesting again at the very end, with part of the mystery being explained. There were a few original parts (e.g. the quirky personalities of the SS agents) that stopped the series from being a generic rom-com “hot guy protects special girl and eventually they end up falling in love” anime.The anime was largely episodic, and I found the pacing to be very slow during the middle episodes (For example, almost 3 episodes were spent revolving around making coffee!) but those were in any case mainly for introducing the supporting characters, not progressing the story.Many of the characters had interesting (if one-dimensional) personalities, that was one of the stronger suits of the anime. I did actually really like Natsume’s character (I think all the Kuroshitsuji comparisons are spot on!), and although I initially disliked Soushi’s character it did actually fit him very well. Ririchiyo was a refreshing break from the traditional tsundere and was really very nicely played, with the best development of any character in the series.There were however several moments, that although initially funny, soon became nothing more than an overused series of gags. Nobara’s yuri obsession and Kagerou’s S&M obsession basically took over their respective characters, and ended up causing me to cringe at them far more than I laughed (“My human toilets?” Really??) Karuta’s food obsession also eventually bored me, it seemed like all she ever did was eat and nothing else.It was a decent anime, so, why did I give it a 6? Mainly because, when I reached the end I sat back and asked myself “was this an anime I really enjoyed? Did each episode make me want another?” and the answers were no overall. Although nearer the end the anime did indeed improve, as character development increased and backstory was revealed, it never had me particularly excited waiting to see the next episode.I’d recommend if you like supernatural rom-coms that are mainly episodic by nature, but do be prepared to cringe a bit.

Each of them has their specific ‘charm’, or ‘quirk’ (for the lack of a better word).

But it seems the show doesn’t care about these elements, which is a shame, since it could bring more to the table. It’s just there with no purpose and remains undeveloped.So everything revolves around the daily life of the inhabitants living in this luxurious hotel and their everyday shenanigans.

The art seemed pretty enticing at the time and the bio put this show out to be a short but enjoyable watch; ranging at only 12 episodes. In the end, i\'m really glad I did pick this up because I can safely say that even though it\'s nothing really worth talking about; the quirky characters, comedy, drama, and even moments of action kept me well invested in the 4 hour run...time it presented me. This is an over the top comedy with plenty of Heartfelt scenes. If this is your cup of tea, then i\'m sure that your experience with this show will no less be as enjoyable as it was with mine!Story:Inu X Boku SS follows the life of female protagonist Ririchiyo, Shirakiin. As we see her move to this new Hotel/Apartment complex called, ""Ayakashi Kan,""  we meet her undying servant, Soushi Miketsukami who is obsessed in pleasing Ririchiryo to her greatest satisfaction. Aside from some added fantasy elements and exposition that bind all the residents of Ayakashi Kan together, majority of the show is dedicated towards the growing relationship between Ririchiryo, Miketsukami and all the fellow tenants that reside in Ayakashi Kan. What makes this such a fun setup to watch however is thanks to the interactions between all the characters and the wacky events that happen. Starting with the main driving force of the series: the relationship between Ririchiyo and Miketsukami is a comedic yet palpable one. Both characters receive much development and grows at a smooth pace, making almost all their actions seem reasonable and in context to the character. It was fun to see Miketsukami start off as a self depreciative, over-obedient servant into a more laid back, but still caring individual by the end of it. However, it does not stop there, and half of the spotlight is also given to the other members living in Ayakashi Kan. Despite being one dimension and even remaining mostly static throughout the series, the residents all have a certain quirk to them that will no doubt harbor favorites. Whether it\'s the silent-but adorable Karuta (my personal favorite!), the mindless Tsundere Watanuki, or the simply strange Natsume, each character is uniquely different and is what really gives the show the charm it deserves. Despite this however, the show does nothing to break any boundaries and remains nothing more than a good time. In addition, since most of the episodes each have their own scenario with the relationship between Ririchiyo and Miketsukami really the one thing that connects the episodes together, the pacing can sometimes be all over the place. This ranges from fun episodes that have a fast and wacky pace, to the next episode potentially being slow and dramatic. At times it can somewhat jarring, but nonetheless it did nothing to ruin my experience.7/10Art:The animation was produced by the company simply known as, ""David Production"" whose other works include: Jojo\'s Bizzare Adventure (2012) and Level E. The overall art in Inu X Boku SS was once again nicely detailed and well animated, but nothing of a master stroke. The character designs on the other hand  were greatly distinctive, making each character easily stand out to suit their personality.7/10Sound:A major fault on my part is to recognize an OST during a show, as I hardly notice it due to my one sided attention being on the dialogue and events on the screen. Therefore, for an OST to really stand out as ""Good"" for me, it has to make it self heard by highly enhancing the mood at the particular moment or simply just having a good and solid beat that I can even listen to without any context. Sadly, Inu x Boku never had any of that for me. The OP Nirvana (no, not the english band Nirvana) by MUCC (No, also not the band english MUSE) provided a good rock piece, and the End Credits featured a variety of character themed ending animations plus songs. While the themes fit the characters themselves, none of them particularly grabbed my interest and I unfortunately skipped them.5/10Character:In my humble opinion, the best thing about Inu x Boku SS was indeed the characters. As previously mentioned, most of the cast each had their distinctive character trait that can make you absolutely love or hate them, but in the end; the show really needed to make likable characters for their two mains: Ririchiyo and Miketsukami. Thankfully, Inu X Boku does well for these two as even though Ririchiyo  may not be liked by everyone due to her Tsunshun personality (A new character archetype created in the show where she would act cold towards someone but get depressed afterwards due to regret), she well makes up for it due to her naivety and some-what laid back personality that makes characters sympathize (and laugh at) with, but also allows her to not be completely helpless. Miketsukami also shows high appeal as throughout most of the show he is covered in mystery, but also has this overly obedient side that is used to great comedic effect. No doubt however that he will/did definitely appeal to many Josei fans as his never ending will to please Ririchiyo seems like the ideal butler.. Kinda like another well loved Butler (Cough cough).8/10Enjoyment/Overall:The time I spent at Ayakashi San was definitely a satisfying one. I easily grew attached with all the characters, and I effortlessly devoured the episodes more faster than you can say your favorite long running Shounen series. Though it wasn\'t anything groundbreaking, this was a show that flew under the radar and definitely deserves all the attention it can get. If you\'re looking for a good comedy and want or don\'t mind a bit of substance to it then the only thing I have left to say is: Enjoy your stay at Ayakashi Kan!7/10 time it presented me.

It all starts with a girl named Ririchiyo, who didn\'t have attention and love from her parents and other people that  surrounded her as a child. Upon changing to Ayakashi Mansion and meeting her new SS\' agent, Soushi, things start to change, as she gets to know what\'s like having frinds, people who care for her...Her mean attitude towards everyone is just an way to hide her real feelings and supress all the suffering she had... Spending time with Soushi soon makes her able to show...those feelings... It suddenly turns out to be love... This plot takes some time to be revealed, but that\'s what made it more interesting and exciting. A deep truth comes along as it happens...Although main characters, who reside in this mansion are descendants from ""monsters\' families"" and have supernatural powers, plot isn\'t focused on their transformations nor battles and this kind of thing... Basically a romance afterall.Everyone is lovely in here and there are also types you can\'t find on every anime. I mean, there\'s a lesbian and even a ""cross-dressing maid"" dude, like, what? Besides that, Kagerou really blows it by being the weirdest one... Making use of such uncommon characters, that\'s impressive and make it different from many others... Point!Art was what caught me, it\'s simply gorgeous! Everything looks so simple, still, it kept my attention. Chibi made it even better and the use of soft colors amazed me. OP theme matches nicely to the song, which is great, and there are variated ED themes, awesome!It surely isn\'t one of the best I\'ve watched... Still, I don\'t think it was a waste of my time, it was pretty good... A heartwarming story about a girl who slowly learns about how to be more sociable and, specially, how to love someone... The way she begins to show her sweet emotions... I totally fell for her... those feelings... It suddenly turns out to be love...

I totally fell for her...', ""I wasn't sure what to expect upon starting Inu x Boku SS, but as it was recommended to me by a friend I decided to give it a go. And I am glad I did.I enjoyed the story of Inu x Boku SS, at least what there was of it. It was relatively simple - a teenage girl, who has difficulty interacting with others, moves to a 'special' academy in order to be alone, where she meets her mandatory S.S. agent, who is a very self-depreciating but sweet man. The story really revolves around their interactions and the development of their feelings toward each other,...and the consequent changes that happen to them. Of course there is a decent amount of filler, however personally I found most of them pretty entertaining, but by the time the last few episodes rolled around and the story progressed a little more it was getting a little tiresome to be watching constant filler.The art of Inu x Boku SS was very clean and well-animated. I really enjoyed the art of this series (I gave it a 10). I thought that the exaggerated chibi style and facial expressions for comedic effect were great, often they produced a laugh from me where otherwise I probably wouldn't have. The art of the characters was very crisp and each of them was easy to recognise however the designs themselves weren't overly original.The sound did what its purpose is - setting the scene in certain situations. It was well placed and nothing sounded out of place, though it wasn't hugely memorable. I enjoyed the OP, but I don't really recall any of the EDs. None of  them were awful, they just weren't particularly amazing where I would commit them to memory. I thought the voices were very good though, which saved the sound score from more than a relatively average score (It got an 8 from me) - they all fit well with their characters and made them more believable.One of the things I wasn't expecting to be astounded or moved by was the characters in this anime, though I was rather pleasantly surprised. The two main characters are the driving force of this anime, though it doesn't have much of a present plot the way their characters develop because of the other was intriguing and sweet, and it made me want to keep watching to see if each would succeed in helping the other develop. I also enjoyed most of the supporting cast, with the exception of Natsume Zange (stupid bunny guy). One of my favourites was Roromiya Karuta, because the idea of such a quietly-spoken sweet person turning into a giant skeleton tickled me.I really did enjoy this anime. It kept me wanting to watch, if only to see how each of the main characters turned out or if they changed by the end of the series.

That being said for the majority of the show it felt like there was more chemistry & romantic development between two side characters than the main couple and that the whole side character cast had more to offer than the two leads. in a complete lack of chemistry.On top of that even though the Female Lead is someone who can't convey their thoughts correctly and we hear her true thoughts at times, the show spends a majority of its episodes with an inactive female lead who never develops or progresses, seemingly until the final 2-3 episodes.All while that's happening you get episodes that feel like long running anime filler with little to no main character developments or experiences.

Whether because I was too tired at the time writing, lost interest or clearly overexaggerated. Therefore, my reviews might be changed in the future since I have more to add-on to. Thanks for reading.SPOILERS:Story 6/10:As the description and everyone else in their reviews have been saying: this is an anime that deals with 15 year old Ririchiyo Shirakiin and her struggles with her personal issue of badmouthing everyone, because she lacks proper communication skills.So she then moves to...Maison de Ayakashi (The complex building in the anime) to get away from her family and for peace and solitude (I think, I forgot). It is a place where half-human, half-yokai reside and live together. Ririchiyo also being a descendent of one as well.Although, little did she know someone in her family hired a secret service agent for her. Thus it begins of the tale of Ririchiyo and her secret service agent, Miketsukami.Oh, man!! The premise sure does sound interesting, doesn\'t it???No. Just... no. If you couldn\'t tell from my score of this anime, it\'s pretty obvious of what tone I\'m going to display soon. If you like this anime, but you\'re reading this review, you have been warned.So, let\'s go over the story one more time. What do I mean by this? Well, I already just discussed a little slice of the pie for the story. And even the description makes this anime sound interesting. But it\'s really not. This is like- no, IS a slice of life, a really boring one at that too.So even though it sounds like it has a cool premise to it, it\'s really the everyday life of Ririchiyo going through life with her buddies at the apartment complex, and her interactions with Miketsukami and both of them trying to ""understand each other"".Oh, did I mention they do and worry about pointless and very miniscule things? Especially stupid Watanuki wanting revenge on Miketsukami and then the episode is about some game or something orchestrated by Zange, because Watanuki can\'t keep his mouth shut.Art/Animation 5/10:The art is alright. It\'s not the best I\'ve seen; but not the worst either. Average for 2010s art. It can be beautiful sometimes, other times average and passable.Sound 5/10:Some of the sounds are interesting... I don\'t mean in a positive way. Some of them sound like they\'re from SpongeBob SquarePants.The music is alright. I mean... it works.Characters 6/10:Most of them I don\'t like whatsoever.Ririchiyo:I have mixed feelings. I like her sometimes, but then I don\'t. She over-complicates and over-thinks every goddamn situation in this anime. I find it very cringe, over-exaggerated and over-the-top. She\'s also one of the most annoying female characters in this show other than Nobara and Chino (the maid)The only reason I like her sometimes is because she can be funny and relatable slightly. But hearing her thoughts on every little thing or her last interactions with the others, or Miketsukami, makes me cringe and makes me want to chop my limbs off and bathe in my blood.On the positive note, she has a cute and nice design but I hate how in the anime they sexualize her. I\'m like... bro, she is only 15 years old. Just stop.Nobara wants to have her fantasys about her and stick her fingers in Ririchiyo\'s thigh, Zange talks about the color of her pantys and that she weared lace one time. HELL- EVEN THE DESCRIPTION MENTIONS SHE\'S ""PETITE"" JUST...WHY???Miketsukami:Where do I even start with this guy??? I liked him him in the first couple of episodes but then I kind of stopped altogether after episode 3 or 4. He comes off as polite, somewhat endearing, and most of all... submissive, but it\'s creepy.He is hella repetitious with the pure and innocent attitude. ""Miss Ririchiyo, this piece of paper means the world to me! I shall read it everyday."" (he didn\'t actually say that, but it\'s something he would say) It\'s very annoying, and gets old quickly. Thank god I don\'t have anyone in my life like this. By the way, this guy is in his early 20s, and Ririchiyo is 15, and there\'s romance... YIKES.That is a BIG ISSUE in this anime but the characters in this anime, and some reviewers view it as normal or have no problem, because they aren\'t doing the dirty (also because she is mature for her age...bruh). Right... let me just take a 1,000 steps back from you.Also, when they do start getting romantic and dating each other (yes, it happened.) this motherfucker when Ririchiyo tells him to stop being romantic around her because of children watching he says ""Isn\'t it more exciting?"" ARE. YOU. FUCKING. KIDDING. ME... ARE YOU? This is the same guy who said he didn\'t really like children. But you\'re DATING a 15 year old and have no problem with kissing her and stuff around CHILDREN. AMAZING (sarcasm).Nobara:This is one of the most annoying female characters in this anime. She is gay, and she hates males. She makes me sick and disgusted perving on teenage females, treating Sorinozuka like shit, and every time she moans she makes me uncomfortable. But I really hate how she hates males. It\'s fine to not like a certain thing or person but you\'re hating something someone could not control when they came into existence. I hope she never finds a girlfriend with that kind of attitude. Plus, I\'m not even gonna lie, Nobara has shit taste in females lol.Chino:Oh my god... words cannot describe my hate for her. She is everything I hate in a female character. She has a high pitched voice, is clueless to make her more cute I guess, and to top it off... energetic and laughs OBNOXIOUSLY. Seriously, how did she not understand Nobara when she explained that one thing in the Ayakashi Kan episode. Nobara said it in the most simplistic way and she still didn\'t get it. She got dropped on her head as a baby? Wtf. I\'m not trans myself, but I found it disrespectful for those trans jokes she made to Ayumu the ""wise tranny!"". It wasn\'t necessary, made me hate her even more and it would be best for her to just keep her fucking mouth shut. A really unlikeable character she is.Only characters that are cool in this anime are Sorinozuka and Karuta. They both mind their own business, are caring, and are all around gluttonous like me. They never stop eating and think about what they\'re going to eat. Especially Sorinozuka, really caring guy with chill vibes and cares about everyone and puts up with Nobara\'s shit. Seriously, dude compliments her or makes a light-hearted joke and she treats him like SHIT. I feel bad for him one of the only male characters I really like.Watanuki just keeps calling himself a delinquent, but he is really a kind guy. He can be annoying with that because if you keep calling yourself a delinquent, you\'re not a delinquent. Only a wannabe one. Zange is an alright character, wish he wouldn\'t talk about Ririchiyo\'s pantys sometimes, It is unecessary. Kagerou is... Kagerou. But he does kinda make everything better with the comedy in the english dub and even though he spouts nonsense, he was right about Watanuki being a masochist and Miketsukami being a sadist but not showing it.Enjoyment 4/10:It was very painful but there was some comedic charm. Some parts I liked some I didn\'t. I laughed more than I should but it got REALLY boring as well. A good mix of both. Because the characters worry about pointless and useless things so I was praying the episodes got done fast.Overall 5/10:This was very painful to sit through. But unfortunately, I finish what I started when it comes to anime, it\'s my golden rule because I\'m curious to see the ending. This is one of those animes I watched 4-5 years ago and didn\'t finish but I don\'t remember it being THIS BORING. The first time I watched it 4-5 years ago I thought Ririchiyo was 18 and her buddies too becasue the way she dresses and acts, but nope. I watched the specials too, won\'t make a review for it but wasn\'t hard to sit through. The whole time I watched this anime I was thinking ""why was this made?"" It is LITERALLY just a slice of life. Why does it say there is shonen? For those pointless little fights they have in this anime WHY is there shonen? Then there is also the age gap problem, was this shit made by a lolicon or something? Gross. I didn\'t cry or anything either at the end because I don\'t care for the characters and because of the age gap problem (age gap reminds me of Happy Sugar Life). I got more emotional watching Shiki (corpse demon) than this piece of shit. I will say... A sharp-tonged girl and a guy who deceives other people truly do deserve each other... not in a good way, either.So if you like slice of life, age gap and characters worrying about pointless things because of Watanuki this is for you. As for me, I\'m not going to remember 95% of this anime and I\'m off to another probably more enjoyable one. This took way too much energy and time. Although I will never read the manga, I\'m pretty sure it is better than the anime. This was a waste of time in general. Maison de Ayakashi (The complex building in the anime) to get away from her family and for peace and solitude (I think, I forgot). It is a place where half-human, half-yokai reside and live together.

Right... let me just take a 1,000 steps back from you.Also, when they do start getting romantic and dating each other (yes, it happened.) this motherfucker when Ririchiyo tells him to stop being romantic around her because of children watching he says ""Isn\'t it more exciting?"" ARE. YOU. FUCKING. KIDDING. ME... ARE YOU? This is the same guy who said he didn\'t really like children. But you\'re DATING a 15 year old and have no problem with kissing her and stuff around CHILDREN. AMAZING (sarcasm).Nobara:This is one of the most annoying female characters in this anime. She is gay, and she hates males. She makes me sick and disgusted perving on teenage females, treating Sorinozuka like shit, and every time she moans she makes me uncomfortable. But I really hate how she hates males. It\'s fine to not like a certain thing or person but you\'re hating something someone could not control when they came into existence. I hope she never finds a girlfriend with that kind of attitude. Plus, I\'m not even gonna lie, Nobara has shit taste in females lol.Chino:Oh my god... words cannot describe my hate for her. She is everything I hate in a female character. She has a high pitched voice, is clueless to make her more cute I guess, and to top it off... energetic and laughs OBNOXIOUSLY. Seriously, how did she not understand Nobara when she explained that one thing in the Ayakashi Kan episode. Nobara said it in the most simplistic way and she still didn\'t get it. She got dropped on her head as a baby? Wtf. I\'m not trans myself, but I found it disrespectful for those trans jokes she made to Ayumu the ""wise tranny!"". It wasn\'t necessary, made me hate her even more and it would be best for her to just keep her fucking mouth shut. A really unlikeable character she is.Only characters that are cool in this anime are Sorinozuka and Karuta. They both mind their own business, are caring, and are all around gluttonous like me. They never stop eating and think about what they\'re going to eat. Especially Sorinozuka, really caring guy with chill vibes and cares about everyone and puts up with Nobara\'s shit. Seriously, dude compliments her or makes a light-hearted joke and she treats him like SHIT. I feel bad for him one of the only male characters I really like.Watanuki just keeps calling himself a delinquent, but he is really a kind guy. He can be annoying with that because if you keep calling yourself a delinquent, you\'re not a delinquent. Only a wannabe one. Zange is an alright character, wish he wouldn\'t talk about Ririchiyo\'s pantys sometimes, It is unecessary. Kagerou is... Kagerou. But he does kinda make everything better with the comedy in the english dub and even though he spouts nonsense, he was right about Watanuki being a masochist and Miketsukami being a sadist but not showing it.Enjoyment 4/10:It was very painful but there was some comedic charm. Some parts I liked some I didn\'t. I laughed more than I should but it got REALLY boring as well. A good mix of both. Because the characters worry about pointless and useless things so I was praying the episodes got done fast.Overall 5/10:This was very painful to sit through. But unfortunately, I finish what I started when it comes to anime, it\'s my golden rule because I\'m curious to see the ending. This is one of those animes I watched 4-5 years ago and didn\'t finish but I don\'t remember it being THIS BORING. The first time I watched it 4-5 years ago I thought Ririchiyo was 18 and her buddies too becasue the way she dresses and acts, but nope. I watched the specials too, won\'t make a review for it but wasn\'t hard to sit through. The whole time I watched this anime I was thinking ""why was this made?"" It is LITERALLY just a slice of life. Why does it say there is shonen? For those pointless little fights they have in this anime WHY is there shonen? Then there is also the age gap problem, was this shit made by a lolicon or something? Gross. I didn\'t cry or anything either at the end because I don\'t care for the characters and because of the age gap problem (age gap reminds me of Happy Sugar Life). I got more emotional watching Shiki (corpse demon) than this piece of shit. I will say... A sharp-tonged girl and a guy who deceives other people truly do deserve each other... not in a good way, either.So if you like slice of life, age gap and characters worrying about pointless things because of Watanuki this is for you. As for me, I\'m not going to remember 95% of this anime and I\'m off to another probably more enjoyable one. This took way too much energy and time. Although I will never read the manga, I\'m pretty sure it is better than the anime. This was a waste of time in general.', '[Eng]Honestly, I\'m deeply disappointed with this anime, I rarely give such a low rating to a work, but this one deserves it, because I\'ve never seen an anime capable of deceiving me in such a dark way and making me feel PHYSICAL PAIN with such a disgusting ending. I rarely feel this way, but the ending of this anime ACHIEVED this feat.Here are the explanations:I\'ve known this anime since I was a teenager, it became famous in a fandom of a dating simulator game that I participated in, as Soushi resembled one of the boys in the game in appearance, so, even if I...had never finished the anime, I had a good emotional memory with Inu X Boku SS because of nostalgia. However, now older, I decided to give it a chance and finally see what awaited me at the end of this anime; Everything was going ""well"" throughout the episodes, I put it in quotes because Kagerou is very strange, but I left it out because he made me laugh a few times, I had a really good feeling at one point because I LOVE Natsume Zange, I think his design is very beautiful, he\'s interesting and funny (too bad he has little screen time), I also really like Roromiya, I think she\'s really cute! Right! I reached the final episode and halfway through, I was already thinking about the grade I would give to the anime, a very high grade indeed, because the way events were unfolding, I thought the ending would be: Ririchiyo fell in love with Soushi but not necessarily she would break up with him and this passion made her want to change for a better person; If this were the ending, I would find it AMAZING and exciting! It definitely deserved a good grade!ALTHOUGH! My dreams were ruined by the infamous scene where Soushi, a 22 year old man, kisses Ririchiyo, a 15 year old girl, in front of SEVERAL CHILDREN with Ririchiyo CLEARLY uncomfortable asking him to hold on, but no, Soushi smells her neck making that scene even more erotic and disgusting... Seriously, I felt so uncomfortable, it had been a while since an anime gave me such a bad feeling... But do you think that was the end of my suffering? No. I was already at the height of my discomfort, I wanted the episode to end soon to end all my memories of how Japan is problematic with this children\'s issue, so what do they put at the end? Just Soushi and Ririchiyo lying on a couch with him saying he wanted to have a CHILD with her.... Look, I swear, Soushi has always been weird to me, he\'s clearly a weird obsessive stalker, but even though that\'s super toxic, I I didn\'t feel angry with him or anything like that, he was just neutral to me (just like Kagerou, strange but neutral), but as soon as he dared to say that he wanted to have children with Ririchiyo, with her, remembering, BEING 15 YEARS OLD, I It made me wish a meteor would fall and kill Soushi right there....Anyway, that was my statement, I\'m sure many won\'t agree, I really don\'t care, the ending of this anime brought me something much deeper than just a bad ending, it made me feel DISGUSTED for something I was enjoying so much. ... I finish Inu x Boku SS with my heart broken.....[PT-BR]Honestamente, estou profundamente decepcionada com esse anime, eu raramente dou uma nota tão baixa pra uma obra, mas essa merece, pois eu nunca vi um anime capaz de me enganar de uma forma tão tenebrosa e me fazer sentir DOR FÍSICA com um final tão nojento, eu raramente sinto isso, mas o final desse anime CONSEGUIU essa proeza.Vamos as explicações:Conheço esse anime desde a adolescência, ele ficou famoso num fandom de um jogo de dating simulador em que eu participava, pois Soushi se assemelhava na aparência com um dos rapazes do jogo, então, mesmo que eu nunca tivesse concluído o anime, eu tinha uma boa memória afetiva com Inu X Boku SS por conta da nostalgia.Porém, agora mais velha, decidi dar uma chance e finalmente ver o que me aguardava no final desse anime; estava indo tudo ""bem"" ao decorrer dos episódios, coloquei entre aspas pois Kagerou é bem esquisito, mas relevei pois ele me tirou algumas risadas, eu tive uma sensação muito boa certa hora pois eu AMO Natsume Zange, acho o design dele muito bonito, ele é interessante e engraçado (pena que tem pouco tempo de tela), também gosto bastante de Roromiya, acho ela bem fofa! Certo! Cheguei no episódio final e na metade, eu já estava pensando na nota que daria para o anime, uma nota bem alta inclusive, pois do jeito que estava se desenrolando os acontecimentos, pensei que o final seria: Ririchiyo se apaixonou por Soushi mas não necessariamente terminaria com ele e essa paixão a fez querer mudar para uma pessoa melhor; se o final fosse esse, eu acharia INCRÍVEL e emocionante! Com certeza merecia uma boa nota!PORÉM! Meus sonhos foram estragados com a famigerada cena onde Soushi, um homem de 22 anos, beija a Ririchiyo, uma menina de 15 anos, na frente de VÁRIAS CRIANÇAS com Ririchiyo CLARAMENTE desconfortável pedindo para ele dar uma segurada, mas não, Soushi cheira seu pescoço tornando aquela cena ainda mais erótica e nojenta... É sério, eu me senti tão desconfortável, já fazia tempo que um anime não me invocava uma sensação tão ruim assim... Mas vocês pensam que acabou por aí o meu sofrimento? Não.Eu já estava no auge do meu desconforto, queria que o episódio acabasse logo para acabar com todas as minhas lembranças de como o Japão é problemático com essa questão infantil, aí o que eles colocam no final?Simplesmente Soushi e Ririchiyo deitados num sofá com ele dizendo que queria ter um FILHO com ela.... Olha, eu juro, Soushi sempre foi esquisito para mim, ele é claramente um stalker obsessivo e estranho, mas mesmo isso sendo super tóxico, eu não sentia raiva dele ou algo do tipo, ele era apenas neutro para mim (assim como Kagerou, estranho porém neutro), mas assim que ele ousou dizer que queria ter filhos com Ririchiyo, com ela, lembrando, TENDO 15 ANOS DE IDADE, me fez desejar que um meteoro caísse e matasse Soushi ali mesmo....Enfim, essa foi minha declaração, tenho certeza que muitos não vão concordar, eu realmente não me importo, o final desse anime me trouxe algo muito mais profundo do que só um final ruim, me fez sentir NOJO por algo que eu estava gostando tanto....

Termino Inu x Boku SS com meu coração partido.', ""After watching the first episode I was expecting this series to turn into a bishonen harem show, but to my delight, I was mistaken. The closest similar anime I can think of is Fruits Basket, though Inu x Boku has more comedy and less heart-warming-ness (?) than FB. The slightly ecchi humor may not be for everyone, but I think it's a good balance for the more wholesome themes of love, friendship, and trust that make up the rest of the story. Watching as Ririchiyo slowly retracted her thorns and thawed her heart was sweet. (And her outfits are just TOO cute!)For most of...the show, the only thing I didn't like about the series was her bodyguard's inexplicably extreme level of devotion and submission to her. Of course, that isn't explained until the series' climax and then it all makes sense. If there's one thing that I would've liked to have seen, it would have been more exploration or usage of the secondary characters. They seemed intriguing enough that each one could've provided an episode or two of backstory/sidequest.Overall, I like that Inu x Boku did not fall into any of the typical overdone anime storylines and/or tropes that we've come to expect. It's a modest, mildly sweet, and fairly unique work. the show, the only thing I didn't like about the series was her bodyguard's inexplicably extreme level of devotion and submission to her.

Kemono Jihen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40908/Kemono_Jihen,"[""Kemono Jihen is, without a doubt, the dark horse of Winter 2021. Dark, not only in its fame and premises that are being overshadowed, but also in its plot and story that twists the audience around its bloody, red hand-gloves.Among tons of promising sequels and exciting, intriguing anime that are pumped into this season, I step into watching this show with no clue whatsoever it is about, and it left me impressed with the gory yet thrilling adventure of the protagonists against the relentless demons, warm my heart with a genuine portrayal of friendship that exceeds 'protect to protect' values, and really blew my expectation...away.In a society where demons of different races and classes exist unbeknownst to the human, it's up to a detective office cooperating with the higher-up in police officials to keep the boundary between two kinds clear, and visible. The main character, a child with high regenerative skill and enormous brute strength is recruited into the detective team from outskirt.But, there's a catch: he doesn't know love, and is emotionless.As the plot progresses, ensemble characters with different talents, and most importantly, captivatingly dark background stories intertwine together. It's almost like a celebration of a cluster of broken demons, yet with human emotions, that are brought together for a chance to live—regardless of the numbing pain that are yet to be unfolded, or lingering truth that are to be discovered.Strangely, it is because of their childish like interaction and casual exchange of worries and concerns that forge the trio's (sometimes, quartet) relationship. It's not 'tomo-tachi' (friends) given the perilous and critical nature of their work, but it's 'nakama' (comrades) between them that added much depth to their bond. When one of them is in pinch, they do not shout or fill themselves with flashbacks to fuel their power and become temporarily invincible.They cry.Like a little child; because, in many senses, they are. They cannot shoulder the whole responsibility and burden that the world dropped on them by themselves. And this is where the depiction of comrades, where they would rely on each other, comes in through the perspective of the emotionless main character, Kabane. It is precisely because he sees thing subjectively—evil as evil, good as good—that he can evoke the best in his comrades, that they know how frustrating it is to be powerless and how powerful feelings, emotions are. And, as he learns more about the meaning of empathy, with love in its many shapes and forms with his comrades, I believe the story will reach much greater heights than what were depicted.As for the animation, the fighting sequences are fluid and colorful; for the soundtracks, the music matches the ambience the show was going for perfectly. It seeps in creepy, thrilling piano notes in the moments of suspense and danger, while giving off a blood-pumping, hopeful, evil-hero-like vibe when the protagonists are face-to-faced with the merciless demons. The opening is great, with its editing matching the tempo of the songs while the J-rock ending ended each episode in a positive note.Overall, Kemono Jihen is a show that wraps its hidden dark elements, and stories inside layers of pure, and genuine bond of reliance that the protagonists share, exhibiting their fragile, yet unyielding determination and emotions. It can get really, really dark sometimes, yet at the same time, you couldn't help but to crave for more of their heartfelt moments.So, if you're into exploring some supernatural stories of demons through the eyes of young protagonists, I'd definitely recommend Kemono Jihen. Beware though, as it could shock and traumatize your senses, then warm and melt your heart when you least expected it. away.In a society where demons of different races and classes exist unbeknownst to the human, it's up to a detective office cooperating with the higher-up in police officials to keep the boundary between two kinds clear, and visible. The main character, a child with high regenerative skill and enormous brute strength is recruited into the detective team from outskirt.But, there's a catch: he doesn't know love, and is emotionless.As the plot progresses, ensemble characters with different talents, and most importantly, captivatingly dark background stories intertwine together. It's almost like a celebration of a cluster of broken demons, yet with human emotions, that are brought together for a chance to live—regardless of the numbing pain that are yet to be unfolded, or lingering truth that are to be discovered.Strangely, it is because of their childish like interaction and casual exchange of worries and concerns that forge the trio's (sometimes, quartet) relationship. It's not 'tomo-tachi' (friends) given the perilous and critical nature of their work, but it's 'nakama' (comrades) between them that added much depth to their bond. When one of them is in pinch, they do not shout or fill themselves with flashbacks to fuel their power and become temporarily invincible.They cry.Like a little child; because, in many senses, they are. They cannot shoulder the whole responsibility and burden that the world dropped on them by themselves. And this is where the depiction of comrades, where they would rely on each other, comes in through the perspective of the emotionless main character, Kabane. It is precisely because he sees thing subjectively—evil as evil, good as good—that he can evoke the best in his comrades, that they know how frustrating it is to be powerless and how powerful feelings, emotions are. And, as he learns more about the meaning of empathy, with love in its many shapes and forms with his comrades, I believe the story will reach much greater heights than what were depicted.As for the animation, the fighting sequences are fluid and colorful; for the soundtracks, the music matches the ambience the show was going for perfectly.

So much so that I've gone ahead and checked out the manga, and hoping to keep up with it after it finishes. It has interested me that much. From it's story, characters, to how the overall themes look in general. They really can make Kemono Jihen look terrifying, but also great at the same time, let me explain.Art and sound:Since I just touched upon both, let me explain. This isn't a happy go lucky anime, which of course means a more darker tone on some of the scenes. But it's well done here, they really make...things look disturbing, creepy, and disturbing. Even the sound in each of those scenes, it really adds to the entire atmosphere of the entire show. But they also can make more brighter scenes stand out too, with a tone and style that fits the scenes that they are in. Not too bright, but that right kind of tone. Which is great.Story and charactersHere is where it really comes into it's own. We start of following as the plot is described on here, the case behind these dead animals, and what is truly going on. Only to learn hidden truths, and what Kemono are, as Kemono are all kinds of creatures. Think Youkai culture in some cases, think Touhou, think Kyokou Suiri and how all those have some of their creatures of all types. Within this show, there are all types of Kemono, from those who'll attack and feed, to those being more good, to those being an evil bitch. A good mix range that can only provide more entertainment. As we come to a detective agency, dealing with all types of strange quests involving Kemono such as of course solving the case of dead animals, to helping a guy fall in love with a cat lady, along with meeting a rather dangerous foe in the form in Inari Yoko.Speaking of characters, let's talk about them!We have our two MCs, one being Kabane, who can come across as being blank and emotionless, but that's more that he hasn't experienced these emotions as of yet, or hasn't got an understanding of how things work unless he's guided, but he's still a good character. We have Inugami, the head of the agency, and seemingly the good at his job cool customer type, while having a bit of sneakiness to him, a really respectable guy who does what is right. We also have Akira whom has the longest name I've seen I swear, a real germaphobe, as he hates gross things, and can come off as your typical social media buzz person, the type that'll spend all day on it. Next we have Shiki, whom I can best describe as Bakugo honestly. With how he reacts at least, but he's got a good head on his shoulders. Finally so far we have Kon whom wants to be a good girl and gets upset when she isn't, a real cutie. Compared to her boss Yoko, whom is a right controlling bitch. But a good written villain for sure.It's blend of characters is a real highlight of the show, as each of them mesh well together, and I can't wait to see future episodes of when certain scenes are animated, so we can see more of the characters and what they have to offer. It's gonna be so great, you'll love them as much as I did.Kemono Jihen is honestly a secret hit of the season, I dig it, you'll dig it, we'll all dig it.

He is like an empty vessel without any emotions, feelings, etc (until he is thought).Kemono Jihen mainly stresses on the topic which revolves around kids who have some special abilities which is different from normal humans, which makes those kids Kemono (meaning monster).The MC starts off living in a small village where he thinks that he is the only one like a monster until he meets a dude. Then the dude takes MC to his place in Tokyo and with other kids, the MC starts going on missions related to Kemono...stuffs.Things I liked ->1) The MC is cold which makes him to thinks less and and fight more.2) The teamwork of the MC and other kids.3) A slight romance in this action anime.4) Every episode has a humorous laughing effect.Finally, this anime is best suited for binging. stuffs.Things I liked ->1) The MC is cold which makes him to thinks less and and fight more.2) The teamwork of the MC and other kids.3) A slight romance in this action anime.4) Every episode has a humorous laughing effect.Finally, this anime is best suited for binging.', 'This show can best be summed up and described this way (with the help of a former friend of whom this description fits to a T):The world not as simple as it seems. Together with humans, there exists another type of being: they are called Kemono: supernatural monsters, spirits, and demons, whom used to co-exist peacefully. However, one day, a war broke out. Some thought that humans were behind it, since they instinctively discriminate against races different than themselves, and others think that Kemono were at fault. Sometime after, the story brings us to a remote village. For some time now, dead animals have been...found there. Kohachi Inugami, the owner of a detective agency that specializes in the occult, meets a neglected boy named Kusaka ""Dorotabou"" Kabane in a remote village, who is avoided by all villagers and works instead of going to school. And it turns out that Kabane is a half-ghoul, whose true nature is suppressed by a lifestone. Kabane is always discriminated and labelled as the mud Yokai, will he help the detective uncover the truth behind the animal killings?Kemono Jihen is one of those works that you rarely see about very often, much less the obscurity of the manga since it was released in Jump Square (instead of the more popular Weekly Shonen Jump), despite having all the common bells and whistles you would think of in the typical Shounen genre. At first glance, it\'ll definitely remind you of the similarities due to the dark fantasy and supernatural genres that are closely reminiscent of Bungou Stray Dogs, from the setting of the ""detective"" theme to the main character whose personality is like Dororo, unbeknownst to his main power and only being accompanied by the small numbers whom have encountered for the mystery and supernatural realisms. In fact, from the moment when the story plot starts moving from the get-go, there is this alluring sense that all is not what it seems, and the next thing you know, you\'ve sunk your teeth deep into this rabbit hole that keeps the constant grip on your toes as to where circumstances would go. Think of it like Kyokou Suiri (a.k.a In/Spectre): a great 1-to-1 adaptation, but without the heavy exposition and easy storytelling and progression that will keeps you glued to the episodes for a few hours on end. Although the presentation demographic is different from Bungou Stray Dogs, don\'t let that fool you into thinking that teenagers don\'t have it just as hard as adults, nope. In fact, it\'s quite mature with its dark themes and intrepid to the ghoulish, macabre and grisly nature.Mostly a character-driven story, where I can give praise to Kemono Jihen, lies with the characters that can sometimes be quite morbid in their ways, but I feel that they should be given more recognition:- Our MC is Kabane ""Dorotabo"" Kusaka, a 13-year-old human-ghoul hybrid. An abandoned kid with little to no education of the world, what he is able in is limited of the little common sense that he has. The lifestone (or Life Calculus) in his possession is a gateway to understanding both his control of the thirst for ghoulish thirst, as well as finding out the connections of his parents, and the rest is history. Being someone who looks innocent and straightforward, he has a self-sacrifical spirit of always being ready to put his life on the line for others when danger strikes, since he is an immortal, provided his head stays intact. He\'s the experiential definition of ""Act first, think later"".- The detective in question is Kohachi Inugami. As you\'ve guessed, he\'s also a Kemono, and a strong tanuki at that, often referred to as ""the Kemonoist"". Running his own occult consultancy office to take care of specialized Kemono-centric issues is a cinch when the outside world practically does not know that Kemono co-exist, and he\'s the meditator between both humans and Kemono beastkin alike, other than managing the care and concern of fellow teenage Kemono under him, and seeks to long for a world where both humans and Kemono can co-exist.- The first of three Kemono under Inugami\'s belt: Shiki Tademaru, a 14-year-old Arachne-human hybrid who had been passed into Inugami\'s custody by his uncle Akio. Acting like a tsundere for the most part, Shiki can be often as brash and rude, and at worst, seem off-putting than most, but it is for this reason alone that as time progresses, he grows to be rational and level-headed in making sure to taking good care of them at the same time, an influence from his family of a single mom and 8-year-old daughter Aya (who thinks maturely but acts immaturely) who are also Arachne Kemono.- The second of three Kemono under Inugami\'s belt: Akira Iwakiyama-yuki-sa-to-Shirona-no-go-Juuroku-shi (that\'s a mouthful), or best translated as ""The 56th child of Shirona of the Snow Village in Mount Iwaki"", because he is a descendant of a Yuki-onna. Despite Akira\'s lifestyle of embracing feminity by acting like a girl and doing all the stuff that girls like or tend to do, Akira is a he, not a she. So in retrospect, not a tomboy, but a tomgirl. He mostly takes care of affairs within the Inugami occult office, due to his hate for disgusting things and if encountered, cowers and faints at fear\'s door. Having a twin Yuki-okono brother (Yui) whose fate was to become the chief of a Yuki-onna village for nothing more than a tool of sexual reproduction for pride and ego reasons, that\'s as dark and gutsy as it can get.- The last of three Kemono under Inugami\'s belt: Mihai, an immortal vampire, but a shut-in NEET whose mentorship under Inugami has seen a fair share of him being a ""Jack of all trades, Master of all"" from utilizing technology for hacking purposes and communication from an online perspective. He\'s quite the over-bearing character with a narcisstic mindset, yet he doesn\'t go without the reluctance of help every once in a while.- And what\'s a good team of ""protagonists"" without a good team of antagonists? And Inari Yoko is just that: the beautiful and alluring kitsune Kemono, serving for both humans and Kemono as the superintendent of a police force, while under the farce that this is all but solidifying her position in the human society to one day bethrone the inevitable conflict between humans and Kemono due to her ruthless ways of self-satisfaction and vile manipulation. Under her belt are two kitsune Kemonos: 19-year-old Nobimaru and loyal follower Kon. Despite Nobimaru\'s shape-shifting abilities to attune to the same age as the Kemono under Inugami, his intelligence is backed by his personality of being a witty crafter of lies, and much like Inari, can manipulative circumstances to his advantage. Kon on the other hand, she follows wherever Inari may go, despite the fact that like Kabane, she\'s used as a tool to advance the former\'s tactics, and all that\'s required of Kon towards Inari is recognition that she is a ""good girl"". May Kabane rescue Kon from Inari\'s hands one day, and let the sail ship between them.I find it quite fascinating for such a decades-old studio like Ajia-Do, I\'m presuming that the studio is trying to find what works for them, despite the low, yet consistent output of at least 1 show per year (just to maintain business as usual). Just look at the shows made by the studio in recent years: Isekai Maou was a decent job done, while both Isekai Bookworm and Kakushigoto firmly solidified the studio as being capable to perform in Slice-of-Life works, though this is the first time that the studio has returned to doing an action-heavy show since 2016\'s Shuumatsu no Izetta (that is averagely tacked-on mediocrity). Personally, I\'d like the studio to focus more on their bread-and-butter genre expertise, though I can\'t fault that the presentation in Kemono Jihen is finger lickin\' good and consistent throughout. Truly ""Are you (un)afraid of the Dark?"" levels of surrealism. Likewise with the music, it pretty much fits the whole dark theme to a T here as well. Once again, the massively popular Seiyuu Daisuke Ono hits the nail with the OP and Sayaka Sasaki with the ED, you couldn\'t have asked for a better OST than this. But honestly, though the production team isn\'t what you can call them strong, all I\'ve ever needed from a show like this is just one word: consistency, for the art of balancing skill and expertise, and that\'s all it matters.A hidden gem amongst the ever increasing popularity of contemporary Shounen series, yet easily overshadowed by the same circumstances as well. Everyone should check this out, and if you decide to pick this up, watch this on a binge, it\'ll do you good to keep you hooked from start to finish. found there.

Kemono Jihen really is an underrated, hidden gem that hooks you in from the first episode.The show may look kiddy to you but don\'t let appearences fool you as it is a surprisingly mature and dark show. Part of the new wave of ""darker"" shonens that are unafraid to show morbid, disturbing things every so often.That said, even though the atmosphere when our gang goes out solving mysteries is often dark and unforgiving and contrasts heavily from the lighthearted and wholesome slice of life moments that...are equally as enjoyable, Kemono Jihen still preserves a lot of its childlike innocence as we slowly discover what it means to live as a normal person, and not a monster with our protagonist, Kabane.Our main cast, which comprises mostly of kids so far, are all extremely endearing and adorable characters you can easily empathise with or relate to. They all have their own unique traits and personalities and I really enjoy the genuine and sincere interactions they have with each other in their found family of sorts. I\'ve never felt this deeply attached to a cast of characters from an anime in a really long time, which attests to the anime\'s skillfulness at tugging at your heartstrings as the emotional moments will really get you feeling something.I\'m only 5 episodes in so far but Kemono Jihen has been a brilliant, competently animated show this season everyone ought to check out are equally as enjoyable, Kemono Jihen still preserves a lot of its childlike innocence as we slowly discover what it means to live as a normal person, and not a monster with our protagonist, Kabane.Our main cast, which comprises mostly of kids so far, are all extremely endearing and adorable characters you can easily empathise with or relate to.

Oh well, honestly, probably for the better. The whole ""every good guy lives"" and ""MC protecting his friends"" tropes are really getting old.Kemono Jihen is a good example of a modern shounen integrating ""mature"" themes while also trying to relay as little good storytelling as possible by using edgy shock value while not developing characters in any meaningful way. It tries to integrate brutality into a morally good cast of characters, and while this can work, the execution of these themes are terrible to say the least.I\'m only...going to focus on Shiki, because it just highlights this absolutely horrendous edgy shock value story telling at its finest.Spoilers ahead, but trust me, nothing much of value has to be said about the story.At the point of the story where you reach Shiki\'s backstory, you already know that the main cast of characters have performed a few missions, few of which include killing anthropomorphic and intelligent beings, all of which were warranted. That being said, no humans have been harmed or killed by our main characters. You get where I\'m going with this?Shiki\'s uncle performed many atrocities on his mother. Forcefully jailing her, inseminating her for many years to forcefully breed offspring, and Shiki, morally scarred and scared of reality, runs away at the prospect of her mother\'s plight. So far so good.Many years later, Shiki comes back to discover the truth. Guilty because he abandoned his mother and fueled with rage, he storms upon his Uncle and decides to kill him. Using shounen storytelling tropes, of course he is able to escape. Shiki has a mental breakdown after being confronted with all of his mother\'s offspring, and loses motivation to kill his uncle. After having Kabane kill all of his mother\'s offspring, Shiki decides to spare his Uncle. Using arguments such as ""He\'ll have a fate worse than death if he lives,"" ""Killing him won\'t bring back my mother,"" he decides to spare his Uncle.What\'s wrong with this picture? First of all, I\'d really like to point out the timeline of these events. They\'re extremely close! Shiki goes through more mental development than an adult would do in their entire life in the span of a few days. He gets over his guilt and trauma, gets over his rage, and becomes and enlightened one over the span of a day or so. It\'s extremely surprising to me that he would not, in a fit of rage, just immediately kill his Uncle, but I guess we have the ""shounen"" genre to thank for that. Sure, could you ""reasonably"" say that Shiki could have matured so much? Yeah, as much as Ellie could have rationally spared Abby. Again, even Ellie in TLOU2 has around 60 hours of character development while our boy Shiki has 20 minutes, so Ellie\'s actions make a bit more sense than Shiki\'s. It\'s so frustrating seeing how Shiki spares his Uncle without much of a solid reason; his mentality changes way too quickly. He just commanded all of his siblings to die, and yet he\'s going to let the perpetrator of all of his pain get away? In fact, you could say that his siblings had no sin, and yet, they took the brunt of his rage, while his actual source of grief and rage is let of scot free. Oh yeah, he\'s a better person after killing many innocents because he let his main source of rage go. But wait, his siblings were half monster. Wait a second, he himself is half monster. All of his allies are also half monster. What gives? Well, if you don\'t look human, you\'re just a monster still! Fire at will. Perfect reasoning. Human looking monster = good, monster looking monster =kill. But wait! They\'re less intelligent than humans, so they\'re just animals. Yeah, how about we just kill all mentally disabled while we\'re at it?For people thinking that revenge is immature and that Shiki\'s reasoning was solid, I\'d really like to see how they\'d react if they had their loved ones tortured and raped for years before their eyes. There\'s not a shred of ""well, his Uncle had some good in him,"" in which you could perhaps argue for someone like Abby in TLOU2. Again, this is a good example of how the show loves to frame people as ""100% good, or 100% bad,"" and nothing in between. Or how about the argument that ""him living is worse than death because I can deny any sort of future achievements he might have."" Well, killing him would be the absolute fool-proof plan on eliminating any sort of achievements his uncle might have in the future. And you can see, right after the incident, his Uncle isn\'t disheartened and is ready to perform atrocities over again. I just hope that Shiki understands that he\'s letting his Uncle commit more acts of torture  and allowing more victims to pile up for his own fragile ego.Let\'s go over how Shiki is unable to make his Uncle provide testimony about where his mother\'s location is. Instead of any confrontation, Inugami gets convenient plot device in the form of information on his mother. I like how the Uncle gets spared so thoroughly, and how Shiki and his friends are at a loss. Yeah, I can\'t imagine just tearing his Uncle limb by limb or doing any sort of torture would unable to extract his mother\'s location. I like how it doesn\'t even cross his mind even though he should have had the resolve, reason, and drive to do so.I have so many problems with this story, but I\'ll focus on the masking of any moral indictment that this show tries to do with it\'s framing of the story.Kemono Jihen is a story that features killing and murder. Our main characters experience it for good reason. They kill monsters that harm other humans and society as a whole. So what exactly is the morality of our main characters for killing monsters that killed humans, but sparing humans that kill other innocent people?Monster bad, human good? That\'s basically the story Kemono Jihen wants to present. God forbid these kids go killing humans even if they\'re monsters inside, but they can go kill monsters for sins that are doing crimes less severe than humans they spare. It also aggravates me in the process of making the story so black and white in determining what is good or bad, it eliminates any sort of mental gymnastics by the viewer. You\'re merely being fed ""human good, this monster bad, revenge bad."" Everything can be labelled as good or bad without any distinction.Killing and murder are featured in the story, but the brutality and nastiness of anything macabre is merely glossed over. It\'s the same idea where many people are dying, but you don\'t get a good sense of how brutal everything is merely because you barely see the killing happen. They just die, and you move on. Just the fact that the brutal act of imprisoning and having his mother being raped continuously to produce over 100 offspring is limited to a few seconds is a tactic that this show employs in order to undermine the ""evil acts\' that Shiki\'s uncle makes, and this sort of masking of violent undertones is always present in this story. Even Kabane\'s bullying and frensy backstory are flimsy. These trauma inducing events are extremely short and are barely a blip in the radar for what they are. You\'d think that these events would be essential to the story, but they\'re glossed because it\'s a shounen, and everyone is happy and can move on, apparently. You\'re given a narrative that shoves the idea that our main characters are of quite a high moral standing without much thought put into it because again, it\'s a shounen. MC good. OK? Even other chilling acts of someone like Kon immediately decapitating Kanabe are just ""kids being kids,"" ""Kanabe didn\'t die, so Kon\'s all good."" In the end, Kon just becomes good friends and gets invited over to eat. ""Well, as long as there are no repercussions, I\'ll forgive you."" Cringe. There\'s so much atrocities that happen in the show, but it\'s just not focused upon and people just get over it. Whether it be on the receiving side or the side giving it out, cruel acts are not questioned or emphasized in the least bit. Instead, it maintains a ""lighthearted"" tone. Thanks a lot.I\'ll give a shoutout to the other flaws. So in Shiki\'s backstory, her mother just complies with his Uncle? She is a monster, a strong one at that, and she just willingly, day by day, gets inseminated and raped by random monsters because Shiki\'s uncle tells her to? She doesn\'t get any warning signs when she\'s being locked in a room and unable to see her son? Oh, what about her barely intelligent offspring. Surely they would be loyal to her, and not the Uncle. Inugami, basically aware of this situation, allows Shiki\'s uncle to do whatever he wants for over a year. Inugami\'s kind of scummy in that regard. This plot is as secure as swiss cheese, and should not be taken seriously, as once you start combing through the details, you start to realize that this story is only there to serve as character development for Shiki. It not only does not characterize Shiki very well, but it also is just an extremely poorly built backstory and plot that clearly points fingers and the situation is allowed to stay the status quo until Shiki needs character development.As for other characters, we have our classic vanilla OP MC that doesn\'t have a shred of personality. He\'s the type character in which ""he\'s unfeeling,"" but also has a ""good sense of morality"" built into him due to the teachings of his master. Akira is just a flamboyant trap character for comic relief. Shiki, he\'s ok, but again, the backstory makes him terrible as well.Let\'s not even talk about how power progression happens. Everything about how powerful people are is a whim that the author decides. Hey, character too weak? Slap a random power up arc so that they\'re powerful. In the case of our MC? What do you expect? He\'s OP as hell in the very beginning and gets even more OP. It\'s not even like Jujutsu Kaisen, where at least our MC has limitations.Overall, a story that tries to incorporate edgy themes without much thought put into it and tries to maintain the ""shounen"" more lighthearted tone, and as a result, you get a insincere narrative in which the bad guys and good guys are clearly defined in which their actions don\'t quite match their supposed morality. going to focus on Shiki, because it just highlights this absolutely horrendous edgy shock value story telling at its finest.Spoilers ahead, but trust me, nothing much of value has to be said about the story.At the point of the story where you reach Shiki\'s backstory, you already know that the main cast of characters have performed a few missions, few of which include killing anthropomorphic and intelligent beings, all of which were warranted. That being said, no humans have been harmed or killed by our main characters. You get where I\'m going with this?Shiki\'s uncle performed many atrocities on his mother. Forcefully jailing her, inseminating her for many years to forcefully breed offspring, and Shiki, morally scarred and scared of reality, runs away at the prospect of her mother\'s plight. So far so good.Many years later, Shiki comes back to discover the truth. Guilty because he abandoned his mother and fueled with rage, he storms upon his Uncle and decides to kill him. Using shounen storytelling tropes, of course he is able to escape. Shiki has a mental breakdown after being confronted with all of his mother\'s offspring, and loses motivation to kill his uncle. After having Kabane kill all of his mother\'s offspring, Shiki decides to spare his Uncle. Using arguments such as ""He\'ll have a fate worse than death if he lives,"" ""Killing him won\'t bring back my mother,"" he decides to spare his Uncle.What\'s wrong with this picture? First of all, I\'d really like to point out the timeline of these events. They\'re extremely close! Shiki goes through more mental development than an adult would do in their entire life in the span of a few days. He gets over his guilt and trauma, gets over his rage, and becomes and enlightened one over the span of a day or so. It\'s extremely surprising to me that he would not, in a fit of rage, just immediately kill his Uncle, but I guess we have the ""shounen"" genre to thank for that. Sure, could you ""reasonably"" say that Shiki could have matured so much? Yeah, as much as Ellie could have rationally spared Abby. Again, even Ellie in TLOU2 has around 60 hours of character development while our boy Shiki has 20 minutes, so Ellie\'s actions make a bit more sense than Shiki\'s. It\'s so frustrating seeing how Shiki spares his Uncle without much of a solid reason; his mentality changes way too quickly. He just commanded all of his siblings to die, and yet he\'s going to let the perpetrator of all of his pain get away? In fact, you could say that his siblings had no sin, and yet, they took the brunt of his rage, while his actual source of grief and rage is let of scot free. Oh yeah, he\'s a better person after killing many innocents because he let his main source of rage go. But wait, his siblings were half monster. Wait a second, he himself is half monster. All of his allies are also half monster. What gives? Well, if you don\'t look human, you\'re just a monster still! Fire at will. Perfect reasoning. Human looking monster = good, monster looking monster =kill. But wait! They\'re less intelligent than humans, so they\'re just animals. Yeah, how about we just kill all mentally disabled while we\'re at it?For people thinking that revenge is immature and that Shiki\'s reasoning was solid, I\'d really like to see how they\'d react if they had their loved ones tortured and raped for years before their eyes.

I didn’t know what to expect with this series and went in blind. How was it?...........MehThe story follows around a detective at a supernatural agency where he lives with children he picks up off the streets and uses them to his advantage and tosses them into life-threatening situations. Putting aside my jokingly blunt summary, the agency focuses on hunting down Kemono, or beast-like entities. So far, the story hasn’t shown much potential and seems...to be almost a monster-of-the-week show.The artstyle, as stated in the intro, was the main attraction to this series. Characters look distinct from one another and the background art looks good. Nothing much to note here.The only interesting things about this show so far is:• The darker/grim momentsWith a show focusing on Kemono, it has the liberty of making them look very off-putting. One example being a rhino-sized deer with human-sized antlers smiling with a bloody, toothy grin. How these creature work and interact with those around it is intriguing.Now let’s talk about the main detriment of this show and what I think brings this show down:• The characters are blandThe main cast is quite boring. The only notable character is the detective who is a chill, level-headed guy. Besides him, the other cast is pretty forgettable and uninteresting. You have the MC who’s a typical “I don’t know how to act like a human”, his loud friend who yells for the sake of yelling, and a trap. One other character introduced is a blonde fox girl, however so far her character is just “I serve my master”, so we will have to wait and see what happens with her.All in all, this show has been a let-down. With the show only airing 1/3 of its episodes, I don’t see this show getting that much better, or at least enough to make it notable enough to check out. If they decide to go a more sinister route with the show, it might pick up. However, I anticipate it’s going to keep its happier atmosphere.6/10 to be almost a monster-of-the-week show.The artstyle, as stated in the intro, was the main attraction to this series.

The first episode has an excellent hook and each episode thereafter continues to string the viewer along for a thrilling ride. It was clear that there was a lot of effort put into this anime and I congratulate the staff on a job well done. Daisuke Ono may not have played a major role in the show but he shown through by delivering a killer opening. The artists were not short of skill either. Between the action and the array of different...colors, the art was clean and purposeful. One can only hope for a season two to continue the story. Overall this anime is brilliant, a diamond in the rough, and I would recommend it to anyone. colors, the art was clean and purposeful. One can only hope for a season two to continue the story. Overall this anime is brilliant, a diamond in the rough, and I would recommend it to anyone.', 'I was enjoying this anime until the rape attacked. This was recommended to me via mals secret santa 2022 and I could somewhat see why someone would recommend it to me. I\'ve seen many shounen with supernatural elements and fucked up stories but this was just something else entirely. The first half of this anime is just basic shounen, easily consumable but not containing anything that will change my life. The entirety of this anime is just backstory of the two kids our main kid Kanabe works with. He meets them, learns their work and kind of just stands there to be the op character...until Akira and Shiki learn to do something (god forbid they survived before Kanabe arrived and joined the team, like what did they do before? stand there?). Akira and Shiki then get backstories after they each have their i\'m useless turned op moment.In all honesty Shiki is the best character so I was excited to get his backstory, see where he grew up and what happened to his parents. All of the three kids want to find family members, but part of me doubts Kanabe gives a fuck though, he\'s just there with no personality yet has 8 year olds fighting over him. Maybe he would do that edgy stoic thing where he meets his parents and a single tear exists the eye. we\'ll never know without the manga i assume since I\'m stuck halfway through episode 11 with no drive to continue on (I will though, ig I\'m a masochist). Shikis mom ends up getting raped on the daily for money by Shikis uncle and other monsters (I can\'t be fucked to remember if those things were kemono too tbh). Also Shikis dad is dead I personally believe the bitch ass uncle killed him anyway he gets her to agree to this by promising the money will make it so that Shiki will never have a struggle in life. Shiki ends up following his mom to work one day and sees her getting fucked by a monster before getting nabbed by the uncle and forgetting everything from trauma. When he was about to kill his uncle in our present time for what he did after getting his memories back, all of the offspring that came from is mother goes to protect the uncle. There were over a hundred of them. The only words they know are words that Shikis mother has said to him so he spirals into a trauma response as everyone murders the offspring.The next arc is then about Akira, who i could not give a fuck about. Hes just there but with less use than Kabane and a worse personality. Him and his twin brother come from a village that is basically that one hentai where an island is all women and one man. A man is born every hundred years and these women are basically waiting for these kids to become of age and have seed so that they can make offspring. It\'s disgusting. Akiras brother matures before him so he becomes the king (I can\'t remember the term used through the disgust) and gets raped on the daily under the guise of a ""job"". He plans on escaping with Akira but during this conversation Akira mentions in one sentence that he pissed the bed at 14 and thaty it was embarrassing. His brother then looks horrified as he realises that it was probably not piss and that Akira is also capable of producing children now. He doesn\'t want Akira to go through what he was going through since the women of the village would pounce on Akira as well if they knew so he sends Akira away to Tokyo to be safe with the guise that he would soon join him. He would in our now current present, kidnaps Akira by locking him away and being uber protective of him (because of trauma i\'m guessing).Anyway this felt like a rape trauma fantasy about kids for shock value because there isnt much else in this anime. Its just there, I guess you\'ll like it if you hate women because they\'re all awful. Now for a bad transition to a talk about the opening because oh my god does it just feel stuck in randomly. Theres like probably 30 seconds of the anime and then the opening and everytime the opening happens its so jarring. They do not ease into it good at all and ruins the flow. That\'s my review i guess, I\'ll torture myself with the last 5 minutes of episode 11 and watch 12 soon but I doubt it\'ll change my opinion. Anime can have these topics but wow does Kemono Jihen do absolutely nothing with them, its just there for those who think shock value with no substance is an entertaining story until Akira and Shiki learn to do something (god forbid they survived before Kanabe arrived and joined the team, like what did they do before? stand there?).

Kemono Jihen did not fail to catch my attention. It's concept of Kemonos got me wanting to watch...more of it. Based on the first season (hoping there's a season 2), the author played with the plot well.The characters are actually lovable. Kabane who was treated badly for all his life knowing the world full of love with Inugami, Inugami who runs the kemono agency, Shiki who has anger issues but still lovable and Akira as a lovable clumsy person. The characters are all so dynamic and their stories are capable with so many possibilities.The last episode actually got me sad since we only get 12 episodes for this. I'm crossing my fingers for Season 2 :D more of it. Based on the first season (hoping there's a season 2), the author played with the plot well.The characters are actually lovable.

I'm crossing my fingers for Season 2 :D"", 'I was impressed by the first episode. There was a thrill and impact to the way the detective tested the kid Kabane to determine his disposition, Kabane\'s circumstances were intriguing. Even in Anime it\'s not everyday a guy just shoots a kid in the head at point blank range, especially when the dude has been set up as one of the ""good guys"". Least of all, where the kid just smiles, utterly chill about it - trying to make the dude feel better about the whole thing just in case he has trauma/guilt or something later since I\'ll just be dead anyways. You actually couldn\'t...be 100% at that time, whether the guy with the gun was going to be the main character or whether this kid was going to undead himself somehow. The whole episode gave off that weird creepy intrigue you want a supernatural journey through some shadow world to have. There was a clear differentiation by way of contrast between the two main characters and the humans who had hired the one guy that shot the kid. Hot DAMN, I thought. That was cool, pleasantly surprised at the quality of the show - wonder where they\'re going with this, I thought...Well, that\'s the issue. Where they go is a silly place known as The Kemonist\'s Office. Supposedly mediating issues that arise between humans and murderous furry of the week as some kind of appendage to local law enforcement, which is under the complete and total control of a somewhat evil foxy lady Kemono anyways so raison d\'etre unclear. Most of the story is centered on this one trap kid and yung spidey, the kids already enrolled in Kemonist daycare when Kabane shows up. They both get arcs, those arcs basically take up the whole season - except for Kon, her thing is she\'s dumb, and she gets left in a park and waits there for the rest of the series as the Kemonist\'s battle against Mr. Freeze - the trap kid\'s brother.There is just something not quite right about the framing - why are they all kids? Why is one a trap? Why is the racoon girl such an idiot? Why is the evil head of the police department so scary but so completely, conveniently impotent when it comes to the Kemonist guy? Why is there a video-game addicted vampire living in the closet? You know what the problem is - I don\'t care why. I just, don\'t.Honorable mention - yung spidey has some character development of mild interest during his arc, and in interacting with the omnipotent MMO guild master vampire living in the clost. Also in the show\'s favor, there\'s some cool fight mechanics sprinkled here and there, and Kon\'s replacement does pretty well for himself as a wunderkinds who is playing double agent one way or another and you can\'t tell 100% which way... but honestly the villains are lame, nearly across the board. There\'s literally no tension, it\'s about as suspenseful as an episode of care bears. I found the backstories for the Kemono races flat as hell, sometimes almost an afterthought - like the vampire MMO guy, ""vampire\'s are an advanced race, even among Kemono"". Tsk.What began as a surprisingly mature first step into an intriguing lore, ended up being exactly the kind of show I was afraid it was going to be when I saw all those kids striking dynamic poses on the poster. It\'s not outright bad to be fair, but I didn\'t get what they did here personally. If I had been expecting a slice of life, kooky kids doing grown up things so cute type of show - maybe it would earn higher marks in that category. Overall not my jam, wouldn\'t recommend. be 100% at that time, whether the guy with the gun was going to be the main character or whether this kid was going to undead himself somehow.

Could see myself rewatching this.- This show balances being a darker shounen with more lighthearted scenes, which honestly is what I always dreamed shounen could be growing up.- Similar vibes as Demon Slayer. The main downside is that this show doesn't have as good an animation/soundtrack, unfortunately, which causes issues with feeling invested in the emotional scenes sometimes. But I actually prefer the overarching plotline and character arcs in this one.- The characters. Are. Amazing. What's particularly cool is that since Kabane is a blank slate, as he spends time with each of the characters he gains some of their...tendencies and ideologies. And this can be seen over the course of the season. The characters have seen much love and care from the author, as each is given their own set of motives that they actually act upon.- Avoids some anime tropes. E.g. in most anime, if you have two characters that are strangers walking down a hallway together, they'll usually have some cringey dialogue-- but here, the characters as you would expect in RL, don't say a word to each other!

I liked the ideas that are used in the anime but are not explored too deep into the anime, hopefully there is a 2nd season in the future but most likely this anime we will have to wait about 3 years for another season which is...fine, but we could be waiting longer. Regardless if it does get a second then this anime will progress and develop exceptionally well.Story 5/10The story has not been explored too well until later and when it has been explored there is very little build up or reasoning behind the story. The story has not been fully explored to completion at points either and most of the time its spent having the characters mess around and going back and forth with their emotions or thought process in the current time.Characters 9/10The characters have back stories and have a lot of expression, emotions and many other human characterization features. An anime that can work with many characters and introduces more characters in the anime usually tends to get good, because it becomes increasingly harder for the animator to keep them in character form, especially making sure they are always included in the anime when needed. The main character is super cool and got a Halloween costume which is a little funny.Art Style 9/10The main reason this anime is doing well is mainly because the sole purpose of the anime is due to have an amazing art, and solely focused on the artistic and animation side of things which always means they are focused on making the characters looking spot on and the environment which is probably why the story is not explored as much as it should. If the anime gets another season then this anime will most likely start exploring the story a lot more then the artistic side of things, which is always a plus since it will get a fan service.Audio 8/10The opening song has this spicy dance feeling to it and wants me to dance to this almost Spanish music which is funny. The audios used in the anime are excellent and timing with the animations and voice lines are spot one perfect, really love that.Enjoyment 7/10I absolutely love the music in the anime works well with the overall theme, the animation and art is fantastic too, Wish though the story is explored a lotmore in the future maybe a second season will push this anime real far. fine, but we could be waiting longer.

It is unfortunate that in the first 12 episodes, we don't see where that is.We see do see hints, of course. Violence, fear, gore, and darkly painted arcs contrast with with bright, simple character designs and dispositions. We follow our misfits as they try to make sense of their place in the world, kept in check and nurtured by the tired but dutiful Inugami-sensei. Their character traits are defined relatively quickly as a plus, though many are 1-dimensional on the surface. It is clear that it is a starting point, and there is a lofty ceiling for...future development.Unfortunately, hardly any of that ceiling has been used for the main character so far. This can cause some moments that would otherwise be tense or interesting to be predictable and disengaging. On the brighter side, the voice acting is convincing and well-matched, adding some of the depth that the story has yet to present. Despite the story and characters being the weaker points of the series so far, it is easy to become invested and excited for the potential they have.The art and animation are excellent, seamless, and feel unique to the show. The fighting is explosive and to the point while retaining depth and flourish, as simple but distinct designs and color choices play well with fast-paced action and relaxed scenes alike - the moments where everyone is just hanging out are still visually engaging. It is a joy to watch the characters simply exist on screen. Their expressions are very convincing, and are used to subvert interactions flawlessly.  Violence carries weight in animation, the gore and horror of the show is presented in full without hiding everything behind a spatter of blood or formless wound like many shounens choose to.I recommend watching Kemono Jihen if you are interested in watching a violent, offbeat shounen series with fantastic animation and a lot of room to grow. It is not neatly wrapped up in the first season, but will likely hit full stride in the next.A negative note:There is sexualization of a younger character. There isn't anything egregious here; it's done as a gag.

There lives a boy there, nicknamed dorota-bou, who got his name from a yokai that lives in mud. During this investigation, the occult and the boy seem more interlinked than expected. The anime gives off some serious bungou stray dog vibes with the art being as good as you’d expect a modern day Shonen, the music that helps frame sequences incredibly well and the action is of course top-notch so far....This anime doesn’t shy away from horror and gore so hold onto your seats whilst watching this.Story 7/10As mentioned in the TL;DR, the story is quite simple but that's the charm of it, solving problems outside whilst simultaneously solving problems inside. The anime does show some darker aspects of life as an outcast of society and the main characters are written well enough to root for. The story is not something revolutionary, however it is executed quite well and is enjoyable. The pacing of the show is fairly consistent which makes it a pleasure to watch, with a monster of the week format as the kids find and solve the problem within the same episode.Art 8/10The art is incredibly nice, with character designs having a lot of detail without being too messy. The background scenes are appeasing with good defined lines and the fight sequences are choreographed and animated quite well. It is a pleasure to watch and is easy on the eyes, with dark scenes being light enough to see details but still know that the scene is supposed to be dark.Sound 8/10Sound is quite good with this show, with a special mention to the sfx which match the scene incredibly well. The op is brilliant as it is jovial yet has undertones of mystery and the ed is great too with its catchy tunes. Background music is used well and is unobtrusive yet boosts the scenes quite well, packing a punch in fight scenes.Characters 8/10In a similar vein to one punch man, the main character is not someone we empathize with but sympathize with, that is to say we can feel sorry for kabane but we don't exactly understand him . The rest of the main cast fill in the gaps left by kabane incredibly well, displaying a plethora of emotions and kabane is written in a way where he slowly grows with more emotions as we continue watching.Enjoyment 8/10So far this anime has been quite entertain and is very underrated in my opinion as it brings a more niche angle than many other shows that are airing.

Kemono Jihen is just something to watch when bored. It doesn't lack in originality but that does not make it great. Everything is pretty average in terms of animation, ost, and characters. The tone changes throughout episodes which creates a disconnect. One episode can be about traumatizing events and the next can be about an eight-year-old in a crop top.

And hey what can you do about it?, there are a lot of unrecognized anime everywhere, other franchises, that may not be bad, but they are definitely not what people say they are (mha) have amazingly high scores, I have seen a lot of them. The thing that bothers me the most is the fact that Kemono Jihen has EVERYTHING to be a successful and well received shounen, yet is quite unknowed having only 87,912 reviews and a score of 7.44 being ranked...in the 1803th place. I dont know if it has anything to do with winter season that brought renowned anime names (SNK, Re: zero, dr stone, horimiya,etc) but its just sad to see such a good anime being overshadowed that badly.Anyways sorry for the long introduction to the review, im finally gonna startStory: 6/10I personally was immersed in the story since the first two chapters; the world that develops is surprisingly well done, bringing a ot of concepts that i would like to believe will be more developed later on the story.Lets start off saying that its not an ""original"" story , but it works well. As an example, JJK managed to highlight so much, not for its original story, but because its entertaining and has a good functionality, its story works perfectly to present villians, develop characters, and bringing good fights. And thats pretty much what Kemono Jihen does, obviously not at that extreme but you get the point. Although clearly its not the strong point of the show, but it accomplishes its duty. Its a good start for the series, nothing innovating or refreshing, but still pretty goodCharacters: 8/10Probably the best thing of the show. Let me start off saying that theyre wholesome, the friendship that they have, their personalities, everything about them is pure awesomeness.The first season pretty much covers Shiki and Akiras arc and thats when we get to know what are their goals, how their pasts afects how theyre now, why they do what they do to achieve what they want, how everything that hapenned to them is linked on the things they say, act or feel. We really get to understand what theyre going throught and genuinly feel bad for them.As for kanabe i liked him a lot as a protagonist, he doesnt know much about ""real"" life due to the life he had, he knows the general aspects and meaning of things but cannot fully understand them. Watching him grow and learning what love is, what friendship is, that he wants to do things, is just amazinggg.They all have complexity and a great development, and theyre really easy to empathize withSound: 8/10I have nothing bad to say about this, everything was really good, but nothing impressive (although i really liked the op and ed)Art: 9/10the fightssss *cheff kiss*, and alsoo I really liked the setting and the tone of it, it was really good, for moments you feel like laughing, and for moments youre actually scared. I really liked the use of gore it was not a little, but it also wasnt excessibly to the point of not surprising you. I liked everything that had to do with the art (The only reason of it being not a 10 is because ive seen better)Enjoyment: 9/10(just because i found some parts a little boringOverall: 8/10I really really enjoyed it a lot (to the point of writing  review), if youre looking something entertaining, funny, sad, quite epic and just good, you should definitely give it a try.

Let me start off saying that theyre wholesome, the friendship that they have, their personalities, everything about them is pure awesomeness.The first season pretty much covers Shiki and Akiras arc and thats when we get to know what are their goals, how their pasts afects how theyre now, why they do what they do to achieve what they want, how everything that hapenned to them is linked on the things they say, act or feel. We really get to understand what theyre going throught and genuinly feel bad for them.As for kanabe i liked him a lot as a protagonist, he doesnt know much about ""real"" life due to the life he had, he knows the general aspects and meaning of things but cannot fully understand them. Watching him grow and learning what love is, what friendship is, that he wants to do things, is just amazinggg.They all have complexity and a great development, and theyre really easy to empathize withSound: 8/10I have nothing bad to say about this, everything was really good, but nothing impressive (although i really liked the op and ed)Art: 9/10the fightssss *cheff kiss*, and alsoo I really liked the setting and the tone of it, it was really good, for moments you feel like laughing, and for moments youre actually scared. I really liked the use of gore it was not a little, but it also wasnt excessibly to the point of not surprising you. I liked everything that had to do with the art (The only reason of it being not a 10 is because ive seen better)Enjoyment: 9/10(just because i found some parts a little boringOverall: 8/10I really really enjoyed it a lot (to the point of writing  review), if youre looking something entertaining, funny, sad, quite epic and just good, you should definitely give it a try.

On one hand, I overally enjoyed in, watching it days after it finished airing. On the other hand, some things urked me. Like the fact that the main character, a kid who supposedly didn't know anything about his demonic side, suddenly knew how to do things involving his powers. I wish that would have been explained a bit more considering we got to see the other characters discover new things about themselves and struggle with their supernatural side. The only thing the kid needed help with was the demon mode without the stone thing.Regardless it was a nice...watch, and I hope that we will be provided another season soon. watch, and I hope that we will be provided another season soon."", ""Kemono Jihen is one of those hidden Gems.Airing in the most stacked Season and on the same day as Powerhouses like Attack on Titan and Ex-Arm it might have been overlooked by many.

They are children who suffered a lot and you could understand their quirks as a coping mechanism.If you give this Childhood-trauma-Konga-line a chance and like it,  I'd also recommend reading...the Manga, which goes into more depth for some of the scenes that were skipped in this Anime, probably to fit one more Arc into 12 Episodes.

The world surprisingly makes sense and bases itself loosely in Japanese mythology with half-human half-beasts (kemonos) making up the world.

I couldn't tell where the plot was going and the story mostly consisted of short arcs where the main characters deal with different kemono (aka supernatural beings) issues and solve them. Fine for a plot, but the main goal of the mc was to find his parents and that seemed to be put on the backburner so other characters could get introduced and developed. It wasn't until the last episode where I realized that this was a prologue to a much bigger story.Story:6If the last episode hadn't clarified anything I would...have given this an even lower score. A six seems fair for leaving me feeling like the events occurring in the story were somewhat aimless. Granted, the stories themselves are pretty dark, which I think was more for the benefit of the overall narrative than not. I definitely wouldn't recommend this show if you can't stomach dark issues. Overall, definite room for improvement.Characters: 8I liked them. I honestly did. They're cute and distinct and that's more than I can say for most shows. My only real issues are the skimpy outfit that a certain (incredibly young) character starts wearing later on and the feeling that the treatment of women overall in the show was weird. I don't know, it's not something I noticed until it was pointed out to me, but I think once you notice it's hard to ignore. I think characters like Kon have definite room for growth but we didn't get that in this season.Art:9Pleasantly dynamic and honestly much better than I expected. The animation for the facial expressions I thought was quite good in some parts and the fight scenes were all well done. Not Jujutsu Kaisen levels of well done, but certainly better than many other series I've seen.Sound: 10Honestly what hooked me on the show was the ost.

They're both prologues to long running shounen series, and honestly now that I sort of understand the overarching plot of Kemono Jihen, I think they are even more similar than I initially thought.

Seriously, I don't think there was anything else I enjoyed more than the soundtrack.Overall: 8Screw it, I'm gonna give this the same score as Jujutsu Kaisen, mostly thanks to its soundtrack and what I thought was pretty good art and character moments. They're both prologues to long running shounen series, and honestly now that I sort of understand the overarching plot of Kemono Jihen, I think they are even more similar than I initially thought.

The main plot point for the main character isn't strongly fused to the story, but tons of anime and manga do that.I'm a little confused as to the viewer age that this show's trying to target, though. Part of it has some violent scenes that would seem to up the target age, but the themes feel like they've been done before, and aren't really told in a way that would intrigue an older audience.

The idea of a business that solves paranormal mysteries aren't a new development in anime but I feel the events in Kemono Jihen have substance; The characters are a minority of people with demonic attributes and their task is to coexist with humans from the shadow while also preventing demons from abusing their powers. Each main villian/situation in the series does feel unique but the series tries to infer the power of friendship to forcefully develop a bond between the main kemono child characters.

There are interesting characters, interesting character development, and unique powers that keep you watching. On that topic, the OP is just so *chef kiss*.

""Poorly written and directed""? "" ""Pretentious Shounen Anime""? ""Merchandise bait""?It\'s hard to point out where it really went wrong when everything was a mess. What started off with so much promise on its very first episode with its dark, serious, and mysterious vibes, drastically changed into a much lighter, tensionless, more comical kind of Anime by the very next episode. And while it had some pretty serious arcs that one would have expected after watching the first episode, it\'s hard to appreciate those when the build-up for it has either been done poorly or simply just non-existent in the first place. While it...did have a pretty good last arc (I was watching the last 3 episodes on background as I write this review), it still doesn\'t justify the very messy story-telling that could\'ve ruined the entirety of the Anime.Just like some other reviewers, I\'m also surprised to see that this has mostly positive reviews. But in a way, I can see how people liked it. I mean, I DID manage to watch the entirety of it without feeling forced and regretful by the end. But frankly, it was mostly the visuals that got me to stay. The art design is so easy on the eyes, and while the characters didn\'t have much depth, they were diverse and unique enough to produce some fun moments. Plus, the VA is pretty good too.  But still, those random good things that are scattered all over the messy story shouldn\'t be the basis of its overall rating.And speaking of rating, here\'s mine:STORY - 3/10: While the main plot and character arcs are interesting, it lacked proper build-up and the pacing of the story felt too rushed. Most battles got a *One Punch Man* treatment, beaten with one strike after long random conversations. But since the Anime ended on a pretty good note, the 2nd season might have an opportunity to redeem it\'s initial potential.CHARACTERS - 6/10: I would\'ve rated this higher but, with the story being so messy the characters didn\'t really have much to play around with. But since it\'s the only reason I managed to survive this anime, I\'d give it a fair rating. Good VAs, distinguishable designs, and quite fun personalities. Unfortunately, the protagonist lost most of his mysteriousness too early, and he doesn\'t come off as oblivious as he should be. There\'s also the spider girl that immediately got turned into a loli. Inugami, Kon, and Nobimaru seem to be the most consistent so far. Akira weirdly provided most of the entertainment for me, personally, annoying the noises he makes may be.ART and SOUND - 6/10: I haven\'t really noticed the BGMs much so, this SOUND rating is just for the OP/ED theme. The Art looked so good in the first episode, looked lame for the rest until the last arc came.I don\'t follow behind-the-scenes news so, I don\'t know if the production of Kemono Jihen has been affected by the pandemic.

I think some of them don\'t get a fair treat (sorry for the bad english) and just get wasted, they do some development on them, but just to put them aside, you should not make the viewer feel something for a character just to not follow up on them and...just use them to fill some minutes in the show and completely forget about them, whats the point?

A little bit of everything place and mixed into their respective place and just at the right dose. It might not be 3 stars Michelin food, but I like it a lot.I often think Anime is the same as food. Some would like what others don't, there is one of a kind that is everyone's favorite, there is some food that everyone hates but still has certain people that love it. If its food, you could say that I'm...a person that would eat everything, as bad as it is as long as it is edible and more importantly doesn't have paprika and any bitter vegetables, I would immediately throw the food away if it contains those, no matter how expensive it is, or even if it's been cooked by Gordon Ramsay or even any 3 Michelin star Chef. That's just the kind of person I am. Ah look how wrong I was, this one slap me hard, smack my stupidity so badly of not knowing how broad and wide this world is. It's what this anime did. I would say it's how the anime is directed, I'm not familiar with the manga, but it feels like that this is also a very well-written story and well-directed craft.Just like the paprika, there are some things in anime that I like to avoid, not because it's bad, It's just that I don't enjoy those things, which is1. kids in most anime, they often get too naive with saving the world and beat the hell of bad guy just to get their ass kicked with a very cliche hostage situation, it's too old shounen cliche that irritates me a lot2. a character that lacks decisive action, talks like girls, and CRY A LOT, in other words, Akira. (damn even with all that, they force me not to hate this character, what a brilliant)Despite things I don't like, I'm still gonna bite anything edible to see if its good. And what a surprise, This anime is what makes me realize that I finally meet one of a kind anime that successfully blends the factor that I hate the most from anime into something extraordinarily satisfying and makes me craving for more and more and this might be a problem for me if there is no 2nd season. Hell, I would settle for a spin-off with Aya and Shiki spider family adventure.The spider family introduction is the best part of the entire anime IMO. Even as satisfying as that, it doesn't outshine our MC, its just perfectly mixed together. Also, the development between our MC and Kon is something fresh to me and very much interesting to see how they gonna develop it later in the story.I would say that it is the director that put up a lot of great works here, beside of how well it is directed, the Seiyuus also consist of those of my favorites: HanaKana play the bad guy is something rare, Ono daisuke, natsuki hanae, suwabe junichi the immortal Ojisan, shimono hiro, they even get ishida akira. Damn, that is some serious quality.So if by any chance there is someone out there that might be just like me, that kinda like to avoid those things I mentioned above, you ABSOLUTELY need to give this a top priority binge, lol. As for the other people that has no character preference, this is a strong recommendation for you, since if a picky watcher like me enjoy this, there is a high chance you might enjoy it too. Except if you don't like anime being unrealistic about how mature the kids in this anime, maybe you should stick to Marvel and DC.

On the face of it, this is a fairly average story premise however what separates Kemono Jihen from other similar stories is its execution. Kemono Jihen does not have a single, overarching plot but instead, similar to Star Trek Deep Space Nine or the new series of Doctor Who, it features a mostly episodic plot but with some overarching plot points. Most notably the ominious presence of the fabulously turned out and...delightfully evil Lady Yoko Inari. Kemono Jihen at first sight, can also appear as a relatively easy going show with its child protagonists (don’t worry, no fanservice for the protagonists). However it also has some very dark storylines- most notably Akari and his brothers backstory. Fortunately, Kemono Jihen manages to avoid being either sickly sweet or overly dark and the result is a compelling show that can both horrify you and make you smile but without either element feeling out of place.The Characters of Kemono Jihen are as compelling as the story. Protagonist Kabane for example with his unemotional demeanour, pragmatism but also, kindness makes for a refreshing protagonist free of many of the usual annoyances found in for example, Isekai protagonists. He can be kind but not sickeningly so, he can be very blunt, but without feeling nasty and he is comfortable killing his enemies. So if your tired of anime protagonist’s who never want try to kill the villain but at the same time don’t want a protagonist who is overly edgy or angsty then Kemono Jihen might be the show for you. Kabane’s co-protagonists Shiki and Akari are equally well developed as characters over the course of the series and they all have an enjoyable dynamic.  However for me, the stand out character was the aforementioned Lady Inari. Although only in a few episodes in comparison to the main protagonists, Inari maintains a certain presence throughout the sotry via her agents and her control over the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. Furthermore, her suprisignly cheerful demeanour combined with a certain air of menace make her a very compelling antagonist for the show. Her tendency to help the protagonists  (albeit always for her own ends) just as much as she tries to hinder them makes for a surprisingly unpredictable villain. Overall, Inari manages to be definitively evil but without being a hate sink. This results in a villain who is both obviously evil but also quite fun to watch.Overall, Kemono Jihen is a well-written and enjoyable show that has excellent and unique characters as well as being both fun to watch and not afraid of dark storylines. delightfully evil Lady Yoko Inari.

Not expecting much from a demon anime, which to my pleasant surprise, turned into a fine piece of work.The story follows a boy ridiculed in his current town. Not knowing much of his past he survived with the little he received and all the mistreatment from his own family. He was later picked up by a man who said will help him learn of his parents. With that his new life started in Tokyo fixing demons problems.The action was well drawn out, interesting and hype to say the least. With some interesting twist and amusing turns....From the first episode you feel how different the fights will be in this anime.I truly enjoyed the dynamic between the kids and other characters in their work space. They were quite humorous, pure, and idiotic. But, when things got serious each character had a role and did it well, even if it was to pass out.For a normal 12 episode anime, it pulls the heart strings good. Honestly, I got teary eyed more than once in this anime, and that is a wonderful thing. It really makes you want to root for the kids and their lives.This anime did many wonderful things and I hope to see more in the future.

It’s not quite the same as a typical isekai protagonist, in that it is just a power fantasy. Though that could be a part of it. That just isn’t the sole focus. It’s more like he is the catalyst for the rest of the characters. He is stronger than most, has the ability to heal indefinitely, and can summon even more strength if need be. Basically he’s an overpowered badass that assures you that everything will be alright. There isn’t anything inherently wrong with that, but it does make...things less interesting being aware of this. It doesn’t help that he’s a blank slate with little to no emotion. Of course that doesn’t ruin the show.There are plenty of other aspects of the show to enjoy, like the setting. The world of Kemono Jihen is nothing special. It is pretty much set in the real modern world with supernatural elements sprinkled in. There are spirits, beasts, and everything in between. Kabane, our main character, is what you would call a hanyo. It’s a combination of a human and a khoular, a “bloodless demon.” There are other classifications for human-beast hybrids, but it doesn’t go into much more depth than that. It’s really only important in regards to Kabane to explain why he is overpowered. I guess if you inherently like this type of show then it’s for you.As for the other characters, they are fine. You’ve got Akira, who has ice powers, who is from some snowy ice village occupied by mostly females. Males are born every 100 years. I’m not sure how that’s supposed to work. I guess that explains why they have such a low population, but even that must be hard to maintain. Maybe the women FREEZE their eggs. Who knows? Akira and his brother Yui, who also has ice powers, were currently the only males living there. Of course they were mistreated, so they ran away. Yui is a bit over protective, and it all comes to a head in the final arc of the show. It’s all very heartfelt and kind of cliche. Then there is Shiki, who has the power of silk like a spider, who had a traumatic incident involving his mother as a child. There was a conspiracy and some betrayal, but it didn’t end too badly. That’s really all the interesting characters.Overall it was a fun supernatural action show. The main character is a bit lacking, but maybe that’s on purpose.

Also Kon\'s crush on Kabane is so...cute!Kemono Jihen, I feel, underneath all the magic and creatures, is a story of facing your trauma, and dealing with your past.

Compared to the manga, the Kemono Jihen anime is a disappointment.The manga does a superb job of rendering tone and heart, and the horror is genuinely frightening. The action is strong, the lore engaging, and even with a main character as inaccessible as Shiki, we care about him on the page - as we do everyone else. The anime, however, is lacking in almost all of these aspects.Kemono's animation is flat,...stiff, over-lit, and the same everywhere we go, so there's no atmosphere - ever. The musical score is distractingly bad and sometimes doesn't even fit what's happening onscreen. Certain performers are standouts - especially Hanae Natsuki, Shimono Hiro and Hanazawa Kana (all three playing delightfully against type here) - whilst others, who are typically really strong and dependable like Murase Ayumu, are reduced to one-dimensional, irritating foreground noise due to the anime’s interpretation of his character and how they decided to translate Akira's personality from the manga into the anime. There is also zero tension due to Shiki's infallible strength, and his lack of personality, emotions or growth means there's a giant black chasm at the series' center that makes it impossible to really care about what's going on because he will always sweep in at the last minute and save everyone, leaving all the characters completely unscathed (therefore no development), week after week. The manga's original tone and its ingenuity concerning story and world-building disguises these flaws. The anime brings them into sharp relief.The direction is mediocre, and the camera seems to be in all the wrong places, especially during the action sequences, which are clunky, underwhelming and shot with little-to-no imagination. Everything is a close-up, a two-shot, or a wide-shot. They really could have gone to town and made it as page-turning as the source material. It's just disheartening that they seemed to want to make this show the best version of itself, but either didn't know how, or settled on being lazy about it.It’s all a real shame. I really think this had the potential to reach teen-friendly Jujutsu Kaisen territory, had the studio kept the manga’s dark, unsettling tone; if they utilized their creativity; if if they had a better understanding of the characters and how to adapt them and therefore could give the whole thing all a little more life.

Wow. For the first three episodes I didn\'t know whether to laugh or cry. It is just plain weird. I can\'t describe it better. It_just_is_weird.Ebichu is about a hamster called Ebichu. Her owner is a single office lady desperate to find a husband. Many jokes center around Ebichu\'s owner and her good-for-nothing boyfriend. What makes this show worth watching is its extreme humour that springs form this set-up. Warning to all American kids: Contains adult themes, watch this...and be sued! Infidelity, sex in it\'s all forms (and positions... he-he-eeeeh...), gambling, violence and much more. Best advertising speech ever?Ebichu is best watched with an open mind and maybe a couple of friends and some beverages with alcohol in them.

Try it - I can guarantee that you may or may not be disappointed.', 'I, like many other people, had never heard of this anime for the longest time. An obscure Gainax comedy show about a talking hamster? Never would\'ve found that one. That was until a friend of mine showed me the famous scene from the show on YouTube, simply titled ""Manko"" https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AAP1tmTn6tE . I don\'t know about you, but that was enough to sell me on adding it to the PTW. About a year and a half later, and I finally sat down and gave it a watch. And I\'ll tell you right now, it\'s a shame I hadn\'t found this sooner, because it is one of...the funniest comedy anime I\'ve ever seen.Of course what caught my eye was the off the wall vulgarity in a show that appears to be a cute little slice of life about an adventurous housekeeping hamster. Consisting of an assortment of sexual comedy and somewhat violent slapstick humor. This show pushed the boundaries big time. The simplistic art style was probably the only reason I can gather as to why they were even allowed to show this on television. There\'s both explicit sexual scenes, as well as Ebichu getting absolutely decimated in the most comical way (if that makes any sense) by her OL Master or the ""Useless Bum"". It also shows the highly dysfunctional relationship of Ebichu\'s Master and her ""Useless Bum"" of a boyfriend. Portraying an incredibly real looking relationship that is so against the norms of most anime.And through all that, this show remains impeccably charming, and adorable most of the time. Throwing adult themes into something that for all intents and purposes looks like a children\'s show, you can\'t find this stuff anywhere else.The housekeeping hamster in question, Ebichu, is voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi, famous from her days as Misato Katsuragi from Evangelion. The story of how this show came to be was an interesting one too. Mitsuishi would read the Ebichu manga in between recording lines for NGE. She would often burst out laughing and that caused people to go up to her and ask what she\'s reading. After some time, they at Gainax, including Hideaki Anno (what?), decided they wanted to animate it, and thus made Mituishi the titular character of Ebichu. I just found it very interesting, both that the studio sees a manga and goes ""what the heck let\'s give it a shot"", and that Mitsuishi eventually got the chance to provide a voice for the character she\'d grown to love. And what a voice it was. Never was there a break in character, Ebichu has an unmistakable voice and speech pattern that I can\'t compare to anything else I\'ve ever heard before. Mitsuishi did an unbelievable job portraying her.This show is a gem. However, it is a relic from the year 1999 that almost nobody ever talks about. And that\'s incredibly sad. I\'m not someone who particularly loves straight up comedy anime, but this show hooked me from the start. It was a riot. It stayed true to itself the whole way through, and brought new things to the table that I\'d never seen in comedy anime before. You won\'t find many shows where a character fantasizes about having an intimate relationship with a hamster. It\'s truly something unique for both its time and now and is something most everyone should at the very least check out. If you haven\'t seen it, I recommend doing so immediately by any means possible, and then feel sorry that you hadn\'t watched it sooner. the funniest comedy anime I\'ve ever seen.Of course what caught my eye was the off the wall vulgarity in a show that appears to be a cute little slice of life about an adventurous housekeeping hamster. Consisting of an assortment of sexual comedy and somewhat violent slapstick humor. This show pushed the boundaries big time. The simplistic art style was probably the only reason I can gather as to why they were even allowed to show this on television. There\'s both explicit sexual scenes, as well as Ebichu getting absolutely decimated in the most comical way (if that makes any sense) by her OL Master or the ""Useless Bum"". It also shows the highly dysfunctional relationship of Ebichu\'s Master and her ""Useless Bum"" of a boyfriend. Portraying an incredibly real looking relationship that is so against the norms of most anime.And through all that, this show remains impeccably charming, and adorable most of the time. Throwing adult themes into something that for all intents and purposes looks like a children\'s show, you can\'t find this stuff anywhere else.The housekeeping hamster in question, Ebichu, is voiced by Kotono Mitsuishi, famous from her days as Misato Katsuragi from Evangelion. The story of how this show came to be was an interesting one too. Mitsuishi would read the Ebichu manga in between recording lines for NGE. She would often burst out laughing and that caused people to go up to her and ask what she\'s reading. After some time, they at Gainax, including Hideaki Anno (what?), decided they wanted to animate it, and thus made Mituishi the titular character of Ebichu.

Adult themes clash with animation and sound effects of a childrens\' show. Humor, sex and kawaii in a perfect mix. Highly recommended!AnimationVery simple graphics and animation, but that is kind of the point. The characters look dull at first glance, but once you get to know them, you can\'t imagine them looking any differently.Can\'t give too high a score here, because of the simple looks, but on the other hand this anime really couldn\'t have a more appropriate animation.SoundThe intro song is cute and catchy, but nothing too fabulous. The reason I rate the ""sound"" cathegory so high...is because of the sound effects. They are well timed and fit like a glove, that which they are supposed to illustrate. Spot on!Oh, and great voice acting, especially Ebichu.StoryNo story, just episodic ""strips"". Actually, each episode is divided into many many short scenes which often has nothing to do with each other. There would have been nice with some kind of final conclusion, but hey... Extra points for the setting, though.CharacterExcept for the extreme and universal aggression towards hamsters, most of the characters feel like real people (if somewhat drawn towards an extreme). The adult theme lets them act without regards to the age of the audience, and there is no epic story behind it all. Just people.And Ebichu. Who definately is the cutest anime character I have come across this far.ValueThe episodic structure lets you watch any episode of Ebichu at any time, without risk of being confused, so I\'d say the re-watch value of this is high. And lots of extra points for the fansubber\'s translation notes at the beginning of each episode. Very informative. is because of the sound effects.

It’s cute and talks of a cute little hamster’s life and how her owner is to her. In fact, the very first episode shows exactly how her master is… a useless bum. All this women seems to do is whine about her boyfriend and have sex with him. Yes, this shows them having sex a lot. The owner’s boyfriend seems useless to me. I don’t know why the owner hangs around him at all. The owner isn’t really that good herself.Now that I have talked about all the bad things about...the story, I have to say, this feels pretty realistic and I actually like it to a point. They have there bad sides, but you can actually feel for the characters even though I still don’t understand why the owner keeps smashing Ebichu into the wall and making her bleed. I think if the little hamster was real, it would have been dead by now.The artwork reminds me a lot of Shin-chan and it’s really hard to actually watch because of this. The artwork just makes me feel sick with moving colors that don’t even fill in the lines. It’s like a child drew it. Whenever you look at the front of the hamster, the tail sometimes makes it look like Ebichu has a male part and even has the normal little black dot to show a butt hole. It could have been placed behind her and not looked that bad. Ebichu also looks a lot like Hamtaro which messes me up since Hamtaro is a little kids show.A lot of the script is made for Japanese so I can understand why they haven’t dubbed it yet. The first episode has Ebichu playing a word game and I guess the words for Chestnuts and Squirrels in Japanese is the same for a women’s… well… down below. The music is alright, nothing to put on a ipod though. It just doesn’t stick out well. the story, I have to say, this feels pretty realistic and I actually like it to a point.

For this reason, Oruchuban Ebichu breaks my heart.Ebichu, the adorable (one might say sickeningly so) hamster of the title is mauled and abused in every episode, after having only lovingly cleaned her master's home.  Reality check, eh?  This shit happens in the real world, people.Another reality check?  Office Lady, although she is constantly taken advantage of by her lousy boyfriend, always comes back to him.

Of course it is sad that Ebichu gets punished often, but its just slapstick for gods sake. Get over yourselves. And the art couldn´t be super detailed, otherwise the show couldn´t be broadcast at all due to censorship. The simplistic art style is what lets it get away with being so explicit. This is Japan, people. Even their porn is censored. By the way, the art shouldn´t have to be detailed to be considered good. Judging an art style based on how detailed it is is stupid. In this case,...the simplistic art style serves a purpose and lends to the overall atmosphere of the show, which is the art´s point in an anime. If it simply doesn´t appeal to you, that´s valid. But trying to judge the art from an ¨objective¨ standpoint is pointless, as art is subjective. The animation can be judged objectively though, and yes, I do agree the animation is a bit lacking. But the show gets by just fine and I find it gives the show more charm and has a comedic effect, which is why I rated the art so high. I also love the cute opening and strangely good ending song. I´m still trying to memorize the lyrics of both, which is difficult only because of how nonsensical they are and how off-beat they are sung.I wont repeat what most people who enjoyed the show wrote (about the dirty jokes and all that), I only wanted to defend and deflect the some of the idiotic things people said about the show in other reviews and let any newcomers know the show has more quality than they made it seem it has. the simplistic art style serves a purpose and lends to the overall atmosphere of the show, which is the art´s point in an anime.

It's short, quirky and unique comedy. The show is about daily life of a woman who lives in an apartment with her pet, who does the chores. The comedy is heavily based on characters and their interaction than other elements. Story is one of them and the show feels like it's slowly paced and barely any changes happen at all. But that's the only downside, characters and situation are on the focus and create amazing atmosphere.The show is comedy of character. We don't know much about the characters: most of their names, occupations...and other personal details; while we know all their personal traits: the woman is gullible and has low self-esteem, her boyfriend is a drunk and a cheater, the hamster behaves impolite often and humiliates her owner in public, etc. When it gets close to the feeling that you can predict next actions, the show gets refreshed with new characters, locations or events which keep the flow interesting.

Mikakunin de Shinkoukei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20541/Mikakunin_de_Shinkoukei,"['""Dust in her eye? I\'m gonna kill it!"" - Hakuya Mitsumine.Over the last few years, Rom-coms have become stale; the violent tsundere, a harem, the childhood friend, unrequited love, all of the shows seem to have these itsy-bitsy things. As such, the comedy becomes stale, they become increasingly dull to watch and you automatically know what is going to come next.But not with Mikakunin de Shinkoukei.I repeat, you will not be able to predict what will be coming next in this little anime.Mikakunin de shinkoukei is REALLY unpredictable. It drops the bomb on huge things like it\'s no big deal and makes a big deal...out of things that are of no importance. Not only that, the way it handles cliches is completely ridiculous. Almost all of the normal cliches are present in Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, just in a different way. It leads you into preparing yourself for the cliches, but the opposite happens instead ( I will refrain from giving an example not to ruin your enjoyment in this series. You will know EXACTLY what I mean when you watch it)Speaking of enjoyment, the kind Mikakunin de Shinkoukei provides you with is the happy and refreshing kind. Mikakunin de Shinkoukei makes you have fun WITH the characters. It will take the weight of your shoulders and make you happy from watching the everyday life of Benio, Mashiro,Kobeni and Hakuya. You will laugh at their eccenticities of each of the cast members, and I assure you, you will get a lot of laughs out of them.What about romance? Well, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei has plenty of offer on that matter too. Usually in a romance series, The main couple must overcome misunderstandings, difficulties, rivals, and all those annoying stuff. Mikakunin does none of that.(It will make you think otherwise though) Granted, it doesn\'t make you go ""D\'awww"" out loud most of the time, but you surely feel fluffy inside from seeing the two innocent teenagers, Hakuya and Kobeni grow closer and closer.In a Rom-com series, proper and strong characters are a must. How does Mikakunin fare in this area? VERY WELL. Benio and Mashiro are the ones that carry the humor in this series, and they do it very well. Say anything you want if Beino\'s ridculous sis-con antics don\'t make you laugh even once. Slap me through the internet if you don\'t laugh at Mashiro\'s eccentric actions.Do the two main characters get overshadowed by those two then? Of course not. Hakuya seems like your average male lead. Dense, stupid, timid. Oh, how wrong you must be. Granted he\'s dense, but he\'s a billion times sharper than some *cough* Orimura Ichika *cough* idiots, and that\'s because he comes from the mountains. And believe me, looks can be deceiving, he\'s not the gloomy guy he seems to be. How happily he reacts to Kobeni\'s actions will make you see him in a new light (He sometimes shines when he\'s happy)Of course, let\'s not forget, the main girl, Kobeni Yonomori. The sister of Benio, the sister in law of Mashiro and the bethrothed of Hakuya. It\'s obvious that this whole show revolves around her. Her role as a straight man to the antics of the rest of the cast works like a charm. And it\'s really nice to see how she slowly turns ""dere dere"" towards Hakuya.The sound department of this anime deserves a mention too. Mashiro\'s voice acting is really good (even though this is her VA\'s first role). The same can be said for Benio\'s voice acting too, she wouldn\'t be as funny if the voice actor wasn\'t this good.The OP and the ED of this anime is addicting. The OP, Tomadoi Recipie, is an upbeat song that will make you want to listen to the first parts again and again (a youtuber made a 10-hour loop of it) And the ED, Mashiro World is one of the cutest EDs of this season.In short, Mikakunin is a must if you want a decent SOL-Rom-Com.

See if you like it.', ""Engaged to the Unidentified generated very little hype coming into its season, being an adaptation of a relatively unheard of manga. So how exactly did it catch my attention when one glance of the line-up for the season had other shows I could of better invest my time with? Was it the cover image of three adorable looking girls in seifuku which called to me? Possibly... Actually, that was most definitely the case. C'mon, let's be honest; what other reason could there be and please don't tell me the synopsis had you brimming with optimism. I'm willing to give anything a chance as long as...there's cute girls I can ogle at and I particularly wasn't looking for something to test my wits or to get me on the edge of my seat. Thus Engaged to the Unidentified was quite the inviting choice for somebody who just wanted to loosen up and let the calm sweep them away.Story:Is this still your generic SoL rom-com you see rolling in every season? For the majority it is. Nothing screams mundane more than the synopsis of this show so as you can imagine, expectations were pretty low at the point of starting. The first few episodes are mostly spent building characters and observing Kobeni after saying farewell to living peacefully as a normal highschool girl when the Mitsumines join the household. For 1/2 of the show, it's standard fare in terms of a SoL rom-com; a large chunk of comedy of the moe kind but a pea sized amount of romance. The latter half is where the show begins to peak when we learn the Mitsumines are far from ordinary folk and the connection with Kobeni linked to a long forgotten accident, leading to the reason behind this engagement. Personally, I thought the new turn of events were weird for this show (not shocking) but even so, it still never strayed far from being a normal SoL rom-com. From what I gathered, it was only a means to advance a stagnating relationship so don't go hoping to have your mind-blown expecting a massive change when you learn of this new revelation. To conclude; a simple premise of girl forced to betroth boy with an innocent yet unusual twist half way that sets the romance into motion.Art:Surprisingly, the art is very attractive. The animations for each character are smooth and slick and fits very well with the show's direction. It isn't short of cute or funny moments that would send you on a GIF making binge. Extremely pleasant to the eye and has a certain charm about it that causes you to break into a wide smile. Nothing to really complain but nothing to really highlight as being revolutionary or rousing though. With the atmosphere of what the show was going for, keeping it light and cute was the right direction.Sound:A mostly unknown cast of seiyuu but fulfilled each of their roles nicely. Personally, i'm not too picky when it comes to this so I wasn't dejected when peeking at the list. However, I was very surprised to see this was a first time role for Mashiro's seiyuu who did a standout performance you wouldn't anticipate. The OP and ED are very upbeat and catchy; I don't think I ever skipped past them before or after an episode yet felt it was a little dishonest because whilst watching this show, I noticed there was a startling lack of BG music which is very rare for this genre. I'm not usually somebody who pays close attention to it but having noticed myself, it may disappoint other people who do care. I do think this may of been a choice of direction rather than negligence as it emphasised the down to earth nature of this anime.Character:A generic story can be carried by a strong cast of characters. In this case, i'm not sure which department wins. There was nothing wrong with them; more like there was nothing special about them that would convince me to add them onto my favourite characters list. Kobeni, the main female of the story, is indeed pretty, considerate and candidate for perfect waifu but wasn't strong enough to really shine above the others and felt somewhat muted. Hakuya, the main male (and the only one) of the story, I even forget existed in the first half of the show. However, both are as meek as eachother so there is a balance in the relationship that I enjoyed. Mashiro, the impulsive and immature chibi (likely will have the most fans), and Benio, the severe siscon honour student, provide most of the comedy and steal the show. Altogether, a charming but unoriginal cast which could of been better if the central leads held a stronger presence.Enjoyment:Now for the main question; is it enjoyable? If you're a big fan of this genre then certainly yes. If you aren't then you'll most definitely feel that time was wasted. Engaged to the Unidentified does not offer anything new or exciting but still delivers well for its kind. One complaint i'm sure many people have voiced is the pacing. For the first half, almost nothing happens in regards to advancing the story. Confusing it for a cute girls doing cute things anime wouldn't be confound at all. As for the romance, it hints here and there as the show progresses and doesn't really blossom until very late. It's cute, awkward and pure but it won't get your heart racing. People who have seen plenty of SoL will be accustomed to the turtle like pacing but those who are romance veterans that delight in more passionate relationships will probably find themselves bored stiff.Overall:Engaged to the Unidentified is a very solid series. If you're not looking for anything serious and just want to chill out to something cute (did I forget to mention that?) and dainty then absolutely give this a try. Compared to other shows of this type, there wasn't much about it that stood out apart from the twist half way but that couldn't save this series from being just a regular SoL rom-com. there's cute girls I can ogle at and I particularly wasn't looking for something to test my wits or to get me on the edge of my seat. Thus Engaged to the Unidentified was quite the inviting choice for somebody who just wanted to loosen up and let the calm sweep them away.Story:Is this still your generic SoL rom-com you see rolling in every season?

For 1/2 of the show, it's standard fare in terms of a SoL rom-com; a large chunk of comedy of the moe kind but a pea sized amount of romance. The latter half is where the show begins to peak when we learn the Mitsumines are far from ordinary folk and the connection with Kobeni linked to a long forgotten accident, leading to the reason behind this engagement. Personally, I thought the new turn of events were weird for this show (not shocking) but even so, it still never strayed far from being a normal SoL rom-com. From what I gathered, it was only a means to advance a stagnating relationship so don't go hoping to have your mind-blown expecting a massive change when you learn of this new revelation. To conclude; a simple premise of girl forced to betroth boy with an innocent yet unusual twist half way that sets the romance into motion.Art:Surprisingly, the art is very attractive. The animations for each character are smooth and slick and fits very well with the show's direction. It isn't short of cute or funny moments that would send you on a GIF making binge. Extremely pleasant to the eye and has a certain charm about it that causes you to break into a wide smile. Nothing to really complain but nothing to really highlight as being revolutionary or rousing though. With the atmosphere of what the show was going for, keeping it light and cute was the right direction.Sound:A mostly unknown cast of seiyuu but fulfilled each of their roles nicely. Personally, i'm not too picky when it comes to this so I wasn't dejected when peeking at the list. However, I was very surprised to see this was a first time role for Mashiro's seiyuu who did a standout performance you wouldn't anticipate. The OP and ED are very upbeat and catchy; I don't think I ever skipped past them before or after an episode yet felt it was a little dishonest because whilst watching this show, I noticed there was a startling lack of BG music which is very rare for this genre. I'm not usually somebody who pays close attention to it but having noticed myself, it may disappoint other people who do care. I do think this may of been a choice of direction rather than negligence as it emphasised the down to earth nature of this anime.Character:A generic story can be carried by a strong cast of characters. In this case, i'm not sure which department wins. There was nothing wrong with them; more like there was nothing special about them that would convince me to add them onto my favourite characters list. Kobeni, the main female of the story, is indeed pretty, considerate and candidate for perfect waifu but wasn't strong enough to really shine above the others and felt somewhat muted. Hakuya, the main male (and the only one) of the story, I even forget existed in the first half of the show. However, both are as meek as eachother so there is a balance in the relationship that I enjoyed. Mashiro, the impulsive and immature chibi (likely will have the most fans), and Benio, the severe siscon honour student, provide most of the comedy and steal the show. Altogether, a charming but unoriginal cast which could of been better if the central leads held a stronger presence.Enjoyment:Now for the main question; is it enjoyable? If you're a big fan of this genre then certainly yes. If you aren't then you'll most definitely feel that time was wasted. Engaged to the Unidentified does not offer anything new or exciting but still delivers well for its kind. One complaint i'm sure many people have voiced is the pacing. For the first half, almost nothing happens in regards to advancing the story. Confusing it for a cute girls doing cute things anime wouldn't be confound at all. As for the romance, it hints here and there as the show progresses and doesn't really blossom until very late. It's cute, awkward and pure but it won't get your heart racing. People who have seen plenty of SoL will be accustomed to the turtle like pacing but those who are romance veterans that delight in more passionate relationships will probably find themselves bored stiff.Overall:Engaged to the Unidentified is a very solid series. If you're not looking for anything serious and just want to chill out to something cute (did I forget to mention that?) and dainty then absolutely give this a try. Compared to other shows of this type, there wasn't much about it that stood out apart from the twist half way but that couldn't save this series from being just a regular SoL rom-com."", 'It seems that ‘16’ is a magic number for most girls, as in a special moment where something must happen that makes their Birthday to be unforgettable. Most times anyways, it’s just any normal day for people. But in this show, that’s not exactly the case when Kobeni Yonomori finds out that she is to be engaged with her arranged fiance Hakuya Mitsumine. As a little bonus, Hakuya also brings his younger sister Mashiro to spice up the family.The concept no doubt comes firsthand as being cliché. We have the golden trio of the show that plays on the norms of the normal, popular,...and cute girl. Then, there’s the main male protagonist Hakuya with an apathetic outlook on life. Taken for granted, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei (Engaged to the Unidentified) comes off as a show that isn’t particular outstanding judging from its outer shell. Yet, the story itself is crafted with a clever way of delivery. In retrospect, it’s a romantic comedy with a simple premise involving an arranged marriage. There’s certain degrees of development between the characters as we learn about their true origins. By their origins, it’s noticeable to point out that some aren’t actually humans. More importantly however is how they fit into society and demonstrates human behavior.Development comes from the foundation of its characters. The character cast is small yet colorful. The core of the show involves Kobeni and her new circumstances as a young girl. She just turned sixteen, which by most law sets the standards for a working girl in society. Yet, her circumstance skips that phase and goes towards marriage, an abrupt event that can change most people’s lives. After all, marriage calls for responsibilities for young women like never before. Yet, Kobeni is able to still continue life thanks to the support of others. One of them is her older sister Benio. Coming off as an elegant lady on the outside, she is viewed as an idol at school. Yet at home, she has a bizarre attraction towards the youngest in the household, Mashiro. Being only nine years old, Mashiro often wants to be noticed and demands others to see her not as a child, but as an authoritative figure. Finally, our main male protagonist Hakuya is the aloof young man without much words but holds some wisdom for the family. There’s an odd degree of mixture with these characters since none of them really are compatible with each other. Yet, they hold the show together in a laudable way with their influence. Despite not even noticing it, their actions leads to results and often bring together episodes of embellishment. This can either be in the way of drama, comedy, or story development. In essence, the characters can be quite easily to get attached to thanks to their diverse personalities. Hell, even the parents make their memorable moments despite their relatively short time on the show.As the story progresses, we learn more about what happened in the past with clever usage of flashbacks. They give clues with foreshadowing details relating to the main premise of the story. More importantly is how our characters responds to them, especially in the case for Kobeni. Developments takes unusual turns with romance angles and characterization. In fact, we learn more about the characters through their interactions. The story also deals with supernatural elements, another unusual gag used for such a lighthearted story. While lacking the shounen action one might hope for, it makes it up with its energy. Mashiro in particular is like a light bulb that shines with ebullience. Similarly, her interaction with Benio will evoke amusing reactions given their complete opposite characteristics.Being a romantic comedy, there’s a presence of romance developing. Unfortunately, Hakuya tends to be a character that lacks any exquisite attributes. He’s not the bachelor type or someone people see as a hero or sex idol. Instead, Hakuya is a quiet young man that often keeps words to himself. Yet when the situation calls for it, he is able to enter a conflict and tries to formulate a civil solution to bring peace. Of course, his past is a big point to the story involving him and Kobeni during their childhood. A love triangle also develops in later episodes involving a supporting character that causes trouble. She brings not only drama but some nuisance for the family because of her obsession with Benio, minor feelings for Hakuya, and rivalry with Mashiro. But as far as romance goes, most parts is still lighthearted and somewhat realistic. However at the same time, it’s predictable judging by Kobeni’s interactions with Hakuya. We also get unusual responses from Benio, the oldest sister of the family. She breaks out of her usual comfort zone and displays of annoyance towards their engagement. Hakuya also shows more of his character as he becomes more and more involved with his decisions rather than just being a standard yes man.Comedy exists throughout the series in a variety of ways. They can come with mixed bags depending on how one perceives its execution. However on most parts, I find the comedy to be cleverly executed. Thanks to our main characters, there’s a fun mood in the show despite the tense premise. Mashiro is the mascot with her attempt to act like an adult despite being a kid. She can yell, wear adorable outfits, has a huge sweet tooth, and can dance melodiously in front of a television. Her fear for Benio is what really brings out the humor of the show. Yet, this can also become drawback for viewers who sees Benio’s tactics to get Mashiro’s attention to be repetitive. It’s hard to not see Benio going full lolicon on Mashiro. Also, fan service is minimal and there’s not much of it with even the absence of a beach or onsen episode. Camera angles aren’t suggestive and neither does skin show for any of the girls except in perhaps the main opening sequences. Rather, the series brings together more of an unusual romance comedy rather than an asinine sweet 16.Despite the bizarreness of the presentation, there are some parts that can be dull. Hakuya in particular is a character that is hard to get used to or be relatable mostly because of his little presence. The love angle between him and Kobeni can also come off quasi with lack of sensation. Even with development, the duo doesn’t stand out much mostly because of their silent personalities. Most supporting characters only play minor parts with only one girl that makes quite the drama. Additionally, most episodes doesn’t take itself outside the home or school setting. It lacks a degree in diversity as to other locations being explored in their neighborhood. And even so, neither is their home or school distinctive in any way.There’s also interesting aspects to the artwork style. Characters are designed with cuteness and simplicity. Mashiro in particular is a girl that stands out with her short stature and hair that seems to almost have a life of its own. Kobeni’s innocence is also portrayed well for a young girl that doesn’t go with social conformity such as putting on heavy makeup or spending hours in the bathroom doing their hair. The backgrounds are also aesthetic and comedic scenes adapts itself with clever usage of its visuals.Soundtrack has a casual tone with its OST. It’s easy to take notice of the slice of life tone with director Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, previously involved with GJ-Club. Hence, experience some of the lighthearted background music that is coordinated with various scenes. It’s also noticeable that on many occasions, there is no OST playing in the background at all in order to illustrate a sense of realism. Characters’ voice mannerisms fits well on some parts, although Mashiro’s voice can come as both cute yet fluffy at times. Yuri Yoshida voices her character who is a rather fresh face in the VA industry that may take some time to get used to. Otherwise, Hakuya’s voice is hardly outstanding and some of his dialogues come off as monotonous as if he’s reading off some textbook. On the other hand, embrace the OP and ED song for its catchy tone and bouncy sequences.Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is more of a show for one’s self-indulgence. It will take a little time to get used to but the pleasure of enjoying this show is worth it for its characters. Even the story comes together with unusual gags despite the quasi-like clichés. The show does have some frivolous comedy and moments where it does seem repetitive. Additionally, some characters might also might strike a few nerves with their personification. In fact, to enjoy this show will take patience but in the end will be a fun ride if your mind is up for it. and cute girl.

And Dogakobo had, yet again, brought out another good anime for us to watch.When I watched the first episode of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, I thought that it would have a great story and I felt that it would be the best romcom anime for the season. But unfortunately, I wasn’t finding that expectation I wanted. Here’s why.The story revolved around the Yonomori sisters, Kobeni and Benio, and the Mitsumine siblings, Hakuya and Mashiro. Akane, who is the Yonomori sisters’ mom, announced that Kobeni was somewhat engaged to Hakuya by...her grandpa during her 16th birthday. Apparently, Kobeni had met Hakuya before during childhood, but it seemed that she forgot who he was.So why did my expectation failed? It can be summed up in one word, which is “tropes”. They are everywhere in the anime, mainly the story and the characters. It made the story a bit clichéd, and the characters similar to others.However, it didn’t really matter much, because there are some points in the story which made the story more interesting. Indeed, there is a small surprise that developed it from a few characters. There is also a backstory between Kobeni and Hakuya as well. The romance, although not bringing enough impact to me, is cute. There are times when Kobeni showed her “dere” side sometimes to Hakuya, while there are other times when she wanted Hakuya to stop acting “cutesy-lovely” to her. Eventually, the relationship actually developed.The ending is a bit satisfactory, as it ended the story where the characters continued to carry out their lives.The anime has characters with the typical tropes. Benio is a student council president who excels in academics and sports and is adored by many students. Mashiro is a child who acts like a teenager. Hakuya is a quiet guy who is always emotionless. Kobeni has great figures, mentioned by some characters, and is great at housework and cooking. There are other characters, such as Konoha, a member in the student council, who has feelings for Benio, and Shirayuki, mom of the Mitsumine siblings, who looked like a loli.I feel that there’s isn’t much character development in all except Hakuya and Kobebi, but it is a slice of life anyway. But all these characters are interesting. Some of them showed their emotions well to execute something.The opening is totally superb. It has a great upbeat and is sung by the seiyuus of the three main girls in the anime. They also sang the ending, which is more relaxed but still enjoyable. The art style is awesome, although not really important at all. The scenery is just spectacular. The character designs have the moe feel, and the facial expressions do exaggerate, all of this to make a great comedy.Although the story and characters are the anime’s weakest points, I still enjoyed the anime nevertheless. It may not be the best romcom of the season, but it is good enough. Sweet cute romance is enjoyable for me already.I heard that the anime’s first volume sale was great so far. I hoped that this continues onwards with the other volumes, and maybe we might expect a second season. There are two OVAs, where one of them is already released but not subbed. It’s just typical scenes of the onsen and night-walk. her grandpa during her 16th birthday.

Now ima get this out of the way really fast, this does not affect the score in any way but ill just say this. If you have an anime where your main characters are not human but take the form of humans THEN SHOW US WHAT THEY REALLY ARE it just satisfies the need to know i mean i still dont know if there dogs, not dogs, half dogs, wheredog. This title translates to, engaged to the unidenitified and good...lord unidentified is what they are.  Like spare 2 frames to show us the main character as a dog whats wrong with you, you cruel bastardKay now that that\'s out of the way let\'s get on with this bleh anime. So first off the plot of this anime seemed very promising, i like innocent rom-coms where you have a cute relationship but nay in the end i was sorely mistaken since relationship is the last thing any characters in the anime have because the whole anime is just her asking herself do i really love him. That\'s it that\'s the whole anime  i mean ""what about that whole him being a dog"" well curious reader that has no relevance to anything and might as well have not even been true ""what about her being half dog"" others would ask, well i would say that goes no where but that would be an understatement that would mean admitting it happened but really nothing happened they just said she\'s kinda sorta 1/10th dog and thats it. It has no relevance to anything.  We end the anime where we started it, a brother and a sister living with the brothers fiancee who may or may not like him. so ya plot.Characters so first we have Hakuya who is as much of a main character as the sticks he uses to build houses. He has no personality or development as a character. He is just there to be fawned upon and to get some not funny jokes in. Next we have Mashiro the token loli character. She is just there for humor as well really and she isnt very funny. She\'s kinda just the centor of the comedy along with Benio and is boring to watch. There is Kobeni who is just the most boring character to watch like my god her dialogue can be summed up in do i love him do i not love him it\'s not very deep and she also gets no character development. Then we have Benio who is one of the most annoying characters in anime, not much more to say. Then there\'s the supporting cast who support a bunch of twigs with one punch line written on them so really as to be expected they are just smaller twigs with one punch line written on them. None of them are even funny punch lines. Insestual love for you sister is not funny it\'s just stupid. In the end this anime is just a bunch of not funny nothing that starts with nothing and amounts to nothing with a whole lot of nothing in between. if you enjoy the three jokes this anime has to offer enough that you could listen to them till judgment day than enjoy.I gave this anime a 3 for the amount of jokes it had. lord unidentified is what they are.

However, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei lit a spark in me. Inspired me to write about it, I suppose.~Story~ (9/10)Nowadays the typical idea for manga is that the characters suddenly meet. I got used to that and honestly, that was what I was expecting. However, in this case it is different. 16 year olds Hakuya and Kobeni find themselves caught in an arranged marriage. It was set up by Kobeni\'s deceased grandfather. As some shows do: Hakuya moves in with Kobeni. He has...a sister named Mashiro who tries to act grown up (despite being ten years old herself) and a crazy sister-in-law named Benio who\'s more then a little protective of Kobeni and has a little bit of a complex. There\'s more then what meets the eye for this show. In the beginning it stole my heart when they hit it right off the bat with a romantic moment in episode one. (Under the first ten minutes, too!) I\'m a huge fan of fantasy and shows that involve magic. Especially the light-hearted kind. I was highly amused when little Mashiro managed to score herself a spot in high school. I won\'t say why but I know you can connect the dots. The story had much promise and it turned out well but I felt they rushed it at the end. No ""I love you"", no visiting your in-law\'s house. I was hoping for some hilarious situations and maybe even rings for Kobeni and Hakuya. (They are engaged, right?) Besides that, I felt it was amazing and deserved the 9/10 I gave it.~Art~ 8/10I\'m a pretty honest person. So I\'ll admit that when I noticed Kobeni had a bust, I groaned and looked down at my own chest. The story followed with Kobeni having issues with her body and her allegedly ""good child bearing"" hips. All in all, they drew the women pretty decently and it made sense. (Though for Kobeni\'s mom, I felt a little envious of her bust. That\'s all I\'ll say.) There\'s only one boy as Kobeni\'s father nor Hakuya\'s is drawn in. Hakuya is drawn (dare I say) a little better then Kobeni. He looks a little older, and he is taller. He looks a little better and to me it seems the animators were a little more diligent. It seemed they tried to fulfil the whole highschooler who\'s a boy = good looking idea. The backgrounds were stunning (especially trees and some buildings) and even the background characters caught my eye. The animators seemed quite diligent there too. (I\'ve seen animes where the background people are lumps coloured in odd colours. It\'s great to see that they tried.~Sound~ 7/10Don\'t get me wrong, I loved the opening and ending. The songs were adorable and light hearted. I just felt that sometimes they could have tried a bit harder. (Fine, I just wanted a ""DUH DUH DUH"" like in the horror movies for when Benio got shocked.)~Character~ 7/10I loved each of the characters. From Kobeni\'s mother to Nadeshiko (Benio\'s student council friend with the brown hair.) I felt that they were all well developed, all had good attitudes. The only issue I had was how they interacted with one another. Take Mashiro and Konoha (one of Benio\'s many adoring fans and a student council member) for example. Their fighting was repetitive and really the same. I never really liked their fighting because it never really contributed to the story. Also take Kobeni and Hakuya for an example. Throughout the story I felt the spark but never much to confirm it. Sure, Hakuya did something romantic in the last ten or so minutes of the last episode for Kobeni but that\'s it. I had hopes for those two because he\'d done something sweet in the first so I wanted that to progress. It did emotionally but I\'m a fangirl and I need something to squeal about. I loved the story but they never even held hands or kissed. It hurt me a little bit.~Enjoyment~ 9/10As I mentioned before, it was hilarious all the same. Funny moments to moments where I fell over laughing. I loved the show\'s lightheartedness and I was shocked when I got to the last episode. It had just zoomed past me and left me aching for more. I loved it.~Overall~ 8/10Sure, it had some issues but I did truly enjoy it. No show is perfect and it\'s great that this one came close.I hope this was helpful! If you like comedy, a touch of fantasy and romance, this is the show for you!! a sister named Mashiro who tries to act grown up (despite being ten years old herself) and a crazy sister-in-law named Benio who\'s more then a little protective of Kobeni and has a little bit of a complex. There\'s more then what meets the eye for this show. In the beginning it stole my heart when they hit it right off the bat with a romantic moment in episode one. (Under the first ten minutes, too!) I\'m a huge fan of fantasy and shows that involve magic. Especially the light-hearted kind. I was highly amused when little Mashiro managed to score herself a spot in high school. I won\'t say why but I know you can connect the dots. The story had much promise and it turned out well but I felt they rushed it at the end. No ""I love you"", no visiting your in-law\'s house. I was hoping for some hilarious situations and maybe even rings for Kobeni and Hakuya. (They are engaged, right?) Besides that, I felt it was amazing and deserved the 9/10 I gave it.~Art~ 8/10I\'m a pretty honest person. So I\'ll admit that when I noticed Kobeni had a bust, I groaned and looked down at my own chest. The story followed with Kobeni having issues with her body and her allegedly ""good child bearing"" hips. All in all, they drew the women pretty decently and it made sense. (Though for Kobeni\'s mom, I felt a little envious of her bust. That\'s all I\'ll say.) There\'s only one boy as Kobeni\'s father nor Hakuya\'s is drawn in. Hakuya is drawn (dare I say) a little better then Kobeni. He looks a little older, and he is taller. He looks a little better and to me it seems the animators were a little more diligent. It seemed they tried to fulfil the whole highschooler who\'s a boy = good looking idea. The backgrounds were stunning (especially trees and some buildings) and even the background characters caught my eye. The animators seemed quite diligent there too. (I\'ve seen animes where the background people are lumps coloured in odd colours. It\'s great to see that they tried.~Sound~ 7/10Don\'t get me wrong, I loved the opening and ending. The songs were adorable and light hearted. I just felt that sometimes they could have tried a bit harder.

If you like comedy, a touch of fantasy and romance, this is the show for you!!', ""Ugh, romantic comedies. They are usually a mix of romance, slice of life and, of course, comedy. I’m not a particular fan of any of theses genres, as Romeo x Juliet, Yuyushiki, and a number of other anime have successfully proven to me. If I dislike all these genres, why on Earth would I like something that is a combination of all three? The pleasant surprise of Chu-2 gave me hope for rom-coms, however, and I’m pleased to say that Mikakunin de Shinkoukei held up my expectations.MdS is about a girl called Kobeni, who on her sixteenth birthday is suddenly told that she is engaged...to the mysterious Hakuya. Not very original, huh? I can imagine that people would be a little bored just by reading the summary and thus reluctant to watch this.MdS is not anime to be watched if you are searching for a fresh plot that has plenty of twists and turns. The premise, along with some other elements, is quite generic, maybe even a little stale. However, if you get past that, and rather concentrate on the way the story is told, focusing on the characters and the humour, you’ll realise that MdS is an interesting and very enjoyable anime.Watching MdS was somewhat… refreshing. As I said, the plot is not original, but it’s told in such a light-hearted and humorous way that you can’t help but like it. It masks the cliches and the ‘I’ve-seen-this-a-million-times-already’ moments so well that you don’t even realise that they’re there, save for a few moments that don’t hinder the enjoyment in the slightest. I usually hate romance anime because the romance is so soppy, slice-of-life is usually so boring that I can’t force myself to watch it any more, and comedy elements are usually entirely characters being dumb, slapstick, or the old manzai layout with the bokes and the tsukkomi. I felt none of this repugnance in MdS. I was cheering for Kobeni x Hakuya all the way and found the little romantic actions unbelievably cute. Their relationship is really well paced, too. As slice-of-life anime often go, after watching a few episodes, I asked myself what actually happened in the 2 hours or so that I'd watched so far, but it just didn't bother me because, hey, I had fun. The comedy revolved mainly around Benio and Mashiro, and was at times subject to the usual exaggerations that I don’t like, but no episode failed to make me laugh. The events and relations between the characters and just so relatable, even if few of us have been plunged into an engagement planned by our relatives. Even fewer of us have known people who aren’t really human, but the way the characters react mirrors how most of us would probably react.In short, the plot line of MdS really accentuated everything that I like about anime - the great story telling, as well as the fun of it.The characters are definitely the strongest point of the anime. They’re just all so loveable, and every extra minute they’re on screen only adds to the overall greatness. Similarly to the plot line, there are some stereotypical elements in their personalities, but their highly amusing personal quirks and characteristics simply drowned this out. Let’s take Kobeni. She's the average high schooler that we’ve seen so much before, with slightly low self-esteem, but at the same time, parts of her mindset are completely different from... pretty much every other female lead I've seen up till now. She is the first anime girl that I’ve seen who is self-conscious about her figure and wants a smaller bust. All females I have seen till now are perfectly slender and find being flat-chested a curse. Kobeni does have rather big breasts - something which is pointed out a few times in the anime - so maybe it is our human nature to want everything we don’t have, but still, this was just such a relief. There’s a lot more to her though, but I won’t elaborate too much. The way the seemingly stoic Hakuya’s emotions are portrayed are definitely giggle-inducing, and despite being apathetic most of the time, he can be amusing. Mashiro is by far the cutest character, mature for her age… but not completely. And for once, there are actually adults living in Japan.Benio and Suetsugi let the cast down a little. They’re both amusing characters, but they were blatantly stereotypical. Benio’s little sister complex and popularity were over the top, dragging away in an unneeded fashion from the realism of the anime. She also broke the fourth wall a number of times (“this reeks of love comedy”). Suetsugi's yandere-like love towards Benio was a little annoying.Despite some flaws, all the characters were very loveable and greatly added to the general enjoyment of the anime.The art was nothing special, but it was really well done. The character designs were very well done, and the general drawing style was really appealing. There were some flaws, notably the chibi-like feet at times, without the actual details of the shoe, or Mashiro's dress alternating between blue and green, but apart from that, the art was fine. Good backgrounds, good characters. When I think of anime, this kind of art pops to mind.Voice acting was really well done. The voices suited the characters so much. They didn’t sound overly emotional, kids didn’t sound like adults, etc. Once again, this is the type of voice acting that I expect from anime. My main complaint would be Mashiro’s voice. It bothered me a little at first, since it sounds obviously fake, like the voice actress was voicing with cotton balls or the likes in her mouth in attempt to sound ‘cute’. It wasn't like that all the time, though, and I soon came to like it. Benio’s voice in particular was really well done.There wasn’t that much background music, which is a bit of a shame, because the bgm tracks were quite nice. The OP and ED are one of the better ones I’ve seen so far. I usually skip the OP, but in MdS I listened through it every episode. The ED was cute and well done as well. I would have listened through it every time as well if I wasn’t so eager to get on to the next episode.In summary, the music that this anime had was really nice, but there should have been more.If I had to summarise Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, I would have to say: simple, but fun.This anime was by no means flawless. It does have some stereotypical and failed-comedy elements. However, it is so enjoyable, the characters are so loveable, that it outweighs the flaws. I really enjoyed it, and finished it within 2 days. The ending is very open, so I’m in high hopes that we’ll get a second season!Let me just finish off by saying that for me, contrary to most other anime I’ve watched, first impressions were correct. If you don’t like the first few episodes, this anime is not for you.Even if you’re not a huge fan of rom-coms, like me, I still suggest you give Mikakunin de Shinkoukei a try!Plot: 8/10Art: 8/10Sound: 7.5/10Characters: 8/10Enjoyment: 9/10Overall: 8.1/10 - rounded to an 8 to the mysterious Hakuya.

You will be surprised at...the end that this is a good RomCom.Story: 8/10Well the story goes as the title of the anime says ""Engaged to the Unidentified"". It follows Yonomori, Kobeni and her daily life with her fiance that she just met, Mitsume, Hakuya , or so she thought. The story line is pretty common with other Romantic Comedies like this which are the girl meets her unknown fiance and as the story goes on they fall in love with each other. However what sets this anime different is that the development or the progress of their relationship is faster than other RomCom but at the same time gives a convincing bond between Kobeni and Hakuya. Next would be is how they deliver those cliches, they all delivered it well and in a funny way that anyone could enjoy.Art: 8/10Since I am not an artist, I will just say it\'s nice. I mean it\'s not bad at all but not that remarkable either and before you think its mediocre, let me just tell you it\'s not or at least I think it is. Though I could say the art is normal it could really deliver the emotions and atmosphere it wants to deliver like when its serious it gets a little dark and when romantic it get bright and fluffy.Sound: 10/10""Papapara♪ papa♪ oh-oh♪ papapara♪ pa♪ yeah-yeah♪!""Yes the opening is addicting as cocaine or for my geek friends Pokemon.It one of those song that so catchy it will haunt in your dream like what happened to me! Anyways, the opening and ending are both great and one of this anime\'s best strength.  IT WILL ALSO GET STUCK IN YOUR MIND!!!Character: 9/10You would normally think that all the characters will be linear or copy-paste personalty on a other RomCom characters but you will be sorta wrong.Well I did say sorta because the sub-characters are as stereotype as you can get. I feel like they are there just for gags you know extra when the plot needs humor or help sometimes. Then you have the main cast:Kobeni Yonomori- the lucky sweet 16 girl who got a fiance for her birthday.She is a all around nice girl and could be a serious hard-working wife when she needs to. Though you would say that there is no problem with her, she has a inferiority complex with her sister which she thinks she is lower than her.Hakuya Mitsumine- An emotionless character at first that has actually have a character. He is also the one that deliver the cliche line of RomCom male protagonist yet it work, props to him, CHEERS!.Mashiro Mitsumine- The Obligatory loli of the series because MOE! Nonetheless she is not useless because she helps the relationship of his brother, Hakuya, and gives humor to the story as well.Benio Yonomori-  The Obligatory crazy sister of Kobeni because what will a RomCom be without a crazy sister, ....a slice of life or sitcom. However she is actually a likable character because she cares about her sister and she gives the best gags and comebacks in the show.Enjoyment: 7/10The shows strong points are its Romance and Comedy which is to be expected because it is a Romcom. Personally I enjoy the 4th wall breaks of Benio and the Hakuya x Kobeni moments. However as much as I like the show it still has some flaws and a big one for me also. I don\'t want to spoil anyone so I will just say it as a plot device. That PLOT DEVICE IS UNNECESSARY, I mean you could do the same thing without it or even better. It only caused unnecessary conflict between Kobeni and Hakuya.Overall: 8/10Positive-Good Romance and Comedy-Really addicting opening like seriously its like ""under the sea"" of Little Mermaid-Great main castNegative-UNNECESSARY PLOT DEVICE!!!!!!!-weak minor characters the end that this is a good RomCom.Story: 8/10Well the story goes as the title of the anime says ""Engaged to the Unidentified"".

While it doesn\'t fit everyone\'s tastes, especially if you are averse to SoL or romantic comedy, Mikakunin certainly delivers on what it aspires to be. It doesn\'t try to change up the traditional formula or anything fancy, but what it does attempt is executed charmingly.The story follows the daily life and escapades of Kobeni Yonomori and her family. Many of the scenes are your typical high school slice...of life antics. While they are very tried-and-true, the segments(especially the reactions) are very funny and give each character moments in the spotlight. There was a little plot twist close to the middle of the series, but it could have easily been written differently with little impact on the outcome. However, the plot twist is somewhat subtly foreshadowed and is worked into the main storyline effectively.Essentially, the plot can be boiled down to ""Kobeni and Hakuya slowly developing their relationship together"". It is a simplistic plot, but personally I would not have it any other way. There\'s no dithering, no serious love triangles that lead to overwhelming tragedy, no ""I need to make a choice"" or whatever. The relationship is already set at the very beginning, and now it\'s the characters\' turn to make it grow. It\'s the simple story of two people slowly falling in love, and that\'s what makes it beautiful.The art style is one of the nicest things about this show as well. The characters mostly give off a sense of reality, that these people could be real. They are styled in typical fashion, but not outlandishly cute or anything like that. The proportions are very realistic and help just a little in getting into the show. Adding to that are the background art and environments, which are beautifully designed and a pleasure to look at. The school is your standard anime high school, but the city and mountain scenery are very well done and add to the ambient feel. Topping it off is the animation, which is very fluid and somewhat more natural compared to many other series. It\'s not over-the-top 60 frames per second quality, but that kind of quality would detract from the series as a simpler and more realistic show, in my opinion.An oddity about this series, however, is that there is a noticeable lack of background music during many scenes. Some people may find this a little jarring, being used to background music playing during most scenes during a show. I found it a little jarring the first couple episodes myself. In spite of that, I do feel that the lack of BGM doesn\'t really take too much away from the show. It allows some of the scenes to showcase what\'s happening onscreen without necessarily needing BGM to immerse the watcher, and it also reflects reality somewhat since most of the time background music won\'t be playing while things happen. The background music mostly boils down to personal preference; if you prefer to have BGM to immerse yourself in the show, the lack of it during some scenes will hurt this show\'s impact on you somewhat. The opening and ending songs are rather fluffy and addicting, however, and I think I can safely say that most people will enjoy them. They also fit the tone of the show very well and are good songs in their own right.The characters, while not featuring anyone who really breaks the mold of the traditional archetypes commonly found in slice of life/rom-com anime, work fairly well together and don\'t really have any serious flaws in them. Kobeni, our main female lead, is a cute teenager ""with a great rack and child-bearing hips"" who is often the face of sanity among the cast. Hakuya, our main male lead, is a quiet guy who speaks little but shows more than tells, which is a quality I appreciate among characters. Mashiro is the childish comic forever at odds with Benio, Kobeni\'s older sister who is...erm, rather perverted. The main four characters above get at least some development and/or shown to have hidden depths, which is very nice. Some potential pitfalls, however, is that the development itself is rather gradual and not entirely explicit, and a couple characters can be a little annoying at times. I personally found Benio rather grating occasionally, since a few parts of her character are highly exaggerated and are brought to the fore. She also has a tendency to interrupt something important, which can be annoying. However, the show does put on display another side to Benio beyond what is presented normally, which does help to balance and flesh out her character, but she can still be rather annoying at times.Personally, I love this work above many of the more recent SoL/rom-coms that I\'ve seen in the past couple years. That is not to say I didn\'t like the others, just that Mikakunin left a big impression on me. As a guy almost in his 20s who has never had a girlfriend in his life, I\'d say that there are few romantic SoL comedies where I could say ""Man, I hope any future relationship I have could be somewhat like this"". Mikakunin de Shinkoukei qualifies to be among those select few in my book. I found the growing relationship and eventual love that the main couple develop over the series to be very sweet and heartwarming to watch, and for me, that was the greatest gift I could have gotten from taking the six hours or so I needed to watch this anime.Overall, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is a solid Slice of Life romantic comedy that, in my opinion, deserves more attention than it got or currently gets. It is not an anime that appeals to everyone; for people who are looking for something earthshattering in the genre or for people who dislike either SoL or romantic comedy antics, this show is not your cup of tea. Mikakunin doesn\'t pull any new fancy tricks out of the Slice of Life hat. What it does do, however, is execute the tried-and-true forms very well and tie them all together into a very sweet and heartwarming story. For SoL and rom-com fans, people looking to try something new, or for somebody just looking for a sweet and relaxing story to pick up, I ask you to try Mikakunin and experience it for yourselves. It isn\'t perfect-I don\'t think any anime ever will be-but I certainly hope you prospective viewers would come to enjoy and love Mikakunin de Shinkoukei as much as I did and still do. of life antics.

It\'s the simple story of two people slowly falling in love, and that\'s what makes it beautiful.The art style is one of the nicest things about this show as well. The characters mostly give off a sense of reality, that these people could be real. They are styled in typical fashion, but not outlandishly cute or anything like that. The proportions are very realistic and help just a little in getting into the show. Adding to that are the background art and environments, which are beautifully designed and a pleasure to look at. The school is your standard anime high school, but the city and mountain scenery are very well done and add to the ambient feel. Topping it off is the animation, which is very fluid and somewhat more natural compared to many other series. It\'s not over-the-top 60 frames per second quality, but that kind of quality would detract from the series as a simpler and more realistic show, in my opinion.An oddity about this series, however, is that there is a noticeable lack of background music during many scenes. Some people may find this a little jarring, being used to background music playing during most scenes during a show. I found it a little jarring the first couple episodes myself. In spite of that, I do feel that the lack of BGM doesn\'t really take too much away from the show. It allows some of the scenes to showcase what\'s happening onscreen without necessarily needing BGM to immerse the watcher, and it also reflects reality somewhat since most of the time background music won\'t be playing while things happen. The background music mostly boils down to personal preference; if you prefer to have BGM to immerse yourself in the show, the lack of it during some scenes will hurt this show\'s impact on you somewhat. The opening and ending songs are rather fluffy and addicting, however, and I think I can safely say that most people will enjoy them. They also fit the tone of the show very well and are good songs in their own right.The characters, while not featuring anyone who really breaks the mold of the traditional archetypes commonly found in slice of life/rom-com anime, work fairly well together and don\'t really have any serious flaws in them. Kobeni, our main female lead, is a cute teenager ""with a great rack and child-bearing hips"" who is often the face of sanity among the cast. Hakuya, our main male lead, is a quiet guy who speaks little but shows more than tells, which is a quality I appreciate among characters. Mashiro is the childish comic forever at odds with Benio, Kobeni\'s older sister who is...erm, rather perverted. The main four characters above get at least some development and/or shown to have hidden depths, which is very nice. Some potential pitfalls, however, is that the development itself is rather gradual and not entirely explicit, and a couple characters can be a little annoying at times. I personally found Benio rather grating occasionally, since a few parts of her character are highly exaggerated and are brought to the fore. She also has a tendency to interrupt something important, which can be annoying. However, the show does put on display another side to Benio beyond what is presented normally, which does help to balance and flesh out her character, but she can still be rather annoying at times.Personally, I love this work above many of the more recent SoL/rom-coms that I\'ve seen in the past couple years. That is not to say I didn\'t like the others, just that Mikakunin left a big impression on me. As a guy almost in his 20s who has never had a girlfriend in his life, I\'d say that there are few romantic SoL comedies where I could say ""Man, I hope any future relationship I have could be somewhat like this"". Mikakunin de Shinkoukei qualifies to be among those select few in my book. I found the growing relationship and eventual love that the main couple develop over the series to be very sweet and heartwarming to watch, and for me, that was the greatest gift I could have gotten from taking the six hours or so I needed to watch this anime.Overall, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is a solid Slice of Life romantic comedy that, in my opinion, deserves more attention than it got or currently gets. It is not an anime that appeals to everyone; for people who are looking for something earthshattering in the genre or for people who dislike either SoL or romantic comedy antics, this show is not your cup of tea. Mikakunin doesn\'t pull any new fancy tricks out of the Slice of Life hat. What it does do, however, is execute the tried-and-true forms very well and tie them all together into a very sweet and heartwarming story. For SoL and rom-com fans, people looking to try something new, or for somebody just looking for a sweet and relaxing story to pick up, I ask you to try Mikakunin and experience it for yourselves. It isn\'t perfect-I don\'t think any anime ever will be-but I certainly hope you prospective viewers would come to enjoy and love Mikakunin de Shinkoukei as much as I did and still do.', ""This anime was cute, yet frustrating. The main characters that are engaged never actually get any alone time to talk to each other and when they do, Kobeni just mumbles and doesn't actually talk about anything.The story was very vague and didn't have any strong points and was disappointing. The ending was a let down in my opinion.The art was very good, Kobeni is one of the cutest girls in anime, and each character is very well animated, and the settings are done decently. The characters are the strongest point in the art department.The sound was pretty cute. They had little piano parts here and...there and funny music. Reminded my of Kirby's Epic Yarn at some points actually.The Characters don't ever develop. They stay very much the same throughout the entire show. Hakuya never speaks for himself, Kobeni never reacts the way you want her too, Benio was funny at first but then it gets super old, and Mashiro never leaves Kobeni or Hakuya alone.Overall it was a little disappointing with some cuteness mixed in, and it wasn't worth it but it wasn't awful. I'd suggest looking elsewhere if you're looking for a romance anime, because I'm sure most would have more romance than this one. there and funny music.

(I\'m only assuming here.)  And so, what better way to celebrate your entry into womanhood...by giving you a brand new, totally unexpected and uncalled for, fiance and sister-in-law as a present!  Today, the anime is Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, or, Engaged to the Unidentified in english translation.  Let\'s begin.Story (7.31/10):  The story is essentially what I had in my intro.  Our main protagonist Kobeni, who has reached the age of 16, has now received a fiance by the name of Hakuya, and a sister in law by the name...of Mashiro.  It is from then on that Kobeni lives with these two, with the whole timespan of the anime explaining their daily life.  Overall, the plot is extremely simple, and quite bland as an idea standpoint cause it literally is a slice of life that talks about daily life.  But, this series does have its interesting and amusing quirks to it, that make it so much better.The plot of Mikakunin has several twists and turns in and of itself.  In very unexpected times, our main protagonist learns new things about our new residents and has to cope with these new changes, as most of them pertain to an event that occurred several years prior to the story.  Yes, this anime does have a backstory, and not one that\'s particularly flushed out.  It\'s explained to a certain extent, but not to one where you know the whole story and you can make connections.Aside from the whole ""serious"" parts of the anime, (which actually add a good amount of depth into it), the anime is predominantly light-hearted comedy.  The comedy of the series is actually quite refreshing and good for a nice laugh.  The thing is, it\'s just so casual with it, that the series doesn\'t even need to try to be funny with itself, because they practically devote an entire character to it.  (I\'ll get to that later.)The ending of the series was a rather simple and somewhat open-ended one.  Personally, I would\'ve like a more closing and more absolute end due to the fact that it didn\'t really solve anything, and it was actually quite abrupt.  It worked as something that resembled an ending, I suppose.  I didn\'t like it as much though.Though the actual plot idea is a reused piece that many of us have probably seen, the actual execution was rather pleasant and enjoyable.  It\'s not the OMG you have to watch this anime of the year, but for what it\'s worth, it\'s pretty enjoyable.Overview+  Good comedy+  Good pacing (except for the final episode)+  Good depth to the characters mixed in-   Abrupt and unsatisfactory end-   Reused plot ideaCharacters (7.89/10):  Now, the characters.  For one thing, the gender ratio is like 1:8 for guys to girls.  I\'m not even joking.  This anime isn\'t a harem, but I mean, come on.Hakuya Mitsumine.  Now, as the only guy that exists in this anime period, I was somewhat disappointed with how he was created.  For starters, this guy shows no emotion.  He\'s a kuudere.  His only method to show the audience if he\'s happy, sad, depressed, or what have you, is by flashing a very ornate and colorful background depending on what mood he is.  (i.e.  Flowers when he\'s happy, and the blue, depressing lines when he\'s sad.)  As a character though, he\'s rather blunt in terms of speaking out what he wants to think.  Out of the four main characters, he gets the least amount of lines out of all of them, even though he\'s the reason why our main female is in this predicament in the first place.  Though gradually, his character is explored a bit more to help Kobeni\'s development, Hakuya himself gets jack.  It\'s not that I don\'t like him per say, but the fact that he gets so little development or expression as a character, since he\'s the only guy, is rather disappointing.So, now that we have all of the male characters out of the way, (god that\'s depressing.), now onto the real focus of the show, the main females!Kobeni Yonomori is the main protagonist of this fine little series.  Her character is heavily based on the perfect waifu archtype, as she is respectful to everyone in the series, she loves cooking, does the laundry, cleans the house, and basically any house duty needs, she can do it.  Not to mention she has the biggest bust out of all the females in the series, as mentioned many times by various other characters.  What is the key thing to know about her character, is the fact that she has several tendencies throughout the series.  Those tendencies being sick quite often, and blaming herself for any issues that come up.  She out of the whole cast gets the most development, as she starts to understand what her life really is in terms of the people around her.  She grows quite attached to the people around her, and I see her as a very honest character in general.  That being said, this development literally only appears in the very last episode, and it felt somewhat pointless to me to do a development to this degree at the END of the series.  Putting it a few episodes back, or even sprinkling it over the course of the whole series would\'ve been better.Mashiro Mitsumine is the fan favorite of this show, and for good reason.  Mashiro is presented as a proud character with the mindset of a child, (cause she\'s still like 10.)  Mostly, she\'s is the shows great focus in terms of situational humor due to the fact that she gets amazed and pleased by many different things and sweets, as well as being the one to point out the obvious most of the time, that the other characters don\'t really notice.  Above all, she acts as a ""big sister"" to Hakuya, trying to get her brother and his fiance closer together.  She doesn\'t get very much development, (beyond obtaining an obsession over aliens), but she makes up a great deal of that by just being a very enjoyable character.  Not to mention, her voice actress is a newcomer to the voice acting game, who does an incredibly good job of nailing the character in every aspect.  (I pray she gets more roles.)And finally, to round out the main characters, ugh...Benio Yonomori.  Benio is the older sister of Kobeni, with an obsession over her little sister/little sisters in general.  (Think of Akaza Akane from Yuru Yuri.  If any of you know that show.)  She is shown in the series to have two personas; one with a studious and looked up to personality at school where she is the student body president, and a model student, and the other one where she obsesses over her little sister (and later on, Mashiro), to the point of I think almost assaulting them.  Benio is the where the majority of the comedy comes from, as her obsessive personality make the series a hell of a lot more hilarious and enjoyable when it comes down to it.  While she\'s not my favorite character, she does make the show a lot more interesting.  Although, she kind of becomes obsolete towards the end of the series, which is actually kind of funny.Aside from the 4 main characters, we have about 5 or 6 other characters that make up the supporting cast.  2 of which, rarely appear.  The supporting cast is actually rather well tuned to their role, with the majority of them carving a nice niche for them to support the main cast an drive the plot along, and the others having a greater part in this series, i.e. my favorite, Konoha Suetsugi.Overall, while the cast is small, the cast is created tastefully with a wide assortment of characters that never fail to lose interest.  That being said, the ""unidentified"" part of the title is never really fully explained.  Unless you read on some wiki or do some research yourself, the actually unidentified that is explained in the series is never fully fleshed out.  It is mentioned several times with some good details, but it never REALLY explains it, which is one of the more infuriating things I find.Overview+  Small cast with decently good development+  Good slapstick characters+  Some supporting cast becomes important later on-   Only one f**king guy in this series!-   The guy is underdeveloped.Art and Sound (7.98/10):  From an artistic standpoint, this anime does what a lot of anime in this genre do, which is for the most part, switch from its normal animation to chibi, at a moment\'s notice.As far as the normal artwork goes, the show is decently detailed with nothing too exceptional in terms of detail.  The characters themselves look rather simple and quite moe heavy.  The color palette that is used comprises of a very white oriented mix of colors where even the black colors used in the show is quite light.  Occasionally, the characters will look quite comical, which from a viewership standpoint adds to the show\'s comedy.Now, the music.  I can only say one thing.  How can you not love it?  The OST for the series is very light-hearted and upbeat.  It\'s actually not too generic in terms of sound and it\'s actually quite a nice listen to and opening for a light hearted series like this.  It\'s more or less a stress reliever because it\'s just so happy sounding.On the flip side, we have, one of the best ED\'s ever in the history of anime.  (I\'m serious.)  The whole ED is sung by the voice actress of Mashiro, and the whole thing is essentially a little play in a theater acted out by Mashiro while Kobeni and Benio provide the parts of the vocals in the bottom right hand corner.  Personally, I find this to be one of the most enjoyable ED\'s ever because it is literally a show in and of itself.  The music playing is also quite cute as well.Overview+  Simple and not overly detailed artwork+  Good transition into comedy scenes+  Awesomely upbeat music-   Moe heavy character designs (This is a warning, just in case you don\'t like moe)Personal Enjoyment (9.03/10):  I will admit, I probably enjoy this series WAY more then any guy should.  When I watched this series, I, as always, attempted to find something that differed it from any other Romcom out there.  And in fact, I did.  One thing that I didn\'t find while watching this, was any real romance.  Unlike a romance series I recently finished as of the time of this review, the main focus of this show wasn\'t primarily based on the actual romance that is ""supposed"" to be going on.  Rather, it follows a rather happy and calming tale of 4 people living together, with the idea of marriage being in the back of the head.The series for me was very enjoyable, and I looked forward to it every week.  It was the culmination of really likable characters, as well as some good twists to the plot, and very funny comedy moments.  Overall, this series is a high on my recommended list for anyone who wants to watch something that is a casual slice of life, while also having a plot to it.  Regardless, I\'m still a little pissed off at the fact that they didn\'t completely fully explain the ""unidentified"" part of the series.Overall Score: (8.21/10) of Mashiro.

This anime started off decent enough, and yet it went increasingly downhill from there. I felt zero development in any area of this anime, it didn't have any hint of depth. I was hoping for a charming rom-com that would be simple to watch and yet satisfying. I was disappointed, to say the least.Story and Plot: 4I wasn't completely uninterested in the plot, but it really dragged on and was weighed down by poor comedy on Benio's part....The comedy was decent, but whenever Benio was on screen I dreaded what was to come, I found her comedic role to be astoundingly annoying. As for Hakuya and Mitsumine not being human, I found it surprising that they never show us what they can really do.Art: 6The art was actually charming, and it fit the feeling of the show. The art gave off a heartwarming and simplistic vibe.Character: 5The worst character got too much screen time, the best characters got too little. Benio is my main complaint, it became blatantly obvious that she had an uncomfortable obsession with lolis. This 'quirk' of hers wasn't funny in the slightest, I felt genuinely uncomfortable with her character, every second she was on screen I was screaming for the FBI. Had she had less screen time, or none at all, this anime would have been ten times more enjoyable. I found Mitsumine to be adorable for being so childishly mature, and Kobeni was also very sweet. As for Hakuya, I found his character to be the most comical. His expressionless emotions were of the few things to actually crack me up, maybe one day he'll finish his wooden house. However, these characters still felt 2D and flat, and it's easy to become uninterested in them.

Thus later that day the boy, who looks considerably older than Kobeni, and his sister, who looks more like an 8 year old drop by. Kobeni\'s mother, who for the rest of the series is less than a supporting character, tells her that her grandfather , long dead now, engaged them when she was very little. What follows in the next few episodes is how, Kobeni handles this news, and how...she\'ll deal with it in school.Characters: The hallmark of a slice of life show is its characters, and I believe that this series really did when in that department. Kobeni Yonomori, is a timid, busty, housewifey type of 16 year old, for whom cooking, cleaning and laundry are more important that school clubs, and sports, both of which she is quite terrible at. Her sister, Benio Yonomori is the complete opposite, as she is student council president, and is a fantastic athlete, but she hates all things to do with the household, and can\'t cook worth beans, seriously well other than steamed buns. Their mother is an equal of Benio, and can\'t cook, clean, and is a work-a-holic, her story is not really mentioned in the story. Over all Benio and Mashiro, Kobeni\'s set to be future sister-in-law have a really great comedy act, where Benio is trying to fetishize Mashiro, and she is equally strong in her hatred of Benio.Art & Overall Apperance: This show is wonderfully animated, I mean shirts blowing in the wind, vivid colours, and great character design. Kobeni is set as our main character, but she don\'t have any of the ""MOE"" tendencies, such as clumsiness, I refer to Lucky Star of course, and Ecchi-ness, her busty figure is rarely the center of attention but when it is, it is done pleasantly, not let\'s just objectify her entirely. The scenery is also quite well done, and this animation studio, of which I do not know at this time, I will come back to.Verdict: You want a show you can just enjoy, without any story whatsoever, then this is the show for you! The characters are the main focus here, and the SOL plot is something more unusual than the average run of the mill, and that\'s what makes it really bearable. If however, SOL is not something you like then, you will hate this show. Nothing terribly deep happens, hell even remotely deep, at absolutely nothing. Should you watching it, well if you like the shows I like then you\'ll love this series, nothing Ecchi, so this definitely recommended to the entire crowd, of all age groups. I really enjoy the physical comedy, and that\'s something in the anime I\'ve seen, something rare. Give it a try and you\'re sure to enjoy this series, of course the re-watch factor is almost nothing, but still very highly recommendedScore: I\'m gonna give it a 7/10 cause this show is good, and well made, it accomplished everything it set out to do, and the overall atmosphere was funny and age-appropriate something that is getting harder and harder to find, season after season. she\'ll deal with it in school.Characters: The hallmark of a slice of life show is its characters, and I believe that this series really did when in that department. Kobeni Yonomori, is a timid, busty, housewifey type of 16 year old, for whom cooking, cleaning and laundry are more important that school clubs, and sports, both of which she is quite terrible at. Her sister, Benio Yonomori is the complete opposite, as she is student council president, and is a fantastic athlete, but she hates all things to do with the household, and can\'t cook worth beans, seriously well other than steamed buns. Their mother is an equal of Benio, and can\'t cook, clean, and is a work-a-holic, her story is not really mentioned in the story. Over all Benio and Mashiro, Kobeni\'s set to be future sister-in-law have a really great comedy act, where Benio is trying to fetishize Mashiro, and she is equally strong in her hatred of Benio.Art & Overall Apperance: This show is wonderfully animated, I mean shirts blowing in the wind, vivid colours, and great character design. Kobeni is set as our main character, but she don\'t have any of the ""MOE"" tendencies, such as clumsiness, I refer to Lucky Star of course, and Ecchi-ness, her busty figure is rarely the center of attention but when it is, it is done pleasantly, not let\'s just objectify her entirely. The scenery is also quite well done, and this animation studio, of which I do not know at this time, I will come back to.Verdict: You want a show you can just enjoy, without any story whatsoever, then this is the show for you! The characters are the main focus here, and the SOL plot is something more unusual than the average run of the mill, and that\'s what makes it really bearable. If however, SOL is not something you like then, you will hate this show. Nothing terribly deep happens, hell even remotely deep, at absolutely nothing. Should you watching it, well if you like the shows I like then you\'ll love this series, nothing Ecchi, so this definitely recommended to the entire crowd, of all age groups. I really enjoy the physical comedy, and that\'s something in the anime I\'ve seen, something rare.

The same trick applies to facts, you cannot change them once they have occured, you can only accept them and move forward.Mikakunin de Shinkoukei follows the story of Kobeni a normal girl with fairly good grades from the point where she is told out of the blue that she is engaged to some guy she does not know named Hakuya. She is worried at first about her future, yet slowly she begins accepting her situation as well as her new guests through a series of...amusing situations that mostly involve teasing.When you watch this series you notice how good the artwork is when you look at the eyes and the overall shapes of someone as well as the backgrounds which are,in my opinion, well made in comparison to other such series. Colors are enhanced with a shade of white to bring them closer to the fact that it is an animated series.Each of the characters are unique in their own way because of their personalities even if at some point they may seem similar, something rather good and expected given the number of characters in the series. As the story evolves they remain constant and act according to their own personalities which is perfectly normal given the fact that this is a comedy series, it is supposed to be funny not amaze people with something new.All in all I enjoyed the hilarious scenes in every episode and I would recommend this series for anyone looking for a home-comedy series with a spice of drama.Thank you for the time taken to read this review amusing situations that mostly involve teasing.When you watch this series you notice how good the artwork is when you look at the eyes and the overall shapes of someone as well as the backgrounds which are,in my opinion, well made in comparison to other such series.

Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is pretty much your typical rom com but it's fairly well done. It's not mentioned in the genre tags but there are supernatural elements which gives this rom com a little more flare.Story:While the plot is sort of generic and has been done a million times before, this series handled it differently than other shows which made it a bit more interesting. Basically, a girl turns 16 and a mysterious guy shows up on...her doorstep and turns out to be her fiance, an arranged marriage setup by their grandparents and the girl had no idea. In the typical rom com, the girl will usually be completely against the arranged marriage and the 2 main characters probably hate each other and don't get along. However, that's where this show gains some points because they don't take it in this direction. Instead, the girl, while not completely thrilled about the arranged marriage decides to give the guy a chance and the 2 actually get along.The premise may seem a bit boring because it's usually that friction between the 2 main characters that add comedy to a series but this comedy is instead introduced by the girls older sister, who seems to have some weird obsession with cute little sisters, and the guys little sister who follows him to his fiances house to help nurture the engaged couples relationship.Art:The art is nice  and matches the genre quite well, which I guess isn't surprising from a fairly new series. The characters are attractive and the animations flow naturally without any awkwardness.Sound:The music in the show is nice and easy on the ears. I also found myself watching the end credit song every time because it wasn't jut entertaining but it was catchy too. I found the cast of voice actors to be quite appropriate as well. I found the voice for Hakuyas little sister to be exceptionally well done and the voice for Hakuya himself to be fitting for his personality.Character:This is a tough one to evaluate, mostly because it's the characters that make this show good, but it's the characters that make it bad. What I mean is, Benio (main girls older sister) and Mashiro (Hakuyas little sister) are awesome and add lots of comedy to the show. Benio is a hillarious older sister that is obsessed with doing lots of cute things with her younger sisters (including her now sister-in-law). She's so obsessed that she ends up being creepy and causes Mashiro to run in horror. The interaction between these two characters is fantastic and keeps you laughing constantly.However, the sisters personalities heavily overshadow the 2 main characters. There's nothing wrong with Kobeni (the main girl), she's actually pretty likeable and a well rounded character. Unfortunately, Hakuya is one of the worst main characters in the history of rom coms. He is incredibly silent, has almost no personality, is incredibly stupid (his sister does all the thinking for him), and only has a line or 2 per episode. I didn't have a problem with this at first because characters like that usually go through some character development and become more likeable. Hakuya on the other hand does not. He stays the same throughout the entire season.The interactions between him and Kobeni are boring and never lead to any real relationship development. Not only did I find myself feeling sorry for Koberi but I couldn't really understand how anyone could fall in love with someone like Hakuya. It's different when you have a mysterious, silent main character that is constantly proving to be reliable but that's not Hakuya, he's mysterious sure, but he's lacking common sense, he's indecisive, and he's just not interesting.Enjoyment:The 2 sisters made this show really funny and stayed pretty consistent in their humor throughout the show. However, the show started to lose momentum around half season and while the comedy was still there, i think it's because the romance never really picked up momentum. Their romance for the most part stayed pretty neutral throughout the entire season. While I loved the sister comedy, it just wasn't enough to carry the entire show. About half way through the season, I was used to the comedy and while it was still enjoyable, it just wasn't as enjoyable as the beginning. This is the point where romance starts to gain momentum and make up for that initial lose of enjoyment. Unfortunately, that didn't happen in this show and the episodes became a bit stagnant.Overall:Overall, it's not bad for a rom com. It had tons of potential to be a really lovely slice of life rom com but it's squandered because of a poor male lead. I'm not saying it's bad, I don't regret watching it but it wasn't spectacular either. It's one of those shows that start off really good and just keep gradually losing steam. It never hits that point of being bad but it's certainly disappointing after having such a promising beginning. her doorstep and turns out to be her fiance, an arranged marriage setup by their grandparents and the girl had no idea.

At a glance, Mikakunin seems to be another generic show out of thousands released by Japan's animation industry, with your cliché main character living under the same roof with the opposite sex and hilarities ensue. But what the show provided is a decent slice of life with an awkward romance of two species.To start, the show's story is generic, it plays the tired living under the same roof trope that a lot of shows has done. Even its catch, which can be seen in...the title, is already played out. But what Mikakunin does is it keeps true to itself, being a simple slice of life show with insight on their characters and how the strange budding romance between the two characters develops. It is not special, but it does not really need to.As for the characters, this is where Mikakunin shines. There's the main character Yonomori Kobeni, a shy, but responsible sixteen year old heroine who is engaged Hakuya Mitsumine, an overly quiet person who is more than what meets the eye. They are supported by Kobeni's sister, Yonomori Benio, a loving sister who adores Hakuya's younger sister, Mashiro Mitsumine to an obsessive degree. What the show provided are stereotypical characters, your main character with little depth, its romantic interest that is secretive and cool, an overactive sister and your token loli who is cute and like sweets. It’s oh so familiar, but Mikakunin did great strides in making their dynamics fun, lively and relatable. It placed the main characters in an awkward romance due to how they are engaged, with not much familiarity, and they develop their romance in small yet understandable ways. Kobeni and Hakuya received decent development and showed that a character can outgrow their supposed archetype. But, it is unfortunate that the show's spotlight is taken by the two supporting characters, due to their outburst of character and their love-hate relationship that is more amusing to see. The show also features decent background characters that made the world's setting livelier. They are the cogs that set the romance of the main character moving, and it is to the studio's credit on how they utilised the background characters nicely yet avoided focusing on them too much that it might impede the development on the main cast.Moving on to aesthetics, it is clear that the company has budget saved up for the show. The characters are distinct and colourful, where the character differs themselves nicely from one another. There may be too much difference in hairstyle colours, but it is up to the audience on how they look upon it. The environment is nicely drawn, with effects that fill up certain areas in relation to real life. And to Mikakunin's credit, the animation is great, with different frames used to provide smooth transitions to character movement; it provides a nice bounce to the lively show and provides a quirky zip to its comedic parts.Next up is the sound in the show. To be honest, Mikakunin's soundtrack did not have any that stood out, but what it provided are soundtracks that kept the show from sounding empty. It provided sound effect to every minute detail, making it either funnier, or impactful depending on the scene. The voice acting for each characters are fitting, making sure that the character archetype is there, especially so with Benio and Mashiro where their love-hate relationship requires back and forth commentary against each other. Thus, kudos to the studio from making sure that not only is the aesthetic pleasing, but it is supported by effects that may not be aurally outstanding, but filling nonetheless.Lastly, for all the things that Mikakunin provides, it is all for naught if it’s not entertaining. Anime is an entertainment medium, and if a show is not entertaining, then it did not serve its purpose. Entertainment, in my own definition, has a lot of terms, but let's look at Mikakunin as the show that it wanted to be, a Slice of Life, Romance-Comedy. In the end, Mikakunin is a nice albeit generic slice of life. It was carried by its character dynamics and budget that made the show livelier than what it can be. The romance is there, more of a mutual understanding but not fully developed. The company may not have touch on the Mitsumine's family backstory that much, but it might be for the better so as to keep the show as what it was, a simple slice of life with a touch of romance.To conclude, Mikakunin is a good show, it was not the funniest, nor did it have the loveliest romance there, but it did a solid job on providing some chuckle here and there and some cute awkward romantic development between the characters. A 7/10 show that will garner its audience due to its cuteness, and to think about it, that is not so bad after all. the title, is already played out.

It is also one of the most ""brainwashing"" dance from anime. Thus, I wanted to watch this since very long ago.However, due to insufficient info I am not able to find out the name of the anime (although I once found out but I don\'t have time at the moment and by the time I am...free I forget the name already)[I dun have mal to record at that time].When 2 weeks ago I finally found the show again. I decided to watch it during the weekend and to prevent me to forget it I immediately put it into mal. And so I did managed to finish it during my weekend free time.The show is mainly about a guy who save a girl when young is engaged and they stay together. It shows the progress of the girl who once deny liking him to slowly fall in love.And the best part of the show is of course the story line. They neither keep all the secret until near the end nor tell all the past at the start but slowly let you know the pass bit by bit to keep my interest to the show.There are also a lot of funny face scene or even the dance I mentioned come out of nowhere but still make it fun to watch. The only thing I don\'t like is how annoying Benio is but she is also one of character that carry the story by making stupid things.The female MC is voiced by someone who aren\'t so experienced but still she did quite well. The OP starting part music is also very catchy not only because of the music but also the animation.Overall, the art are good story is not bad I like almost all the characters and I totally enjoy the show due to lot of different reasons.

I happened upon it by chance, and with nothing else to do decided to give it a swing. In the end, I couldn't stop watching it till I had finished every episode, the process of which may have upset my non-anime-loving family members (in short, my whole family). The thing most intriguing about this show is it is not about supernatural abilities and the people who use them,  but rather it is about people with abilities and how they live with them. The story plot is short, but carried out well; at no...point was I wondering why a character was in existence, or why they had to do something so illogical. That in its self was a relief because too often in stories there is that one character that seems to have no plot but to make the same mistake repeatedly.Anyways, of you haven't watched this show, you should, but if you don't, you'll live.For Parents: despite being a seinen romance anime, it is really clean. You never see anything and there is surprisingly no fan service or kissing. point was I wondering why a character was in existence, or why they had to do something so illogical.

The presentation is very ""cutesy"" which made it hard for me to hate the show as much as I should. The opening and ending songs and animations were also very warm and fun to watch.The problems with the story can be forgiven if you just want to turn your brain off, however, the characters cannot and are the...main issue here. The problem isn\'t even with the dialogue, but more that a lot of the characters in the show are just downright unlikable (Benio and Niko being the two worst).

The opening is also really good in it's own way, pretty much where they spent the entire fanservice budget which is not a bad thing considering the kind hearted nature of this show.One of the strongest points for this show is the characters, they are all so loveable that it was hard to pick a favorite (you'll know who is the cutest from the first episode) they actually have common sense and act very mature, a few jokes here and there but they are always welcome.Overall I can say this needs a second season and this will be another one I will have to pick the manga up, if you're into this type of shows you will be in for a treat. I tend to be a bit picky when it comes to this because I love romance and a show that actually accomplishes it's goal leaves you with a warm sensation in the heart. 10/10 one of my favorites! of cute moments and lots of laughs, truly one of my favorites.To be a show that has been out for a long time I feel like the animation is really good and at the time one of the best, sure it is starting to show its age but you will be trapped by the lovely characters, a second season would be what we really need to make this year worth.We can see the passion that was put into this project in the ending scene, definitely one I'll be listening on repeat, whenever the show ends at a climax you automatically start to sing along.

Especially older sister Benio, tha oiii is so funny and caring a little too caring if you ask me, but you can\'t even get upset with her for how she is. She and Mashiro-tan create this much funnier story. Kobeni-chan is again that girl who is much too worried and insecure about her, that\'s why some moments bother me. However, we have Hakuya and he always solves the group\'s problems in some way.Animation: Brother animation is really enjoyable and makes me feel extremely good watching this series. It calms you down extremely, but it also assures you that you will not have extremely sad and extremely unpleasant moments.Soundtrack: The soundtrack brother is extremely good and is well tuned. At any time and where you need sound is great. That\'s why I like these animes so much, because you will always know that there will be nothing to bother youPersonal Opinion:My opinion about this anime is that it is much too unpredictable at times, and at others it is too unpredictable, we don\'t have much balance here.

However, we have Hakuya and he always solves the group\'s problems in some way.Animation: Brother animation is really enjoyable and makes me feel extremely good watching this series. It calms you down extremely, but it also assures you that you will not have extremely sad and extremely unpleasant moments.Soundtrack: The soundtrack brother is extremely good and is well tuned. At any time and where you need sound is great. That\'s why I like these animes so much, because you will always know that there will be nothing to bother youPersonal Opinion:My opinion about this anime is that it is much too unpredictable at times, and at others it is too unpredictable, we don\'t have much balance here. ""But we can\'t be upset about that. Still, op and ed are great. I recommend them.""Short opinion and note: Masterpiece 10/10', ""you know that insane plot twist you see at the end of an anime that if it wasn't in the end it would force you to watch the next episode immediately but there is no next episodethis show has 3 of those and none of them are in the last episodeyou know that dumb cliffhanger at the end of the season  that makes you want the next episode immediately but now you have to wait 2 yearsthis show has the twice and neither are on the lastt episodei dont feel incomplete after watching it and the ending wasn't cringey as fuckthats impressive "", ""Engaged to the Unidentified is a sweet and enjoyable slice of life anime about two teenagers who are forced to marry each other due to family circumstances.The boy has a cute loli sister,the girl has an overprotective older sister(who is also a lolicon) and there is another astounding character which I won't spoil.Hint:Masamune kun no revengeThe art quality is fluid and soothing.The openings and endings are forgettable but the voice acting is really great.This anime has a really unexpected twist in the middle(which I obviously won't spoil)which makes it memorable.Overall, I recommend it to all connoisseurs of cuteness(like me). "", 'Story, Character, Enjoyment and Art: 10/10The Characters did their well properly, they did not prolong the happenings and it is very direct to the point, it is not one of those animes where they prolong the story until the viewer becomes bored that he/she wants to drop the series. The Character and their settings provides the viewers a proper interpretation throughout the story.The sequence of the story provides the viewers an emotional interpretation (in terms of romance) wherein the viewer can connect more through the story.Sound: 9/9The sound is good, but there are some parts where it easily gets cut off.10 + 10 + 10...+ 10 + 9 = 49 / 5 (compute for mean) = 9.8 rounded off = 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 / 5 (compute for mean) = 9.8 rounded off = 10', ""*Please note this is my first review ever and I am trying to not spoil things that are not in the synopsis.Story:I believe the story was good. The name of the anime (Engaged to the Unidentified) fits well. It all slowly leads up to Kobeni realizing her feelings that grow towards Hakuya, as well as the random and weird things between Benio and Mashiro. Also with the two supporting characters, Konoha and Niko, they add to the story between Kobeni and Hayuka a bit.Art:The art and animation was very nice. It was appealing to the eye, no use of bad color clashing in my opinion....Sound:Sounds were done well too.Character:I enjoyed the characters even if sometimes they seemed over the top.For example, Benio towards Mashiro and her(Benio) thoughts over Kobeni and Hakuya. As well as Konoha towards Mashiro about Benio treating Mashiro with special treatment.Enjoyment:I honestly really liked this anime a lot. It made me sad that there were only 12 episodes. It was a really nice rom-com.Overall:Overall this anime was a good anime for 12 episodes. Though at the same time people may think that Hakuya seem *unidentified*. He was though if you pay attention enough. They may not full show what he is, but it shows you.Even though there are others of his same species in this anime (not going to say who,) remember that they all can range from different things, and see as Hayuka is a *main* character, I can understand maybe why they didn't show what the others looked like.If you love randomness, a rom-com, and a slice of life, check this anime out.

Needless to say, the 12-episode adventure of Kobeni Yonomori's engagement was very enjoyable for me. So let's jump right in.Story - 7/10Once you begin Engaged to the Unidentified, I will not lie, the thick of the whole plot is thrown at you pretty quickly and it comes off as a bit uncomfortable. The first couple minutes sort of end up like oh there's the main protagonist, OH HERE'S THE MAIN PLOT OF THE STORY SUDDENLY. However, once you violently drive over that...speed bump, the little love story unravels in a much slower, more comfortable way. If you like action and big plot twists, this anime isn't going to be for you--the episode to episode plot points are along the lines of your typical high school anime where the main characters simply go through a series of relationship related problems. Still, I wasn't bored, seeing as the story was backed up with some pretty good characters, and it's always great to tune in and see what Kobeni's sister is up to. If you'd like action, the story isn't really all that, but if you'd like something sweet and lighthearted, it's just wonderful, and you're not rolling your eyes the entire time at stupid stuff like unnecessary panty shots or too many boob jiggles.Art - 7/10Part of the reason I liked the anime is because of the fresh and fluid style the characters are drawn. Everything about the art seems crisp and new, and I'm a bit biased seeing as I really like it when they highlight characters with a bit of clear white. As well, the characters move pretty freely and the design in general--school uniforms, street clothes, etc.--ius very contemporary.Sound 6/10I found the opening and ending credits ridiculously catchy, and don't mind not fast forwarding for that part. It's peppy and pretty much suits what you're about to watch. Yet, the background sound for most conversations is sometimes the same reused melody that comes off a bit irritating, sort of like the Jeopardy theme...Character - 8/10By far, my favorite part of Engaged to the Unidentified was how full each of the characters were, even Kobeni's friend who appeared once every so often. Kobeni's your typical plain heroine, but it's sort of forgiven when you've got characters like Benio and Mashiro backing her up. Benio, Kobeni's sister, is part of the reason I didn't get bored episode to episode, seeing as I got endless enjoyment out of her pedophilic-sister-lolita complex that couldn't be narrowed down to just one of those categories. Hakuya, the main love interest, says about two words per episode and ends up being likable anyway, simply because the anime takes the tropes and rounds them out enough for it not to be irritating.Enjoyment - 8/10As for overall enjoyment of the series, I wouldn't mind a season two, seeing as the characters and situations are likable and easy to take in. One or two of the jokes fell flat at times, but the humor is still there. Most important thing, there isn't all that awkward misunderstanding nonsense where the heroin assumes something ridiculous for comedy. It's a bit plain but it's nice.Rom-Com anime fans, slice of life anime fans, fans who want closure with a shy couple but don't want to commit to a ton of episodes--Engaged to the Unidentified isn't bad at all. It feels weird writing something nice after I was so pissed at my last anime.Anyway, the one thing I've got to say is this is one of those animes I hope gets a season two, just to delve a little deeper into the cute romantic antics of Kobeni and Hakuya. *Thumbs up emoji* speed bump, the little love story unravels in a much slower, more comfortable way.

That girl is just beyond creepy and annoying, but lets put that aside.The anime is entertaining and almost never let's you rest, you know like some anime scenes show you the landscape or such to create a right scene. This one is just action all the time, you have no time to rest before another clumsy thing or romantic thing happens.I will keep this as short as possible as I do not enjoy spoiling things nor telling people what they should like...or not, I will just say it how it is.This anime is a great one to just watch and relax, if you are into rom-coms that are constantly surprising you, most of the time it's expected but then again there are a few things that are unusual as well.All in all it's a generic rom-com that has enjoyable character, except for Benio whom I dislike, and a sort of good plot without too much development. It's purely an anime that has one purpose, at least for me, and that is to occupy some free time before a new episode of a series that I find godlike is out. or not, I will just say it how it is.This anime is a great one to just watch and relax, if you are into rom-coms that are constantly surprising you, most of the time it's expected but then again there are a few things that are unusual as well.All in all it's a generic rom-com that has enjoyable character, except for Benio whom I dislike, and a sort of good plot without too much development.

The fast run down of the plot is that a side of Kobeni\'s family descend from a sort of animal/human hybrid race and it has been deemed that Kobeni must marry into the family. Thus begins her awkward adventures with her fiancé Hakuya and her aunt-in-law Mashiro. Things happen in the story but you see them coming a mile away. What...really brings the show together is the humor that is present. The gags between Mashiro and Benio along with the sexual jokes pointed at Kobeni were pretty much ""lol"" worthy each time. This is also most definitely a kawaii heavy show as there are just way too many cute girls present.All that said however the plot is generic feeling and the plot points are not groundbreaking.Animation: 8.3/10I really liked the animation, the character models looked really good, action scenes (though rare) were very fluid, and backgrounds looked great. The comedy scenes had the usual exaggerated plain looking style in order to bring out more laughs.Overall a very good looking anime.Sound: 9.5/10The voice actors did a tremendous job. No I mean a spectacular job! They were so in tuned with their characters and a lot of scenes showed off how well they worked with the other characters in the show. The opening and ending for each episode was way too catchy and well done (the ending has been stuck in my head for around 3 months now). Music in-show was also very fitting.Characters: 10/10I don\'t normally give out perfect scores but the cast in this anime were so in tuned with each other. EVERY scene felt like it was worth watching for either an awkward teen love moment or a funny gag. The back and forth between Benio and Mashiro or the funny but extremely accurate insights of Mayura were a blast to watch. This is an anime that you do not watch for plot; you watch for the kawaii awesome cast interactions.Overall: 8.5/10Overall this show was an amazing watch.

Benio's character her just pisses you off to the point where you want top punch your screen.Aslo, the whole supernatural part is irrelevant since Hakuya never uses his powers or transforms, so it doesn't really contribute to the story.

I try to not spoil anything in it, because in the case I want to rewatch the show, I don't want to know too much about it other than what I think I will remember or surface level details that don't really matter much. I just want to make sure my future self understands a bit of how I felt about it and why I gave this mark.Review start:A good slice of life anime with a bit of supernatural stuff in it, adapted in quite a good way knowing that...the manga is a 4 koma. I wouldn't call it awesome, but it was nice enough to finish it ig. Maybe it was just me, but the voices were a bit too high pitched and they seemed to always scream... had to lower down the volume quite a lot, a first for me tbh.Story: 7The story is pretty basic... you can clearly see the whole big plot points from the beginning kinda. But it is okay, because this isn't really something you should watch for the story.Art: 9The art is really well done... after all, they are the studio that did Oshi no Ko and Plastic memories.Music: 9The OP and ED are pretty catchy, and the first part of the OP is top tier stuff imo.Characters: 8Now here this is a bit of a hit or miss... sometimes the character's personalities do become quite annoying... especially the couple because of their shyness and such... The interactions between them is still overall nice and funny, but man, they do no grow from their stuff... which is quite a shame to not see much progress... after all, they are a couple and everything....Enjoyment: 8At first I couldn't say I really enjoyed it, for some reason it seemed quite weird to me how the episodes went... and the first episode is quite a bomb shell already in a weird way... but episode by episode I started to grow more attached to the characters, even tho some interactions became a bit annoying to watch, it still made me want to see them more.Overall: 8Right now it has 7.37 from 182.442 votes Ranked #2320 Popularity #579 Members 391,741, which seems like around the mark it deserves. Gave it an 8 just because a bigger mark wouldn't hurt it, and in the end, I did enjoy it overall. The manga also I read that it's gonna end with the next volume... after 14 y of running.... yikes, quite a long time... especially when you think that the anime came out in 2014. I will most likely read the manga as well, as I want to see the end of their story with my own eyes and see how they grow.

This is a seinen anime meaning this is targeted at not horny brats but for those who watch anime other than for harem, drama, etc.For a superb series like this, I found the overall rating to be too low, and hence this review.First, let\'s dive in to the story. The story is superb in the way that it is told. Sinen anime focus more on the story so this is no exception. Even with some kind of superpower in this story, the story focuses more...on the relationships than on the power.I found the art of this anime to be especially good. That\'s all.All the characters are lovable. As for the role-model in this anime, she awfully resembles Katsuragi Keima (Kaminomi, TWGOK) when he cross-dresses. And all the more because Keima is a Kami and she also has that Godly aura. All the characters(girls) in this series are very kawii. Damn, I just want to take all of them home (""Omochikaerii~~~!"" from Higurashi no Naku koro ni).For those who watch OP/ED of every episode, you won\'t get bored of the Ending of this series no matter how many times you watch it(even more if you understand it).The overall satisfaction for me was great. Anime of this caliber is usually hard to find, and so I recommend this series to anyone who want to watch something other than the norm.Personally I give 10 to any anime if I get sentimental after watching it(like you know, just wanting to lie down and just think about that anime and when it feels like I just lost a part of my life) so I gave this series a 9 as I think I won\'t be able to remember it for a very long time. on the relationships than on the power.I found the art of this anime to be especially good.

Anime of this caliber is usually hard to find, and so I recommend this series to anyone who want to watch something other than the norm.Personally I give 10 to any anime if I get sentimental after watching it(like you know, just wanting to lie down and just think about that anime and when it feels like I just lost a part of my life) so I gave this series a 9 as I think I won\'t be able to remember it for a very long time.', 'I am not one to write reviews, Honestly this is my firstI do not know if it has something to do with this particular time in my life or what not but this anime spoke to me in great ways.It starts off as a great comedy with lots of small things happening all the time but it then starts getting more serious and ""Lovey-Dovey"" as they say.It is honestly a beauty, from the opening to the super funny ending, Mashiro is so cute and funny and Kobeni is such a true embodiment of a wonderful loving person.Be careful with this anime though haha, just when...you think its all fun ad games there were certainly parts that caught my heart stringsLots of fun, Great art style, Great story and great character developement :)""I made it this time"" - Hakuya you think its all fun ad games there were certainly parts that caught my heart stringsLots of fun, Great art style, Great story and great character developement :)""I made it this time"" - Hakuya', 'LA first noticed and was interested in Mikakunin de Shinkoukei because of that .gif of Mashiro dancing, you know the one. Curiosity wasn\'t in vain.Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is something of a typical slice of life, cute girls doing cute things comedy anime, involving Hakuya Mitsumine voiced by Wataru Hatano being engaged to Kobeni Yonomori voiced by Haruka Terui that brings these two families together and at first LA thought nothing of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei as an anime besides ""cute girls doing cute things"" but with one very small plot twist, didn\'t exactly change the entire anime but made the anime at least ""interesting"". But Mikakunin...de Shinkoukei at it\'s core is a verbal slapstick comedy romp with some romance and mystery along the side.Mikakunin de Shinkoukei\'s characters are at their base, somewhat typical. Kobeni one of the main characters being the most responsible character in the series and thus the minder for Mashiro, Benio and Hakuya. Hakuya being the deadpan stoic, nontalkative character akin to Suguru Koshigaya from Non Non Biyori, Benio voiced by Eriko Matsui, Kobeni\'s older sister who\'s an absolute siscon pervert and probably your and LA\'s breaking stick of the series due to this and finally from the core cast, Mashiro voiced by Yuuri Yoshida, Hakuya\'s little sister, LA\'s favorite character, mainly due to her naivete and her having the majority and gravitates the comedy of the anime.There are other minor characters, such as Nadeshiko Kashima voiced by Ayane Sakura, Benio\'s friend and Vice President and is another minder to Benio in the field of controlling Benio\'s siscon urges with her deadpan deliveries and because of that LA will easily give Nadeshiko LA\'s seocnd favorite character fo the series, Konoha Suetsugi voiced by Saki Fujita, the student council secretary and has a massive crush on Benio, Niko Oono voiced by Asuka Kakumoto a newspaper reporter and finally Mayura Momouchi voiced by Aimi Terakawa, a friend of Kobeni who\'s alot sharper than she looks.So to say that Mikakunin de Shinkoukei\'s comedy is centred around the verbal slapstick is saying the obvious and with the moderate amount of plot focusing on it\'s characters. The character chemistry oddly works VERY well in this anime as well, LA doesn\'t know WHY but it does, maybe due to all the quirky characters, typical but quirky nonetheless.As for LA\'s stance on Benio as a character, she had her comedic moments and for LA, Benio was NOTHING but comedic relief but let\'s just say her dedication to her siscon fetish feels almost overbearingly surpassing Kuroko Shirai from To aru Kagaku no Railgun. In short, Kuroko is more resilient than Benio is and THAT is saying something. Benio has her moments but with her constant badgering of Mashiro, gets annoying and one note VERY quickly.Mikakunin de Shinkoukei has SOME level of plot though it has typical cliches shown especially with a slice of life comedy anime such as this, mostly misunderstandings piled on top of misunderstandings to some slow romance moments with our main engaged couple Kobeni and Hakuya, the only other notable plot related thing about Mikakunin de Shinkoukei involves Suetsugi, Hakuya, Kobeni, Benio and Mashiro in again the aforementioned misunderstandings that just snowballs and snowballs.In terms of animation by Doga Kobo, well the animation has Doga Kobo\'s animation trademarks all over the place, with the vibrantly color coded characters, moe character designs with the colorful but not overly detailed backgrounds. LA will give huge props to Doga Kobo if anything for the vibrant and distinct character designs which is expected from Doga Kobo. All in all, decent to great animation from Doga Kobo.As for voice work, LA actually liked the ENTIRE cast of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei no joke. Everyone from Haruka Terui as Kobeni to Yuuri Yoshida as Mashiro and Ayane Sakura as Nadeshiko and heck LA will even give Benio\'s voice actor Eriko Matsui as major pass as it seemed Eriko Matsui was having HEAPS of fun voicing Benio with all her hammy and erratic cadence in the comedic sense of course. Best voice actor?, as much as LA wanted to give to Yuuri Yoshida for voicing Mashiro, LA can\'t ignore Eriko Matsui as Benio...yeah LA said it.As comedic and slice of life Mikakunin de Shinkoukei actually is, Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is subtle in it\'s facading mystery elements, something LA didn\'t even realizes were clues until the ""big"" plot twist was given, this especially concerned Hakuya and Kobeni as they were the LEAST interesting characters of the series but with that plot twist, they had SOME bearing to the plot and THAT was the biggest push for LA to see that Mikakunin de Shinkoukei wasn\'t all the moe, slice of life comedy it was and not only that but made the anime make a whole lot more sense afterwards to which LA will give props to Mikakunin de Shinkoukei as LA didn\'t even see it coming as just saw it as an anime where two people were engaged ""just because"". Now LA is saying this VERY loosely as the anime itself is still very laid back even after all the revelations given and goes back to it\'s roots of being a verbal slapstick comedy with Mashiro at the helm of it all.LA was expecting typical slice of life moe with cute girls doing cute things, what LA got was slice of life, moe cute girls doing cute things BUT with a tinge of mystery and *ahem* puppy love romance and it worked!. Yeah to say LA\'s experience with Mikakunin de Shinkoukei at first was at first typical fair with nothing that hooked LA but after the big reveal, LA became much more interested in it afterwards while still keeping it\'s comedic core intact and it really only got pretty serious at the last episode.Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is all in all a fairly decent slice of life comedy anime centreing on an engaged couple and the comedic hijinks they along with their family members and friends create while they get to know each other and grow their romance. de Shinkoukei at it\'s core is a verbal slapstick comedy romp with some romance and mystery along the side.Mikakunin de Shinkoukei\'s characters are at their base, somewhat typical.

It\'s a genre that often consists of nothing but charming visuals and comedy that does very little for me. So, to counteract this, the slice of life anime that end up in my cue usually have at least one extra theme or genre added, the most common being a romantic plot line. So, was my latest bundle of romantic cuteness enough to stave off the nothingness of a typical slice of life series?...I will say that as someone who is generally very uninterested in slice of life, this series had my attention for most of its run time, and there were certainly less moments than usual where I felt like the series was dragging or the pacing was too slow. As is the case with many other slice of life series, the humor is crazy and wild, but is still grounded in stereotypical anime style that never really reached a gut-busting level of hilarity. This is definitely a series that you can just sort of throw on if you\'ve got nothing else to do.That being said, a lot of the humor still relies on the characters who execute it, and that ended up fluctuating quite a bit throughout the series. Kobeni herself is very plain in personality and often serves as the straight man to the comedic bits of the other characters, but she\'s also still very endearing in how much she thinks of the others and how to keep them happy. Conversely, we have Benio and Mashiro, who were meant to serve as the comedic core of this series, putting me in the awkward position of not really getting too engaged in them, thus causing a lot of the jokes to illicit no more than a slight chuckle from me. Benio is the ""perfect schoolgirl"" who ends up having a much more spastic personality at home, while Mashiro is the token loli with a childlike personality that one would use to market this series, and I felt myself constantly shifting back-and-forth between finding her enjoyable and absolutely annoying. Much like with Kawai Complex, there were a lot of moments where these two were actually ruining some of the romantic tension between our two leads.As for the romance, it\'s probably the most solid point for this anime. Throughout the entire series, you really do get the sense that Kobeni is struggling with how she feels about being engaged to someone she has no memory of, and the progression from not feeling anything towards him to possibly liking him is gradual and very smooth. It\'s just unfortunate that Hakuya is basically a pseudo-kuudere and rarely ever displays his emotions overtly. While it is often very obvious what he is feeling, we never really get a sense of his personality, his likes and dislikes, or anything else really other than his engagement to Kobeni.As one last note on the story, there is a slight supernatural element, and while I wouldn\'t say that it was poorly executed, the story definitely didn\'t need it to work.The animation was produced by Dogakobo (Monthly Girls\' Nozaki-kun, YuruYuri), and this is a studio that I consider second only to KyoAni when it comes to cute girls doing cute things. The character designs are incredibly adorable, and the movement animation is either very smooth and fluid for attractiveness or spastic and frantic for comedic effect, though there are also point where slower movements take larger than necessary arcs that almost make me feel like they really wanted to draw attention to how the movements are done.There is currently no dub for this series, and as a slice of life anime, I think it would be perfectly fine without one.The music was composed by Jun Ichikawa and remained relatively unremarkable for most of the series. Some moments highlighted emotional climaxes rather nicely, but never really drove them home completely. Both the opening theme ""Tomadoi→Recipe"" and ending theme ""Masshiro World"" were performed by Mikakuning!, the three main voice actresses for the series, and both tracks provided an upbeat and catchy J-pop track that fit incredibly well with the tone of the series.Overall, Engaged to the Unidentified is watchable, but not very remarkable, though it should definitely go high up on your list if you\'re a more enthusiastic slice of life fan.

It\'s marketed as a romance and yet the opening credits give you a good picture of where the series\' real focus is: on the relationship between the two sisters, their future ""sister-in-law,"" who is all of nine years old, and their various friends.Given the ratio of females (lots) to male (one), it almost looks like a harem show, but that could not be further from the spirit of the show.  Hakuya is about as far as possible from other shoujo leads: basically he\'s not a dick or a flirt or...a genius or sexually aggressive in any way.  Frankly, he may well be the most stand-up romantic lead in the history of anime.  And Kobeni is just plain lovable.  She\'s a great example of how shoujo can really explore what it means to be ""ordinary"" while keeping clear of cliches.  I have no idea what to make of Benio--there do seem to be some cultural barriers at play in her depiction--but I loved the interaction with the student council vice president, and I do enjoy shoujo\'s willingness to portray girls as the objects of hero worship from other girls, something I\'ve never seen in American media.I really thought Mashiro would be irritating, but I ended up loving her, and arguably, Hakuya did need her along to help with that pesky speaking thing.  Mashiro dancing to the TV,  freaking out about aliens, and her anguish at getting yet another Nessie figurine in her chocolate egg was a more authentic picture of childhood than you usually see on TV--even if she is a nine-year-old attending high school.Not sure where to put this in but I loved both the opening and closing songs and adored the animation for the opening credits.Definitely recommend for shoujo fans for its charming heroine, complete absence of annoying male behavior, and genuinely off-beat sensibility. a genius or sexually aggressive in any way.

It was a show based on a series I\'d never heard of before, and somewhat of an iffy premise. Regardless, I gave it a shot, prodded further by the suggestion of a friend, and found an incredible show out of absolutely nowhere.STORY: 8/10Mikakunin de Shinkoukei is the story of a rather plain young girl, Yonomori Kobeni, who, upon turning 16, is shocked to learn that she is to be married to a young man she has no recollection of. We are immediately introduced to her sister, Yonomori Benio, a refined schoolgirl between school walls but...an eccentric siscon/lolicon at home, and eventually meet the young man in question, Mitsumine Hakuya, quiet, mysterious boy from the mountains. He and his younger sister, Mitsumine Mashiro, a dignified, yet childish girl, quickly move into the Yonomori household. This is where Mikakunin really starts to shine,as the interactions between the other characters are really fun to experience. From Kobeni\'s conflicting feelings about Hakuya to Benio\'s crazed obsession with Mashiro, the show is tons of fun to experience in this respect, as is the case with many slice of life shows. It follows along a pretty safe romance slice of life path, at least, until a certain fact is revealed. I know a lot of people who feared where the series would go after this somewhat infamous reveal, myself included, but thankfully it\'s impact on the show is relatively minimal. The twist doesn\'t try to command Mikakunin in its own direction, instead taking the back seat to what the show did so well with from the beginning, and I think that was the best thing that could have been done with it.ART: 8/10Mikakunin had very solid art and animation quality, especially when compared to other shows of its season, quite frankly. Characters were highly emotive an expressive through their animation, and there weren\'t really any noticeable drops in quality.SOUND: 8/10I never really know how to rate sound in an anime. Certainly all the characters had nice voices that suit them, and I really loved both the OP and ED themes, so I\'ll just go with that.CHARACTER: 10/10As mentioned before, characters are Mikakunin\'s strong point. Benio\'s obsessive admiration over Mashiro, and Mashiro\'s fear of her, makes for a fun dynamic, while Kobeni\'s growing relationship with Hakuya is interesting in and of itself. I\'d say that all the main characters are developed well enough for what they\'ve set out to be. At first I had criticism of Kobeni\'s ""main character"" syndrome, as I call it, but the show doesn\'t abandon her plain personality, but rather uses it to further her character later on. The rest of the characters, though, you get a feel for pretty immediately, so the entertainment value can spark quickly.ENJOYMENT: 10/10I really loved this show; it was certainly my favorite of the winter season. The only thing that really upsets me about it is that it wraps things up rather well, and I can\'t see a season two  happening as a result. Maybe it\'s for the best, but I\'m a simple creature, so boo. At any rate, I\'d highly recommend Mikakunin de Shinkoukei to any slice of life fan, or just someone who wants a cute, fun show to watch.FINAL SCORE: 9/10 an eccentric siscon/lolicon at home, and eventually meet the young man in question, Mitsumine Hakuya, quiet, mysterious boy from the mountains.

Secondly, I rated this a 7, so it wasn't bad, but it is very annoying and frustrating how it has the potential to be a 10/10 show, but doesn't make use of nearly any of it's potential.All of...the show's problems leads down to 5 major points.1. The romance between Kobeni and Hakuya progresses extremely slowly, which it feels like it doesn't progress enough to lead to the conclusion of this series. This is by far the most frustrating part of the show because when progress is made, it is undoubtedly very well done, but it happens at such an undeniably slow pace that it gets really frustrating to watch, since it feels like the romance actually progresses once every 4 episodes.2. Lots of filler content gets to be hard to bare. This kinda coincides with #1, since the filler content feels like 60% of the series, where no progress is made, partially leading to the slow progress for the romance between the two MCs.3. Dumb & annoying characters that are there just to disrupt scenes. I am directly stating Benio, Mashiro and Konoha for this, they all take the stage for 70% of every episode, with very little focus actually being on the main point that Kobeni and Hakuya are engaged. Now they are meant to be this way, to be comic relief, but they take up far too much time in each episode that it doesn't allow the engaged couple to get closer to each other emotionally.4. The engaged couple maybe gets ~15 minutes of alone time in the whole 12 episode run. This ties into all other complaints here, in the fact that it's so unrealistic for their love to be deepened when they get almost no alone time to actually chat and learn each other in all of these episodes.5. The ending is so stale with tension that shouldn't exist, thus it makes much of the show feel mute, like nothing was gained and ruined some of the development that happened previously.All together though it really is a good/decent anime, one that I can overall recommend, but cannot say that it is altogether something that I can recommend to everyone.If any two of the points I pointed out makes you not want to watch then I wouldn't, this anime takes a lot of patience to push through for something that is overall good, and if you do not have the patience then you will be upset and it will likely make you frustrated.🗿 7/10 🗿 the show's problems leads down to 5 major points.1.

It\'s a good anime that is funny and has good production value. It\'s not great, It\'s not bad, it\'s just good. It\'s the poster child of a 7/10 comedy. I have no real complaints. some of the jokes land, others don\'t. It\'s still funny enough. The cliches are pretty tired, but the characters are interesting enough versions of those cliches that they manage to be very watchable despite the predictable plot beats. This is a colour-by-numbers comedy with a bit of ""romance"", and if you like that sort of thing,...you\'ll like this; if you don\'t, then this isn\'t going to do anything to change your mind. you\'ll like this; if you don\'t, then this isn\'t going to do anything to change your mind.', ""This is a lot like a pretty standard romcom, however it flips the script a bit with the heroine being the main perspective and hero become the sudden fiance, though it should be emphasized that despite that it isn't shoujo but rather still kind of shounen. This results in it being different enough that it makes it quite a bit more interesting even if it has a lot of common tropes. In terms of implementation, I had mixed feelings. It felt quite a bit slow towards the beginning, and it took far too long for what seems like the core twist to appear. But at...the same time, the twist itself doesn't seem to matter all that much to the plot once its actually revealed. Hence, all in all, it felt overall like there just wasn't enough substance to the plot. The comedy is solid so it's still pretty amusing and the cast is is pretty interesting as well, with some great development, especially towards the end. However, this didn't feel like the sort of anime where that's enough, but rather it felt like it needed some sort of plot line, and in this case what it had I felt like wasn't enough, that there was something missing, that not enough actually happened over the course of the anime.

She's a pretty normal and average girl who takes care of the cooking and housework. We are introduced to her on her 16th birthday when she receives surprising news; her late grandfather had arranged a marriage partner for her and he's coming to stay with them. In comes the fiancé, Hakuya, who is quiet, polite, very straightforward and clearly already in love with Kobeni. We are then introduced to Hakuya's little sister Mashiro, who will also will be staying there...to watch over her older brother. Apparently Kobeni as met Hakuya before as a child but now must redevelop the relationship she forgot she had.This slice of life anime tells the story of Kobeni, Hakuya, Mashiro and Benio as they adjust to this new living arrangement and each other.Story: 7/10It is definitely funny, cute and overdramatic. They make little problems into bigger problems than they ever should be, but it can be entertaining nonetheless. I will warn that because it is a slice of life anime there is not much progression in the story in terms of character relationships, background stories, etc. The anime is only 12 episodes which in this case seemed way too short. I think the show would definitely benefit from a second season to further develop the story and the characters.Also there were times where they were emphasizing a specific joke or interactions between characters that just seemed to miss the mark or last way too long.And lastly, the ending. It was what I expected from a slice of life but not what I wanted exactly. I was hoping for more resolution than I got because there is so much possibility for the story from where it ended. If the anime gets a second season, more than likely this specific score will increase.Character: 7/10The characters are very average in terms of anime. If you have seen other slice of life or shoujo, you will know characters exactly like the ones here. However that does not make them any less likable for me. Benio may be too over the top for some people's taste as she is relentless in her sister complex and loli-loving attitude. The supporting cast is quite funny and stood out to me as the backbone of the anime.My major criticism is the lack of development with Hakuya, Mashiro and their family.... there is something special about them but to be honest, at the end you're still not clear as to what specifically that is.Art/Animation: 10/10Such beautiful and stunning animation. The character designs remind me a little of the anime One Week Friends, with the rosy cheeks and pastel pallets but this anime does use different colors and backgrounds to express the character feelings very well.Sound: 8/10I LOVE the opening and ending themes to this anime. Very catchy and fun, suiting the anime very well. Besides that there were no stand-out pieces during the anime but the music they did have, did set the tone pretty well.Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 7/10Anyone who enjoys slice of life comedies will probably really like this anime. Other similar recommendations include if you like One Week Friends and Nisekoi. They both use similar plot devices to this anime, although in general they are quite different. Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun (My Little Monster) also popped into my head as something similar because of their sense of humor and their lead male, Haru, is similar to Hakuya in a lot of ways. There is a tiny bit of fan service for male audiences but generally I think this is more of a female-oriented anime.I did enjoy it but found they did over exaggerate things a bit much. I would recommend it if you are just looking for something to watch and not take too seriously, as it was quick to get through and pretty easy to follow. to watch over her older brother.

There was barely any build up to any of the major reveals except one that I can certainly tell that it did have some build up and the romance was not really strong at all as the main plot of the show is barely given any development and the climax of this love story is... how should I put this... all too sudden, why? Because there was not enough build up in the romance.so there is my rant, had to get that out of my chest. I still enjoyed it nonetheless but the story disappointed me for not being what it could have been.Should you watch this show?- honestly you probably have better ones to watch other than this but its worth a try if you like cute girls but can handle the story being.... okay.... this could have been one of my favorite romcom.

Wish they'd shown more interest in the relationship between Kobeni and Hakuya, their bonding into a relationship, etc.Never read the anime so no idea where that storyline went.. kind of wanted to learn more about their secret and origins, what made them meet etc. One big factor which was sadly under used was that Hakuya just seemed under developed. His silent but strong ways were just.. mild instead. His character needed more meat in the story, it was almost as...if it wasn't even about them. if it wasn't even about them."", 'Longing for a pure yet simple anime was an idea with which i came to watch Engaged to the Unidentified.Visual - Great looking,Music - two bangers - opening and ending + additional music used in show,Deatils - great to the level of creepy sometimes,Comedy - gag situations amazing most of the times.However hold your horses with giving it a straigt 8. Problem with this show for me comes in a way of story and two main characters.Story is candy-like, everything good kinda happens but at the end of the day everyone either forgets about the problems or not talk about them at...all.

She thinks before she...acts, but she assumes every single little detail of what is happening to her currently and makes a choice based on the assumptions then doesnt listen to the other people and continues to make completely dumbfounded choices based on what is going on in her half brain instead of the clear input that others are giving her (they also have no reason to lie to be a cunt to her). what a piece of shit character, worst character in an anime i've ever seen 0/10. that little girl dog (cant even remember her name) is also not a great character but not on the 0/10 level that konoha is. the majority of her interactions with others is just complaining and blurting out the first fucking thing that comes to her mind, she's more on the opposite side of konoha where she doesnt think and just speaks. she can't take a second to figure out the current problem happening to her and ways to fix it, she just yaps at the person causing the problem then cries about it and eats some shit then goes all happy again to seem like a good character, but shes fucking not. i get that shes like 9 or 10, but thats no excuse for not having a single complex thought ever 3/10 character design. acts, but she assumes every single little detail of what is happening to her currently and makes a choice based on the assumptions then doesnt listen to the other people and continues to make completely dumbfounded choices based on what is going on in her half brain instead of the clear input that others are giving her (they also have no reason to lie to be a cunt to her). what a piece of shit character, worst character in an anime i've ever seen 0/10. that little girl dog (cant even remember her name) is also not a great character but not on the 0/10 level that konoha is. the majority of her interactions with others is just complaining and blurting out the first fucking thing that comes to her mind, she's more on the opposite side of konoha where she doesnt think and just speaks. she can't take a second to figure out the current problem happening to her and ways to fix it, she just yaps at the person causing the problem then cries about it and eats some shit then goes all happy again to seem like a good character, but shes fucking not. i get that shes like 9 or 10, but thats no excuse for not having a single complex thought ever 3/10 character design."", ""I never really had any reason to watch this, I just random started watching the first episode and rather enjoyed it.Story - The story isn't hard to understand, you get given the point of it in the 1st episode. Kobeni, who has just turned 16 finds out that a boy Hakuya will being living with her and her family and that she and Hakuya are engaged.---Art and Sound - Decent but average, nothing really worth mentioning, although the find the ED song a bit catchy.---Character - The main characters are Kobeni, Hakuya, Benio and Mashiro.Kobeni has been told that she,...due to an arrangement by her grandfather, is engaged to Hakuya, who will be living with them. She is originally against this but as the series goes she comes to understand Hakuya more and begins to recover memories of an incident involving her and Hakuya, as well a secret about him and Mashiro.Hakuya, a quiet but kind and tries to help Kobeni when possible including shopping. He has very sharp senses and knows Kobeni despite the latter not being able to remember him. He feels he is responsible for the incident involving him and kobeni. He and Mashiro are apart of a mysterious family with a big secret, although the secret is eventually revealed to Kobeni and Benio.Benio is Kobeni's sister and is the main source of comedy, she has an extreme sister complex and as a result of this, there is almost no major progression of the relationship between Hakuya and Kobeni. Benio completely opposes thier proposed marriage and is extremely jealous of Hakuya, the two almost never speak to each other.Now we have Mashiro, Hakuya's little sister and unlike Hakuya, Benio thinks of her as her own little sister and teases her a lot, to Mashiro's annoyance. Mashiro has a fear of aliens and UMAs and has a liking for sweet foods.---Enjoyment - Overall it is good and very funny. I found that Benio's sister complex can be funny at times especially towards Mashiro, but it can also be very annoying at some points because it just ruins any progression that Hakuya and Kobeni can make and as a result this anime barely has any romance in it at all. due to an arrangement by her grandfather, is engaged to Hakuya, who will be living with them.

However you will be surprised (as I was) that the sequels are all filler episodes. In Saiyuki, they showed some parts in the character's past lives so one would think it would have some relation to the overall plot of the sequels, which shockingly it did not. The characters look better in the sequels than in saiyuki (especially gojo, his hair actually becomes red and not purple this time) so that was a plus, if not the only one.And the whole one-pattern personalities and lines get old after...a couple hundred episodes, and I was just left wondering why oh why did I waste my time watching 60something episodes of plotless intermission to which there is no sequel. So, if you want to just watch some more of the characters of saiyuki getting together then this is the series to watch, because there is no story really, its just a veeery long series of filler episodes. a couple hundred episodes, and I was just left wondering why oh why did I waste my time watching 60something episodes of plotless intermission to which there is no sequel.

They done did a few changes to an already bad project....and made shit hella worse! Saiyuki Reload at first seems like an improvement with glossier art, less animation shortcuts and different voice actors from the first installment of [Gensomaden] Saiyuki. But if you're anything like me and you've watched more than your fair share of anime shows, then you should come to the same realization that I have....Reload is prettier but it's not better.~ArtRight off the bat you will notice that the art and the character designs are a little bit different. The correct term I would use would be “off” I feel...the art is off. Meaning, it definitely doesn't look like “Saiyuki”it doesn't have that trademark “Kazuya Minekura” style. This just looks like a regular anime or someone else's rendition of Minekura's work.....I guess the word I'm looking for is “FANART”  tho to it's credit, really really good fanart [but never as good as the original]. You can obviously see the difference on how the characters look from the closing credits and the anime...very drastic. But even with all the upgrading, there still a lot of shortcuts with the animation: a whole bunch of still-frames & sliding cells being used in the fight scenes. The only good thing now I guess is that, when Sanzo shoot's demons or whatever they actually bleed and die, instead of the image turing to black and white and them using some cheap dissolving F/X.~SoundAnother notable difference is the change in voice cast. The obvious downshift with the swearing....personally, it was too over the top and so unnecessary [I can appreciate swearing if it made sense....like in Black Lagoon, it made sense for the characters to talk like that], about the casting, I really liked the original Sanzo's voice David Matranga [who also did Orphen], he really had a better voice and could really convey Sanzo's cynicism, Gojyo's voice is definitely better, Goku's voice is also a little better [but still a bit too whiny for my tastes, tho], Yaone's voice is OK but I have a preference for the original voice by Shelley Calene-Black. However OMG! but what is with the Merciful Goddess' voice, she sounds like a complete and total tranny! And of course they totally turned Hakkai into a complete pansy....with some kind of English accent, WTF?~StoryOK so the the original story got COMPLETELY derailed. Some of the stories seem pretty good, regardless of the obvious deviation from the original work, Like, for example, I loved episode 4 [The Final Promise] which again showed that not all things will come to a happy ending. But of course there were definitely more than a few stories that were complete and  utter rubbish: Foolish,waste of time stories like the little dragon-jeep pet going off and defending orphans or the other one about stray kittens These stories were a waste of time, even as far as filler content is concerned. If watched better fillers in Naruto.~CharacterLike I already said, the character design is a complete deviation from Minekura's style. It's not ugly or anything but more like really good fanart. I also hate the new Kougaji face also with the markings.~VerdictI think it's worse than the first installment, this show brought zero WOW-factor. the art is off.

There is much more to say, and Reload is superb for many reasons. Yes, Geneon licensed Saiyuki Reload and they also licensed the next part, Saiyuki Gunlock -- for those of you who didn\'t know there was a next part, there is, and the start of it is available, although not in English dub, just with subtitles. And I agree, Illich Guardiola and the rest of the crew did a good job with the original series, Gensou Maden Saiyuki and the movie Saiyuki Requiem. Make sure you catch...the extended interviews with the voice actors on the Saiyuki Requiem DVD. Illich Guardiola is particularly interesting and funny, as are the rest. Which leads us to Saiyuki Reload and the third series, Saiyuki Gunlock. If you haven\'t seen any of Gunlock yet, you are in for a TREAT. The art and the animation are awesome, and the story grabs you from the first episode. Saiyuki Reload is also superb, and the *furthest* thing from a ""retread"" of the original as you can get. There is a HUGE piece of plot information that falls into place in Reload. It is NOT to be missed. You won\'t see it coming and it will stun you. If only for this plot twist, Reload would be excellent, but there is so much more.. And it prepares you for Saiyuki Gunlock. Seemingly impossible situations, things which have never happened before; it\'s breathtaking. Don\'t worry about the dub, don\'t worry about Geneon -- those things will fade VERY fast once you get into the series, and the end (prior to the beginning of Gunlock) will leave you breathless with shock and anticipation, and amazed at the many plot twists (and breakthroughs) that you will not see coming, but which will make tremendous sense once you\'ve seen it.

The story in itself is amazing and I recommend reading he manga, but in my opinion of you love the first series like me I wouldn\'t bother watching the anime unless subbed avoid dubbed. ', ""This is a review of the anime only. I have not read the manga.This felt more like a long OVA than a true sequel but it was still worth the watch. If you like the characters already and want to spend more time with them, this is a great way to do it.What i loved about it:1. The characters. These four are just so awesome. I can't get enough of them.2. The art was far improved to the original. That was a plus for me.3. It was super funny. Funnier than the original.4. I liked the hand-drawn cards during the ending song....5. I liked the ending song (but not the opening).What I didn't like about it:1. There was no solid throughline like in the first series. There was no clear adversary nor goal. It was mostly episodic.If you're a fan of Gintama and how it can go from ultra funny to ultra serious and tragic ... that's sort of what this series does over the course of all these series put together. The first series was mostly serious and dark. This one is much more lighthearted. We get to see the characters interacting in situations that are more humorous and I enjoyed that. So if you'd enjoy that too, then you'll like Reload. 5. I liked the ending song (but not the opening).What I didn't like about it:1. There was no solid throughline like in the first series.

Saiyuuki Reload Gunlock,https://myanimelist.net/anime/131/Saiyuuki_Reload_Gunlock,"[""Bad – worser -WORST! Yes, I know it's not grammatically correct, but it is by far the most appropriate way to describe this trilogy. By the time got to the 3rd installment, I was pretty much fed up and over this series. I don't see the point of watching a series that has no REAL point or purpose...I never read the manga, but it's pretty obvious this anime went completely off the track and ran amuck! I dropped the series! I refuse to listen to Goku say he's hungry and argue with Gojyo over meatbuns for another episode.~ArtThe art is the same as part two...[Reload], which as I've stated before is pretty OK. Nothing jaw-droppingly amazing or anything. If I wasn't so fed up with the series and the way they adapted the artwork from the original designs...I might have been OK with it. But watching something that had sooooooo much potential to be way better than it currently is just brings up strong feelings of revulsion. The art is nice, maybe if they have another project to draw I can truly to appreciate it. The animation still sucks though. Same cheap f/x and animation shortcuts....especially for an “action anime” that's very disappointing.~SoundGoku's voice is like nails on a chalkboard by this point. Does he have balls? Why does he whine so much? Hakkai is as gay as ever [not that I have issues with gayness...obviously!] Like I said in my Reload review, Sanzo and Gojyo have decent voices. The cast is a mixed bag of good and bad....the music for this series is pretty decent.~Story???.....................WHAT STORY???Scooby-Doo! That's what I felt like I was watching. There is ZERO progression with the story, ZERO plot or character development, ZERO entertainment! The show became completely stagnant [YES, I said STAGNANT] and straight-up ridiculous! I mean when I got to the board-game episode, that which was an obvious rip of the movie “Jumanji” I kinda barfed in my mouth a little bit and called it quits for this series. And I dare anyone to tell me that episode wasn't bullshit. This whole installment was a waste, what happened to the Merciful Goddess, Nataku and all that drama that was going on in Heaven? What happened to all the angst and darkness that was so pronounced and almost so very palpable in the first installment? That's what made this show worthwhile in the first place....it's SUPPOSED to be IRONIC or didn't anyone get that? Saiyuki is supposed to be about beautiful guys with very ugly and twisted pasts, and yet, somehow it became this watered-down shonen crappola! Also I don't know if anyone else noticed but in part one the [lesser] demons were kinda more like raving mad monsters foaming at the mouth affected by the evil miasma spreading across the land or whatever it was that's supposed to be driving them crazy but eventually they just became these generic, foul-mouthed henchmen who attack people just for the sake for attacking people.~CharacterAt this stage, I wanna kill Goku! I wanna shove my hands down his throat and rip out his vocal chords. The chronic “I'm hungry, I'm hungry” whining of his ISN'T funny anymore! Actually it never was.....and why do anime creators think gluttony [over-eating] is soooo fucking hilarious? It's not, it's cliché not to mention gross. I love Goku's look, physically he's very cute [not sexually – I'm not a hentai freak or anything, I'm just saying as far as anime bishounen designs go, he's nice looking]. Actually all four main characters are nice looking....but something about Goku's and Hakkai's personalities really grate on my nerves by this 3rd installment of the series. I admit that Hakkai was a little on the meek and soft-spoken side from part one of the trilogy but secretly he was a beast, he had a very dark side and is probably second strongest to Goku.....but you'll never guess it from watching Reload or Gunlock, because by then he's like the group's bitch he does the cooking and the cleaning and his voice is equally irritating. I'm also fed up with all the same slapstick, 3-Stooges routines going on between all the characters: Goku and Gojyo fighting over food and whatnot and then Sanzo saying he's gonna shoot them, it gets very tiring.....I hope by the end of the series, he actually shoots them! [not that I intend to stick around for the end of this farce of an anime!]~Verdict*le Sigh!*Look, I will always love my Saiyuki wall posters and calendars....and I'll more than likely buy and read the manga, provided it's a completed work of course. However this anime is simply WRETCHED! This gets a [4] simply because of the art and the bishounen factor and because I do think the Saiyuki franchise may hold a lot more potential than this current rubbish.Hopefully they redo the whole thing like they redid FullMetal Alchemist!

Scrapped Princess,https://myanimelist.net/anime/167/Scrapped_Princess,"[""Scrapped Princess has been a show sitting on my shelf for quite a while and for some reason I had never gotten around to viewing it.  For that I am rather disappointed in myself as it turned out to be a wonderfully entertaining and charming series.When starting the show you will be treated to what is seemingly your normal medieval era sword and sorcery fantasy adventure.  And for the first half of the series that is exactly what you get.  The second half in some ways almost feels like a completely separate show as mecha like combat starts to replace your standard...swords and magic fighting.  I imagine some people who are expecting a more traditional kind of adventure might feel a bit disappointed but I thought the transition was logical and seamless.  Pacifica, known as the Scrapped Princess is on the run with her two older siblings because everyone wants her dead as she is prophesied to destroy the world on her 16th birthday.  Of course it will become obvious to the assassins sent after her and the viewers that she is nothing but a sweet girl who poses no threat to anyone.  The plot moves along fairly slowly but the pace was quick enough that I never got bored with it.  A number of interesting twists emerge, some predictable others not so much but all and all I found the mix of the old and modern technology quite fresh and original.  The action and special effects are quite good but my one complaint with it is that towards the end it does feel like it drags on for a few episodes with little really going on.  The ending was also pretty solid and I felt very satisfied with how many of the storylines wrapped up.Pacifica shines as the main protagonist of Scrapped Princess.  She is a very likable and character and I think most people will find it very easy to relate with her.  Rounding out the rest of the main cast is the siblings and Pacifica's guardians, Shannon and Raquel.  They were very fun characters and I liked them both a lot.  Unfortunately we didn’t ever get that much back story on either of them.  Things were hinted at with them both but I was left feeling a little let down that these were not better developed.  The supporting cast is also very strong as several characters shine, particularly Leo, but others feel a bit flat and stereotypical.The music was very good.  Both the opening and ending songs felt very appropriate and set the tone of the series.  Voice acting is also very strong.  Do to some issues I had with the subtitle timing on my DVDs, I was unfortunately exposed to the English dub of this show for an episode before I couldn’t take it anymore and had to download the corrupted episodes online.  Honestly I don’t know how or why people watch English dubs, particularly from Bang Zoom! who has some of the worst actors in the industry.  Why do I always feel like you’re trying to hard when you speak?  Just talk normally, you don’t have to talk like your trying to be 12 years old.  Just stay away from the dub.  Remember: friends don’t let friends watch dubbed anime.One of my favorite elements of SP, is the artwork and animation.  The backgrounds and spell effects were beautiful.  The character designs were truly exceptional though.  The girls were all adorable and the guys were handsome and manly and bishounen free.  Some of the girls bosoms were a bit out of hand though, particularly Winia's.  Those looked like they might get in the way.Overall I am left with a very favorable view of this anime.  A satisfying ending, great characters, I am sad to see this one end.  The story feels very original and delivers a unique cautionary tale about mankind and his struggles to not destroy himself. swords and magic fighting.

The story feels very original and delivers a unique cautionary tale about mankind and his struggles to not destroy himself."", ""Overall/Enjoyment:As you can see, I really liked Scrapped Princess. It's a familiar song played to a different tune. The way it starts off gives the appearance of being slow and uneventful, but it all depends on your point of view. The action is light, and it builds up gradually to some pretty big battles as the story progresses, but what the show may lack in action it makes up for with some really potent drama. In this way it excels beyond the usual sword and sorcery fare. If you prefer the myth and the magic over character dynamics then this may seem dull and ordinary...to you. I enjoy stories about escalating climactic battles, but life isn't always an epic series of conflicts, so stories like this are nice as well.Story:The story of the Scrapped Princess is one of prophecy and death, and it never lets you forget that. There's always an essence of tragedy and suffering looming in the air. There are moments of endearment and playfulness mixed in with those of doom and gloom. So on the surface it may appear to be just another medieval adventure, but beneath it lies an emotional one as well.Sure there's the occasional sword fight or spell casting or sci-fi tangent (there's even some mech-like things), which are interesting on their own, but what I found myself instantly drawn to were the characters. Even though in the beginning I could tell the action was pretty low key, I was still no less interested in watching more. There was an allure not so much in what they were doing, but how they were going about it.It's a very well written story. The character's are surprised when they are supposed to be, they're not omniscient and are often ignorant of knowledge the viewer already has. Events and precedents are recalled correctly so there's no plot holes. There are no real loose ends to speak of and the ending is solid. There's plenty of good humor, romance, and really touching moments. It's one of those stories where there's a big world of big burdens and a decisive destiny waiting for them at the end, but it's the journey itself and the little things inbetween I enjoyed.The only flaw, if I had to pick any, I could see was that the whole Peacemaker angle was never explained too clearly or thoroughly. This leads to an ending that's wrapped up just a tad too neatly/ideally for my taste. In fact, I'd say the whole sci-fi thing probably hurt the series more than helped. It could've done just fine without it. I would've liked a little more definitive clarification on how things got to the way they were, and some kind of indication of where they were going to go from there (such as what happens with magic?).Characters:Given the kind of story this is, I think you get a pretty good feel for the characters, though none quite as well as Pacifica and Shannon. Everyone else are just supporting characters by comparison. Still, characters are fleshed out fairly well. Even if you don't particularly like a character, you get some kind of sense of who they are. Not just in actions, but how they feel and think.People are not one-dimensional automatons programmed with a set of unshakable and predictable reactions. They have moments of fear, doubt, impulsiveness, and weakness. It's essential to establish these things as well for any story to have any semblance of authenticity. Some of the extra characters may not have been necessary but I think Scra-Prin did a good job anyway. No one was particularly overpowered or unbelievable, and the main character's &quot;spoiled innocence&quot; lent itself well to this story.The one oddity I would say is that the Winia character looked bizarrely identical to the Senes one. Were they related or did the character designer reach his creative limit?Art:Maybe it's just me, but I really like BONES art. Their shows are always vibrant and colorful, their lines are sharp and clean, the character/outfit designs are beautiful, the backgrounds are lush and the animation is always fluid. I guess it may seem pretty &quot;average&quot; by modern standards, but I'd still say they're my favorite to date.Sound:Well, although no particular tune comes to mind, I'd say as far as setting the mood and tone are concerned, the music was always right. There were never any odd moments of silence and when a scene called for action or suspense there was always the appropriate music to accompany it. I thought the dubbing was pretty good, which is not a compliment to take lightly as I'm pretty critical about, well, everything, but especially dubbing. The subtitles on the other hand were littered with spelling/grammar errors.Other:Scrapped Princess is a rather misleading title. As a show it doesn't sound quite right, and it's certainly an awkward way to keep addressing someone. That is, it makes about as much sense as calling her the &quot;Killed Princess&quot; or the &quot;Trapped Princess&quot;. Perhaps Cursed or Forsaken would've been more appropriate, though certainly less original.This show was kind of strange for me because it had the flair of Fullmetal Alchemist and the heart of Eureka 7, but wasn't as good as either of them in those regards. However, I would say it had the more complete ending of the three.I'm not sure why, but in the world of Scra-Prin the average woman is very.... voluptuous, that or they are wearing some of the most form fitting clothing ever made. This is either a statement about the lack of bras in medieval times, or that women in our future will be very well endowed.O_o to you.

This adds a nice touch to a story which is quite logical (if somewhat predictable) and has a satisfying ending.The animation is quite average – nothing to complain about…a bit boring at times. Nice character designs even for some of the supporting roles.Sound – the ending theme caught my interest, nice arrangement, a bit different. The beginning suited the series and the score was fitting too, although nothing that stuck longer.Now, the characters are one of the strong points of this anime…I somewhat...came to like them…even Parcifia who can be a bit annoying sometimes with her: “Perhaps it’s better when I die” attitude. This aspect is just a bit to heavy. The development of some of the protagonists (especially Shannon, my personal favourite^^) is consistant; their dilemma and how they cope with problems is interesting and understandable.Looking at this it is quite clear that I enjoyed it…it’s sad that this anime just couldn’t reach far enough to be truly amazing…but still a recommendable series. came to like them…even Parcifia who can be a bit annoying sometimes with her: “Perhaps it’s better when I die” attitude.

It has a bit of everything, romance, war, parent/ child love, magic, sword play, memorable funny scenes and mecha, yep thats right, MECHA.But for those of you who hate mecha anime, dont go just yet, cuase the anime's not heavily based on mecha, but more on the story (you'll understand why mecha was used in the end). The fanstasy land that the story is set is akin to animes such as Full metal alchemist or naurto, a mix of science and medievil theme....Animation is average  but enjoyable and some pretty nice music.It has a cool storyline where you've basically got this princess who everyone hates and is protected by her elite brother sister pair. It keeps you interested becuase you want to know why she is hated and called the &quot;scrapped princess&quot; and the surprises that the story line chucks at you kepted me excited :D.However, the main heros are your aveage cool brother whos pretty good with a sword and your typical princess who knows she has to die but puts on a brave face and enjoys life to the max but some of the scenes cracked me up big time.If you enjoyed Full metal alchemist i think you'll find this anime to your taste as both are set in a similar sort of world and both are series yet funny at the same time.

Enjoy :D"", 'Scrapped Princess is an anime that\'s been overshadowed by many of the shows that have been released this past decade. Just because it\'s underrated doesn\'t mean that it\'s not good. In fact, it\'s quite the opposite.The story of Scrapped Princess is very RPG-inspired; gamers who are familiar with the genre will feel right at home with this anime. The first half of the series is light-hearted, dedicating its episodes to introducing the characters and establishing the main plot. The second half of the series is much darker, with plot twists and turns every so often, character developments,...and in-depth looks at the villains\' schemes. As I watched it, I couldn\'t help but feel that I was playing an above-standard RPG. Don\'t let that distract you from the experience, though. Not only does the story take place in a world of its own, but little clues are planted here and there in the dialogue to establish the period of time it takes place. They\'re kind of hard to miss. All the characters are pretty much likable, despite their flaws. Overtime, they start to grow on to you, making some of the major moments of the series more memorable. The story, overall, is well paced and brings everything together into one satisfying conclusion.The art is what one would come to expect from BONES studios (Fullmetal Alchemist, Ouran High School Host Club, Soul Eater). The colors are vibrant and the character designs cheerful and, in some cases, cute. They work well for the first half of the series, but at first, feel out of place during the series\' apocalyptic second half; You tend to get used to them after a while. The animation shines during the action and fight scenes, but when the scene is simple, such as a conversation between two characters, the animation tends to be a bit stoic except for some wind blowing. This issue only occurs for several episodes, though. The positive side of that is that the animators are focused more on making this series look beautiful, which they have accomplished. The art in Scrapped Princess is truly a feast for the eyes.The audio in this anime didn\'t really shine as much as I expected it to. The soundtrack overall isn\'t memorable, but the orchestral compositions soar during the more climatic moments of the series. The music is fitting, but it doesn\'t make me want to go buy the soundtrack. The series\' opening theme ""Little Wing"" by JAM Project has a nice Celtic-inspired intro that quickly makes the transition into an upbeat Pop/Rock song (with vocals provided by Masumi Okui). The song is all right as an intro to this series, but the song itself is good. It\'s one of those songs that grows on you. Same with the series\' ending, ""Daichi no la-li-la"" by Yoko Ueno and Masumi Itou. The brass at the beginning of the song makes it seem old fashioned, but then this song proves that this is no ordinary J-pop song. The singers\' canons fit well into the song (and it\'s darn catchy too!) and the song itself fits the fantasy/adventure fell of the show well. I watched the English dub of the series, and I was once again impressed at the effort put forth by Bang Zoom! Entertainment to make this dub sound good. This show has an all-star cast, starring voice actors such as Kari Wahlgren (Pacifica Cassul), Crispin Freeman (Shannon Cassul), and Steve Blum (Luke Storm). They each took their roles and made them their own. At times I felt like I wasn\'t even watching a dub of a show from Japan. The dub has to be one of the best parts of the show.Scrapped Princess is one of the most pleasant surprises I\'ve seen in a long time.

I guarantee you that it will not disappoint.', 'The thing about the fantasy genre is that, as far as I’ve picked up, a large focus is put on creating a fantastical world that the characters inhabit. There are numerous ways to go about this, whether it’s focusing a lot on the magical aspect of the world versus blending the fantasy elements with science fiction, or letting the audience know very little and have them figure out the history of the setting themselves versus letting them in on every little detail, or something else entirely. Scrapped Princess takes all of the wrong turns when it comes to this, but more of that later.The synopsis...for the anime you can find up there, so I won’t bother with it. Instead I’ll focus on what I liked or didn’t like about the show.In terms of production Scrapped Princess does alright. The visuals are nothing too fancy, which one might find strange since it’s made by Bones right after they made Wolf’s Rain and right before they made the original Fullmetal Alchemist. Point is, it doesn’t look impressive, but it looks okay. The same can be said about the music; nothing outstanding, but alright. In fact what I like the most are the character designs and more specifically the costume designs. Bones have a thing for character designs, and it really goes to show. I don’t know why everybody is wearing shoulder pads, but I like it.The characters are, to put it simply, fun. Most of them are incredibly shallow, and much of their internal conflicts can be seen as a bit dull. There is development, mind you, but we never know anything about the characters for better or for worse. The good thing is we get to see them here and now and how they change as the story goes along. The bad thing is we can’t sympathize with them well. More than anything the characters bounce off each other really well, and they make up for their lack of depth in interaction with other characters.But where does this anime fall really flat, then? As I stated before, Scrapped Princess takes all the wrong turns in creating a mysterious and fantastical fantasy world – something I absolutely love. I have this idea of fantasy worlds that you have to immerse yourself into it, preferably by questioning the mechanics behind it and figuring out how everything works out by yourself. Scrapped Princess doesn’t allow you to do so. Scrapped Princess is filled with so much expositioning you can’t help but ask if it’s trying to insult your intelligence. “Now it’s time to explain this thing,” “Here’s an explaination of that explaination,” “Here’s an explaination of what we just talked about,” “Here’s a thing that can do this, now let me remind you that we still have that thing and it can still do everything we know it can do, just in case you forgot.” But why is this a bad thing? Because you can never be fully immersed in the world the anime tries to create. Every time you think of a question the series answers it within five minutes, along with giving you many more answers that completely kills the wonders of the setting. You can never immerse yourself into the world because there is nothing to grab hold of your interests – all of your questions have been answered, so why should you? Is this bad storytelling? Yes, because it doesn’t view the audience as an entity capable of free thought, a person who is able to pick up small clues and use them later when they’re needed to answer a question – and the audience has to do this on their own, I might add.All in all Scrapped Princess had potential but ultimately fails under its own ambitions. It’s still enjoyable enough though, and it does have a set of fun characters that are fun enough to watch on their own.

Even if not, Scrapped Princess is more than worth a look.', 'This entry has a severe shortage of negative reviews on both MAL and Anidb, so I\'ll contribute my opinion to keep people like me from wasting their time with these 24 episodes.Scrapped Princess is about Pacifica, a princess who is prophesized by this world\'s religion to destroy the world when she turns 16. As such, she was abandoned as a baby by the king and found by a family who have been guarding her for her entire life.As a thematically focused series, Scrapped Princess fails on every account, but that will take time and spoilers to explain so I\'ll comment on more its...more basic aspects first. The plot meanders too much in Pacifica\'s episodic travels and has large exposition dumps that diffuse all of the mystery in its setting at once. The places where the plot meanders is also used to introduce characters that react to Pacifica\'s status as the scrapped princess. However nearly all the characters have bland personalities and backstories that aren\'t worked on enough for you to care for them. They also all turn out the same way; they see Pacifica and decide that such a nice girl can\'t possibly destroy the world so they defy religious prophecy and the government. From what I can tell it seems like their further desire to risk their lives to protect her is mainly motivated by their observance of Pacifica\'s character but the problem is that Pacifica herself doesn\'t have the charisma or magnetism to pull that off. The other thing that the plot tries to do is constantly remind you of Pacifica\'s angst owing to her position as well as the strong bond between her and her guardians, Shannon and Raquel, which gets trite.Yet for all her angst, Pacifica is not an active character. Her guardians do all the work and later when they get separated she instantly finds a stranger that takes care of her and protects her, so that she\'s generally shown living a comfortable life. She never has to fight her own battles or be the main source of income. She cooks but she\'s bad at it. When she does laundry she makes her guardians do it too. Despite this she spends half of her screen time complaining to her guardians about being tired and hungry and generally acting like a pampered princess. After 24 episodes of getting cocooned by her guardians and allies that she somehow charismatically attracted, she\'s given a choice that would change the fate of the world.The major reason why I can see people being absorbed by this series is because it utilizes a lot of emotional porn. Pacifica will angst by feeling guilty about being the scrapped princess despite it clearly not being her fault and despite being told that the prophecy is wrong repeatedly. And as I said, this angst is overblown when she constantly has people protecting her from physical harm, and she\'s never had to suffer much from self esteem issues caused by the world because she was raised in a loving family and is fed constant emotional support from her siblings and allies. In fact, she\'s shown to have an almost narcisstic bend to her; she beats up artists who don\'t draw her in a flattering way, glares at people for not liking her cooking, and says a guy is out of her league when he asks her out. Shannon\'s desire to protect her against the world at all costs is repeatedly emphasized so you can take in the emotional beauty of such a dynamic, but doing this doesn\'t reveal anything we didn\'t already know about the characters from the first episode. To keep this going,(SPOILERS)the show gives Pacifica amnesia, gets her another guardian, makes him sacrifice himself to protect her, and then gives her back her memories by having her remember Shannon\'s love for her.(ENDSPOILERS)All of which does nothing to further either character or develop the themes. Emotional porn 101. As such, character development across the board is miniscule or trivial. Other than people doing what they think is right by not killing the obviously innocent girl instead of listening to religious brainwashing, you have the standard ""logical AI\'s develop emotion"" trash.Of course, the series also tackles major themes that might give the semblance of depth. I don\'t think so, and I\'ll explain possible thematic connections and why they don\'t work:SPOILERS AHEAD1) Discussion of fate/religious prophecy/destiny. First of all, it doesn\'t exactly discuss destiny because a prophecy that says something will happen is different from the thing factually happening. One of the central conflicts is whether or not to believe in the religious prophecy that says the scrapped princess will bring doom to the world, which makes sense in the medieval setting, where religion would play a large role in people\'s lives. However, the general problem of using this as a theme is that prophecies in stories almost never work. If the story says the prophecy is true, then there\'s nothing else to be said except maybe accept your fate. Usually though, if the prophecy is something negative, the story necessarily has to eventually reveal that the prophecy is false, in which case the only thing that can be said was that prophecies aren\'t always accurate so you can\'t base your actions entirely on them. Then the aesop is too simple and there\'s nothing to be learned. In the case of Scrapped Princess the prophecy is so at odds with common sense and morality that the obvious answer is that the prophecy is wrong, which was confirmed by the story about 11 episodes in. Pacifica is obviously a normal girl that has not shown the slightest tendency nor power of destroying the world and killing her would be cold blooded murder. It\'s like when people thought the world was going to end in 2012 and the only evidence was that the Mayan calendar ended on that day. The only lesson learned is that prophecies with little basis in reality are stupid, which the characters of Scrapped Princess learn upon meeting Pacifica. There\'s nothing about defying destiny here.That\'s not to say the idea of prophecies or fate can\'t be used in storytelling at all. Rather, a prophecy or idea of fate has to be tied in a natural chain of causality such that things SEEM inevitable and thus characters actually have to grapple with the idea that most things are beyond their control, which definitely occurs in real life. In the case of Scrapped Princess, this would involve a Pacifica who manifests destructive powers and has trouble controlling her temper. That way, the prophecy would only be accentuating the human problem of not being able to control oneself and thus be doomed for a path of self-destruction. The idea of prophecy and fate would be relevant insofar as they describe how hopeless it can feel for someone to overcome their personal weaknesses. This would be similar to something like Lenny from Of Mice and Men, wherein the character seemed doomed from the very start. Done this way, the prophecy being proven wrong wouldn\'t be proving that it was a religious sham, BOOM all problems solved, but rather people worked their asses off to change the course of events from their most likely outcome. It would also make people\'s choice to believe in Pacifica much more significant, because they chose to see the good in a person who was so flawed, rather than make the obvious decision to not kill a perfectly normal girl.2) Defying the gaslighting of religious belief--- if it was going for this, the series only touches upon this lightly, again owing to the fact that the characters decide to believe in Pacifica so easily. It doesn\'t explore the intense internal struggles that people who\'ve grown up with a religion face when they start questioning that religion, and all the thoughts that go with it. In fact the series portrays religion in a pretty one-sided manner by making it the instrument of oppression on the human race. It doesn\'t offer any more depth than any one of those fake church episodes from episodic action adventures.3) Humanity is too self destructive for its own good and should be controlled, freedom vs security--- the series is out of its depth when it touches on this subject. An alien race decides that humanity if left alone would destroy itself, so it fights a war with it. They fight a war to end all wars, basically. Then one of the humans decides the war will take too many more lives so she betrays the human race and gets it enclosed in a tightly controlled environment stuck in medieval times (apparently advanced technology is too dangerous). This is obviously too extreme of a solution that values security over a total lack of freedom. Furthermore the standard of living has generally increased since medieval times and international relations are much more heavily regulated now than it was then. But it still could have worked, if the series had explored the advantages of living in such a world weighed against the freedom or lack of freedom of the people living in it. Unfortunately, such worldbuilding is scarce. Instead, Pacifica gets the God of this enclosed world to free humanity after telling her that people should have the freedom to make their own choices and take responsibility for it, and God agrees just like that, as if she didn\'t have any basic historical knowledge about governance and this 16 year old girl who knows nothing provided this piece of wisdom to her. Basically, this series discusses the issue by swinging the pendulum between two extremes and thus produces no meaningful thematic exploration. Who would\'ve guessed that humans should have free will, right?ENDSPOILERSThat wraps up the themes. In the end, I don\'t think there is a single element that this show did well. more basic aspects first. The plot meanders too much in Pacifica\'s episodic travels and has large exposition dumps that diffuse all of the mystery in its setting at once. The places where the plot meanders is also used to introduce characters that react to Pacifica\'s status as the scrapped princess.

The other thing that the plot tries to do is constantly remind you of Pacifica\'s angst owing to her position as well as the strong bond between her and her guardians, Shannon and Raquel, which gets trite.Yet for all her angst, Pacifica is not an active character. Her guardians do all the work and later when they get separated she instantly finds a stranger that takes care of her and protects her, so that she\'s generally shown living a comfortable life. She never has to fight her own battles or be the main source of income. She cooks but she\'s bad at it. When she does laundry she makes her guardians do it too. Despite this she spends half of her screen time complaining to her guardians about being tired and hungry and generally acting like a pampered princess. After 24 episodes of getting cocooned by her guardians and allies that she somehow charismatically attracted, she\'s given a choice that would change the fate of the world.The major reason why I can see people being absorbed by this series is because it utilizes a lot of emotional porn. Pacifica will angst by feeling guilty about being the scrapped princess despite it clearly not being her fault and despite being told that the prophecy is wrong repeatedly. And as I said, this angst is overblown when she constantly has people protecting her from physical harm, and she\'s never had to suffer much from self esteem issues caused by the world because she was raised in a loving family and is fed constant emotional support from her siblings and allies. In fact, she\'s shown to have an almost narcisstic bend to her; she beats up artists who don\'t draw her in a flattering way, glares at people for not liking her cooking, and says a guy is out of her league when he asks her out. Shannon\'s desire to protect her against the world at all costs is repeatedly emphasized so you can take in the emotional beauty of such a dynamic, but doing this doesn\'t reveal anything we didn\'t already know about the characters from the first episode. To keep this going,(SPOILERS)the show gives Pacifica amnesia, gets her another guardian, makes him sacrifice himself to protect her, and then gives her back her memories by having her remember Shannon\'s love for her.(ENDSPOILERS)All of which does nothing to further either character or develop the themes. Emotional porn 101. As such, character development across the board is miniscule or trivial. Other than people doing what they think is right by not killing the obviously innocent girl instead of listening to religious brainwashing, you have the standard ""logical AI\'s develop emotion"" trash.Of course, the series also tackles major themes that might give the semblance of depth. I don\'t think so, and I\'ll explain possible thematic connections and why they don\'t work:SPOILERS AHEAD1) Discussion of fate/religious prophecy/destiny. First of all, it doesn\'t exactly discuss destiny because a prophecy that says something will happen is different from the thing factually happening. One of the central conflicts is whether or not to believe in the religious prophecy that says the scrapped princess will bring doom to the world, which makes sense in the medieval setting, where religion would play a large role in people\'s lives. However, the general problem of using this as a theme is that prophecies in stories almost never work. If the story says the prophecy is true, then there\'s nothing else to be said except maybe accept your fate. Usually though, if the prophecy is something negative, the story necessarily has to eventually reveal that the prophecy is false, in which case the only thing that can be said was that prophecies aren\'t always accurate so you can\'t base your actions entirely on them. Then the aesop is too simple and there\'s nothing to be learned. In the case of Scrapped Princess the prophecy is so at odds with common sense and morality that the obvious answer is that the prophecy is wrong, which was confirmed by the story about 11 episodes in. Pacifica is obviously a normal girl that has not shown the slightest tendency nor power of destroying the world and killing her would be cold blooded murder. It\'s like when people thought the world was going to end in 2012 and the only evidence was that the Mayan calendar ended on that day. The only lesson learned is that prophecies with little basis in reality are stupid, which the characters of Scrapped Princess learn upon meeting Pacifica. There\'s nothing about defying destiny here.That\'s not to say the idea of prophecies or fate can\'t be used in storytelling at all. Rather, a prophecy or idea of fate has to be tied in a natural chain of causality such that things SEEM inevitable and thus characters actually have to grapple with the idea that most things are beyond their control, which definitely occurs in real life. In the case of Scrapped Princess, this would involve a Pacifica who manifests destructive powers and has trouble controlling her temper. That way, the prophecy would only be accentuating the human problem of not being able to control oneself and thus be doomed for a path of self-destruction. The idea of prophecy and fate would be relevant insofar as they describe how hopeless it can feel for someone to overcome their personal weaknesses. This would be similar to something like Lenny from Of Mice and Men, wherein the character seemed doomed from the very start. Done this way, the prophecy being proven wrong wouldn\'t be proving that it was a religious sham, BOOM all problems solved, but rather people worked their asses off to change the course of events from their most likely outcome. It would also make people\'s choice to believe in Pacifica much more significant, because they chose to see the good in a person who was so flawed, rather than make the obvious decision to not kill a perfectly normal girl.2) Defying the gaslighting of religious belief--- if it was going for this, the series only touches upon this lightly, again owing to the fact that the characters decide to believe in Pacifica so easily. It doesn\'t explore the intense internal struggles that people who\'ve grown up with a religion face when they start questioning that religion, and all the thoughts that go with it. In fact the series portrays religion in a pretty one-sided manner by making it the instrument of oppression on the human race. It doesn\'t offer any more depth than any one of those fake church episodes from episodic action adventures.3) Humanity is too self destructive for its own good and should be controlled, freedom vs security--- the series is out of its depth when it touches on this subject. An alien race decides that humanity if left alone would destroy itself, so it fights a war with it. They fight a war to end all wars, basically. Then one of the humans decides the war will take too many more lives so she betrays the human race and gets it enclosed in a tightly controlled environment stuck in medieval times (apparently advanced technology is too dangerous). This is obviously too extreme of a solution that values security over a total lack of freedom. Furthermore the standard of living has generally increased since medieval times and international relations are much more heavily regulated now than it was then. But it still could have worked, if the series had explored the advantages of living in such a world weighed against the freedom or lack of freedom of the people living in it. Unfortunately, such worldbuilding is scarce. Instead, Pacifica gets the God of this enclosed world to free humanity after telling her that people should have the freedom to make their own choices and take responsibility for it, and God agrees just like that, as if she didn\'t have any basic historical knowledge about governance and this 16 year old girl who knows nothing provided this piece of wisdom to her. Basically, this series discusses the issue by swinging the pendulum between two extremes and thus produces no meaningful thematic exploration. Who would\'ve guessed that humans should have free will, right?ENDSPOILERSThat wraps up the themes. In the end, I don\'t think there is a single element that this show did well.', 'I first watched Scrapped Princess back when it was originally being fansubbed. I decided then that it was the best anime I had ever seen, and my opinion hasn\'t changed. To this day it\'s still my number one favorite and I\'ve watched it over at least three times. Recently I decided to watch it again, and I was inspired to write this review from the perspective of a long time fan.The story of Scrapped Princess is remarkably engaging. The setting, middle-age fantasy with elements of science fiction, is still believable. This is the kind of fantasy world I would like to live in. I find...myself almost drawn in as I watch. Coupled with great character development, each episode is enjoyable and the plot never feels like it\'s dragging on for too long. I only wish the backstory would have been explained in more detail regarding the Dragoons and Peacemakers, as well as their creators.Speaking of characters, I don\'t think there\'s a single genuinely unlikeable person in this whole story. Even the baddest of the bad ones I can hardly bring myself to hate, and I really feel like I want the good guys to win. Each character has his own distinct personality traits, but they aren\'t overplayed, and tragic moments actually feel tragic.Everything is drawn well in Scrapped Princess. The characters are never off-model and the backgrounds in most scenes are nothing short of beautiful. The fantasy-sci fi setting is presented incredibly well. Ruins of a highly advanced, long dead civilization dot the landscape, but scenes still evoke an ""old world"" feeling.I can\'t really say much about the music. It seems pleasantly understated, if anything. Nothing stands out in the soundtrack, but it always fits the mood.Regardless of its faults, I can\'t possibly recommend Scrapped Princess more. I\'ve never seen anything else like it. It doesn\'t get old no matter how many times I watch.

So the series tracks the princess as she avoids her pursuers and makes friends and comrades along the way.Aside from getting a big load of plot dropped in your lap around the middle of the series spanning a couple of episodes, the pacing was very good. Also there are a few emotional moments in the series where you really feel for the characters.

To avoid being killed by the zealots of Mauser, Pacifica and her adoptive brother and sister leave the village of Manhurin. Her brother, Shannon, is an expert with the sword while Racquel is proficient with magic. At every step of the way, however, someone is constantly trying to kill Pacifica, hoping to somehow avert the catastrophe that is supposed to befall the world on her 16th birthday.I will admit that I like the plotline for this title as it deals with a burden of being born with a curse and that you have to live with that of people constantly hating you for what you are because of your title yet once you know them, they are not that bad of a person that they make you out to be. Plus, the show is run of a quick and constant pace as it doesn’t feel too long whenever you watch it, as in watching the first 6 episodes is 2 hours long but you don’t think that it’s dragging or wasting your time.I got to say for the characters, there is one flaw within the characters of the show: NONE OF THEM ARE UNLIKABLE! As in, I find every character of the show to be enjoyable to watch once you get to know them in the story. In the beginning, the main character Pacifica Cassul may act like a brat in some of the episodes but you don’t really hate her since it wasn’t that obnoxious or overbearing. You really feel for the character that’s going through his status as the Scrapped Princess, being forsaken to that, and it helps that she can be a sweet person on the inside. Shannon Cassul is the straightforward older brother, meaning he doesn’t have time to fool around when it comes to protecting his sister and is a great swordfighter.  Raquel is the oldest of the siblings and she is very calm and motherly figure of the show, which is what I liked about her as in groups, people do need that type of person who assures themselves that things can work out. Other characters include Leo, the noble yet naïve knight who vows to protect Pacifica, and also has a crush on her, too, and Winia, the introverted and lonesome maid who later joined the Cassul siblings into their adventure.The animation from Studio BONES is very 2000s vintage considering as of now, it’s been almost 10 years since its creation in 2003 and it doesn’t look aged at all but the artwork, character designs and backgrounds are very fluid and strikingly impressive by today’s standards or even the standards of 6 years ago.Musically, I can say for the opening theme, it seems like a bit of Scottish and/or medieval charm was heavily influenced by that, as well as the background music. The ending music, I didn’t feel much of that influence on there but it is serviceable for the ending theme.Lastly, I got to say on the Bandai/Bang Zoom dub is that this is one of the most well-done dubs I have ever watched. It also helps that Crispin Freeman, not only voices Shannon, but he is also the ADR director and writer of the show and it shows that Freeman can be awesome behind the screen as well as being the voice. Kari Wahlgren as Pacifica is one of her better roles of likable characters, right next to Haruko from FLCL and Saya from Blood+ and Bridget Hoffman does a great and nuanced job as always playing the cool and calm role of Raquel and even supporting roles filled by Michelle Ruff, Yuri Lowenthal, and Kirk Thornton among others are decent in their roles.FINAL VERDICT: I can easily say that Scrapped Princess is one of those shows that you should definitely check out (if you can, since you-know-who has folded). It has a great amount of pacing, enjoyable characters with great development and something that can combine things you don’t even like in anime into saying you love.

It started out watchable with the brother and sister team protecting their little sister the prophesized SP, with one specialising in fighting and the other in magic.As the story progresses towards the ending, it becomes a mess with mechs appearing and a storyline full of plotholes and a serious case of plot armor.For example, you have a general which is reputed to be the most logical choosing to go after the princess, using normal human soldiers,...when she is protected by this OP mech that has the ability to obliterate entire kingdoms.**spoilers**Other really stupid logic lapses includes the knight promising to protect the princess giving up without a fight when found, or him being released without a reason when she's captured.Also how can a queen that's been kept alive for 16 years suddenly die just next to Pacifica's cell? That's pure garbage writing written in just to elicit some drama.And the dragoon knight doesn't need to negotiate with any human beings. He can wipe out the entire kingdom by himself. So when he was in the same room as Pacific in the throne room, all he needed to do was to activate the dragoon mode. Did the writers accidentally erase his brain or something?Also, he had a big fight with the Peacemaker CZ, and next moment, he tolerates her hanging around him constantly? And the peacemakers will allow a weakened dragoon warrior to live when they can easily eliminate him due to lack of sleep?None of the behaviors here make any sense and you rather get the feel that the writers just went with whatever they liked without really considering the logic of it. This is just really poor writing and full of flaws that makes it unwatchable in the end. Do not watch this if you can't stomach lazy writing and writers who couldn't really come up with a logical ending to their initial premise and just wrote whatever nonsense that they can come up with.

This one is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and bought the DVD's. It even made it as part of my favorites, although not top 5. A few minor spoiler hints but nothing too specific are included.Wait... Why do I sound down about a top 10 favorite you ask? Well its simple really. I'm big on something called setting the scene. How do i mean ? That is also very simple. But first Lets talk about what I liked about the show.The story is nothing too spectacular but it does have...its moments, as the storytelling is overall pretty good in my opinion.Art is average to above average. Character designs are done overall very well as well as scenery feeling alive and not just a backdrop for everything else. Battle effects are done very well, and the spell effects are excellent.Characters are likable. Even the principle villains are interesting and with a few exceptions don't feel flat. Characters motivations are pretty generic, but it is easy to understand why characters act they way they do for the most part.Overall I really enjoyed the series and would recommend it to anyone seeking an adventure with mixed magic and swordplay along with fragments of highly advanced technology thrown into the mix. This is not a little kids show about courage and facing off against higher powers. People die, lives are shattered, characters are manipulated into trying to kill the scrapped princess. Even a (short lived) primary supporting character is shot full of arrows and dies in the streets leaving us in a  bit of a predicament at one point.I do feel I need to mention post processing of how each episode ends its a bit jarring. It can flow from whatever is happening on screen strait into the outro music. Sometimes this is abrupt and feels almost like the producers couldn't find a good place to cut the episode off. This not setting suspense for the next episode, this is just a jarring cut.The other thing I can really rip my hair out about this and what prevents it from being a top five favorite is this series implementation of some of its sound mechanics.Voice acting is fine and even above average. Sound effects are concise and used without problem. The intro song is pretty good actually, while the outro is forgettable. In scene music is mostly forgettable, with a few exceptions taking the lead from time to time.Well that's average or above average sound use right? well it is except for one thing that bothers me a great deal. Maybe I'm just spouting crap. but the break to and return from commercial interlude completely breaks the scene for me.

Oh wait .

As the writer Arthur Clarke says in one of his laws: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"". This concept, alone, is enough for two genres as disparate as fantasy and science fiction to become completely compatible, but also, the transition from a medieval, magic-filled world into something more complex, with such an harmonious and right pacing, gives this anime its own style and a feeling that might be imposible to replicate in any later works. In other words, this series is simply unique in this way. The world is also vast, consistently built and explored...in detail: the viewers will travel through several places and, if paying proper attention, will find subtle tracks about the background story, which creates a great feeling of immersion and intrigue.During this adventure, different groups of people with diverse beliefs (not only in a religious sense, but also in the livingstyle and even personal values) will be shown, as well as the inherent conflicts that come along with the opposition of different ways of thinking, and here comes the main thematic: What\'s best for mankind, for a human being? To be protected from dangers and live comfortable, but at the price of being privated from their free will? Or to be free to decide their own fate, but assuming the risks of chosing wrong, perhaps even facing one\'s own destruction? This debate is heavily present throughout most episodes, and as well as several other secondary topics, will be properly developed and reach a conclusion.The main character, Pacifica Cassull, is an extremely passive, comformist and carefree person for most of the time, which might make her unpleasant at momments, but she\'s designed like that in order to explore the aforementioned subjects. She will slowly learn about different perspectives and grow to give the story a closing. Truly tri-dimensional, she has many traits, both negative and possitive: she\'s also kind, worries about others and strugles with the suffering that her existence causes to others because of a fate that others decided for her. She\'s got behaviours that might seem contradictory but that\'s always coherent in the end. All this makes her realistic, mostly well-balanced and the perfect protagonist for this anime. The rest of the main cast is way more simple, but also remarkably well designed since they all have properly defined personalities, their own motivations, have dinamic and organic interactions and keep the plot moving into the right way. Bassically, few to none character go to a waste.Moreover, Scrapped Princess is not only rich in philoshophical content, but is also diverse possessing drama, comedy, and exciting action. The series just has enough stuff as to be entertaining just as much as it is artistcal. Everything referred to the  audiovisual section is just impressive for the time this series was aired. Animation has a great use of colour for every situation and a truly high level of detail (both for characters and landscapes). The action scenes are really fluid, which, alongside variable camera angles, make them epic and memorable. The viewer can really feel the magnitude of the battles. As for the soundtrack, it is in my opinion one of the best around there. Every track has a lot of emotion and fits perfectly every scene, making drama and action really intense, at the same time contributing to the series\' identity. In short, this anime is pretty ingenious with its plot, its scenerey, its concepts, its character writing and the way in which it exposes and develops these four sections, plus amazing artwork.This anime has some little defects, though. In specific moments, the subtle narrative will be replaced by perhaps oral exposition, thus becoming a little dense at times. Also, even if the conclusion of the story is plainly epic, the conclusion for the main theme is kind of weak, since I think the final message needed a little more clearness. Yet, these trifles pale compared to the good job this anime does, and for that reason, it is nearly a perfect show.Scrapped Princess gets a 10/10 from me. A masterpiece as few I\'ve seen. in detail: the viewers will travel through several places and, if paying proper attention, will find subtle tracks about the background story, which creates a great feeling of immersion and intrigue.During this adventure, different groups of people with diverse beliefs (not only in a religious sense, but also in the livingstyle and even personal values) will be shown, as well as the inherent conflicts that come along with the opposition of different ways of thinking, and here comes the main thematic: What\'s best for mankind, for a human being? To be protected from dangers and live comfortable, but at the price of being privated from their free will? Or to be free to decide their own fate, but assuming the risks of chosing wrong, perhaps even facing one\'s own destruction? This debate is heavily present throughout most episodes, and as well as several other secondary topics, will be properly developed and reach a conclusion.The main character, Pacifica Cassull, is an extremely passive, comformist and carefree person for most of the time, which might make her unpleasant at momments, but she\'s designed like that in order to explore the aforementioned subjects. She will slowly learn about different perspectives and grow to give the story a closing. Truly tri-dimensional, she has many traits, both negative and possitive: she\'s also kind, worries about others and strugles with the suffering that her existence causes to others because of a fate that others decided for her. She\'s got behaviours that might seem contradictory but that\'s always coherent in the end. All this makes her realistic, mostly well-balanced and the perfect protagonist for this anime. The rest of the main cast is way more simple, but also remarkably well designed since they all have properly defined personalities, their own motivations, have dinamic and organic interactions and keep the plot moving into the right way. Bassically, few to none character go to a waste.Moreover, Scrapped Princess is not only rich in philoshophical content, but is also diverse possessing drama, comedy, and exciting action. The series just has enough stuff as to be entertaining just as much as it is artistcal. Everything referred to the  audiovisual section is just impressive for the time this series was aired. Animation has a great use of colour for every situation and a truly high level of detail (both for characters and landscapes). The action scenes are really fluid, which, alongside variable camera angles, make them epic and memorable. The viewer can really feel the magnitude of the battles.

The pace at the beginning was relatively slow and peaceful, but gradually builds up to something rather amazing. Theres a fair bit of heart wrenches and universe twists in the second half of the series. The story was very good and well paced. However the ending seemed lacking in comparison and the pacing in the beginning may have been a tad too slow.The art, animation and sound were all very good and high quality for an...anime of its time. The environment and props fitted together well, most of the time. I found myself disagreeing with the anime's idea of fashion and advanced weaponry, but those are very much personal preferences.Many interesting and unique characters are introduced through the series, although one or two minor characters felt more cliche and shallow than the anime deserved.Overall it is a wonderful anime with a few, very minor downfalls. A worthy watch that definitely deserves more attention than it has. anime of its time. The environment and props fitted together well, most of the time.

It is placed in a fantasy kingdom called Leiwan that’s pretty much under a religious order.Pacifica always acts like a princess even though she grew up with her brother and sister. For a 15 year old girl, she pretty much acts like any normal 15 year old girl. Bitchy, whiny and all together bothersome in most places. She does get annoying at some times but in the end, you really feel for her. She was thrown away at birth and has only her...foster siblings to live with. You can really tell that she loves both her siblings but it seems that she really loves Shannon. I guess you could consider her to have a big brother complex even if he isn’t her real brother. Although she is always called the poison that will destroy the world, she makes lasting impressions on those that meet her.Shannon himself seems to always have problems wondering what he should even do. He fights within himself on the duty he has for his family and for all the other people around him. Even though he fights within himself, when on the battlefield, he protects her without thought. I myself think he looks really cute by the way. He is really reserved and doesn’t really show his emotions towards his siblings. He hates anybody outside the family and doesn’t trust them even if they show that they can be. When we talk about Shannon, we also have to talk about Zefiris who shows up in episode 2. I won’t exactly say why, but she has a large connection to Shannon and helps them with information. She sounds just like a computer with how logical she talks and acts.Raquel is the oldest of the siblings, very kind and motherly to both Shannon and Pacifica. She normally keeps a level head and uses powerful magic, able to cast them rather fast. She doesn’t really have a lot of backstory and her personality to me feels a bit like it is lacking on some aspects, not really as filled out as Shannon and Pacifica. When putting her next to the other two, she doesn’t stand out as well as the others in the series including the people who are not related.Leo takes up the clueless knight area. He is a noble knight who falls in love with Pacifica and his love never seems to faulter no matter what. He is always proposing to her and trying to protect her when he sees her until finds out about her being a scrapped princess. After that, he fights with himself with the question ‘What is Chivalry?’ and the question haunts him.The Animation is wonderfully done with fluid movements as known from Studio Bones. I don’t really see many problems in the artwork as every little detail is done pretty well. There are things that I nit pick about it though like in the second episode, what the hell is the map the old women gave them? There is nothing to actually use to find the house they are looking for!The opening is really lovely, and sounds really nice like a fairy tail beat. I truly love the English dub of the show even if it seems a little off in some of the background characters. The main characters are pretty perfect for the show, giving it the air of class. Crispin Freeman does a perfect job as Shannon, like almost all the characters he does, and makes him sound reserved and calm. He does sometimes seem too reserved but I think that more fits him. There are a lot of words that are used without much definition to the point that we sort of need a Glossary to figure them out. I wish they had a little more information about the different things like the Dragoon and Phase Space.

Part of this is my growing understanding of Japanese language and anime.  Part of it is that Scrapped Princess is a lot more complicated than it may first appear to be.  It has numerous layers of subtlety that you may miss out on during the first viewing.  That isn\'t really a problem, since it is pleasant and enjoyable as a simple fantasy story with a slight twist.  The unfortunate thing is that it may not draw you back for a second viewing.On repeat...viewing, I found that the characters and their interactions were a lot more complicated and engaging than I remembered them being.  I found that the show as a whole had a lot more to say than I remembered.  I also found that I simply appreciated the artistry of it.  Scrapped Princess was one of my earliest experiences with anime.  In the time since my first viewing, I had watched many others.  I had learned what to look for.On a side note, I am even more convinced after reading the reviews here that pretty much everyone watching it completely missed what the show was about.  I ended up reading all of the reviews.  I hoped more and more that one would show that someone got it.  It\'s possible (lets give people the benefit of the doubt) that, like me, no one wants to explain it explicitly .  It kind of reminds me of all the conversations I\'ve had regarding what the Incredibles is about that have me saying ""How can you possibly not know!?!!?

While I may of only watched 2 episodes, I have read the manga half way when I was younger. So I know the back story of the characters and other details they didn\'t place in the anime. But I even though I read it years ago, I still can\'t forget the feeling of reading a good story. And I still feel that even while watching it. While it does have different ways of showing the story of Pacifica, I still good ol\' Scrapped Princess. But I think it would\'ve been nice if they showed the background...story, instead of worrying about episode length. It would\'ve made it more enjoyable for the people that never read the manga before. Now on with the review!Story: The basic story is this, In this world, there was these twins born in the royal family. One of the twins (Pacifica) was foretold to be the ""poison that destroys the world"" if she was to reach her 16th birthday. To prevent this she was thrown off a cliff (Anyone have heard adoption?) and said to be dead, but really she was saved by the court wizard and taken to a foster family. No one had heard of her until she turned 15. Then she and her foster brother and sister, Shannon and Raquel, go to escape the country of Leinwan, protecting her on the way with magic, swords and fantasy things. :3Art: I think of it well, shows the action fights well and the magic was intresting how they show it being cast. It has the same feel as the Manga.Sound: I rather enjoyed the music. Good way to show the feeling of the story, a bit of sadness with hope in the mix.Character: The charcters had a good balance in it. I liked Raquel the most, her sweetness, but I can detect some kind of hostility in it when someone messed with her baby sister. Shannon was pretty awesome, super cool with his sword fighting and his whole attitude, In battle made his awesome, like, ""I don\'t have time for this crap, and when he\'s arguing with Pacifica, pretty funny, reminds me of my brother and I. and there is Pacifica, her attitude I felt was pretty good. She may act selfish, but really.. I felt was a disguise to hide her fear of the future and her only family. She really is a sweet girl, brave and honest.Enjoyment: I say, pretty nice thing to watch when bored. Has some funny moments, but some make me sad. I mean, who wants to be told, ""You shouldn\'t of never been born."" But all in all, a really good anime, I\'m still gonna keep watching though!Overall: I say, read the Manga first, before the anime. It can save the confusing of the background story of the sibilings and the story itself. So when you\'re watching it, you would know what is going on and why. :3But I say, watch it if you want something different in princess/ medivial stories.:3Story: 9Art: 8Sound: 8Character: 9Enjoyment: 8OVERALL: 8 story, instead of worrying about episode length.

Review does include a slight spoiler to the nature of the ending, which I will mark with caps.I enjoyed this anime more than I was hoping to. It was really decent and I have mostly positive attitude towards it. I was surprised reading that this seemingly fantasy anime had mecha in tags, but after few episodes I got to know why. It merges the genres surprisingly well. The pros would be:- enjoyable characters (with one exception below)- interesting storyline- some amazing plot twists, which...were actually unpredictable- satisfying merging of science and magic- nothing original from my part, but SHANNON.the main con used to be:- the pacing is weird. Sometimes I felt like looking blankly at the wall instead of focusing on the screen, which makes me feel after 16 episodes like I’ve already seen at least 23. Seriously, in the middle arc I was really sure we’re heading towards the end, and only then I looked at the number of episodes left. Something is wrong with the script; even if it’s going forward, it’s doing so very slowly, even though there is plenty of action involved. I might not be able to put it into words more accurately. It was certainly not boring though.- with time, my biggest complain began to be the main character.What I thought during the series was: Gosh, how ANNOYING one can be! At first, I thought her behaving as a spoiled child would set the base for her character development, but more than halfway into the story she... never really changed. I mean, she’s a good girl and very compassionate, but still so whiney and princessy (slapping a guy on the face just because he didn’t give her satisfactory compliment on her looks? REALLY?), and veeery dumb (she must be told multiple times about the nature about her situation and even though I understand she really didn’t know what to do at the time, she could at least try to behave more mature in face of the unknown situation). Maybe she indeed was supposed to represent the innocence put in the opposite of how people viewed her, but during the show she was just constantly getting on my nerves exactly the same as she was getting on the nerves of Senes. I just wanted to shut her up so many times. She is standing for her friends and family, even to the extend of letting her hand be cut, but I still think she has absolutely nothing to back her bravado back. She doesn’t even want to learn any basic survival skills or fighting techniques. The only thing she would do, was laundry and repeating all the time ""I\'m sorry that I\'m alive"". When I compare her to Yona, she is one spoiled annoying brat all the time. Of course, you don’t discuss the taste, but for me, she was one of the most annoying main characters ever and hands down the most annoying character in the series.Now, the part below contains the aforementioned SPOILER TO THE ENDING. No names, no incidents, just a general idea........After finishing the anime, I got the impression, that Pacifica was actually MADE to be very plain, a bit dumb and clueless about the world. She might have been made to stay like that to the very end, so that her natural feelings and instinct might serve as the finishing touch to this world’s destiny. It might be some kind of an interesting idea, but for a fictional storyline I don\'t really thing it\'s the best main character, if you ask me. I know, that in reality, lots of plain, uninteresting and dumb people are put in the irreplaceable position, like she was, but fictional characters should have some development and traits that make you actually feel that they’re special in something more than just their destiny. They are to teach viewers how to face the situation and how to grow from it. The only thing Pacifica actually accomplished was not running away crying – but still, I feel that she was the most spoiled and the most annoying main character I\'ve ever seen, and I was often wondering why was she so adored by people she met on her way, because I wanted to kick some maturity in her ass in every single scene she appeared in.So, my score for this anime would be much much higher, if only the main character wasn\'t pissing me off so much with every passing episode. were actually unpredictable- satisfying merging of science and magic- nothing original from my part, but SHANNON.the main con used to be:- the pacing is weird.

The development of the story was good and it was a lot more fun when it was the crew running away from the authorities and getting out of troublesome situation. IMO it jumped the shark in the last half of season 2 and had all sorts of complicated things, unnecessary mechs, a huge fighting scene that was built up for 6 episodes and lasted 2 minutes. Honestly it was all sizzle and no flavor. By around episode 18 I was begging for it to end. I would rate the seasons: 1 as a 7.5 and 2 as a 5. ', 'This is a flawed gem. IT is a very nice looking anime with interesting and amusing characters ... that also suffers from pacing problems, uses ridiculously cliched plot devices, and can\'t properly handle dramatic or tragic elements.I was unsure if I should rate it 5 or 6, and in the end decide on 6 (and still have my doubts about it)Detailed breakdown below:The story has somewhat interesting premise and a bit unusual settings.

Somewhere between half-way and 2/3rds the series decide to use the most cliched device possible (you\'ll know what I\'m talking about it), and run with the idea for several episodes, which results in a rather tedious ""arc"". The anime has trouble properly handle tragic, sad or dramatic elements - those simply fall flat all the time.Art:It is good. The closest things I can think of are El Cazador De La Bruja or Noir, except it is much more detailed than Noir. I think I spotted few frames with cheap CG lighting strike, but that\'s just a few frames during the whole series. Mechanical designs look good, characters are fairly detailed, backgrounds are well drawn.Sound:Decent music, some battle themes are interesting.Characters:Characters do not really develop over time. Main heroine is a bit amusing at times (she\'s an archetype), but she has that annoying habit of obsessing over her origin. I understand that she would have ""What if I didn\'t exist"", or ""Maybe it is my fault"" thoughts, but when this happens several times per episode at really short interval, it gets really annoying.Enjoyment:Starts off great, feels drawn out at 1/3rd, uses cringe-worthy plot device in the middle, and has annoyingly predictable events near the end. While I liked the beginning, I was very annoyed by the story flaws later on, especially close to the end.Overall:It is decent. I would say it is definitely worth watching because of unusual settings and visuals, but I think it would\'ve been better without story issues.So, it makes sense to check this out if you haven\'t seen it already. detail, while the idea is great, it feels forced.

I think I spotted few frames with cheap CG lighting strike, but that\'s just a few frames during the whole series. Mechanical designs look good, characters are fairly detailed, backgrounds are well drawn.Sound:Decent music, some battle themes are interesting.Characters:Characters do not really develop over time. Main heroine is a bit amusing at times (she\'s an archetype), but she has that annoying habit of obsessing over her origin. I understand that she would have ""What if I didn\'t exist"", or ""Maybe it is my fault"" thoughts, but when this happens several times per episode at really short interval, it gets really annoying.Enjoyment:Starts off great, feels drawn out at 1/3rd, uses cringe-worthy plot device in the middle, and has annoyingly predictable events near the end. While I liked the beginning, I was very annoyed by the story flaws later on, especially close to the end.Overall:It is decent. I would say it is definitely worth watching because of unusual settings and visuals, but I think it would\'ve been better without story issues.So, it makes sense to check this out if you haven\'t seen it already.', 'The story takes place in what appears to be a fantasy world and revolves around a girl named Pacifica Casull, the sister in a pair of twins born to the royal family of a kingdom called Leinwan. Pacifica is abandoned at birth. The 5111th Grendel Prophecy predicts that she is the ""poison that will destroy the world"" if she reaches her sixteenth birthday. To prevent this, she is dropped off a cliff as an infant (""scrapped"").Note: (There\'s a bit of a spoiler near the end of my thoughts.)My thoughts:Scrapped Princess was a superb anime in my opinion. Pacifica although kind of simple in the mind,...did show some intelligence in her own way. You had to explain in simple words for her to comprehend things. She encounters many people who come to realise that although she is the poison that will end the world, she is still just a girl that doesn’t want to do that.I really liked this anime. The characters have depth to them and I love the interaction between them and although Pacifica isn’t a blood sibling, Shannon and Racquel don’t care. They accept her and will do anything to keep her safe. It did sadden me that in the last episodes Furet the one that helped her during her memory loss had died and when her memory returned she didn’t remember him. They fit so well together. This is an anime worth watching. did show some intelligence in her own way. You had to explain in simple words for her to comprehend things.

They have a unique feeling between older shows and what more common style (including how the animation is handled) we will get to see with late 2000s and the start of 2010s seasonal anime.Here and there it\'s sprinkled with quite well animated sakuga moments, but...overall it\'s pretty average.The same can be said about the design of the characters. I really love some of them while others are... just strange. Not bad, strange. I will never get why a commoner nobody like Winia has such a complex jacket, but whatever.The OST were quite effective but I wouldn\'t call them remarkable. They do their job very well as background for the scenes on screen. Don\'t get me wrong, this isn\'t a bad thing, it\'s totally fine.The same can\'t be said about the OP and the ED. I really enjoy those two.Story:Well, without going into spoilers, Scrapped Princess definitely looks as what will be a fantasy+SF twist adventure with an high focus on the character interactions, but after a couple of episodes it becomes clear that no, this isn\'t true. The overall adventure is there if you think about it from a purely technical PoV, but it\'s almost never the focus.All the struggle and narrative tension isn\'t about Pacifica and sibling will see in the next episode, but which character they will meet and what contrast will come out of it. At times it\'s with this character, at times it\'s between the main cast itself, at times it\'s about the drama of being human.Shannon fights and Raquell cast spells, but they are so above anyone else around them that apart from rare exceptions (like, let\'s say, a poison using assassin and supernatural monsters) they are rarely in actual danger.What the story of Scrapped Princess is about isn\'t the next fight or enemy, it\'s about how those troubles affect the lives of these characters, their ideas and ideals, their relationships and their feelings.Overall, it\'s a story about what it means to be human and what\'s important for each of us as individuals.Characters:It\'s hard to speak here without spoilers, but without a doubt Pacifica and Shannon must be seen both as protagonist.Sure, Pacifica has the most lines and she is the focus of the story, but without Shannon PoV much of the tension and ""feels"" are lost.He is simply the hero of his own story, and the series could have 100% worked by focusing on him as well.Beyond them, I don\'t think that anyone is a negative, quite the episode.All are humans, with their flaws and strengths, their doubts and decisions to make. The series don\'t spend too much time on most of them (Seriously, Seness is the only flaw here. She deserved way more screentime. She still gets the best gag of the show, so i\'m fine) in favour of the main cast but.... eh, it\'s still effective.The idea that these are people with their own minds and feelings come across quite clearly.After all, in real life, rarely people say all they think and feel, body language and actions speak a lot on their own. And of course, animated characters on a screen aren\'t as realistic as people when they do so, but there is a reason why there are so many still cuts with characters changing expressions.Overall, I had a good time, even if this series carries an unbreakable feeling of melancholy for me. It\'s strange to say about a series which definitely tries to have a light tone for like 50% of its time, but the other 50% is very oppressive. overall it\'s pretty average.The same can be said about the design of the characters.

Good characters, interesting plot, some philosophical points, some romance, drama, action, you name it! All well thought out and well executed.Even I can't dislike this show. "", ""This is one of the best non-isekai fantasy anime I've ever watched to far.Story 9/10One of the biggest problems I've noticed with 24 episode retro anime's is that the story sometimes feels like it drags on for too long due to an abundance of filler episodes. This is not the case with Scrapped Princess. The entirety of the show has no fillers and it leads up to a complete ending. Plus, the more you watch it, the more gripping the story becomes and I never at any time felt like I was losing interest. There are some minor questions I had that went unanswered,...but for the most part the story was consistent.Art 9/10The art and animations fit in perfectly with what you expect from early 2000's anime, but it's also ahead of it's time. I find the art and animations to very similar to Mushoku Tensei's.Sound 7/10The sound quality is exactly what you expect from a retro anime.Character 9/10Scrapped Princess does a great job in making you invested in the characters.

Even you're not a fan of retro anime's this is a must watch for fans of the fantasy genre."", 'I enjoyed the premise of the show, three people standing against their societal power structures for the love of their family. It was sloppy in execution.Episodes 1 through 10 is where I thought the show was at its best; traveling on the road to a destination with enemy of the day scenarios that set up an overarching villain, where the enemies posed a threat but they weren\'t overwhelming to the main characters (mainly Shannon) like the Peacemakers would end up being. Shannon and Pacifica\'s characterization is the best here because at this point their attention wasn\'t solely focused on a singular issue/threat like in...episodes 11 through 15. We saw the gentler parts of Shannon\'s personality here that we don\'t get for quite a bit of the rest of the show, & these first 10 episodes in my opinion help carry your interest in this character for the remaining 14 episodes.Episodes 11 through 15,  I think the storytelling takes a nosedive. The character of Seness Giat is introduced, she\'s perpetually angry that Pacifica isn\'t using her power in a way that Seness wants her to, and she\'s willing to drop Shannon on a dime as soon as he\'s not immediately useful to her, even though she wants Shannon on her side for his power. (Seness only being useful after this for backup in fights.) She infodumps on the group within a few episodes that humanity was locked in a barricaded off section of Earth by their alien foes after the humans lost the Genesis War and Pacifica\'s purpose is to free them. Except the writers don\'t want the main characters to understand this, and have the 3 siblings act dumb to this knowledge. Shannon had already killed a Peacemaker prior to this, but his attitude all but like the last 2 times he and Zefiris work together to kill them, is overwhelmingly negative. Zefiris explains to Shannon that because he doesn\'t trust her, that their fusion won\'t be successful and could have negative side effects to his brain, but they never address that again. They could have explained his pre-transformation anger as that side-effect, but they never address it, let alone as a bad thing. Stress could be a valid reason for his reaction, but they never choose to address it to give that as a reason. Throughout the show they bring up him not trusting her a few more times, and that it could be related to her using him to complete her mission so he feels like a pawn to her, but they never have a discussion about that or his trust issues. He only gets over his trust issues because she submits to his will. Why? They never give her thought process, they only show her uncomfortable when Natalie makes the siblings upset. But as to why she puts what Shannon wants over what she thinks is her mission is unclear.Episodes 16 through 24... I\'m not exactly sure why people praise Pacifica getting amnesia as a smart writing choice, it only serves to kill time at the capital. Fulle is introduced but he\'s just Shannon with no personality, in my opinion. Shannon has the time to reconnect with Cz, but because it doesn\'t go anywhere; he makes no headway with Cz, doesn\'t learn anything meaningful from her, and doesn\'t convince her to come over to their side. He just walks around the city looking for Pacifica and moping around. Pre Pacifica getting captured, I think the most interesting scene is Shannon spending a moment with Fulle\'s dead body, it seemed like the writer\'s were trying to do some sort of parallel between Fulle and Shannon. What exactly they were trying to say alludes me. Pacifica loves the kind of man Shannon is and liked that within Fulle? And Shannon was in a way laying a reflection of himself to rest? Pacifica mistaking Shannon for Fulle in the castle in episode 20 lends itself to this reading.After Pacifica is captured & imprisoned the show gives what I think is the most touching scene of the show with Pacifica being unknowingly reunited with her mother. It seems like her mother knows it\'s her despite Pacifica going by Pamela at the time because Pacifica said she was the Scrapped Princess. I\'ll talk about Shannon\'s conversation with Zefiris after Pacifica gets her memory back further down. I figured from the start Chris would become an ally to Pacifica and it played out here as I expected. The 3 siblings are reunited & Pacifica has to choose herself or potentially the lives of the rest of the kingdom, I\'ll address this further down. Prince Forsyth, I had a feeling would end up harming Pacifica, didn\'t expect an attempted murder suicide- Although it makes sense because his mother was killed by his father, Pacifica was wanted dead by his father & could have destroyed the lives of his citizens for all he knew, and his father didn\'t love him. So it didn\'t seem like he had all that much to live for, and by going down with his sister it could to him feel like a moment of sharing the bond of death?The plot point of the gatekeeper woman that betrayed humanity in the Genesis War to save her siblings makes sense, but I just don\'t get where the ""Guardian Gene"" came from and who created it, because it wasn\'t the gatekeeper woman because she didn\'t want the system destroyed, and it wasn\'t her siblings because they died in the war, so who created it and why did they make it in a way that Pacifica looked like the gatekeeper woman and the Guardians looked like her siblings? And how did it just happen to be the secondary characters they were friends with that they met randomly also had the Guardian Genes? Doesn\'t add up. I\'ll buy Pacifica being brought back to life but... Why did they set her down in Shannon\'s hands naked. The writers forced that situation on Shannon, why? Incest joke not funny.The siblings being reunited was a nice scene, the writers hid quite a bit of Shannon\'s emotions by having him turn away his face or showing just the back of his head. I think those weren\'t good calls, toxic masculinity moves, let him show his emotions to the audience, don\'t you want us to connect with him? But we got to see him cry & I\'m happy for that.The ending wrapped up pretty nicely.(I have nothing bad to say about Raquel, she was prefect the entire time.)So now I wanna go over two themes they brought up in the show but didn\'t go anywhere with.Leopold is a knight who buys into patriarchy & the concept of chivalry, and has a moral code that aligns with the societal system. That code tells him to kill Pacifica, but he doesn\'t agree with doing that and throws the concept of who is right or wrong and the concept of chivalry into question. Despite being on Pacifica\'s side the entire show, he never figures out that the moral code of society is what he should reject in favor of his own reasoning, and ends the show not figuring out what chivalry means to him or if he should just not follow it all together. (Having just finished Revolutionary Girl Utena I wanted him to reject chivalry.)The second theme addresses Pacifica\'s question, is her life worth more than potentially everyone in the kingdom? And Shannon\'s question, how many lives is worth Pacifica\'s life?Pacifica\'s question does at least get a conclusion, she determines her life is worth preserving even if that means everyone in the kingdom could die. But at no point do we get the reasoning behind how she made that decision other than saying she wants to keep living to be with her friends and family.Shannon does a flip and we never get him explaining why he did. Episode 10 Shannon decides to let Grendel get destroyed by the fake Scrap Princess cult. It would get rid of his enemies and could be what saves Pacifica from being killed by the church/government, at the expense of the lives of the citizens who also live there. Shannon is convinced to stop them out of a plea for humanity, but isn\'t necessary convinced he was wrong to want to choose Pacifica\'s life over the people at Grendel. Episode 13 the Peacemakers threaten to kill 1000 people everyday past the grace period of the 3 siblings not returning to Leinwan, but don\'t address the question of who is worth more, only that they might as well go back because what else could they do? Natalie tries to brainwash Shannon into choosing Pacifica over the people, but never say why they should choose the people. After Pacifica gets her memories back, Shannon has to choose between fighting the Peacemakers destroying the capital or going after Pacifica, and he chooses to fight the Peacemakers saying that he won\'t tolerate all the needless deaths, but what was his thought process when choosing the citizens over Pacifica when he\'s always been serious about his oath to protect Pacifica? Episode 23 when Forsyth stabs Pacifica and Shannon has to choose between saving Pacifica\'s life and saving the capital, he chooses the capital, and Pacifica *dies*  because he chooses the capital citizens. What made him decide that thousands of people\'s lives were more important than Pacifica\'s? This question is very interesting for his character, and only he and Pacifica ever get internal monologue, so it was a waste of the writers to never give him time to think about what he prioritizes to the audience.Overall, I give the show a 6. It has some issues but I had a good time bingeing it and I would call myself a fan.(Love my Shannon statue <3) episodes 11 through 15.

There were times when I downright loved the show, such as those moments early on with Pacifica and her siblings.  One such moment was when Pacific, when feeling depressed, went up to Shannon and leaned on him.  The way the scene was shot and executed really sold me on their relationship.  Despite Pacifica always whining and complaining, the way it was played off with her siblings made it feel like they all loved and cared for one another.One segment I particularly enjoyed was Episode 16, where Pacifica loses her memory and gets...taken in by another man was another episode in which I enjoyed a lot.  I wasn't expecting to like it as they had her forget her memories (a plot device I have never been particularly fond of), but her chemistry with Furet was really touching.  Watching them slowly grow closer, to the point that she can't stand being separated from him was fun to watch.  I'm sure I could have watched a 12 episode slice of life built on those characters alone.Shannon was by far my favorite character.  Miki Shinichiro (the voice actor for Shannon) has always been a favorite of mine.  They way he talks just makes me like the character, and I feel I could listen to him talk for hours.  The segment where Shannon becomes really attached to a little girl he finds became one of my favorites in the series.  While he seems lazy and unenergetic, he also usually feels competent and reliable.Aside from Shannon, his dragoon whose name I've forgotten, and Pacifica, nobody got proper development.  Cin's story arc went nowhere, Leo remained useless comic relief, Raquel barely did anything aside from improving Shannon's move sometimes.  It makes me perhaps irrationally mad, since the setting and some of the core ideas present in this story could have made it really good.  Episode one left me in such great hope.  But my lack of investment in any of the characters made almost all of the drama pretty boring.When the story started to get more into the guardian genes, and Peacemakers, was when the show slowly began its decent from potentially a favorite, to something much lower down on my list.  Which is a real shame since I really wanted to love this series.A weak ending brings what might have been an 8 or 9 down to a 6.  It had its moments but I felt very frustrated and upset by its conclusion. taken in by another man was another episode in which I enjoyed a lot.

Which is a real shame since I really wanted to love this series.A weak ending brings what might have been an 8 or 9 down to a 6.  It had its moments but I felt very frustrated and upset by its conclusion."", 'Religion and free will. If you want to contemplate about those topics, here is an anime for you.Now, when I see something tagged mecha, I automatically close the tab. We live in an era, where inter-continental weapons that are able to target specific person/object precisely and AI making fast decision making are in development. The idea of giant robots fighting with swords seems childish and ridiculous to me. However, the tag ""mecha"" on the ""Scrapped Princess"" is quite misleading. Yes, there are fights between people and human-like race using technology, but it hardly seems like robots (or anything mechanical in that sense). It is perfectly...understandable ""God"" to have technology superior to human.Story: 8Meet Pacifica - a princess that everyone in the whole world tries to kill, because of a prophecy. She posses the poison that will destroy the world on her 16th birthday. Except, that she is just an ordinary girl, so why people believe that prophecy? The premise is quite promising attempt to tackle the religion, the humanity and the free will. And this anime does it very well (not perfectly, though). There are two problems with that story. First, unless forced, all the people in this world have a free will (the God must specifically overrides it). As a result the free will threat seems quite negligible. Second, I find that people will not be wiling to accept God that finds killing 90% of the human population acceptable ""reset"". The problem with humanity is that a single person\'s idea could be more important that 90% (i.e. quality over quantity). I do not believe that human species are able to extinguish themselves even in a nuclear war, so I find it hard to believe that God had any good reasoning in this anime.Putting personal preferences aside, I almost dropped this anime due to its really weak first episode. The first episode I consider boring (I would give it 1). I was able to bore myself through the first 3 episodes, only to discover that this anime will actually make some sense. The story becomes more consistent later on, as more of it is reveled to the viewer, and more and more ties are connected. The first episodes feels like just fooling around without any particular story other than the premise.While the ending was quite useful to understand how the world ended this way, it completely invalidated the whole story of keeping Pacifica alive. If ""God"" was not so bad after all, that it can possibly regret her (yes, it was a woman) decision, then she did not need to wait the main character to grow strong enough to have the power to destroy her, before acknowledging her mistake.Art: 6The art of this anime feels like 1996-1999 while it is from 2003. It is not bad, but they could have done it better. However, it is good enough to not interfere with the story.Sound: 5I listened to OP and ED once then skipped them. They do not set the mood properly. Also note that in the middle of each episode there is a pause usually designated for TV ads pause. The music break during that pause really destroys any drama built up. Background music is good enough to not notice it (I am actually not sure if there was background music, but I never noticed any silence).Characters: 6I vote 6 (fair) since not only the characters are unique, but they are also developed, allowing me to change my favorite several times through the show. With that said, the characters raise to 6 (fair) only because of the story. The setup of the ""Scrapped Princess"" is in ""Middle Ages""-like world, but by our calendar it would be around year 7000. As the ""ancient"" futuristic human technology clashes with God\'s technology on the top of people using swords and axes, you can clearly see why characters feel ""weak"". For example, the burden Pacifica feels while making decision that could possibly decide the fate of the world feels like pathetically prolonged. But think about how a middle aged girl would feel about if you give her the controls codes of the nuclear-armed ballistic missiles? Such decision could overwhelm even a modern-time person, but it could drive a middle-aged person crazy. Using this premise, I could turn a blind eye to most of the characters reactions and decisions, that would otherwise irritate me.I find Pacifica quite unique character. On the surface, she is presented like combination of typical moe and typical tsundere (note, those are usually opposite). However, the long term consequence of her interaction with the other main and side characters, really reveals why she is named ""poison"". The ""free will"" is not physical being or energy that jumps from person to person. It is human interaction, and spreading it is very well portrayed.On the other end of characters sits Prince Forsis. Before the ending he was the most useless character introduced ever. The scenes shown with him are quite insufficient to begin to like him or dislike him. But I suppose his was useful being useless and pathetic. Every other character had certain role, the king represented the fear and weak-mind. His military general represented the human over-ambition. Overall, all supporting human characters represented a small part of the human emotions.Enjoyment: 7Now, I just watched the whole show at once. It start as something boring, but approaching big topics with sufficient amount of drama and adventure, I could not help myself. However, I do not consider it worthy for re-watch. Part of what shrank my enjoyment is the ending. It felt as overly forced swings between sad and happy ending.Overall: 7Overall, I would consider this anime underrated. The topic it presents and the way it tackles with them is far superior than the most recent anime or any other attempting something on ""global"" scale. While I can name some anime that attempt some pretentious topic as well, but their genre is quite different. If anime is original and good enough in order to be hard to compare to other anime in the same genre, then I suppose it is good enough to watch and enjoy it. understandable ""God"" to have technology superior to human.Story: 8Meet Pacifica - a princess that everyone in the whole world tries to kill, because of a prophecy.

In this short review, I will be mentioning some minor spoilers though it's necessary for some of my points to get across. I will try my best to not spoil too much of what goes on.You felt a real deep connection with Shannon/Raquel, for wanting to protect their younger step-sister (Pacifia)  at any cost. The comedy between Shannon/Pacifia was really entertaining and it was effective in making you care for their relationship when things got tough. In fact,...I would say the interactions with the side characters were really good. At times, it could feel like Pacifia can be annoying with her perspective but when you factor her position, you kind of realize that it's understandable. Shannon was definitely the MVP of the show, always making an impact wherever he went.  There were definitely some moments in Scrapped Princess that had you felt like tearing up because of how emotional they were.Now, I am going to discuss some of the things that I didn't  really like that much. The second half of Scrapped Princess felt sort of dragged out. Pacifia losing her memory and living a portion of her life with some guy she found on the streets was weird. What's even weirder is how the guy looks just like her step-brother. Everything about this guy was pretty much an exact replica of Shannon with the real exception being their profession. I believe this whole thing took way too long to get resolved. Another thing that was somewhat disappointing was how some of the Peacemakers (the bad guys) were dealt with. Some of the Peacemakers gave lots of trouble for everyone but then a split second later they got defeated.I'd say the positives for sure outweigh the negatives for Scrapped Princess. Check it out!

Check it out!"", 'Scrapped PrincessAn anime that actually has almost everything, a subtle plot, mostly sympathetic main characters, satisfying dialogues, and a subtle adventure setting.Even if I\'m mostly negative here, I have to say that the anime still entertained me, it was pleasant for in between, but still nothing.Although there is so much there and the expectation was high at the beginning, the anime could hardly think of anything. Not only was the implementation to blame, but the ridiculously slow pacing. The anime could have ended with 20-21 episodes with ease, if not all the scenes that consisted of 4 dialogues were stretched to 3 minutes, while the...characters per scene simply stared at each other for 10 seconds without saying anything. And if they said anything else, they repeated themselves or stared at the floor.[Story 4]And then we had the story, the ""prophecy"" about the ""Princess of Destruction"" - the concept was nice, it was interesting. I feel typical elements critical of society, manipulation of the media, corrupt politics, the church that abuses its power, the full program. The best thing about it, however, was to see how the protagonists had to find their way in this one-sided world and how the connection of the people around the protagonist ""Pacifica"" later slipped into the subject, which I hadn\'t expected at all. Even if it was a minor plot twist, I found it far more interesting than the actual turn of the story, as it had a lot less foreshadowing.Unfortunately, the story developed sluggishly until episode 12, but it still had some charm. From then on, too much emphasis was placed on irrelevant disputes, which dragged the plot out completely. Not only that, from there the pacing stopped completely. Episode 20-24 dragged on for a long time, although this was supposed to be the finale. Almost nothing happened in the period up to episode 24.Unfortunately, the whole thing is made worse by the lack of detail and explanations regarding the main plot around the prophecy. Too much detail about the past, motivations, and concept of it has been readout. One understood why the title of the protagonist came about and why she was hunted, but not enough about the consequences.The only thing the anime was really surprised about was how spontaneous and quick some character deaths have been. Quite a merciless level without much drama, done realistically.[Characters 5]They had personable personalities, both siblings and Pacifica. You didn\'t get much insight into her personality, as the focus was almost exclusively on Pacifica. That didn\'t change that much about the fact that the scenes with them were very pleasant.But that\'s about it, an attempt was made to give several characters a role that develops in the course of the story. Unfortunately, almost nothing was made of it until the end. The structure of the twists was weak and irrelevant. To be honest, you would only have had to rewrite the plot minimally in the end and then all the team formations would not have been necessary, they had practically no relevance to the final fight.The supporting characters were also not sympathetic, they were below average.On the other hand, I have to say positively that I liked the ""Peacemaker"", they had charisma despite their role in the story.[Animation 5]Yes, a 5, and I\'m immensely skeptical about that. Some effort was made between the fights of the protagonists and the peacemakers, where the choreography and animations were pushed nicely. Apart from that, the backgrounds fluctuated between pleasant and bad. What was worst was the animations in episodes 14-16 and the proportions of most of the women. I have never seen torsos and clothes animated in such a questionable way. As if nobody had any idea about it. Sure their skin-tight sets are weird, but this is no excuse for that. I don\'t even want to start talking about the faces and the eyes as soon as the characters are slightly in the background.[Music 4]The intro is disastrous, the music is average, but the visuals hit me in the heart. As if someone had edited it with a low-budget video editor and added cheap movable borders afterward, just so that the characters don\'t just stare at the clouds. Even if the last 4-5 seconds of the intro almost have meme material. Almost reminded me of the intro of F-R-I-E-N-D-SThe Osts were mostly average, apart from the ""Dragoon Transformation Theme"" which even had a slight Marvel characteristic.Otherwise, the biggest problem here was that half of the east were terribly placed.I had the feeling that they randomly selected where to insert which osts regardless of the atmosphere and scene.ConclusionOn the one hand, I think the anime is too good to be passed as ""below average"", but on the one hand, it had too many negative qualities, especially on the part of the adaptation. I\'ll leave it at 5/10, although a 4.5 / 10 is probably more appropriate.Anyway, the anime isn\'t a disaster, it may be difficult for some others to watch. Had he possibly got a solid anime adaptation like ""Demon Slayer"" of the present era, he would have been far better received. Because the plot was at least average and the process aroused interest. Unfortunately, almost everything failed in the studio\'s work.[Enjoyment 6 ] characters per scene simply stared at each other for 10 seconds without saying anything.

The story surely starts a little slow but when it get going it really shines then. The plot actually surprised me and even in those episodes where I felt the story was a bit too slow I never got bored of the antics of our main characters. The comedy and the interactions between the characters are surely one of the brightest spots of this anime.This show surely deserves more attention that it had gotten over the years. Definitely a hidden gem. Would have liked a bit more if...they elaborated more about the alien race and why the peacemakers were not able to kill Pacifica by their own hands. Minor nit-pickings aside it deserves a solid 8/10. they elaborated more about the alien race and why the peacemakers were not able to kill Pacifica by their own hands. Minor nit-pickings aside it deserves a solid 8/10.', ""So let's go to the review of this anime, but first I have to point out one thing that will base my comment further on, the anime is aimed at the shounen audience, that being said, let's go to my analysis.The first episode of this anime was crucial to make me keep watching and motivated me to move on, the reason for this is that although we have a story turning between a female character we would have a romantic couple for her that would be her foster brother Shannon, during 15 episodes of the anime we saw how the characters' relationships are and we...realized that between Pacifica and Shannon a certain attraction that goes beyond the sibling relationship, this is passed on to us several times but after episode 15 the author decided to introduce an element romantic for Pacifica, and how did he do it? Making a character copy Shannon and to give veracity to it he left Pacifica without memories, it is clear that Pacifica only feels something for Fulle because he was similar to her brother, nothing more, this approach was totally unconscious on her part, this made me feel a little hate for the plot that was being created because before that came several problems that outside the forced romance, impacted the plot, such as Pacifica's biological mother instead of knowing the name her adoptive parents gave to her, kept referring to her as the name that Fulle gave her, this is something to make anyone angry as the name is important to a person, as the queen herself puts it, and Pacifica's adoptive parents gave it that name for her because it had a meaning and the anime with that narrative put episode 15 completely destroyed it, that apart from the fact that Pacifica rejects her name in this moment of madness, and to complete all this when I was happy for Fu lle has simply died Pacifica's memory while she was out of memory, is erased when her memories come back, leading her instead to overcome and understand that she sympathized with Fulle because of her brother, led her to carry a piece of him with her, which is the bathroom sign.Another bad point involving Romance is that at the end of the last episode, when Leo decides to confess to Pacifica one last time, and we were hoping she would dump him so the two of them can move on, seeing as Pacifica never showed. a romantic interest in Leo, she gives him a lid and the camera shows her blushing, saying that in the future something might happen, this pissing me off once again, as it was clear in 70%+ of the anime that Pacifica liked Shannon.Now that the part that I mentioned above that this anime is aimed at the shounen audience comes in, why put the heroine liking 3 guys? (Shannon, Fullle and Leo), and clearly the character that is for the (male) audience to identify is Shannon.I think another problem that the series has is the Peacemakers, I even understand the first one was easily eliminated, he had already fulfilled his role, causing chaos more than once and revealing that the Peacemakers existed but the other 3 were simply killed , without any depth, without any weight, Steyr who had all the background of someone who manipulated humans to do what she planned was simply killed, had no final sentence, she who could have been considered the final boss, had a death very fast, she even had a quarrel with Senes but that was all left aside, it was preferable that Socom had died in her place, since he was of lesser importance than the first Peacemaker, he was spared precisely to die the same in the end to her, with the same trick by the same secondary characters, and what about Cz, who looked like she was going to change sides and at least die trying to help Shannon beat the other Peacemaker, but the author or director of decided to kill her out of nowhere, in a very big rush, she didn't even have the redemption that was being built from the moment she started following Shannon.Now in general I felt that the characters were left with their depths open, pacifica didn't necessarily evolve her personality, she remained a quarrelsome girl, but that's because of what I mentioned above about the romance part, Raquel was never developed in nothing but also not a bad character, her personality was like a mother, so she calmed the heart but never had a development in anything, apart from the part that Pacifica dies but it's something tiny, Shannon has a problem, although he is a very good character, I think his powers were nerfed, in fact the two Casull blood brothers never really showed their skills, Raquel only shined in defense, there were many moments where she could use a destructive ability and annihilate armies but never did , and Shannon seemed to have an incomparable sword skill but also never made use of it save and a few moments, not to mention the dragon power, which when it was incomplete defeated a Peacemaker but then even with full strength could only defeat Cz because she let .All the other characters in the series have a good personality, but none of them were properly fleshed out, although in my opinion that wouldn't be a bad thing if the main characters had been fleshed out and their decisions followed correctly with what the series showed at the beginning in the case of pacifica.I think to be fair, there were select characters that had some development, being Christopher who learned not to follow orders and think for himself, although his problem at the beginning of the anime was others but you can say it was remedied when he got a mother even if adoptive, Winia her depth is all focused on her love for Christopher and for his friendship with Pacifica, although these two points were a little forced, Elfitine that even though she seemed very little to me, she had the most coherent development seen that she blindly believed in a guy and then she went on to run her village alone, and it's only those characters that deserve some errata.Now that I've commented on the worst of the series in my opinion I'll comment on the rest, honestly I didn't find the ending, apart from what I commented previously bad, about Pacifica and her brother Forsis being cured it's completely plausible that Celia cured them. before leaving, about the aliens not having decimated the human race or not coming back to lock them back in their cocoon, makes sense, seeing as Celia who was the one who kept it for as long as decided to free them soon the aliens must have understood and even so, it would take some time for humanity to be able to do everything it did 5000 years in the past, even having some devices from the past, I know it looks like I'm passing cloth but the anime never proposed to explain or show the aliens , this was never important, just to imagine that in the future there can be peace or war, they simply left it in the hands of humans to choose their future, and that would not compete with the history of Pacifica, since the her story ended there.Quickly commenting on my favorite characters from the work.Starting with the male first is Shannon, he is the main one and has a very good personality and lastly I would put Christopher, who during the entire anime even not being on Pacifica's side was doing what he thought was right and during this whole time even though I didn't know I was helping her, she's a good character.The females I think there is no way in the first place is Swin, she was a very charismatic little girl, I don't necessarily feel very sad when she left but her personality was very good, secondly I put Zephiris to understand her side of the anime and she is even cute taking everything into consideration, she even blushes at the protagonist near the end when he finally decides to trust her because she first trusts him, then he responds with reciprocity, in third I put Raquel, who although I like her personality she didn't have any development as noted above, and fourth we have our protagonist Pacifica, who I don't hate but before my displeasure as I explained above her decisions were questionable and she hasn't matured.For me the anime was constant from start to finish, it kept me entertained, with its episodes passing fast but nothing that made me jump out of my chair, it had its problems as I commented, so my rating from start to finish is 7/10 . realized that between Pacifica and Shannon a certain attraction that goes beyond the sibling relationship, this is passed on to us several times but after episode 15 the author decided to introduce an element romantic for Pacifica, and how did he do it? Making a character copy Shannon and to give veracity to it he left Pacifica without memories, it is clear that Pacifica only feels something for Fulle because he was similar to her brother, nothing more, this approach was totally unconscious on her part, this made me feel a little hate for the plot that was being created because before that came several problems that outside the forced romance, impacted the plot, such as Pacifica's biological mother instead of knowing the name her adoptive parents gave to her, kept referring to her as the name that Fulle gave her, this is something to make anyone angry as the name is important to a person, as the queen herself puts it, and Pacifica's adoptive parents gave it that name for her because it had a meaning and the anime with that narrative put episode 15 completely destroyed it, that apart from the fact that Pacifica rejects her name in this moment of madness, and to complete all this when I was happy for Fu lle has simply died Pacifica's memory while she was out of memory, is erased when her memories come back, leading her instead to overcome and understand that she sympathized with Fulle because of her brother, led her to carry a piece of him with her, which is the bathroom sign.Another bad point involving Romance is that at the end of the last episode, when Leo decides to confess to Pacifica one last time, and we were hoping she would dump him so the two of them can move on, seeing as Pacifica never showed. a romantic interest in Leo, she gives him a lid and the camera shows her blushing, saying that in the future something might happen, this pissing me off once again, as it was clear in 70%+ of the anime that Pacifica liked Shannon.Now that the part that I mentioned above that this anime is aimed at the shounen audience comes in, why put the heroine liking 3 guys?

any weight, Steyr who had all the background of someone who manipulated humans to do what she planned was simply killed, had no final sentence, she who could have been considered the final boss, had a death very fast, she even had a quarrel with Senes but that was all left aside, it was preferable that Socom had died in her place, since he was of lesser importance than the first Peacemaker, he was spared precisely to die the same in the end to her, with the same trick by the same secondary characters, and what about Cz, who looked like she was going to change sides and at least die trying to help Shannon beat the other Peacemaker, but the author or director of decided to kill her out of nowhere, in a very big rush, she didn't even have the redemption that was being built from the moment she started following Shannon.Now in general I felt that the characters were left with their depths open, pacifica didn't necessarily evolve her personality, she remained a quarrelsome girl, but that's because of what I mentioned above about the romance part, Raquel was never developed in nothing but also not a bad character, her personality was like a mother, so she calmed the heart but never had a development in anything, apart from the part that Pacifica dies but it's something tiny, Shannon has a problem, although he is a very good character, I think his powers were nerfed, in fact the two Casull blood brothers never really showed their skills, Raquel only shined in defense, there were many moments where she could use a destructive ability and annihilate armies but never did , and Shannon seemed to have an incomparable sword skill but also never made use of it save and a few moments, not to mention the dragon power, which when it was incomplete defeated a Peacemaker but then even with full strength could only defeat Cz because she let .All the other characters in the series have a good personality, but none of them were properly fleshed out, although in my opinion that wouldn't be a bad thing if the main characters had been fleshed out and their decisions followed correctly with what the series showed at the beginning in the case of pacifica.I think to be fair, there were select characters that had some development, being Christopher who learned not to follow orders and think for himself, although his problem at the beginning of the anime was others but you can say it was remedied when he got a mother even if adoptive, Winia her depth is all focused on her love for Christopher and for his friendship with Pacifica, although these two points were a little forced, Elfitine that even though she seemed very little to me, she had the most coherent development seen that she blindly believed in a guy and then she went on to run her village alone, and it's only those characters that deserve some errata.Now that I've commented on the worst of the series in my opinion I'll comment on the rest, honestly I didn't find the ending, apart from what I commented previously bad, about Pacifica and her brother Forsis being cured it's completely plausible that Celia cured them. before leaving, about the aliens not having decimated the human race or not coming back to lock them back in their cocoon, makes sense, seeing as Celia who was the one who kept it for as long as decided to free them soon the aliens must have understood and even so, it would take some time for humanity to be able to do everything it did 5000 years in the past, even having some devices from the past, I know it looks like I'm passing cloth but the anime never proposed to explain or show the aliens , this was never important, just to imagine that in the future there can be peace or war, they simply left it in the hands of humans to choose their future, and that would not compete with the history of Pacifica, since the her story ended there.Quickly commenting on my favorite characters from the work.Starting with the male first is Shannon, he is the main one and has a very good personality and lastly I would put Christopher, who during the entire anime even not being on Pacifica's side was doing what he thought was right and during this whole time even though I didn't know I was helping her, she's a good character.The females I think there is no way in the first place is Swin, she was a very charismatic little girl, I don't necessarily feel very sad when she left but her personality was very good, secondly I put Zephiris to understand her side of the anime and she is even cute taking everything into consideration, she even blushes at the protagonist near the end when he finally decides to trust her because she first trusts him, then he responds with reciprocity, in third I put Raquel, who although I like her personality she didn't have any development as noted above, and fourth we have our protagonist Pacifica, who I don't hate but before my displeasure as I explained above her decisions were questionable and she hasn't matured.For me the anime was constant from start to finish, it kept me entertained, with its episodes passing fast but nothing that made me jump out of my chair, it had its problems as I commented, so my rating from start to finish is 7/10 ."", 'Scrapped Princess is an exceptional amalgamation of classic fantasy, science fiction, and drama that is not only tried but also accomplished with finesse. The immersive and credible setting adds to the overall charm of the series. The characters are well-crafted, entertaining, and impeccably portrayed. Unlike other shows, where lost technology is merely a tool for the characters to wreak havoc, Scrapped Princess integrates it with the story, making it an essential element of the plot.The world of Scrapped Princess is inundated with classic fantasy tropes such as dragons, magic, and sword fighting. However, what sets it apart is the realization that not everything in this...world is as it seems. The \'gods\' worshipped by the people are named after old gun manufacturers, and the Peacemakers and their names (Cz, Steyr, etc.) are hidden firearm references. Initially, it may seem like there are a lot of vague anachronisms floating around, but as the story progresses, the reason for these peculiar names and references becomes clear. The plot not only avoids becoming trite but also develops into something even more intricate. The setting is reminiscent of some of the well-written Final Fantasy games.The central character of the story is Pacifica Casull, also known as the ""Scrapped Princess."" She is being relentlessly hunted down because of the Prophecy of Grendel, which predicts her to be the cause of destruction. While she struggles to understand her true identity and the reason for the enemy\'s pursuit, she never succumbs to the cliche melodramatic behavior often seen in similar anime. Pacifica is a precocious, energetic, and slightly spoiled young girl who feels guilty about the pain her existence brings to those around her. She is neither angsty nor excessively bratty, which is not an easy balance to maintain, but her seiyuu does a flawless job of bringing out her essence.Fortunately, Pacifica\'s adoptive family, comprising her older brother Shannon and sister Raquel, do a commendable job of keeping her safe. Shannon is a skilled swordsman, trained by their father since childhood, while Raquel is a potent wizard, inheriting her mother\'s magical abilities. The sibling relationship is the driving force behind the show, but the presence of the supporting cast of characters, including Leon, the aspiring knight, Seness, the exiled princess of the neighboring kingdom, and Bergens, the traveling Inquisitor for the church, adds to the overall entertainment value. Each character is a joy to watch, and none of them overstay their welcome.The art in Scrapped Princess is undeniably beautiful, boasting colorful and detailed cityscapes along with attractive character designs. Although, it\'s worth mentioning that the breast sizes of the female characters could have been more varied instead of sticking to a constant C-cup size. Also, fan service is tasteful but kept to a minimum, which is kind of unfortunate for me. The action sequences are executed smoothly, and the magical patterns that appear when spells are cast are a nice touch. However, the animation quality takes a dip when it comes to horses and ships, which appear quite lackluster on screen. Despite these minor shortcomings, Scrapped Princess is a rare gem in the fantasy anime genre that is worth your time and attention. It has a fully realized fantasy world that rivals that of Lodoss War and a cast of fantasy heroes and heroines that are incredibly fun to root for, akin to El Hazard. The incorporation of lost technology into the fantasy setting is also done with great care and believability, much like in Final Fantasy 4. If you\'re a fan of fantasy fiction and are looking for something refreshing, Scrapped Princess should definitely be on your watch list. world is as it seems.

Senryuu Shoujo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38787/Senryuu_Shoujo,"[""Senryuu Girl is about a highschool girl called Nanako that can't arrange her thoughts so she writes in a haiku-style poem. In the literature club, she meets an ex-deliquent Eiji that is a kind soul with a tough appearance.This anime is all about wholesome romance and beautiful art. There is no drama, no emotional plots (so far), it's all about a wholesome, youthful life of a highschool girl.The art for me is exceptional, although some people might not like the art style of the eyes, but to each their own. I find that it adds to the cute and innocent vibe of the whole anime.This...truly is a seasonal gem for me, and I hope this review makes you check it out truly is a seasonal gem for me, and I hope this review makes you check it out"", 'Spring is usually my favorite season every year. It usually consists of heavy hitters of popular franchises as well as new adaptations that generates a great deal of hype. This year though, we have an unusual amount of short series that runs half the length. Unfortunately, most of these shorts fell flat and limited themselves with low expectations. However, there are two shows this season that managed to break that limit. One of them is this curious little thing called Senryuu Shoujo.I love the manga. It recently reached its 100th chapter milestone and being a short length show actually helps make the story flow better....The story premise itself is simple that stars Yukishiro Nanako as the main female protagonist. An easy trait to notice about Nanako is that she doesn’t communicate verbally with others. Instead, she expresses her language in the form of haikyu, a form of poem.What it comes down to it, Senryuu Shoujo manages to captivate me with its charming cast of characters. Nanako’s personality is that of a friendly girl who is very open minded and willing to accept anyone as a friend, including ex-delinquent Eiji. Throughout the series, Eiji is portrayed as a misunderstood person by others because of his intimidating appearance. As members of the Literature Club, we get an inside look at their relationship. There’s many running gags between the two but at the end of the day, it’s shown that they greatly care about each other. Or perhaps it’s more than what it seems. Someone as dense as Eiji doesn’t realize Nanako’s feelings for him. As a slice a life comedy, this anime is filled humorous moments. It never ceases opportunities to poke fun of their relationship. At its very best, we can see their true personalities behind their outer shell.Meanwhile, we do have other characters such as Literature Club president Amane Katagari. A running gag in the show is how she tries to get Eiji and Nanako together for alone time. Similarly, Eiji’s childhood Koto Ootsuki loves to tease the duo whenever she gets the chance. It makes time to always sell humor so the audience remains entertained. This also extends to fortune teller Tao Hankai who is well known for her bizarre personality. I think by the time we are introduced to the majority of the cast, there’s always someone to keep an eye on. The only character I felt underwhelmed would be Kino, another girl who communicates non-verbally. Unlike Nanako, she is too timid and lacks presence. Even when an episode focuses more on her than others, it feels like she’s invisible. I personally think Kino is a poor’s man version of Nanako for being unable to develop character chemistry with the other cast. It’s a shame.At its core, Senryuu Shoujo is an easy going slice of life anime that relies a lot on its character chemistry than storytelling. It doesn’t and shouldn’t take anyone to think about what this anime means with each episode. Come to think of it, the comedy itself often feels very direct with even more characters getting their own moments of fame. This includes Nanako’s father with his own misunderstood fantasies or Eiji’s denseness. There will definitely be an audience who will find this type of humor to be childish and poorly executed. But hey, that’s the ball in your court.This is actually Connect’s first TV short if you don’t count their previous net anime projects. The overall colorful visuals delivers a great look to the series’ themes. I was cautiously optimistic at first after seeing the preview videos but as more episodes aired, the show proved itself to be visual fest. Studio Connect managed to capture the school life setting with a feeling of serenity. In the meantime, character designs are carefully made with care to match the look of the manga. The most noticeable characters are Nanako and Eiji for their very contrasting designs but anyone who lay eyes on them the first time should easily see how well they match their personalities. Character expressions is also an important feature that manages to communicate characters’ feelings. And for any fans who wants to be serviced, there’s moments of that too including the unavoidable swimsuit episode. There’s something here for anyone who is a fan of slice of life.I admit that shorts aren’t really my favorite type of anime. Most often, they suffer from story development based on the amount of content. However, Senryu Shoujo never relies on storytelling to be special. Instead, it has these creative circle of characters that’s here to steal the spotlight. I recommend giving the manga a chance for first time viewers as the anime doesn’t adapt chronically with its flow. But once you start to get into the flow, you’ll want more and more.

In Japan, they utilize sound units known as “on” or morae.  This inconsistency can lead to a number of problems in translation, leading some translators to claim that 12 syllables in English equate to the duration of 17 Japanese “on.”  Nevertheless, the intent is to capture the essence of a moment in time with a short, poetic composition.Due to Nanako’s lack of audible communication (for reasons unknown), she relays her thoughts through haiku.  Naturally,...she joins a 5-7-5 club and develops a crush on a boy named Eiji.  Despite his tough exterior, Eiji displays a gentler side when around Nanako.  Thus, a friendship between the two is established with the possibility of love in the future.  While “Senryuu Shoujo” is a lighthearted show with intermittent moments of comedy, it frequently becomes dull.  The chief reason being the bland, rudimentary characters.  The second reason being the vanilla comedy that has been used umpteen times in other romantic comedies.  And reason number the third…..this anime didn’t accomplish enough to justify a third criticism.The only positive aspect of Senryuu Shoujo is the brief nature of the episodes (12 minute runtime).  So if haiku is a personal passion of yours, and you’ve got 12 minutes to spare, then give it a go.  Otherwise, this anime can be disregarded for something with more character substance and comedic weight. she joins a 5-7-5 club and develops a crush on a boy named Eiji.

But before that,What is a haiku?In what context is it used,And how is it used?...Taking words off fellow reviewer @Krunchyman, haiku is a form of Japanese poetry, characterized by three un-rhymed lines of 5-7-5 syllables. In Japan, they utilize sound units known as “on” or morae, in which when translating into other languages, inconsistencies can lead to a number of problems, leading translators to claim that as a whole, varied words in the sentence of certain syllables in English equate to the duration of 17 Japanese “on.” Nevertheless, the intent is to capture the essence of a moment in time with a short, poetic composition. Thanks for this valuable teaching information and your contribution.In this case, characterization plays the major plotline, of which the main female MC Nanako Yukishiro (voiced by HanaKana) anchors her dialogues which are then written on Tanzaku (yes, those ones used for Japanese festivals), instead of expressing through verbal communication. Together with the Literature Club with 3rd-wheel comedic Prez Amane Katagiri, she develops a crush on the looking-scary ex-delinquent boy by the name of Eiji Busujima (who joins the club before her), and love hijinks ensue. Even down the line as more characters come to fill in their roles in the club:The shy Kino Yakobe who can only draw to verbalize her facial expressions,The fearsome and bold Koto Ootsuki, being Eiji\'s childhood friend and a teaser for the couple, while doting on him a lot,and the devilish Tao Hanakai who is pretty much reminiscent of the fortune teller look with her magic 8-ball,There has to be a way to get these affections through...right?Too many people,But that\'s no problem for them,They are the 3rd-wheel (for Prez Amane who always gets in the way of the duo-couple)!Honestly, if there is anything going for this, it would be both Eiji and Nanako\'s interactions (which sometimes are lost in translation if not done right, especially to the Haikus), their subtle feelings for one another, though with Eiji\'s naiveness, denseness and ""incompatibility"" with Nanako (in terms of speech and obvious feelings) can sometimes be a chore to watch them get ""hooked"". Nonetheless, it makes up for a ton lot of sweet, enamoring moments, and I\'ve gotta say, it was 12 whole mins of goodness.Likewise, both the art/animation and sound departments carry that good ""Love is in the Air"" feels all around.Connect, the studio subsidary of Silver Link, actually has a small line of projects under their belt (most of them co-produced together), but nonetheless has some true talents under their belt, as further evidenced by the gorgeous art and buttery-smooth animation. I believe that shorts like this do not have a huge budget to work with, but the production staff working this series pulled it off nonchalantly, and that is a good thing.The same thing can be said about the short OP and ED. While they sound a tad off from the usual 90 seconds to work with (60 seconds to be exact), it still fits within the confines of the show, and both songs sound melancholic with that sweet fragance of ""Ordinary Love"". Overall, a great job.So what do you think?Is this your SOTS (Short of the Season)?Whatever it is...It\'s a fun watch if you get the whole ""haiku"" cultured thing. Otherwise, there\'s not really much substance, and sure as the people say: ""Quality over quantity"", and if that is the production team\'s goal, they have succeeded.For me, it is good, but not to the calibres of greatness.

Even down the line as more characters come to fill in their roles in the club:The shy Kino Yakobe who can only draw to verbalize her facial expressions,The fearsome and bold Koto Ootsuki, being Eiji\'s childhood friend and a teaser for the couple, while doting on him a lot,and the devilish Tao Hanakai who is pretty much reminiscent of the fortune teller look with her magic 8-ball,There has to be a way to get these affections through...right?Too many people,But that\'s no problem for them,They are the 3rd-wheel (for Prez Amane who always gets in the way of the duo-couple)!Honestly, if there is anything going for this, it would be both Eiji and Nanako\'s interactions (which sometimes are lost in translation if not done right, especially to the Haikus), their subtle feelings for one another, though with Eiji\'s naiveness, denseness and ""incompatibility"" with Nanako (in terms of speech and obvious feelings) can sometimes be a chore to watch them get ""hooked"". Nonetheless, it makes up for a ton lot of sweet, enamoring moments, and I\'ve gotta say, it was 12 whole mins of goodness.Likewise, both the art/animation and sound departments carry that good ""Love is in the Air"" feels all around.Connect, the studio subsidary of Silver Link, actually has a small line of projects under their belt (most of them co-produced together), but nonetheless has some true talents under their belt, as further evidenced by the gorgeous art and buttery-smooth animation. I believe that shorts like this do not have a huge budget to work with, but the production staff working this series pulled it off nonchalantly, and that is a good thing.The same thing can be said about the short OP and ED. While they sound a tad off from the usual 90 seconds to work with (60 seconds to be exact), it still fits within the confines of the show, and both songs sound melancholic with that sweet fragance of ""Ordinary Love"". Overall, a great job.So what do you think?Is this your SOTS (Short of the Season)?Whatever it is...It\'s a fun watch if you get the whole ""haiku"" cultured thing. Otherwise, there\'s not really much substance, and sure as the people say: ""Quality over quantity"", and if that is the production team\'s goal, they have succeeded.For me, it is good, but not to the calibres of greatness.', 'Although this anime is one of the best ""cool down"" shows of the season, with extensive cuteness and wholesomeness, it lacks in too many departments to be considered anything more than average or decent!If you\'re looking for a revolutionary high school scenario with extensive development and a solid story fueled with both dramatic and comedic moments, turn away now! As a very short series with each episode only being half the length of most; this show lacks all of the above. Although the main female character is unique in a way with her haiku form of communication, this anime falls into most wholesome tropes in...high school anime. The plot is almost nowhere to be found to be honest, it\'s ridiculously simple and cliched, revolving around a group of characters that all belong to a club which is the focus for most of the run time. Consider this show almost like a depiction of activities that this said club undergo with minimal connections or progression apart from the relationships between the characters which still don\'t get enough development due to this anime\'s length!The character development in this show is non-existent with most characters literally remaining the same throughout every episode. Each character falls into specific tropes e.g. a cute shy high school girl that everyone will later lewd and a delinquent who actually has a very kind personality and has never really been in a fight. Yes, it\'s familiarity might be good for some people but it honestly bores me a little that there is no creativity with the anime\'s characters. However, I don\'t dislike any of them and combined with the simplistically yet fitting art, it actually makes you not care too much about this lack of character progress and retention as most of the show is eye candy!Honestly, the art is the only thing that I would consider being good, it\'s consistent and well drawn with common but distinguishable designs and backgrounds. In addition to the art, the animation itself isn\'t mind blowing but relatively clean and acceptable for the genre! Moreover, the rest of the production is average to decent with some voice acting or lack of it not being too well done despite a solid soundtrack and two great songs at the start and end of each episode!Honestly, this anime is basic and isn\'t anything special, yet, I enjoy it as a bridge between two better shows this season, thus, I consider it a cool down anime. After an episode of Bungou Stray Dogs, I always look to relieve the intensity of the episode by watching Senryuu Shoujo before I\'m ready to watch Fruits Basket and get emotionally molested by it\'s story and characters.It\'s by no means a bad show but it\'s also not a good one and for that reason, I can\'t award it anything higher than a 6 (and that\'s me being generous as it should honestly be a 5!)Story: 4Art: 6Sound: 7Character: 5Enjoyment: 6Overall: (4+6+7+5+6)/5= 5.6MAL Rating: 6/10 high school anime.

It has a simple premise: an essentially mute, shy waifu (Nanako) is only able to speak through written poems, and the episodes chronicle her time with her hooliganish friend (Eiji). The show is essentially a gentle, wholesome slice-of-life with some good comedy and some cute romantic undertones.The art is cute. It is not ultra-detailed, but I found it charming. There is a funny effect where nobody has a complete mouth when their lips are closed, though it didn't bother me. I think it fits with the show. The characters are drawn very nicely in my opinion, and I...liked the character designs.The sound is great! I can't stop listening to the OP haha. I also really like the voice acting. Nanako's (internal) voice is very moe <3.In addition to Nanako and Eiji, there are several great supporting characters. One is a ... well-endowed and... sensual ... oneesan; another is an shy artist who can only communicate through images (similar to Nanako's poetry); there is their club president, who is something like a hopeless romantic; and then there is a kuudere+tsundere fortune teller. Altogether, they aren't really the classic stereotypes or tropes (not that I usually mind that anyway), and their weird quirks offer ample opportunity for comedy.One thing they didn't really take advantage of enough is the fact that Nanako is mute - one time they made a joke about her interacting silently with her artist friend, but they could have gotten more comedic mileage out of that I think.Categorically:- Moe: high due to Nanako <3- Comedy: good- Drama: none- Action: none- Romance: present (pre-together)- Harem: none- Ecchi: very littleOverall, this is a great show for anyone looking for something low-stress, with a kawaii protag and a little bit of a wholesome romantic atmosphere, along with a cute story meandering along.

Broadly speaking senryuu can also be interpreted as ""haiku"" or rather modern poetry more or less like that.Tells about the life of a cute, cheerful girl named Nanako Yukishiro.  He has flaws in communication, but he has one hobby, which is writing Senryuu, poetry to convey his feelings.  Together with his naughty friend named Eiji Busujima, they enjoy a pleasant school life with just a few words.  Storytelling goes well and is suitable for accompanying your boring daily life.  The comedy and romance elements in this anime are very much felt especially when they spend time together...I\'m sure you will be laughed at by their behavior.Art is not so extraordinary that it can be interpreted as a standard with no special impression.

Eitsss, don\'t think like that the proof is why they brought Kana Hanazawa?  Nanako does not speak, but every time Nanako writes a word on the board, the voice actor will read what Nanako wrote (although in a quiet voice).

The main characters who have a tendency to talk to boys who look like hoodlums are all mixed together as a result, the combination creates a distinctive characteristic.The screening schedule was right on Saturday so I really enjoyed this program properly because after a busy day I was able to let go of fatigue after watching this anime.  Not only were they jokes, sometimes I also got carried away and laughed to myself, especially when I was in the cave scene (I didn\'t explain in detail because I was afraid the readers would be spoiled later).Overall it was good but the thing that stuck on my mind was why main Heroine couldn\'t talk (I already knew if the age of speech was not the title, I don\'t think that this is my joke).

Just like the main character.If you want to analyze what happens, you will get themes of isolation, friendship and not judging a book by the cover, or listening to rumors.Personally, I just wanted to watch this show for the absolute cuteness of the main character and didn't want to think too hard. "", ""Honestly, I really, really, really hate writing scathing reviews. Nonetheless, I also understand that when such reviews are presented as constructively as possible, it would reach the proper ears and eyes and may bring about better anime in the future. Here it goes... Senryuu Shoujo is a whimper of an anime.Looking at the most reviews on MAL, I deduced of which the generally high scores were most likely influenced by the heroine's femininity and not, ironically, her Senryuu-writing journey. The heroine, Yukishiro Nanako, can only communicate with Senryuu writings (poems with 5-7-5 syllables), most likely due to past bullying issues, but soon she finds her...fellow kindred spirit in former yankee Busujima Eiji. Looking at this premise, various interesting scenarios could occur and be followed with rich possibilities. In fact, Nanako could be the elevated version of her predecessors --fellow socially dysfunctional charas-- such as Switch of SKET DANCE saga. Unfortunately, by the time it reached the first half of the series, I finally realized that it was too high of an expectation.Here are just some of the issues. One, the senryuu (the poems) as written by Senryuu Shoujo herself are nevertheless mediocre. She would simply converse but with a small twist of 5-7-5 syllables. There is no artistry, no finesse, and to be horribly ironic, her male interest writes better senyruu (isn't this supposed to be Senryuu Shoujo-- and not Senryuu Shounen?). Two, with such horrendous literary skills, it becomes hard to root for the titular character. Therefore, it is easy to assume that she is basically coping from her past by utilizing such mechanism that is neither attractive or flattering for her character journey. Yes, the series finale manages to unveil some context for the sake of development-- which leads me to Point Number Three: why the hell would you put such important episode as the finale? It is already too late to go back and root for the character (unless you would consider re-watching it but then one would most likely experience the deja vu of how pointless the experience used to be). Finally, there is also the unfortunate supporting characters that are basically the Cupid for the 'lovely couple'. There is a difference between supporting the heroine's strengths and enabling the heroine's weaknesses. This anime does the latter and this could be a very misleading, if not dangerous, message for the friendships in 'real world'.It truly pained my heart to write the above. It truly did. Unfortunately, I felt it had to be written. The audience deserved better. Why? Because once we choose to watch a particular anime, that also means we toss aside the rest. It is very, very, very important to choose wisely.#felixlovesanime fellow kindred spirit in former yankee Busujima Eiji.

However, it\'s worth a shot if you have some extra time and you want a nice rom-com.The first thing that hits you is how pleasantly simple the style of the show is. Both in art and characters, the show makes it easy to get used to the characters by providing simple backstories and letting the...on-screen chemistry take over from there. All of the initial characters work off each other rather nicely The art, however, is a bit of a letdown. I\'m not sure if it was an intentional stylistic decision or just a budget thing, but the show avoids excessive movement whenever possible. As a result, the show can feel a little stiff during a few of the scenes. The music, from what I could tell, was on par with other shows of it\'s genre and the ""com"" in this ""rom-com"" has it\'s share of good moments.Overall, it\'s fine. But there is one thing about it that really makes this show one to watch and support. The main character talks to everyone through poems on paper. Anime-only people might not get what I mean here, but this could be huge that a show like this exists now. I freaking love Komi-san, and now a show with a similar main character, quirk included, exists. We now have a benchmark for which we can try to see the plausibility of a Komi-san anime adaptation, and for that reason I believe this to be an influential show to remember this season. With enough support, we can get more shows like it, including the adaptation that more and more people are starting to ask for. on-screen chemistry take over from there.

Senryu Shoujo\'s...main focus are on the relationship with Nanako and Eiji with the gimmick of Nanako speaking in senryu.

EVERYONE knows that Eiji and Nanako are a thing but to that the constant teasing of Eiji and Nanako\'s relationship though moe, is a typical twice shy relationship.The animation done by Connect can be summed up in one word, moe. The character designs are moe and polished with the typical chibi moments and the background though ok are vibrant. All in all, Connect did a decent job in the animation department.The voice cast was decent as well, but LA WILL give props to Kana Hanazawa as Nanako for having to permanently speak in senryu, but also Sayuri Yahagi as Amane felt like she was having fun as the ""stalkery towards Eiji and Nanako\'s relationship"", somewhat maniac behaviour yet still being grounded at the same time.Senryu Shoujo is your typical anime short with a gimmick and executed decently, not great or anything nor is it horrible even with the gimmick laws and all.

EVERYONE knows that Eiji and Nanako are a thing but to that the constant teasing of Eiji and Nanako\'s relationship though moe, is a typical twice shy relationship.The animation done by Connect can be summed up in one word, moe. The character designs are moe and polished with the typical chibi moments and the background though ok are vibrant. All in all, Connect did a decent job in the animation department.The voice cast was decent as well, but LA WILL give props to Kana Hanazawa as Nanako for having to permanently speak in senryu, but also Sayuri Yahagi as Amane felt like she was having fun as the ""stalkery towards Eiji and Nanako\'s relationship"", somewhat maniac behaviour yet still being grounded at the same time.Senryu Shoujo is your typical anime short with a gimmick and executed decently, not great or anything nor is it horrible even with the gimmick laws and all. Senryu Shoujo DOES have some flaws, well flaw, mainly the will they, won\'t they of Eiji and Nanako. If there was a way LA could sum up Senryu Shoujo, well why not in senryu?Senryu everywhereWill they, wont they is annoyingBut at least it\'s moe', ""One of only 2 animes that I'm watching this season. Yes you heard me right, I'm only watching 2 animes this season(the other being Senko-san). If I were to put it, Senko-san is for the relaxation while Senryuu Shoujo is all about the enjoyment seeing the relationship between Nanako and Eiji blossom.Story: Senryuu Shoujo's story revolves around writing Senryuus, which are unrhymed Japanese verses which is used in poetry and follows our 2 love birds, Nanako and Eiji in their blossoming relationship as the anime progresses. But that's not all. We have Amame, Kino, Koto and Tao who support Nanako in her quest to...win Eiji's love for her through shits and giggles :v. It's a simple story for a somewhat romance anime. What impresses me the most is.... Nanako's innocent smile and personality but that's for the characters category :vRating: 7.4/10Animation: Senryuu Shoujo's animation is quite beautiful especially animation of the sakuras falling from the trees. Again, it's rather simple scenery animation which I do like. In addition, I like the character animation especially their facial animation expressing their emotions.Rating: 7.8/10Music: Senryuu Shoujo's opening is quite lively and cheerful and it revs up the audience to watch the episode. I also have to compliment the anime in one aspect: I love the voice-acting of Kana Hanazawa i.e Nanako's voice actress. She's got such a sweet sounding and comforting voice.Rating: 8.2/10Character: The best scoring category for the anime. I love how they developed the characters from start to finish. Particularly for Eiji's character. We all thought that he was quite rough and is a hooligan at the beginning of the anime but it turns out, he does have a soft side underneath his aggressive behavior. And we can't forget Nanako! She's so pure, innocent, gentle and sweet-looking. She's probably the most fragile girl in an anime that I've seen in quite a while. Yet, she likes Eiji who's a complete opposite of her. Guess opposite poles do attract each other after all. And of course, I have to mention the more prominent side characters, namely Amame and Koto. They're so supportive of Nanako and Eiji having a relationship with each other.Rating: 8.5/10In conclusion, Senryuu Shoujo is an enjoyable anime as a whole. I loved watching Nanako and Eiji's relationship getting closer and closer as the story progressed and I kinda hope to see how it all turns out eventually.Overall rating: 8/10 win Eiji's love for her through shits and giggles :v.

It uses an entire literary genre as the focal point for its story, and not once does it feel contrived or like it's trying to maintain a shit just for sticking out.

Here's why.First off, the characters, literally every single one of them is so cute and innocent that you just feel clean watching the episodes. Nanako herself is as expected, the best thing about this anime. Watching her interact with everyone is always a very pleasant delight due to how innocently she handles her life.Despite the vibe, this anime does manage to be funny. I really liked...most of the comedic moments, although it is to be noted that the recurring gags get boring really quickly. Still, there isn't that many to really drag down the anime as a whole.The art style is also really beautiful and fits the overall vibe of the story. Although, I wish they didn't rely on that much bloom since it's a bit overkill and makes it hard to see the daylight scenes. Still, the faded and pale color scheme works very nicely in relaxing you the viewer as well.Character design is also very good. Every character is adorable and really emphasize how relaxed the overall anime is going to be. Nanako, while pretty cute as well, for some reason keeps her eyes open at full blast in most scenes which kinda creeped me out, but it's almost not even noticeable since she's so cute.I could very easily nitpick at the anime and criticize it's lackluster love story progression or the multiple story lines that this anime doesn't end up exploring, but they are all so minor, that when you're in the mindset that this anime expects you watch it in, they all tend to not really bother you enough to matter.Adding on, the byte sized format of this anime makes it very easy to quickly watch. They can even be watched out of order as is the case with most anime of this format. I'd imagine it would be super easy to make a Season 2 for this, however unlikely that may be.Summing up, this anime is the type that you can easily watch regardless of whether you like it or not, it's format allows you to quickly ascertain that without much time investment. I personally really liked it, and chances are, you might just watch the entire thing even if you didn't like it anyway.I, for one, definitely recommend it. Go give it a watch and who knows?

It’s composed of a series of 12 half length episodes that are primarily centered around humor, though with a good amount of subtle romance as well. As the title suggests the anime involves a lot of senryu, which are poems like haiku in that they follow the 5-7-5 syllable structure. There are deeper differences between senryu and haiku that you can google to learn more about, but from what I could tell the anime didn’t really take...the differences all that seriously so thinking of senryu as haiku is probably fine for the purposes of this anime.The basic premise is that there’s a high school girl named Nanako who only communicates through senryu and who is close friends with a former delinquent named Eiji who, despite not seeming the type to, also loves senryu. Both of them are in the literature club and spend a lot of time just having fun writing and reading senryu. A lot of the humor arises from Nanako having to convey everything through senryu and Eiji coming up with very bizarre senryu. In my experience poetry related humor is pretty rare so I found it quite interesting and amusing. But even beyond the senryu, Nanako and Eiji have pretty great chemistry together which results in lots of amusing situations.There are also a number of other side characters that add some more variety to the humor. There’s the busybody literature club president Amane who is desperate for a boyfriend and seems to lack common sense at times. There’s Eiji’s childhood friend and self proclaimed older sister Koto who seems to love teasing him. There’s the surprisingly energetic artist Kino, who similar to Nanako doesn’t talk, but instead communicates through drawings. There’s the fortune teller Tao who often makes mistakes with fortunetelling and also brings a strange sense of cynicism at times. And then there are a bunch of minor characters like Nanako’s overprotective dad and Eiji’s adorable little sister. In the end, while senryu are certainly a core part of the anime and as a backbone for the humor, there’s a wealth of comedy beyond that that results in the anime being really amusing from beginning to end.What surprised me though was that the romance was really solid too. Nanako is clearly in love with Eiji and isn’t too subtle about it, though Eiji is dense as a brick so he doesn’t notice. Eiji also seems to like Nanako, though he is mostly subtle about it. This isn’t a drama focused anime so there’s nothing overtly serious, intense, or anything like that. However, just watching the chemistry the two have throughout the show with the occasional heartwarming moment was really nice. And all of that builds up to the last episode, which details how they first met, being a spectacularly good way to end things, even if there wasn’t actually any actual relationship development over the course of the series.The art was quite nice and fit the lighthearted tone really well. The animation was also pretty great and felt very fluid. Combined they did a really good job at showing off the various characters. This is a realistic modern anime so of course the character designs were incredibly down to earth but overall still looked really nice. The soundtrack wasn’t particularly memorable but fit well enough. The OP I thought was pretty great in terms of audio and visuals, though to a degree I felt the song was too intense for the show. The ED was also solid with visuals that were mostly just a recap of the episode, but in a way that felt pretty natural and not just cheap. the differences all that seriously so thinking of senryu as haiku is probably fine for the purposes of this anime.The basic premise is that there’s a high school girl named Nanako who only communicates through senryu and who is close friends with a former delinquent named Eiji who, despite not seeming the type to, also loves senryu.

Since it has to be compressed to 90 minutes or so, it was obvious it would not feel as great as the original series, but they still managed to get all important point across. The later minutes of the movie however, had the most alterations and where IMO the most enjoyable ones from the movie.Art: Movies always tend to have a higher animation...value than regular series and its no different here. Shana`s flaming hair and her eyes were absolutely gorgeous to look at and every character was very well drawn and animated, the later fighting scenes were REALLY well drawn...I already mentioned this but Shana in flame haze mode was really stunning, the animation quality matched that of Kyoto's IMO.Sound: Its used most of the original series soundtrack and since I love that soundtrack i did not mind listening it again, they did add some extra movie only onces and they were great to listen too. 9/10 seems about right for this.Character: Like I mentioned before, compressing 6 episodes into 90 minutes takes its toll also on the character development. It was well done but the series does it better (of course).Enjoyment: I really liked this movie mainly because of the final minutes where the biggest changes were made, and its obvious since without them it would have been the same thing as rewatching something you've already seen before.Overall this movie has some superb animation with some solid story and great sound, all fans of Shana should not miss this. value than regular series and its no different here.

To clear up the doubts, the movie IS what happened in the novels, while the episodes made altercations.The first part of the movie is essentially a recap of the first few episodes of Season One.

She appears 2 times. ;p"", ""The best way to describe this movie is as an enhanced recap, its summarises the events of the first Shana novel/ the manga/ the first of arc of the anime with a few extras added here and there.The story of Shana is a beacon of originality in a sea of cliches and genericness that make up the majority of the action genre.  It explores coming to terms with the unimaginable and the value of human life.  This freshness of the plot grabs the viewer's attention and the removal of the somewhat lame love interest in the anime only improves the experience.  The...story moves quickly and is very well paced, the film's eighty seven minute lifespan flies by as a consequence.As expected from Shana, the animation is really top notch, beautiful backgrounds, awesome effects during the fighting scenes and excellent character designs from Noizi Ito.  It'd be nice to see some of the other characters from the series make an appearance (characters who were clearly present at this point in the overall story) but it cant be helped due to the restrictions of the movie format and in fairness the characters are who are present, are done so majestically.  It's also good to see the movie having superior animation to the TV series, unlike other movie adaptations such as Azumanga Daioh and Clannad.The audio experience is also of the highest quality, as to be be expected of Shana, with none other than Ko Otani (provider of the music for the Shadow of the Colossus videogame) providing the musical score here, the music is dramatic and really helps to build up an atmosphere.  The use of the insert song &quot;Akai Namida&quot; (performed by Mami Kawada) is a masterstroke and it really lets the viewer sypathize with the situation.  The ending theme &quot;Tenjou wo Kakeru Monotachi&quot; by Love Planet Five showcases the talents of the members of I've Sound who are so often providing for the Shana franchise.  It's a real treat as the credits roll.  Voice acting is very solid, each character retains their seiyuu from the anime, giving the same high quality delivery of lines.The characters in the movie are something of a double edged sword, the mains Shana and Yuji remain pretty much the same as their anime incarnations, not a bad thing at all.  Friagne gets a LOT added to his character, he's represented as a genuine threat rather than an eccentric who is soon overshadowed and forgotton due to other villains.  His character is really fleshed out and he's a lot more likeable as a character than his incarnation in the anime series.  Unfortunately some of the other characters are completely unnecessary, Yoshida Kazumi and Margery Daw in particular, the movie format doesnt allow Kazumi's storyline to develop and Margery comes across a lot weaker than she is in the anime, plus her personality has been changed somewhat.Nevertheless, this a very enjoyable movie, the unique concept of the plot keeps viewer interest then treats them to some awe-inspring fight scenes, with a particularly impressive final battle.  Certainly one of the better recap films out there, though it is adviseable you try and watch it before checking out the anime/managa/novel because prior knowledge makes it a tad predictable. story moves quickly and is very well paced, the film's eighty seven minute lifespan flies by as a consequence.As expected from Shana, the animation is really top notch, beautiful backgrounds, awesome effects during the fighting scenes and excellent character designs from Noizi Ito.

I didn't get any opportunity to see it until after I'd already read the first light novel (which the movie takes much of its story from), read the first manga volume and seen all of the first season (and most of the second) of the TV series. So I'm afraid my opinion of the movie was shaped just as much by these things as it was by...the movie itself, and in some ways this doesn't really work in the movie's favor. I'll explain below.Let's begin with the negatives. I read somewhere (I don't remember where, but it might have been LJ) that someone felt that the movie does a much better job telling the story than the TV series. I very strongly disagree with this. The advantage of the TV series was that it had a full season of episodes to tell the story and it was able to move at a comfortable pace, giving us explanations at a satisfactory rate and developing the characters smoothly and nicely. The movie is only 86 minutes. The filmmakers barely gave themselves time to even tell a story (come on; 86 minutes ISN'T that much time), and consequently the movie, especially the first half, feels enormously rushed. We're whisked right through the opening scenes, barely given a sufficient explanation for what was going on (even the manga did a better job of this, and the manga is inferior to both the light novel and the TV series) and hardly given the amount or depth of character development the TV series allowed. If I had seen the movie before the TV series and before having read the light novel or the manga, I would have been somewhat puzzled. The fast pace and hurried explanations wouldn't have allowed me the understanding that I got from the TV series or the light novel. Streaking right through the plot is not an effective way to tell a story.Secondly, the filmmakers tried to cram too much in there, which resulted in there not being enough. Sound contradictory? It might not once I elucidate: we're given Yuji's story, Hirai's story, Kazumi's story, Shana's story, Friagne and Marian's story and a bit of Ike's and Margery's story (more on Margery below) and, again, that 86 minute mark proves too little to effectively accommodate them all. We get enough for Yuji and Hirai, and BARELY enough for Shana, but not for any of the others. We really don't even get enough time for Shana's growing attachment to Yuji to make much sense, and we wonder why she really starts to care about him at all. In the TV series it's obvious why, but here it really isn't. Kazumi's story is especially disappointing because, after such a promising start, her story is abandoned halfway through the movie, and we don't even see her again. It's left on a low note, with her essentially giving up what she wanted to do, and that's what we take with us. With this being the case, it would have been just as well to leave her out of the movie altogether (or greatly reduce her role, with no specific plot line focused on her), since in the end she contributes nothing significant to the story.I also had a problem with Wilhelmina's gratuitous cameos. I know why they were done, but it was too glaring (I mean that in more than one sense, too, for every time she appeared on screen, she'd turn and glare at the camera). They should have limited her to ONE cameo, and they should have kept her from looking towards us. Such a far less self-conscious cameo would have been much more of a treat than what we got. When she appeared again, doing just as she did before, I actually rolled my eyes. If I roll my eyes during a movie, this is a bad sign.Now then: Margery Daw. WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING HERE? Yeah, yeah, I get it; she's here for the same reason Wilhelmina is: giving the fans what they want. But you know, when giving the fans what they want is detrimental to the story, it's a bad idea. Now, I have nothing against Margery as a character; she's fun to watch in the TV series, and Marcosius is always good for a laugh, but in the movie she's barely given any real significance in the grand scheme of things, and no real development. She participates in every battle once she shows up, and her participation does no good at all. She is, in a nutshell, in the movie to be in the movie. Margery and Marco weren't even in the first light novel at all, and when they were placed in the movie, Margery essentially got one of Shana's actions from the book, then stuck around like the fifth wheel that she was for the rest of the time, and making a largely unceremonious exit at the end. Margery and Marco were an intrusion. THEY DO NOT BELONG HERE.I have one other gripe I want to address, because this very nearly ruined the film's climax for me. Let me get to it by explaining something. Alastor, Flame of Heaven, is a King of Guze, and exists in this world by inhabiting the body of Shana, his contractor. He speaks through the pendant she wears around her neck. In the TV series we never actually see what Alastor looks like; the one time Shana mentions summoning him, he's summoned but we don't get to see him. That was effective because it upheld the mystery of his character. In the light novel, when he is summoned during the climax, he is never really described, and we are left to imagine his appearance for ourselves. This, too, is effective. In the movie, however, we see Alastor's true form. Without revealing what he looks like, let me just say I was sorely disappointed. I know what the filmmakers were attempting to do, but they didn't quite get there. Instead of seeing a form majestic and kingly, we see something that looks evil and, worse, rather uninspired. Since Alastor is, really, a force for good since he fights to maintain the world's balance, giving him an evil appearance is far from suitable, even if the intent was install a bit of irony. Irony isn't ALWAYS effective, folks. It sure wasn't here. The better thing to do would have been to use a different, more awe-inspiring design, or to have kept him obscured in the flames so that we never truly got a good look at him. When I saw the design they chose for him, I groaned. Yes, I groaned. I couldn't believe it. (Yeah, I know; how many movies have I made, right? Well, I bet I could make a pretty good movie if you could lend me some money; I only need about $49 million. I'll pay you back if the movie is a hit, and I'll credit you as a producer, too. What do you say?)Now, after having said all of this, you may be wondering how I could have said I like this movie. Well, now that I got the negatives out of the way, let's get to the positives.First, the movie wisely chooses to stick to the story of the first light novel, and during the second half of the movie especially, does a fairly good job retelling it. Like I said, Margery gets in the way, and Kazumi's story is abandoned, but the plot is not too drastically changed. It's rushed, yes, and the filmmakers should have allowed themselves an extra twenty minutes to flesh things out a bit more, but the story is at least intact. We do miss characters like Oga-chan and some of the other classmates (who appeared in the light novel), but since the movie left no room for them, it was a good idea to leave them out instead of trying to squeeze them ineffectively in like they did with Margery.Friagne the Hunter is done a great service here. He gets just about the right amount of screen time, and his relationship with Marian is nicely demonstrated. He also is presented as being more powerful here than he was in the TV series (where he was something of a &quot;little guy&quot; compared to the series' main villains, Bal Masque), and he uses his Hougu with splendid results. They even put in a tiny scene at the very beginning of the film depicting Friagne using Trigger Happy to kill an unnamed Flame Haze, finally showing us just how dangerous he's supposed to be. He puts up one hell of a fight during the final battle (easily holding off both Shana and Margery), just as a good villain should, and when Marian sacrifices herself for him, his reaction is perfect. A well-handled villain makes all the difference in a story, no matter what its medium. And they got the villain right.The animation is breathtaking. It stands above the TV series animation-wise, just as a movie should, and while it looks like it stole a few shots here and there during the first half directly from the first couple of episodes (a cost-cutting move, most likely), most of the familiar scenes were obviously reanimated, given more dynamic camera movement and greater fluidity. The fight scenes were especially well done and were very exciting to watch, and the CGI was very smoothly used alongside the characters to great effect. Visually, the movie doesn't disappoint.A few little things were added that were actually not used in the TV series, which is a bit surprising. Before her storyline is abandoned, we see more of Kazumi's home life, including a group picture of her class. In a particularly nice touch, we see the photograph suddenly alter itself right around the time Shana takes over Hirai's existence, which was a great idea. Hirai's disappearance from this world is handled with slightly more dramatic flair than the TV series, not necessarily making it more effective, but making it different enough to be fresh and interesting. (I suspect the movie's flair for the dramatic is one reason why some people feel the movie does a better job telling the story than the TV series. However, superficial drama does not a better story make.)Speaking of heightened drama, the music is different here than in the TV series, and a very beautiful song is performed when Hirai is about to vanish. This was a good move on the filmmakers' part, since Hirai, even after she is gone, is important to the story, and having such effective music for her final scene helps us feel the distress and frustration Yuji experiences. Another very beautiful tune is played at the end of the film as we see Shana and Yuji standing together, finally sharing a friendly, trusting moment with one another (an effect nearly mired by Margery zipping around overhead). The music, really, is one of the best things about the movie.Overall, the movie is enjoyable (if more on its own merits than compared to other versions of Shana), and any anime fan would likely enjoy watching it. Due to its flaws, I award it a 7/10, but I still regard it as recommended viewing. I hope, if they ever choose to make a second film, they're more careful in their approach to storytelling. the movie itself, and in some ways this doesn't really work in the movie's favor. I'll explain below.Let's begin with the negatives. I read somewhere (I don't remember where, but it might have been LJ) that someone felt that the movie does a much better job telling the story than the TV series. I very strongly disagree with this.

Hirai's disappearance from this world is handled with slightly more dramatic flair than the TV series, not necessarily making it more effective, but making it different enough to be fresh and interesting. (I suspect the movie's flair for the dramatic is one reason why some people feel the movie does a better job telling the story than the TV series. However, superficial drama does not a better story make.)Speaking of heightened drama, the music is different here than in the TV series, and a very beautiful song is performed when Hirai is about to vanish. This was a good move on the filmmakers' part, since Hirai, even after she is gone, is important to the story, and having such effective music for her final scene helps us feel the distress and frustration Yuji experiences. Another very beautiful tune is played at the end of the film as we see Shana and Yuji standing together, finally sharing a friendly, trusting moment with one another (an effect nearly mired by Margery zipping around overhead). The music, really, is one of the best things about the movie.Overall, the movie is enjoyable (if more on its own merits than compared to other versions of Shana), and any anime fan would likely enjoy watching it. Due to its flaws, I award it a 7/10, but I still regard it as recommended viewing. I hope, if they ever choose to make a second film, they're more careful in their approach to storytelling."", ""Shakugan no Shana Movie is basically about the first few episode of the 1st season of Shakugan no Shana, shortened into an hour and half movie.Best watch this BEFORE watching the 1st season. As watching the anime before this is almost like a recap of it. There are some irreverent parts of the movie along with the lack of bgm on some parts of the movie as well, otherwise it's a great movie to watch. "", 'i found the movie shakugan no shana interesting too because some parts from the series when combined into this became different like the scence where the flame heaven alastor appeared and where the scence of hirai yukari where much longeroh well the movie of shakugan no shana is great because it retains the action ']"

It's clear from watching both Gundam SEED and SEED Destiny that there are many mockable aspects, even if both series present themselves as being relatively serious. This collection of super-deformed shorts plays up many popular fandom themes (and snarks) which indicates that Sunrise stays very in touch with their audience. Despite there only being four four minute episodes, Seed Supernova somehow manages to touch on a great number of subjects including Yzak's raging jealousy...towards Athrun, the hilarious cheapness of SEED-mode (aka godmodding, ftw), Athrun's relationship with Kira, Yzak's relationship with Dearka, Lacus's ridiculous political power, and Shinn's... something. I really don't know what to make of Shinn's bit.It's a very effective and well-aimed silliness, to say the least, and it's always good to know that a company's willing to research into what their fans would enjoy in a random spinoff.CHARACTER - As character personality is one of the main focuses of incessant mockery here, it's no surprise that all the characters are supremely exaggerated in Supernova. That said, they're absolutely hilarious characterizations because you're left saying, &quot;YES, that's EXACTLY what I thought all along!&quot; about some of the characters' traits.ART &amp; ANIMATION - They're chibis. It's a cheap production. What do you want? Fireworks? It looks good! You're only watching it for four minutes at a time anyway.MUSIC - Recycled music from SEED and SEED Destiny, obviously, but both series had amazing soundtracks, so there.

Kiznaiver,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31798/Kiznaiver,"[""Kiznaiver is so stylish and colourful that it is almost blinding. But behind Trigger's beautiful visuals, there just isn't a whole lot else besides an extraordinarily average, if somewhat enjoyable anime-- one that is certainly a noticeable step down from their previous work, Kill la Kill.This should not be taken as an insinuation that all Kiznaiver has to offer is style without substance. There is value here, and Trigger has evidently tried to capitalise upon some of Kill la Kill's prior successes, particularly with regards to its characters. Kiznaiver tries-- it tries ever so hard-- but in the end crumbles under its own ambition. It...is an excellent premise that unfortunately never really finds its footing. Were it a full two-cours of content rather than the mere twelve episodes it actually is, the result might have been different.Kiznaiver's characters are likely the first thing to catch one's attention. They are rich with personality, visually distinct from other characters in anime. There is no one that feels particularly bland (aside from maybe Sonozaki), but a number of them never go much beyond simply looking cool or being weird. Nico is a cute airhead suffering from a variety of mental illnesses (and quite possibly low IQ), while Yoshihara is an extreme masochist who orgasms at the very idea of pain, and exists largely as fuel for shounen-ai fanfiction and doujinshi. The protagonist, Katsuhira, is also a mopey emo kid who lets people beat him up without a care. This is about all that characterises them for the entire show. They are as one-dimensional as can be. It is bit of a waste, given how unique their character designs are. (And I do not only say that because I like twintailed girls named Nico.)Some characters are more compelling than others. Tenga's dialogue in the original Japanese, for example, is fairly natural and feels like something that could come from an actual teenager's mouth. Chidori, as annoying as her scream-fests tend to be, is also pretty representative of how the average teenage girl handles their emotions. The writers of Kiznaiver know what they are doing and are capable of doing it well, but the problem is that the short episode count prevents these characters from ever realising their full potential. It throws a lot at the viewer, but never gives them time to digest it or room for the characters to breathe and relax. It is, almost invariably, the quiet moments that stand out the most in a story. There are no quiet moments in Kiznaiver.I suppose it makes sense for something like Kiznaiver to be as short as it is, as Trigger puts a great deal of work and effort into each episode. It obviously shows. But that still does not excuse them creating a story and a cast of characters bigger than they could handle within the allotted time. For something like this, a more briskly-paced movie, perhaps a duology, would have been a better way to compress the story without sacrificing visual quality. But I suppose a movie or two doesn't make quite as much money as five or six over-priced BluRays would. Anime is expensive to make, and Trigger needs to pay its animators so they can eat and have a roof over their head. I get it, but it is still a bit disappointing to see business prioritised over artistic quality in this case. If Trigger saved up extra money for a year or two through smaller projects, and used that to fund an extra cour of Kiznaiver, we would undoubtedly have had a much more exciting product.Some aspects of Kiznaiver, however, are less the result of its short episode count, and more related to lacklustre writing. Most of Kiznaiver's drama involves angsty, spoiled teenagers overreacting. Being rejected by someone you like is a sucky thing, there is no doubt about that, but it is not the end of the world like Kiznaiver tries to paint it. There are things far worse going on out there, and yet they're traumatised because someone they had a crush on couldn't reciprocate those feelings? Big deal. Give it a couple months and it will barely even cross their mind again. It would be one thing if these feelings were long-term, but for everyone excluding Chidori, they have had these crushes for a few weeks, tops.Kiznaiver tries to create an absurdly complex set of romances. Every character is attracted to someone else, and often the one they love is interested in someone else entirely. With eight main characters and only twelve episodes, you can have a pretty good guess of how well these romances are handled. They get angry, scream and beat each other up when they find out the one they love is being treated poorly by one of the other Kiznaivers, only for another person to get upset in return, and another and another, it raining and dramatic music blasting all the while like the world is on fire and ready to explode. It is extremely difficult to care about their feelings for one another when most of these feelings (particularly surrounding Tenga) have been seldom explored and revealed only one episode beforehand, without so much as an explanation-- or heck, even a hint-- for why they like each other in the first place. Considering the experiment within the show is also manipulating these characters' feelings, the romance doesn't just feel lacklustre-- it feels artificial. Chidori and Katsuhira are about the only couple that make any sense. Everything else is just a big mess that the show could and should have done without.It is also quite silly and cloying how emotional 'pain' is shared and hurts them all as well. One of the Kiznaivers is heart-broken, so, hey, that means everyone else must succumb to the feels and suffer from heart-break, too, because emotion is equivalent to physical pain and not at all psychological, or something. There are other scenes, like Chidori confessing to Katsuhira in the middle of a storm (weather in anime being the convenient device that it is), or Yuta and the rest screaming at the top of their lungs and jumping into the river (because that's how you deal with your anger?), that make it quite clear that Kiznaiver is not all too interested in appealing to adults. I can totally understand why someone who is around fourteen-years-old may enjoy and empathise with that sort of thing, but being twenty-three myself, it doesn't warrant much more than a sigh and some head-shaking. For how believable Tenga's and Chidori's characterisation can be, it is a bit disappointing to see the show stray so heavily into melodrama territory. At least Kill la Kill was aware of how blatantly over-the-top it was; Kiznaiver takes itself seriously all the time, and it wants you to take it seriously, too. It forgets how to have fun with itself, and that is perhaps the most disappointing thing of all.I'll still give Kiznaiver credit for trying. Most of these issues could be resolved simply by the show having more episodes to develop its characters and their feelings in a more meaningful way. It would still not be an anime without significant flaws, as the copious amounts of melodrama make clear, but there certainly was the potential to, if not match Kill la Kill, at least come close to its quality. Kiznaiver looks and sounds so nice that it is easy to forgive some of its issues and enjoy the ride regardless, but, in reflection, there just is not much else to praise aside from that. I really, truly wanted to give Trigger's big new project a glowing review, but I just can't do it. It's not there, and it never gets there.At the same time, not everyone is looking for the next greatest thing. Having charm and style alone can please most people, and merely being a standout title within its respective season is enough to warrant a viewing. And, you know, that's perfectly fine. I wouldn't hesitate to give Kiznaiver a recommendation if all the person wants is a few hours of fun and something a little bit different.

What if, despite your thought that your idea was original, someone across the globe, someone with whom you have never and will never have contact with had your same idea and yet, weren\'t able to...act on it. Is it still original?No matter your definition of original- Trigger continues to pump out quality writing and both new, heretofore unseen content, and new ways of presenting old ideas. This season, they pulled the trigger on a double barrel shotgun of new for the anime viewing populace with the zany Space Patrol Luluco, and the much more subdued Kiznaiver- and what a season it\'s been.Kiznaiver is what I would describe as a new twist on an old classic. One of the interwoven themes is referenced in both my opening and ending quotes- the power of friendship. Had Trigger just stopped there, they would have produced a trite, unimaginative, and unfulfilling series much like those that crop up each season. Kiznaiver is not content to merely focus on the power that friends hold over you, but also delve into deeper concepts of pain and loss, the stages of grievance, and the ties that bind.Much like the multifaceted Kill La Kill before it, Kiznaiver tackles these themes with depth and sophistication. Conversations that outwardly appear to be simple exchanges between friends often reveal much more about the characters and their mentalities. The characters themselves also outwardly seem to represent the kind of one note stereotype- Katsuhira the unfeeling, dull, mophaired main character. Chidori the tsun tsun. Nico the genki girl, etc. However simply the characters are presented in the beginning, throughout the course of the show, we watch them grow as people, friends, and characters. In the early episodes, we see the group forced together as part of some sick social experiement- a disparate group of persons from different cliques, if you will, thrown together and told to ""become friends"" (whether through traumatic shared experiences, which has been proven to form bonds between people who might not otherwise associate- such as in fraternity hazing, gang initiation, etc. or the typical socialization process that people go through.)We get to know the person of the characters, what drives them, their insecurities, wishes, and failures. Each has their turn in the spotlight, and as the viewer, I felt like most of these characters, even though many had larger than life personalities, could have been real people. They don\'t have superpowers. They aren\'t infallible, neither are they perfect. They don\'t win every time, and the certainly don\'t all get along perfectly, kiss and make up after every little thing. Like real friends with disparate interests, they get on each other\'s nerves, hurt each other (in more ways than one) fall in love, fall out, make each other cry, and experience life together. Trigger, in all their savviness, also recognized the potential for relationships in the show, and makes moves for different character romances to happen, fall apart, and change. It\'s not your typical ensemble where the bland, self insert protagonist has color coded dereotype ladies throwing themselves at him for no reason. No, Kiznaiver takes a more nuanced approach, and the characters have viable, believable reasons (some are not pretty, just like life) for being interested in each other like mutual interests, pure pity, opposites attracting, and finding kinship.The plot of the show takes a backseat to characterization in what\'s known as a ""character driven story"", which is also something of a rarity in anime these days. It\'s not all about some grand scheme or hero\'s journey, but about the interaction of the characters themselves that matter. As mentioned above, I think that the characters experience the five stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance) throughout the show, as a theme. As part of the Kizna experiment (linking people through sharing pain), these kids in the story, through their own relationships and getting to know themselves and the people around them, experience these stages as part of their characterization. Each is in denial over some reason or another, whether it\'s ""how could my friend have died?"" or ""this person loves me, they just don\'t know it"", etc. This progresses as the story heats up- they\'re angry over their inner demons, and it spills out onto each other- until the voices of reason, Hisomu and Nico bring them all to their senses (bargaining). After the climax of the show, they all decidedly experience a strong depressive episode, where the characters decide what they\'re going to do with themselves, and about each other- having made themselves vulnerable and revealing their secrets to each other. Eventually they come to accept each other, and the story takes its final twist, which would be criminal of me to reveal. Suffice to say, it\'s certainly worth watching to find out.The art of Kiznaiver is also excellent, with the flair Trigger has for small details, and making their characters look fresh and interesting. There are a lot of stylings of Little Witch Academia, especially the hair, but still very within the modern style. It\'s crisp, clean, and flows well, but the lighting is really something. Reflections, eyes, and anything lit look really great, drawing attention to details and adding depth to the shot composition. I applaud the casting director at Trigger, whoever they are- for they have done it again. Similarly to Kill La Kill, Kiznaiver is impeccably cast. The nuance and emotion (or required lack thereof) that was put into the performances really sells the drama and characters. The larger than life Tenga, fragile Maki, zany Nico, wacky Hisomu, hot and cold Chidori, stiff Katsuhira, and mysterious Noriko (and some nice performances from the supporting cast as well) all add up to a very well produced product.tl;dr for my lazy folk+ great characterization+ fantastic art+ a human drama, one that you can get behind, that doesn\'t descend in to pointless melodrama+/- your favorite characters might not get togetherFriends are soy sauce!

Each is in denial over some reason or another, whether it\'s ""how could my friend have died?"" or ""this person loves me, they just don\'t know it"", etc. This progresses as the story heats up- they\'re angry over their inner demons, and it spills out onto each other- until the voices of reason, Hisomu and Nico bring them all to their senses (bargaining). After the climax of the show, they all decidedly experience a strong depressive episode, where the characters decide what they\'re going to do with themselves, and about each other- having made themselves vulnerable and revealing their secrets to each other. Eventually they come to accept each other, and the story takes its final twist, which would be criminal of me to reveal. Suffice to say, it\'s certainly worth watching to find out.The art of Kiznaiver is also excellent, with the flair Trigger has for small details, and making their characters look fresh and interesting. There are a lot of stylings of Little Witch Academia, especially the hair, but still very within the modern style. It\'s crisp, clean, and flows well, but the lighting is really something. Reflections, eyes, and anything lit look really great, drawing attention to details and adding depth to the shot composition. I applaud the casting director at Trigger, whoever they are- for they have done it again. Similarly to Kill La Kill, Kiznaiver is impeccably cast. The nuance and emotion (or required lack thereof) that was put into the performances really sells the drama and characters. The larger than life Tenga, fragile Maki, zany Nico, wacky Hisomu, hot and cold Chidori, stiff Katsuhira, and mysterious Noriko (and some nice performances from the supporting cast as well) all add up to a very well produced product.tl;dr for my lazy folk+ great characterization+ fantastic art+ a human drama, one that you can get behind, that doesn\'t descend in to pointless melodrama+/- your favorite characters might not get togetherFriends are soy sauce! The omnipotent seasoning! - Nico', 'Forced drama, what does it entail? Is it the act of searching for genuine emotion in a place that never offered it? Is it not understanding the limitations of your screenplay? Perhaps it comes from honest attempts to create something organic. Whatever the reason may be, when it happens, it doesn\'t leave a good aftertaste.So which is it for Kiznaiver? Is it truly trying to craft something memorable? Is it seeking poignancy in the anguish of others? Is it studio Trigger trying to branch out into unfamiliar territory; a leap of faith, hoping their dedicated followers would comfort them when they fall on their...faces? And really, should I care, even if they did attempt something out of a place of honest effort? Well, short answer, fuck no.I don\'t need to babysit a half-baked effort. I don\'t need to try to empathize with a failed project that slipped out of the creators\' hands. As harsh as that mentality may be, it\'s the honest truth. I\'m the consumer. The only thing required of me is to be entertained and engrossed by the project they put forward. And guess what? I wasn\'t. In fact, I was mentally drained by this synthetic try-hard and its relentless efforts to pull at my heartstrings; operating with as much subtlety as a Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade trying to sneak down Central Park West. A good concept doesn\'t make a good anime and Kiznaiver embodies that very notion. The message it chose to convey was fine, but the way it went about delivering it was the problem.In a sickeningly idealistic attempt to bring forth ""world peace"" and a greater level of understanding among humanity, the Kiznaiver project was created to combine the shared pain of its placeholders by linking their sensory output together. The more these placeholders are made to open up to each other, the deeper their connection becomes; experiencing everything from the surface-level physical pain, to more emotional-based pain, as the walls that separate them dissipates.If the premise wasn\'t made explicit enough already, it\'s essentially one big character study and self-examination of human relationships. And it should go without saying, but whenever topics like these are made your primary focus, there are some prerequisites expected of it in order for it to function with any semblance of validity. You can\'t go swimming without a pool of water, and in the same light, you can\'t have a character study without characters. Notice I wrote ""characters"" NOT ""caricatures,"" a distinction that Kiznaiver can\'t seem to make.If Kiznaiver had an extended title, it would go something along the lines of:""Kiznaiver: Forcing Archetypes to have Da Feels""These color-coordinated caricatures are so cookie-cutter by storytelling standards that you could sum them all up with one-liners. They\'re basically human smurfs, each feeding into pre-assigned roles with little in the way of diversifying their default archetypes. Instead of swimming in a pool of water, Kiznaiver attempts to achieve the same feat with a pit full of dirt. A task that\'s not only nigh impossible but also painful to watch play out as well. Archetypes are meant to serve as default personalities to further build upon. To simply present them as is without building on who they are as characters is not only conceited, it\'s borderline delusional when taking into consideration the importance that the characters hold in the confines of this material. This isn\'t an action adventure where the world being trekked is the star attraction, it\'s a character study, a CHARACTER study. If there\'s one aspect of your screenplay that you want to shine the most, it\'s in this department. And yet, redhead tsunderes are pre-packaged in this anime in the same way every live-action movie and TV drama depiction of high school has the popular blonde cheerleader and varsity-jacket-wearing jock.So when these non-entities are placed in a situation where they\'re forced to open up to each other, there\'s very little that could be done to divert the audience\'s attention from the obvious truth. That truth being that there\'s nothing to truly pull from these ""characters"" since there was nothing there from the beginning. The show desperately attempts to squeeze a modicum of emotion from this dirt pit, and when that plan fails, we\'re brought back to my original inquiry. This anime is strong-armed into producing something it never had to begin with; genuine emotion.To be fair, there are transient glimpses of decent writing in this dirt pit of a cast, that coming in the form of one character, Honoka Maki. If there was ever a character in this show that Kiznaiver didn\'t butcher with its ineptitude, Honoka was it. With the introduction of her backstory, as well as the time dedicated to exploring her psyche, she stands out like a sore thumb, especially when placed in her vapid surroundings. Had the show handled its cast with the same amount of effort and care as it did with her, I would have been singing a different tune. But this sadly isn\'t the case, and just as quickly as Honoka\'s character focus brought hope to the show, it\'s immediately snuffed out as the artificial angst surrounding every other facet of the screenplay further plunges the material back to the subpar levels that it was constructed out of.If I had to offer any other appraisal outside of this temporary moment of decent writing, it would be that of the art and animation department. Unlike the rest of the show, this area demonstrated the talent found at Trigger that they accumulated from their time spent at Gainax. The color palette used was radiant and immediately draws the viewer\'s attention. With storyboarding that kept a sense of flow in mind and a decent amount of consideration made in its use of color theory, there was clearly more effort here than what\'s usually expected out of typical studio projects. The same could be said (for the most part) about the character designs. While some were painfully by-the-numbers, others were quite expressive and easily identifiable. At the end of the day, these designs are wasted on cookie-cutter archetypes, but they\'re still appealing nonetheless.One a side-note, for readers who\'ve already seen Kizanaiver, the designs of the gomorin outfits take clear inspiration from the Maromi doll in Paranoia Agent. Perhaps this was done so as a tribute to Satoshi Kon, given his extensive work in the field that the show is trying to dive into. Whatever the case may be, it was a nice touch.Another detail that, while not innovative, still deserves mentioning was the color of the characters\' hair. Katsuhira\'s hair—which was supposed to show someone close to complete apathy—was represented with pure white hair overlapped with some brown, with the white representing an absence of emotion and the brown being the faint presence of it still left within him. The same could be said about Niko\'s hair, which obviously denotes to the flamboyancy of her personality given the diverse, bright colors. Again, pretty simple in how the hair color denotes their traits, but still worth noting.As for the soundtrack, there isn\'t much to say. The only thing that sticks out is the opening theme ""LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME"" by BOOM BOOM SATELLITES, and rightfully so, given the infectious nature of it in accompaniment with the visuals presented. This could be attributed to the fact that sonically it has much in common with one of pop\'s more recognizable tunes ""Take on Me"" by a-ha. At the time of this writing, a quick youtube search of ""Kiznaiver take on me"" would bring you to a video that exploits this, merging the song with Kiznaiver\'s opening, demonstrating just how interchangeable it really is. That being said, BOOM BOO SATELLITES certainly delivered. Everything else in the sound department is forgettable by comparison. The only other thing worth taking note of is the sound effects used at times; like the glitchy noise made whenever the Kiznaiver device was activated, or the added sound effects given for objects when motioned. It was minor inclusions but still did something for the show than had it been excluded.Now, what should have been excluded but ultimately made the final cut was a love heptagon. Not a regular one-way love, not a love triangle, but a full-blown love heptagon! And what happens when you involve a bunch of dimensionless smurfs in an ouroboros-like relationship? You get an embarrassing display of cardboard cutouts inserts pleading to each other. A potpourri of ill-advised confessionals that transformed itself into a deformed, blubbering mess. There\'s very little in the way of actual characterization for these mouthpieces with legs, so expecting them to divulge genuine feelings for each other just comes across as half-assed. Some characters don\'t even have much in the way of one-on-one interaction prior to these events either, and those that do get that time barely share any semblance of chemistry. This made what was suppose to be emotional climaxes in the story, into an over-bloated cringe-filled sob-fest. This was midday soap opera levels of awful.The show steamrolls through all of this melodrama and artificial angst in order to deliver a message that no one needed help figuring out in the first place; getting closer to others runs the risk of eventually being hurt by them. This isn\'t exactly an eye-opening revelation, this is just common sense. But what\'s possibly worse than off of this is the fact that what Kiznaiver struggles to deliver in 12 episodes, is easily understood with just 1. This 1 episode I speak of is the TV pilot of Kino\'s Journey. Watch those 20 minutes and save yourself hours of seeing a show drown in the kiddie pool section.Enjoyment: 3/10I told myself, as well as a few colleagues, that I wasn\'t going to review this, due in large part to the fact that just talking about it made me feel mentally exhausted. But then I thought about what it would mean for those people that share my stance but can\'t quite articulate the reason for why they feel the way they do. I thought about our perspective going unheard in the frenzy of hype and unchecked evaluations. Letting Kiznaiver get off scot-free to gain unwarranted appraisal became far bigger of a burden than simply ignoring it to comfortably go about my way. And so, here I am, writing this review for all those, who like me, are tired of these empty vessels being filled with accolades it doesn\'t deserve. The only emotional response that Kiznaiver got right was that of frustration, as that\'s precisely what I felt while watching it.Overall: 4/10Kiznaiver is fine until it gets into the character drama, and seeing that the whole show revolves around character drama, you could see how that leaves very little in the way of value. Had the characters been handled better, had the concept not been bare-bones, had the writers tried a bit harder, then maybe, just maybe, there would have been something here worth talking about. But that wasn\'t the case, and Trigger, once again, ""saves anime!""""The show wasn\'t that good, but the opening was so nice though!"" How many more times do we have to make this statement before we let insufferable titles like these crash and burn? How many more times would we equate trying with being good enough? The only good that Kiznaiver can offer is serving as a future example of what forced melodrama looks like. With that being said, ignore this one if you haven\'t already, it\'s a practice in tolerance-control that would only serve as a distraction from watching something else that\'s truly worth your invested time. faces?

When they’re having a despondent day? Well, look no further because Kiznaiver portrays this theme, and I mean literally.Kiznaiver is an anime revolving around bonds through pain and sentiment. The story circulates around that of our main protagonist, Katsuhira Agata, a modest, slow teenage boy that grasps no emotions within his hands, accordingly making himself a bullying target. However, the bullying that consistently approaches him from every direction is beyond his concerns and most notably, his pain.  Him, alongside with 5 other teenagers’...wounds are connected through the Kizna system and are obligated to bond for the sake of creating “World peace”. And so, their journey begins.Now, I must say, Kiznaiver is an anime I saw one of the brightest potential in, however, was abstracted by various divisions. Whenever it was character development or drama, the manner Kiznaiver executed this is what made itself abstracted from a rather good conception. Many like to say this is a character-based show so they are going to get more profound of the characters than any other department in the show, but even then, Kiznaiver fails abominably at this.If I had to describe the characters using three adjectives, they would be “mild, archetypal, and caricatured” The characters were first given archetypical roles, initially seen as symbolism, which I had no concerns for, however, the characters just started to use that as their foremost individualities, never actually getting in-depth of the traits and explaining why they maintain such. Alternatively, this started to define the characters themselves and the purpose they bring to the plot. Niko and Tenga, for most of the series existed, only to slap in some eccentric yet cartoonish comedy in there, but only came irksome and unnecessary, leaving room for its incompatible tonal dissonance. Kiznaiver genuinely knew what they were doing, thus far were oblivious about the fact that it’s never going to work. Kiznaiver knew that it wanted to be witty at times, whilst simultaneously being serious, yet merely making the story paradoxical. The way serious scenes would modify itself into comedic ones was awkward and off. Kiznaiver couldn’t handle both, therefore making the tonal shifts cringeworthy.The only characterized really are Honoka, Katsuhira (fairly) and Sononaki, yet they still don’t possess strong characterization. Katsuhira and Sonozaki were the only crucial characters of the show and would have still been proficient of creating a story with just the two of them. The rest of the cast didn’t live up to their significance, let alone nearly, and that’s what I found dissatisfying about Kiznaiver. If every single character were presented exactly like how Honoka was, this series would have left me with a different impression, potentially increasing its score from me. Hisomu was a random guy in the background educating a few life lessons to these youngsters but served no purpose whatsoever.  The finale of Kiznaiver entirely explained the significance of our cast; A bunch of kids that just added their two cents to Katsuhira and Sonozaki’s association without it actually making that much of an impact, and additionally their personal issues being irrelevant, which brings me to explain the execution of drama in this series.Kiznaiver must be an anime that secondly enthrals and is reliant on drama for its series, considering the fact that it’s a character-based show, however, even its drama was horribly done. Albeit, I can comprehend the fact that they’re just average teenagers so they are bound to create conflicts; it’s only natural for them to do so, however, not one speck of maturity was balanced with the juvenility of the quarrels. Example would be Chidori’s issues. Instead of it being a bunch of sixteen years olds arguing about their love interests, it was something that a bunch of twelve years old would be arguing about.  Moreover, the love interests were either absurd, lacking or arbitral.  Nico liking Tenga had to be the most illogical, a relationship that was barely transparent and developed. Kacchon and Chidori was a relationship that was hard to care for because they’ve barely exposed their relationship before the Kizna system. Instead, we’re just left to imagine and presume how strong their relationship must be.Characterization and the character interaction within the show were born out of compulsion as a way to move the plot forward, merely making the characters plot devices. A great example of this is episode two, where the characters were forced to reveal a secret of theirs, which I found quite rough. Kiznaiver wanted to impatiently force development out of our characters and rapidly reach the good part of the story, thus giving a reason to these “required missions” or “served punishments if something is not achieved” As much as this made the story engaging, it just came redundant. The same results would have still been created if the characters were simply left to unravel their way out of the system or getting profound of each other. The secrets and authentic identities were proficient of unfolding itself but Kiznaiver were too impatient.Kiznaiver already has an implausible conception, yet is very questionable. They’re already aware of the failure the experiment has brought prior to other children that initially were a part of the research, so why do they revive it again on other kids? Initially, the experiment became extremely hazardous and was nowhere near creating “world peace” from the looks of it, so why would it be smart to do it again? Moreover, Kiznaiver never gets in-depth of how connecting pain equates to world peace, but rather they just state it will. Kiznaiver doesn’t try to bring coherence to an already puzzling idea. I am very aware of the fact that the whole point of the show was to show the faults of the idea, but they never really try to fully clarify the agenda from the very beginning.The effort put into Kiznaiver is very transparent and I support it for doing that. The distinctive turn they wanted to add to their story with the connecting pain and all boasted Kiznaiver up, however, ever so slightly failed itself from the inconsistencies. Kiznaiver prioritised the artistic merits in contrast to all the existing departments, just like what any average modern anime would do really. Not that it’s a problem with bring bigger significant to the visuals of the show, but to not show as much importance to the characters and story is what Kiznaiver performed.The art was very satisfying yet aspiring. It had a very crispy and sharp design to it. The backdrops basically go by what I’m saying, very distinguishing and never felt boring. The character designs were fine, and I mean, really fine. Very distinguishable and was very defining. Each character has an exhilarating look to them and was pleasing to the human eyes. They looked exactly by their characteristics and their personalities were easy to presume. The colour palette was very strong and bright and the animation ran smoothly.Well done BOOM BOOM SATELLITES and Sangatsu no Phantasia by genuinely going by your intended purpose. They rightfully went by what it means to create an opening and an ending, thus making it very appropriate.  An opening is to grip you into the series and places a significant role by entertaining your audience into watching more; the Kiznaiver opening ideally went by that. An ending is meant to relax the viewer and conclude them that the episode was nicely completed; the Kiznaiver ending also ideally went by that. However, the only trouble I have with the opening is how unmemorable it is. As Zeph stated, the only unforgettable line in the opening is “LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME” Other than that, it’s fine.Kaji Yuki, you shady monkey.  His performance was not particularly extraordinary, but most definitely stood out than the rest. I absolutely love how Kaji Yuki can just adjust his voice in order to fit the character, completely making him distinguishable from his most popular roles. Kaji Yuki is like a person that can just hide behind characters without knowing it’s him. His voice was perfect for Agata and convinced me into liking it, a lot.What to expect and personal enjoymentBut the real question is, did I enjoy this?Not necessarily. It has to do with the fact that Kiznaiver vaguely touched upon its default genres, hence why I couldn’t get profound of it. It was hard for me to articulate the message that Kiznaiver was trying to depict because so many things distracted it. There were nothing for me to get in-depth with really, but rather I just started watching the show with enjoyment in my mind. Kiznaiver is fairly a dumb watch. If you want an anime for its exhilaration and fun, Kiznaiver is for you. If you’re looking for any perception of our characters and story, you’re not going to find that hereKiznaiver should have been a 24 episode long series and more considerate with where it story and point goes. This show only wears the name of it being character-based and dramatic but it poorly conveys that. This show technically done what death parade done; a poor story in which its opening saves itself from hate and is seen as good in the majorities’ eyes. Kiznaiver is yet another anime that had potential, however just didn’t go by it.Negatives•\tincompatible yet irritating tone dissonance•\tImplausible and vague conception.•\tObligated character interaction and characterization•\tPurposeless or one-dimensional cast•\tMelodramatic, no maturity balanced with childishnessPositives•\tEffort•\tSatisfying art and animation•\tAppropriate music•\tKaji YukiKiznaiver = Overall 4/10 wounds are connected through the Kizna system and are obligated to bond for the sake of creating “World peace”.

The rest of the cast didn’t live up to their significance, let alone nearly, and that’s what I found dissatisfying about Kiznaiver. If every single character were presented exactly like how Honoka was, this series would have left me with a different impression, potentially increasing its score from me. Hisomu was a random guy in the background educating a few life lessons to these youngsters but served no purpose whatsoever.  The finale of Kiznaiver entirely explained the significance of our cast; A bunch of kids that just added their two cents to Katsuhira and Sonozaki’s association without it actually making that much of an impact, and additionally their personal issues being irrelevant, which brings me to explain the execution of drama in this series.Kiznaiver must be an anime that secondly enthrals and is reliant on drama for its series, considering the fact that it’s a character-based show, however, even its drama was horribly done. Albeit, I can comprehend the fact that they’re just average teenagers so they are bound to create conflicts; it’s only natural for them to do so, however, not one speck of maturity was balanced with the juvenility of the quarrels. Example would be Chidori’s issues. Instead of it being a bunch of sixteen years olds arguing about their love interests, it was something that a bunch of twelve years old would be arguing about.  Moreover, the love interests were either absurd, lacking or arbitral.  Nico liking Tenga had to be the most illogical, a relationship that was barely transparent and developed. Kacchon and Chidori was a relationship that was hard to care for because they’ve barely exposed their relationship before the Kizna system. Instead, we’re just left to imagine and presume how strong their relationship must be.Characterization and the character interaction within the show were born out of compulsion as a way to move the plot forward, merely making the characters plot devices. A great example of this is episode two, where the characters were forced to reveal a secret of theirs, which I found quite rough. Kiznaiver wanted to impatiently force development out of our characters and rapidly reach the good part of the story, thus giving a reason to these “required missions” or “served punishments if something is not achieved” As much as this made the story engaging, it just came redundant. The same results would have still been created if the characters were simply left to unravel their way out of the system or getting profound of each other. The secrets and authentic identities were proficient of unfolding itself but Kiznaiver were too impatient.Kiznaiver already has an implausible conception, yet is very questionable. They’re already aware of the failure the experiment has brought prior to other children that initially were a part of the research, so why do they revive it again on other kids? Initially, the experiment became extremely hazardous and was nowhere near creating “world peace” from the looks of it, so why would it be smart to do it again? Moreover, Kiznaiver never gets in-depth of how connecting pain equates to world peace, but rather they just state it will. Kiznaiver doesn’t try to bring coherence to an already puzzling idea. I am very aware of the fact that the whole point of the show was to show the faults of the idea, but they never really try to fully clarify the agenda from the very beginning.The effort put into Kiznaiver is very transparent and I support it for doing that. The distinctive turn they wanted to add to their story with the connecting pain and all boasted Kiznaiver up, however, ever so slightly failed itself from the inconsistencies. Kiznaiver prioritised the artistic merits in contrast to all the existing departments, just like what any average modern anime would do really. Not that it’s a problem with bring bigger significant to the visuals of the show, but to not show as much importance to the characters and story is what Kiznaiver performed.The art was very satisfying yet aspiring. It had a very crispy and sharp design to it. The backdrops basically go by what I’m saying, very distinguishing and never felt boring. The character designs were fine, and I mean, really fine. Very distinguishable and was very defining. Each character has an exhilarating look to them and was pleasing to the human eyes. They looked exactly by their characteristics and their personalities were easy to presume. The colour palette was very strong and bright and the animation ran smoothly.Well done BOOM BOOM SATELLITES and Sangatsu no Phantasia by genuinely going by your intended purpose. They rightfully went by what it means to create an opening and an ending, thus making it very appropriate.  An opening is to grip you into the series and places a significant role by entertaining your audience into watching more; the Kiznaiver opening ideally went by that. An ending is meant to relax the viewer and conclude them that the episode was nicely completed; the Kiznaiver ending also ideally went by that. However, the only trouble I have with the opening is how unmemorable it is. As Zeph stated, the only unforgettable line in the opening is “LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME” Other than that, it’s fine.Kaji Yuki, you shady monkey.  His performance was not particularly extraordinary, but most definitely stood out than the rest. I absolutely love how Kaji Yuki can just adjust his voice in order to fit the character, completely making him distinguishable from his most popular roles. Kaji Yuki is like a person that can just hide behind characters without knowing it’s him. His voice was perfect for Agata and convinced me into liking it, a lot.What to expect and personal enjoymentBut the real question is, did I enjoy this?Not necessarily. It has to do with the fact that Kiznaiver vaguely touched upon its default genres, hence why I couldn’t get profound of it. It was hard for me to articulate the message that Kiznaiver was trying to depict because so many things distracted it. There were nothing for me to get in-depth with really, but rather I just started watching the show with enjoyment in my mind. Kiznaiver is fairly a dumb watch. If you want an anime for its exhilaration and fun, Kiznaiver is for you. If you’re looking for any perception of our characters and story, you’re not going to find that hereKiznaiver should have been a 24 episode long series and more considerate with where it story and point goes. This show only wears the name of it being character-based and dramatic but it poorly conveys that. This show technically done what death parade done; a poor story in which its opening saves itself from hate and is seen as good in the majorities’ eyes. Kiznaiver is yet another anime that had potential, however just didn’t go by it.Negatives•\tincompatible yet irritating tone dissonance•\tImplausible and vague conception.•\tObligated character interaction and characterization•\tPurposeless or one-dimensional cast•\tMelodramatic, no maturity balanced with childishnessPositives•\tEffort•\tSatisfying art and animation•\tAppropriate music•\tKaji YukiKiznaiver = Overall 4/10', ""THE WORSE ANIME EVER!! My time was wasted. Okay so the main character is that emotionless, smart dude right? He is also hot in the anime. Got this recommended on my tik tok claiming he was emotionless and chill. There's this rlly kind and cute girl with brown hair who has a crush on him and has been looking out for him their whole childhood. BUT NO, he just had to chase the stupid blue haired girl that just appeared and straight up starts simping. Like the blue haired girl was only in his life for a couple years and that was when he was...really little but the brown hair girl was there for you from your childhood to your teen years. Um, I thought the main character was suppose to be emotionless but instead he catches feelings for this random rude girl. NOT JUST THE CHARACTERS ARE BAD BUT THE PLOT! It was so boring and basically an experiment for these 7 random ass people to try connecting with each other through pain. The experiment was so unnecessary and will not revolutionize the world in any way. And the back story is not deep as well. Just some dumb asses who wanted to conduct human experiments with emotions and then decided to continue it years later. I hate the blue haired girl so much. really little but the brown hair girl was there for you from your childhood to your teen years.

(RE-UPLOAD)Have you ever planned to watch an anime with no expectation then it impressed you so much? For me, Kiznaiver is the first anime in that situation.I read the synopsis of it and found it interesting but thought it would probably be really bad. When I watched the first episode I was impressed and it was interesting. Then I continued and ''Now, this is really good.''The thing that I liked most about the anime is everything fits the anime nearly perfectly. The art, the music, the characters, everything... Just give the director his award already!Every episode I get sad because I think ''This probably...will be the best episode, I don't think they are able to make better episodes.'' then next episode I live the same situation. Seriously how can an anime  get so much better in every episode.Story: 9/10First of all, I have to mention about Kizuna System. So, if I understood correctly, The main purpose of the system is ensuring peace. If people connect to each other and share their pains they will understand each other's feelings too. As a result, there will be peace. Am I right?So a group of teenagers are connected to each other, and they share the pain and emotions under the name of ''Kizuna System''. I have to say the story is really interesting. The dominant part is the mystery, ''What is this system?'' ''What is the purpose?'' ''What happened to Sonozaki?''. These questions were the ones I was mostly curious about and I'm really happy they all solved. It is kinda slow pacing, most of the questions are answered at the end of the anime (I mean last 3 episodes) and before those episodes, the anime was full of character developments, comedy and drama. This anime is actually based on the characters and all episodes are plotting the characters and their feelings so about story being interesting is enough. And it's getting more and more interesting every episode.Art: 10/10I can't imagine a better art style for this anime. It could be just good for another anime but it gives you the feel like it is created just for this one.Sound: 10/10I have to say, the first thing impressed me in the anime is the opening. When I first watched it, the animation and its style made me feel like I was reborning. So, did the music. I wanted the opening to last forever, I wanted it to never end. The ending is awesome, too. For me, they are the second best opening and ending this season. And the insert musics are also really good. Especially the final episode, you can feel the all thrilling and sad moments.Characters: 9-10/10The characters are probably the most important thing to me (when watching anime), maybe even more important than story and I become so happy when I see the characters are developing. This anime has 8 important characters. They all are seriously MAIN characters. They all have feelings and past, and the anime is based on those. All characters are original and have so different qualities. One of them is even masochist. I said the main question was ''What happened to Sonozaki (and between Katsuhira)?''. So she was the key character. First episodes she was like an emotionless annoying character and people didn't like her, but last episodes (especially last scene of the 10th episode) she won our hearts. Nico was the most friendly and funny one, Chidori suffered a lot because of her feeling to Katsuhira, and Katsuhira was always brave. But still I think the most developed character is Maki (or maybe Sonozaki).Enjoyment: 10/10*Starts episode, the opening begins* - 10 second later - *The ending starts*Seriously I can't figure out how fast it pasts. This anime can be so boring for some people (especially who don't like slow pacing, character-based animes and who like action) but I'm enjoying it a lot. And melodrama is strong in this one. I never thought teenagers drama could be sad. I think the tags should've been like ''Drama, Comedy, Psychological, Thriller, Sci-Fi''Negative Sides:- Too short. Some characters developed enough and well but we don't know much things about the others. Especially Yuta.- We don't know Chidori's final thoughts clearly. So did she get over Katsuhira and decide to be with Tenga or not?Overall: 10/10So, here is my thoughts about it. This is not kind of anime that most of the people can like, but I'm in the team of lovers. Some people think these flaws are enough to ruin an anime, but still I think it is amazing. Even I'm surprised that this anime became the top in this season for me :) will be the best episode, I don't think they are able to make better episodes.'' then next episode I live the same situation.

Even I'm surprised that this anime became the top in this season for me :)"", 'Something something, anime is saved. Except that’s for Luluco.Welcome to Keeeeeeeeeznaiver, the new full-length anime series from the meme machine known as Studio Trigger, where we come together and cut our pain into pieces. You might be thinking that this show is edgy. And it totally is. But then you watch red-headed Kamina punch someone in the face with his ass and then teabag him, and it’s reassuring that this is gonna be much more light-hearted than you’d expect.Going more into detail about what this madness is about, it’s easily one of the lamest concepts presented in a while. It’s about seven weirdos who get...linked together through pain; as in, when one of them receives physical pain, it gets distributed to the other six. And then they’re tasked to live their summer vacations while getting thrust into some weird challenges and relationships.Oh, but don’t cringe just yet, it gets even better! The Kizna system (which is the thingy that does the pain thingy) is deeper and more complicated, as the Kiznaivers (the weirdos with the pain thingy) eventually start to share emotional pain, or more specifically, heartache.As terrible as this sounds, it’s presented and written pretty well. First off is that the characters and their interactions with each other are Kiznaiver’s bread and butter, not so much the system thing. While it certainly has an impact on them and the plot itself, I was undoubtedly watching Kiznaiver for the people, not the ideas.The other thing that I respect is how the KeezNuts system is presented to the audience. A lot of series tend to sell you on concept alone, they’ll just throw their “brilliant” idea in your face and then spend the next eleven episodes on the different ways they can make it work. Kiznaiver gives us the idea in portions, acclimating the audience to reduce the amount of groans in the first episode as little as possible. I guarantee you that, if the “voice of the heart” thing was displayed in the first three episodes, this show wouldn’t have been as big of a deal as it is. (Unless you’re in Japan. Nice 600 sales rip trigger) But since the story spends time getting you hooked on the characters instead, they raise the bar when the time is right and make seem like it’s not as silly as it is.And so, the series will more-or-less live or die by your opinions on the trope-y characters. The MC Katsuhira is probably the least amusing, being a walking bag of nothing. Literally. His personality is that he has no personality. Aren’t we off to a great start?He actually isn’t some sort of self-insert light novel fuckboy, and there are good reasons for him to act the way he… well he doesn’t really act like anything, but you get the point. But it’s pretty easy to get bored of him, and even his bigger, more emotional moments rarely come through unless he does a full 180, unlike Nico.Yeah, Nico’s the super-peppy girl with the candy-colored-hair that will probably come off as annoying to others, but for me I… actually found her to be the best. While she is one of those characters that apparently needs to say something at every waking moment, I’m surprised by how not excessive she was. And being the clumsy, ditzy, idiot character that she is, her big emotional moments DO come through, and in a very big way.I won’t go into detail about everyone, but almost every character was a lot of fun in some way. While they don’t have much of a personality beyond their basic tropes, watching them do shit together was a blast. It actually makes me wish I was part of their group in some way, which is something I rarely feel. And it makes me remind myself that, oh no, I don’t actually have friends. Sasuga, Trigger. Perhaps if we were given more than twelve episodes, a lot more could’ve been done with the characters, but it is what it is.But here’s the part that’s undeniably true: the production of this anime is fucking fantastic.The character designs have a lot of… well, character. They’re colorful, they’re unique, and they have that “anime” feel without being over-the-top. Just look at the Gomorins. How can anyone hate these fuckers? Sometimes it feels that the models are a little off; dimensions are slightly distorted, hair is more like a twisty piece of metal than hair, but I more-or-less ignored that, as it adds to the overall nature of both the designs and the show. Not only that, but Kiznaiver takes place in a rather beautiful city, and so background art doesn’t lack any inspiration either. Good direction makes the visuals rather telling, with effective shot compositions and great body language and visible motions. On top of that, the animation, actual movement, is very smooth despite the complex aesthetics. All in all, it’s safe to say that Kiznaiver has a lot of ambition with its art.But the underdog of Kiznaiver is its FUCKING AMAZING soundtrack. Holy shit. Much of it is electronic, whether at a driving pace or quietly lingering in the background, but the orchestral scores hit hard. VERY hard. And one of the most interesting things is how some parts will be reversed, as to compliment a dissonant scene where the emotions aren’t at a great place and relationships are breaking apart. No insert songs are found in here, just a beautiful composition that sounds perfect at every moment.The OP and ED are no slouches, either. In fact, I daresay that A-ha’s ‘Take On Me’ is the best OP of the season.Alright, it’s actually Boom Boom Satellites and the song is called ‘Lay Your Hands On Me’, I’ll respect them since this is their last work. But lemme just say that I’ve never been a fan of these guys. They’re kinda out of my comfort zone, and I just think they sound like crap most of the time. But this one song here actually clicks; it puts you in a sweet, yet subtly melancholic trance as dizzying lights and incredibly smooth character animation arrests you visually. Put them together and you have an OP that feels unlike any other, whether you appreciate it or not.And to close each episode off, a pleasant alt-rock song by Sangatsu no Phantasia, whoever the fuck that is, leaves a bit of a hopeful atmosphere right before the next episode’s preview, as we get more shots of the beautiful characters holding flowers. Because, why not. It has a bright tone with its crystal-clear vocals and vibrant piano and violins playing over the band. Yet, it doesn’t feel overpowering or generic, it strikes a nice balance.So, uh. I bet a lot of people aren’t gonna agree with a lot of this, and I’m completely willing to admit that Kiznaiver is a flawed show and a lot of people will/do hate it, but I greatly appreciate what Kiznaiver set out to do and accomplished. This isn’t Monogatari or anything, but I’ll take it over most of the other shows that came out this season.Story - 7/10Art - 9/10Sound - 10/10Characters - 7/10Enjoyment - 8/10Shipping - Teamblueallday/10Overall - 8/10Favorite episode - 5Favorite character - NicoRecommendation level - High linked together through pain; as in, when one of them receives physical pain, it gets distributed to the other six.

Have you ever walked by a couple on the street, bickering and arguing, and suddenly wondered why people are so keen on making each other suffer? Why is it that we feel so frustrated seeing someone get viciously angry in an argument, yet when we’re actually a part of the argument, we feel justified to do so? Why is it that when we witness conflicts revolving around things we deem insignificant, we think people are ultimately petty, yet we have arguments equally as petty all the time? Why is it that we feel so frustrated when someone talks behind...our backs, yet we tend to do the same to others? These are the common hypocrisies which are the unfortunate circumstance of not being able to truly understand each other. Everyone thinks differently, feels differently, loves different, and hates differently. You can’t expect to know everything that’s going on in someones head, and trying to base your friendships, conflicts, and discussions on assumptions like this will no doubt cause trouble.But… what if we could? What if we could understand everything that someone thinks and feels? If we could get so impossibly close to someone, would we ever argue? Would we ever hate each other? I mean, how could we? If someone is basing their arguments on certain emotions that we can ALSO feel, how could we disagree? We can’t really agree, either, but when we manage to understand them on such a fundamental level, it’s hard to know what exactly would happen between us.How about we take this a step further: What if everyone in the world could feel every bit of physical and emotional pain together. Would there be no wars? No conflicts? World peace? This may seem a bit ridiculous, but it’s the main idea of Kiznaiver.Unfortunately, however, this idea is only cool on paper. What could have been an excellent character study turned out to be no more than a melodramatic trainwreck with very few redeeming qualities.-------------------------------------------------------------Terrible Execution-------------------------------------------------------------The thought of what Kiznaiver was trying to accomplish and the original ideas it had are still intriguing. It\'s incredibly interesting to think about what would happen if a group of people did share their pains, and if done with better direction, it could have been a fantastic anime.Unfortunately, however, the show takes itself in the most boring direction possible. It\'s got a stupidly complex love story, it focuses on certain characters and leaves others in the dust, and some have nice arcs while others don\'t even get arcs. Maki got a very long arc yet Niko got absolutely nothing, and not only did Niko get absolutely nothing, she got development that was based around her unexplained love for another character. It can\'t help but feel like Kiznaiver would have done much better if it were longer. It\'s hard to develop that many characters in 12 episodes and that was the biggest problem I had. However, it does a pretty okay job of developing the characters it favors. Maki\'s and Katsuhira\'s backstories are the best parts of the show. It\'s sad to think that we could have gotten an interesting backstory on five of the other characters if the creators thought to lengthen the series. Disregarding the mini-arcs, the plot itself is unsatisfactory as a whole. The direction of the series towards the end wasn\'t as interesting as I had hoped, and the way they executed the final minutes feels like a cop out compared to what could have been.-------------------------------------------------------------Stereotypical Characters-------------------------------------------------------------A friend of mine praised Kiznaiver\'s ""colorful"" cast of characters and claimed they loved how different they are from one another and how much variety the creators put into them to make them stand out from each other.Sure, I can agree.Kiznaiver is full of contrasting characters, I didn\'t find a moment where I thought any character was similar and that\'s a very important part of the story. All seven are supposed to be incompatible or else this experiment wouldn\'t work the way the scientists hoped. However, them being different from one another does not make them good.The cast is full of tropes. They may be different from each other and they may vary in personalities but they never stray outside of their tropes. They\'re trapped inside of their stereotypes and almost all of their actions are unsurprisingly predictable. Some characters got developed but even then a majority of the characters were never touched upon. Trigger plays favorites with their cast and anyone who watched the show would understand that. Specific episodes were made developing Maki and Katsuhira, yet not a single second was spent developing Hisomu. He was comedy relief and poor comedy relief at that. To make matters worse, the romance between the characters was the most frustrating aspect. The creators just forced every character to fall in love with each other in an attempt to create drama. There\'s absolutely no basis to these feelings and the characters seem to think ""it was obvious that they were in love with you"" yet none of it is noticeable besides from Chidori\'s love for Katsuhira. The characters have their moments and they\'re entertaining to watch, but as soon as the drama starts it all hits the fan.-------------------------------------------------------------Forced Drama-------------------------------------------------------------Kiznaiver displays copious amounts of drama that originates from nothing logically sound. Characters will do things for no obvious reason, which creates problems that favors the writers ongoing story. Similar to what I said early, the forced romance induces forced drama which in turn makes everything unbearable. There are a lot of moments where a character will start a conflict because of their ""love"" for someone which in most cases, makes no sense. Tenga hated Katsuhira because of what he ""did"" to Chidori and at first it made sense but even after hearing all about Katsuhira\'s backstory, he was still pissed off for no obvious reason. There\'s also how Niko was so sad about Tenga loving Chidori even though there\'s is absolutely no reason for Niko to love Tenga. It is never explained and Niko went so far as to take drastic actions based on something that was never developed. How does that make sense? One episode Niko wasn\'t in love with anyone, next episode she was full blown in love with Tenga. The only parts of the romance that felt justified was Chidori loving Katsuhira, and Katsuhira loving Noriko. I would also count Yuta\'s fixation with Maki but that seemed more like lust than love in my eyes. It feels like Trigger really wanted every character to have a romantic interest so they just forced the romance onto everyone else. It was baffling and without a doubt one of the most annoying parts of the show.You\'re probably thinking, ""people do overly-dramatic shit for stupid reasons all the time""This is true, however, if you ask any of these people they will always give you a reason. If you ask anyone in love, they will always give you a reason. Even if it\'s a stupid reason or over simplified, it\'s still what drives them. Kiznaiver makes absolutely no attempt to show or tell us why certain characters do the things they do, or why certain characters love the people they love. For some characters, you can deduce reasoning behind their actions, but for others you might as well guess.-------------------------------------------------------------Aesthetic-------------------------------------------------------------Kiznaiver is beautifully illustrated and the soundtrack is likable, as expected of Trigger. Character designs look much different from your typical anime and the art-style itself feels much different than typical Trigger titles (which is what a lot of anime studios struggle accomplishing)Also, the opening is fucking fantastic.-------------------------------------------------------------Ridiculous Inconsistencies-------------------------------------------------------------Kiznaiver felt like it was doomed from the start. When you look at a studio like Trigger and consider the idea of them making a science fiction drama, it seems a bit insane. If you\'ve ever seen a Trigger anime, you would know that they\'re usually full of the most ridiculously goofy content in the industry. The titles that come out of Trigger are usually never meant to be taken seriously with the exception of shows like Kill la Kill, but even that wasn\'t serious most of the time.Kiznaiver tries it\'s best to retain those goofy elements that made me like Kill la Kill, but it just doesn\'t work out well. It\'s hard to sit through a really dramatic scene and then half a minute later something unbelievably silly happens. It\'s seriously risky to mix drama with over the top goofiness and expect it to work out well. Some anime like Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann do this very well, but it\'s a rare occurrence. In the end it feels like the creators of this show clashed with creative differences and had no idea what they wanted it to be. It often made me wonder if I should laugh at something or if it should be taken seriously.There are specific scenes that seriously stand out from the rest, though. A few parts made my skin crawl and I felt goosebumps all over my body. Unfortunately, the immersion quickly breaks when something stupid happens.-------------------------------------------------------------Verdict-------------------------------------------------------------Kiznaiver shines every once in a while but for the most part watching it was frustrating. It had moments where it seemed like it could be great but in the end it disappointed me beyond belief. The stupid drama, nonsensical romance, and underdeveloped characters took away any semblance of enjoyment that was present. For the most part, it\'s still worth a watch simply because the parts that shine happen to shine very brightly. The comedy is enjoyable and the characters spasms are always fun to watch, but once it gets to the drama it\'s usually unbearable. Kiznaiver would have worked better as a goofy slice of life rather than the melodramatic train wreck it became. Either that, or the writers at least trying to fix their mistakes especially since this show had an insane amount of potential. our backs, yet we tend to do the same to others? These are the common hypocrisies which are the unfortunate circumstance of not being able to truly understand each other. Everyone thinks differently, feels differently, loves different, and hates differently. You can’t expect to know everything that’s going on in someones head, and trying to base your friendships, conflicts, and discussions on assumptions like this will no doubt cause trouble.But… what if we could? What if we could understand everything that someone thinks and feels? If we could get so impossibly close to someone, would we ever argue? Would we ever hate each other? I mean, how could we? If someone is basing their arguments on certain emotions that we can ALSO feel, how could we disagree? We can’t really agree, either, but when we manage to understand them on such a fundamental level, it’s hard to know what exactly would happen between us.How about we take this a step further: What if everyone in the world could feel every bit of physical and emotional pain together. Would there be no wars? No conflicts? World peace? This may seem a bit ridiculous, but it’s the main idea of Kiznaiver.Unfortunately, however, this idea is only cool on paper. What could have been an excellent character study turned out to be no more than a melodramatic trainwreck with very few redeeming qualities.-------------------------------------------------------------Terrible Execution-------------------------------------------------------------The thought of what Kiznaiver was trying to accomplish and the original ideas it had are still intriguing. It\'s incredibly interesting to think about what would happen if a group of people did share their pains, and if done with better direction, it could have been a fantastic anime.Unfortunately, however, the show takes itself in the most boring direction possible. It\'s got a stupidly complex love story, it focuses on certain characters and leaves others in the dust, and some have nice arcs while others don\'t even get arcs. Maki got a very long arc yet Niko got absolutely nothing, and not only did Niko get absolutely nothing, she got development that was based around her unexplained love for another character. It can\'t help but feel like Kiznaiver would have done much better if it were longer. It\'s hard to develop that many characters in 12 episodes and that was the biggest problem I had. However, it does a pretty okay job of developing the characters it favors. Maki\'s and Katsuhira\'s backstories are the best parts of the show. It\'s sad to think that we could have gotten an interesting backstory on five of the other characters if the creators thought to lengthen the series. Disregarding the mini-arcs, the plot itself is unsatisfactory as a whole. The direction of the series towards the end wasn\'t as interesting as I had hoped, and the way they executed the final minutes feels like a cop out compared to what could have been.-------------------------------------------------------------Stereotypical Characters-------------------------------------------------------------A friend of mine praised Kiznaiver\'s ""colorful"" cast of characters and claimed they loved how different they are from one another and how much variety the creators put into them to make them stand out from each other.Sure, I can agree.Kiznaiver is full of contrasting characters, I didn\'t find a moment where I thought any character was similar and that\'s a very important part of the story.

Either that, or the writers at least trying to fix their mistakes especially since this show had an insane amount of potential.', 'Ah Kiznaiver. From the studio that bought forth the crazy battle-centric Kill la Kill and supernatural battle school theme series When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace emerges this series. As an original title, I had some doubts about the show at first. Because quite honestly, the show’s premise invites a lot of questions. These may include what exactly is the “Kizuna system”, what’s its purpose, and why does it exist?Coming into this series, I was a little intimidated at first. The idea of the Kizuna system brings a connection between characters (whom become known as “Kiznaiver”) through human emotions by sharing wounds and pain. These...emotions ranges from sorrow, regret, pain, and even love. As part of the story, we also get a deeper insight about the origins of the system. Apparently, the system was designed to explore human feelings and making characters more aware of them for world peace. The characters begins to realize these inner feelings and learns about their close peers and even themselves. From a story point of view, it opens up a lot of possibilities for characterization. In addition, Kiznaiver also does a neat job at crafting a thrilling theater that builds more and more as each episode progresses. Emotions also emerge throughout the series and there’s definitely to worry about. Considering that Mari Okada is directing the series, you should be prepared for some sort of emotional delivery. At times, I feel like the show is trying way too hard to get across the point. While other times, I think it comes out more naturally between the story and characters.For what’s worth though, Kiznaiver take advantage of its premise quite a bit. From the first few episodes, we have a mysterious girl named Noriko who immediately takes interest in the main protagonists in particular Katsuhira. Their relationship can be described as strange but also familiar. This is because the two already seem to have history judging by the flashbacks and segments. And despite Katsuhira not knowing it, he feels a strange connection to Noriko. This also links a connection to the Kizuna system as we’ll discover a darker side of science. From an experimental point of view, the show makes it clear that the system is far from perfect. The kids who underwent experimentation are more like their former selves, kind of like a shell. In the meantime, the show will also explore how the Kizuna system influences relationships in the present.And to be quite honest, relationship dynamics is an important aspect in the show. The main male protagonist Katsuhira has some obvious chemistry with Tenga and Chidori. So much in fact, there’s hints of romance that formulates into a generic love triangle. On the other hand, there’s a general melancholic-like mood throughout the show about relationships. Take a look at Maki for instance. Remember, the series likes to express emotions and sorrow is definitely one of those as well. Maki’s guilt (based on her background story with another classmate) shows a fragile side of her personality. One thing I do praise on Kiznaiver is the heavy writing to get the audience to understand more about the characters. From a personal view, it makes the characters more believable. Even Noriko, the most mysterious character in the show can be understood better once we see a deeper side of her story. Unfortunately, the series still relies a lot on its relationship angles especially when it comes to romance. In the latter half of the show, there’s some particular segments that makes you really roll your eyes about Katsuhira’s role.As with most series from studio Trigger, they often tend to go overboard with its gimmicks. Kiznaiver isn’t an exception to that either especially with such a thrilling premise. But for what it advertises, the show itself falls between the lines of silliness, intimate, and emotional. In essence, the comedy is a hit or miss because generally, the jokes are often outstretched than what they should be. The emotional segments tries way too hard on many occasions in particular one climatic episode when the Kizuna system affects the characters at its peak. And finally, the show’s narrative often pushes the story in ways that becomes predictable or repetitive. The over-saturated exposition about the Kizuna system doesn’t really make strong impressions. In fact, the plot device is probably the least interesting part of the entire show.In terms of artwork, Kiznaiver gives off a vibrant feeling. The characters look colorful with some generic traits to match their personalities. The setting itself has the feel of a futuristic world with more advanced technology. However, not everything looks very solid in terms of design. From a personal point of view, the characters looks rather cartoonish. From the various character expressions to their clothing designs, it seems that Trigger designed them to reflect their outer image. It’s important to also realize that feelings expressed in the show needs to be portrayed accurately and thankfully, Kiznaiver handles that well.While the soundtrack is generally moderate, there’s more depth to the character voice mannerisms. Remember, the show is about expressing human feelings so the voice of the characters is a necessity to match their roles. While it gives off a decent first impression, there’s not much more that it improves on. However, I would like to praise Nico’s performance as a girl that can express both strong emotions such as sorrow and happiness. While she is childish on many occasions, the VA brings the best out of her as a character.The bottom line is, Kiznaiver is generally a show that overhyped itself. This thoughtful and intriguing premise in the end turned into a mixed bag of sour storytelling. Although taking a closer glance, the characterization is fairly well done with what it has to offer. For Trigger, this show’s comedy doesn’t cross the line compared to some of its other works. However, it still takes you on a ride of electrifying shenanigans. And in the end, it will make your eyes roll. emotions ranges from sorrow, regret, pain, and even love. As part of the story, we also get a deeper insight about the origins of the system.

For Trigger, this show’s comedy doesn’t cross the line compared to some of its other works. However, it still takes you on a ride of electrifying shenanigans. And in the end, it will make your eyes roll.', ""Human emotions is a topic that has always proved to be challenging to present in any form of media. It is something very vast and the understanding of which completely varies from person to person, thus often leads people to having different perspectives towards the work in question. Kiznaiver stood as one of the shows to take this challenge upon itself but like most, was unable to deliver in a way that could be deemed worthwhile.Story:The concept and setting of the show is fairly interesting. It’s sure to grab anyone’s attention as the nature of the show holds a lot of potential for deep storytelling...and emotional scenarios. Unfortunately, the show does not manage to fully utilize whatever it had at hand, and how is that? Well, to make things simple, let’s consider both halves of the show separately.The first half, right of the bat was off to a pretty poor start as most of the earlier episodes revolve around scenarios that could be considered as pointless time wasting. While it can be seen that these scenarios were meant to serve as development for both the characters and story, it still feels as if they were put out just to fill in for something that was necessary for the buildup of the series and would provide as a foundation for the events to come later. Because of which, they come out as generic slice-of-life events that you’d see in any other show but without having any unique appeal for itself. While some viewers might be able to find value within the enjoyment of these scenarios, others could very well end up considering them as something meaningless altogether. But even then there’s no heart put into them and just feel as if they were added to get the job done quickly so that the writers could start focusing on the other half of the story. Which was seemingly the main part of it.The second half offers more backstory to some of the characters and some nice development while also offering a deeper take on the entire series… Or at least it tries to. The thing is, while the idea might seem very nice, the same can’t be said about the way it’s carried out. It feels rather vague and just doesn’t provide the proper kind of development that you’d need in order to truly feel for the more emotional situations that come later on. The progression feels very off and the pace by which the show goes barely even gives you the chance to care about any of the events. You can tell that it tries to be dramatic, but just doesn't manage to get anywhere with it.Art and Animation:Studio Trigger managed to do well in this regard as it mostly has in the past. The art direction is really well done and the sharp, bright visuals are very eye catching. The brightly colored backgrounds also added more depth to the overall surroundings and was altogether something nice to look at. The animation is also smooth for the most part but it can get rather inconsistent at times.Sound:The soundtrack within the show is fairly nice but it’s still not something I would particularly praise. There were moments when the soundtrack fit with the show’s mood really well though and do stand as some nice pieces on their own but they don’t really effect the atmosphere all that much. At the very least, the right tracks were played at the right time and nothing in particular ever felt out of place in this regard.I did however, enjoy the Opening sequence quite a bit. It’s nicely presented and has some very eye catching visuals and screenplay along with good music. Just a good opening overall. Really did impress me the first time I saw it.Characters:Quite sadly, the character department was one of Kiznaiver’s weakest areas as not only did the cast feel bland to begin with, but also felt neglected for the most part. While the show does provide a reasonable amount of character development for a few characters, at the same time it disregards the others. Being a show with a main group of eight characters, it felt as if only a few in the group actually mattered and the others were there just to fill in space, a couple of ‘extras’. What also stems from this is that the chemistry between said characters felt extremely unnatural and forced. The characters do present themselves in a fun way and were entertaining at times with their quirky personas but felt limited to those personas and didn’t manage to go much further with their character (except for a very few). They felt extremely flat and whatever supposed 'depth' that was provided to us could barely be considerable, because of which these characters just end up becoming another generic cast that's easily forgettable.Presentation:This is where the show lacks the most. One of the biggest issues that Kiznaiver had was with its dramatics. Most of the time, the more emotional scenes aren’t carried out as well as they could’ve been and also due to the progression of the show and the nature of the characters, very rarely would the viewer feel any sentiments with the drama. The scenario execution is poor, which is sad, considering that there were a few moments for which I truly felt that they could’ve came out as something beautiful if portrayed properly but rather what we were presented with was an abundance of melodrama and forced romance. Also, because of this, nothing ever feels as important as it should. It lacks the qualities which makes a viewer care, whether that be for the characters or for the entire show.Conclusion and Verdict:Even though Kiznaiver offered a good concept, the lackluster presentation and writing held it back from achieving anything noteworthy. If you can look past the flaws and enjoy the show for its nice visuals or just manage to appreciate it for the concept itself then you just might be able to find something in it. Otherwise if you’re expecting a dramatic experience with solid writing then there are far better options within the medium. and emotional scenarios.

It lacks the qualities which makes a viewer care, whether that be for the characters or for the entire show.Conclusion and Verdict:Even though Kiznaiver offered a good concept, the lackluster presentation and writing held it back from achieving anything noteworthy. If you can look past the flaws and enjoy the show for its nice visuals or just manage to appreciate it for the concept itself then you just might be able to find something in it. Otherwise if you’re expecting a dramatic experience with solid writing then there are far better options within the medium."", ""Kiznaiver was the latest anime production by Studio Trigger, a studio who I really like and the one I am most anticipating whenever a new anime is announced from this studio. However, Kiznaiver, while not a bad show, was one with a lot of forced drama and it's characters felt more so like plot devices than actual people.The main problem I had with this anime was the narrative and the characters. Now, on their own, I found the characters to be fun and likeable, and the interactions and comedy between them felt natural and genuinely funny. The only problem with the comedy was the timing....Often, they'd combine the comedy with the more serious, dramatic scenes and it just didn't work, thus dragging me out of some scenes and made me lose immersion. As the show progressed every week, the narrative became weaker and weaker to the point that some scenes were too stupid and too silly to take seriously and as a result made some of the drama feel weak.There is a lot of forced drama and character development in the series. None of the actions the characters take or their decisions felt natural and progressed in such a way that felt rushed and kind of tacked on. Many characters made stupid decisions just for the sake of pushing this drama and a lot of the characters felt more so like plot devices, written for a convenient way to push the story forward whenever necessary. Some development came too little too late and by this time I didn't care about the character since the show never gave me any reason to in the first place. Some of the character development (such as with Honoka) was handled pretty well and by the end, I actually liked this character but others were either forced or lacked any in the first place.Many of the themes and ideas in the anime are far too apparent and pretty much are spoon fed to the audience, as if we're unable to interpret anything ourselves. It has themes, but doesn't really do anything with them and presents them in such a way as to insult the intelligence of its audience.However, there were many things I did enjoy about this anime. For starters, despite the characters having forced drama, they're at least fun and entertaining to watch and the characterisation for most of the characters is pretty good. Also, the animation and character designs was also very well done, and the general look and feel of Kiznaiver was great. The sound, shot composition and music was all great especially in the climax of the ninth episode, which I felt was very well directed. It's just a shame that the story and character development doesn't hold up the rest of the anime.Kiznaiver does try hard to develop its own characters and themes, while having a legitimately interesting premise but it seems to fall short of its true potential, which is a shame. There were many things I loved about the show but it would have been better if the script and characters were more fleshed out.In conclusion, not a bad show, but far from perfect.

to describe what this anime is about.Story(7/10)Kiznaiver is an anime that focuses more on the characters and their development rather than the story.Because of that,there is the imminent confusion to where the plot intends to go.It starts with Katsuhira and his dream of a blue haired girl telling him that ''he'll definitely get his pain back''.Because of his lack of feelings,Kacchon is bullied and extorted money from.One day he meets a mysterious girl who pushes him off the stairs.The protagonist wakes up in what seems to...be an surgery room and the earlier figure who introduces herself as Sonozaki explains to him that he's been ''chosen'' to participate in an experiment with 5(later 6) of his classmates in which their pain is divided and felt between each other.They are put to make all kinds of tests to reveal their most embarassing secrets and missions to help each other whenever one is in torment.It mostly is that but then it's revealed that the experiment is not as safe as they thought and some were affected by it and while at it,the reason for Kacchon's lack of feel.And as the MC gains his feelings,he demonstrates a few things to Sonozaki too.It's quite cute and it has an interesting sense of humour.I also like the bonds they formed between them and there are some ships to sail too.Felt quite heartwarming at times to me so that's why it gets a passing grade.Art(8/10)I dig colorful art like chocolates as presents.The characters are soo rainbow inspired(as most MCs in anime intended for younger audiences).I don't have anything to complain but it still didn't leave my mouth gaping,most likely because the only interactions it focused on was talking.Sound(7/10)The op gave me a hypnotic high kind of feel and while I liked the ed,it didn't attract me especially.None of my favorite seiyuus but Nico's voice is too cute to ignore.Character(8/10)We have an emotionless MC and his emotionless love interest,an childhood friend,the macho guy,the narcissist,the energetic weirdo,the masochist and the girl who has a sad past so she doesn't want to have anything to do with anyone.They are characterised by Sonozaki as ''the seven deadly sins'' because of their obvious flaws that prevent them from making friends.All in all,the characters are lovable,even if they are not the most unique.Of course,that should be a given,as this focuses on the characters more.I could recommend watching this if only for the masochist's weird moans and reactions and Honoka's acidic remarks.Enjoyment(8/10)I strangely enjoyed seeing those teenagers going through their angst and misunderstandings,and the weird love octagon formed between them.This most likely is a representation of one of the questions which humans always asked themselves:how do you understand other people and the feelings they have?Overall(8/10)Despite the mixed reviews this anime has,I liked it.Not most try do something besides the normal friendship formula so this was an intriguing take on what it means to be connected and have bonds.I would recommend watching this for the lols,the colorful characters and maybe if you want a bit of a change from what you usually watch. be an surgery room and

What does it mean to love? What does it mean to be a friend? Kiznaiver, a Drama/SciFi manga adaptation from Studio Trigger (Spring 2016), takes a stab at a heavily character driven story and completely succeeds. The show uses it’s beautiful animation + soundtrack, objectively unique and strong characterization, and deep philosophical questioning of human connection to deliver a new twist on the plot of Rebirth and a meaningful re-imagination of anime’s friendship cliché.Love or hate the show, there’s no denying Studio Trigger ‘showed up’ for the art of Kiznaiver. Each character has an identity, their looks reflecting...their personalities brilliantly, not to mention their body language. Simply watching the intro, we are given a grand spectacle which imprints an understanding of the characters early on, before we have even met most of cast (but I’ll be going more in depth on Kiznaiver’s OP on my blog at a later time). Each character is visually appealing and expressive, giving the audience little reason to turn away from the screen for a majority of the series. Even those with little emotion in the show are extremely interesting to look at, allowing the director (Hiroshi Kobayashi) to set up some genuinely funny and serious moments as a result. On top of that, the animation itself is phenomenal, making use of fluid dynamic camera angles and the works.As far as audio goes for the show, it is great. The music rises and falls in a perfect flow for the narrative, and knows when to go completely silence to let powerful lines of dialogue hit hard. Yuuki Hayashi (previous works including: Haikyuu!, Death Parade, and Boku no Hero Academia) was in charge of music for this series, and did a terrific job. The music for the opening and endings are fantastic (the op being the thing that drew me in to watch the series in the first place), and the ed following up was a great touch to every episode (the ed being another thing I’d like to go in depth on at a later date). Going past the music, the sound effects were spot on. The fictional sound effects that was generated for group’s connected pain was intuitive and, for how often its heard, never gets distracting or feel out of place. Well done over all.(Plot Summary will be kept to a minimum for MAL review guidelines)Getting into the story, the plot revolves around seven main characters, the most prominent being: Katsuhira Agata (or Kacchon). Katsuhira is completely unable to feel pain, and is emotionally distant from the world. A glimpse into his past in the first minute of the pilot shows him at a young age chasing after a girl standing on a roof. While trying to talk her down, she grins and jumps. He cries out, reaches down to his chest in pain and his hair turns white (see: Marie Antoinette syndrome). This scene sets up a potent understanding of, and connection to, our protagonist as we view his behavior and hear his first few words. In this scene he is holding conversation with Chidori Takashiro, a close friend growing up. He asks why a cicada bothered coming to the surface: its safer underground and it won’t live very long anyways. Chidori replies, “Maybe it wanted friends, or something?” It is the brilliance of these lines, that expose us to the main ideas of the plot while giving an introduction to these character’s personalities and already starts to build a connection with these characters.As the story progresses, Katsuharia meets a strange girl who we later find out to be Noriko Sonozaki. She tells him that people bully him because he doesn’t get scared, and doesn’t feel pain, meaning others “cannot find themselves within him”. As he processes these words, she suddenly throws him down a flight of stairs, knocking him out. Upon waking up he is in a hospital with 5 other individuals. They are informed they are a part of the “Kiznaivers experiment” and they are now connected by their wounds. If one individual experiences pain it will be divided equally between everyone connected, in an attempt to create true human connections. The others who are chosen for the experiment were selected under the criteria that they would have never met normally or got along with each other, as well as loosely fitting the definition of the seven deadly sins (or an updated version for modern japan). These differences in characters truly play into the strength of the show’s characterization as each one is unique. From their designs, to body language, to behavior; but it doesn’t stop there. Each character has very human flaws, insecurities, and desires; so when the characters get time on screen you to truly begin to understand them and connect. No character can simply fill an archetype, as they are all diverse and feel deeply human, and in their doing so: Trigger has made a colorful cast of individuals who you want to know more about. This creates an environment where every line and decision made feel purposeful and impactful to the group as they learn how to get along.Lastly, the show taps into a deeper philisophical question, of how do humans connect? Human inherently are not perfect, and as a result of this connection with others is not always simple. Especially in our age of internet its easy to keep to ourselves. In context of Katsuhira’s cicada, why bother going outside where you have to open up and can get hurt? We die too soon anyways. We can see an argument formed through the show’s use of the Kiznaiver experiment, This creates a literal empathy between the characters, and over the course of the show we see these individuals grow, connect and change. They will never be the same people they were at the start. They’ve opened up slowly and they will get hurt along the way. The guy doesn’t always get the girl, others don’t always return their feelings, tragic events can completely destroy friendships, but as humans we keep on moving. The show doesn’t sugar coat the hardships, but it shows us the joy in making the connections, to being a friend to some body. Characters may not end up with who you want them to, and while this has been known to piss some viewers off, we should really see it as beautiful thing. That’s not how real life works, why should it in the show? Getting to know these people so well, you want these relationships to blossom as much as the characters themselves, so it can hurt when we get the truth, but in the end they come to terms with things and learn to live on. This is the re-imagination of the ‘friendship’ trope; we aren’t forcefed a “friendship concquers all” scenario, but instead are eased into a more human and compelling arguement of: “connection with others gives meaning to life”. The main theme the show is presenting is: people need to open up. It’s not easy, you will get hurt, and need to share that pain with those closest to you. But goddamn is it ever worth it.TL;DR+ Beautifully Animated+ Deeper Themes to make you think+ Strong connection with the cast makes dialogue feel purposeful, and decisions feel impactful– Plot lags in the interest of character development– It had to EndIf I have to put a number to it:9/10 their personalities brilliantly, not to mention their body language.

Few of the conversations between the characters feel legitimate as the characters are screaming the situation at you and telling you how to feel. Dialogue is meant to be utilised to give the...audience a sense of the character\'s personalities, their feelings and their goals. However, in Kiznaiver\'s case the characters just downright tell the audience what to think and it leaves you unaffected as there is nothing to care about as the character interactions feel so forced. For a show that is meant to be about friendship and the importance of communication, the show does a horrible job of developing actual friendships as all the characters and their supposed friendship feels disingenuous.The Kizna system itself, what is meant to be the entire focal point of the show, eventually disintegrates and simply becomes a gimmicky tool to advance the story rather than tell the story. This really annoyed me as the system, though pretty ridiculous as a concept, introduced some really interesting themes that the show could of discussed and developed. The  show alludes to some of these themes but are ultimately overlooked in favour of furthering the idea of ""friendship can overcome anything"" motif. By the end of the show every bit of dialogue is just repeating and repeating this same fucking point until it begins to drive you insane. I FUCKING GET IT ALREADY- FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC! The show ends with the characters having some big ""we\'re all so close"" scene which is splashed in unearned pathos as I felt nothing for any of these characters since the show has used its time to simply tell us what to think and feel rather than develop the fucking characters and their relationships.On the topic of character development: there is almost none. Most of the characters in this show don\'t development beyond their cliche\'s and those that do like Honoka end up just reverting right back into their cliche outside of the forced sentimental moments. I don\'t buy that the characters screaming ""We are good friends now, just accept it"" makes them friends, characters need to actually develop in order for that to be the chase which simply doesn\'t happen. That being said the show does have its genuine moments. Honoka\'s arc is the best bit about the show and I feel some of the conversations between Honoka, Nico and Yuta display moments of  genuine growth and investment. However, once this arc finishes it almost just reverts back to normal and the characters don\'t act like they\'ve developed at all unless the show calls for it but overall it just comes off unconvincing.The only other thing about the show I can be assed mentioning is the soundtrack as the OP and ED are both good and the soundtrack is pretty solid throughout the course of the show.Overall, this show has moments of greatness but falls victim to bad writing, horrible pacing and pathos that ultimately leave the characters ""friendship"" feeling major league unconvincing and unmemorable. audience a sense of the character\'s personalities, their feelings and their goals.

Well, Kiznaiver shows us how and they did a pretty good job presenting us how[Story]: (7/10)One day Katsuhira, Chidori, and four other teenagers are abducted and forced to join the Kizuna System as official ""Kiznaivers."" Those taking part are connected through pain: if one member is injured, the others will feel an equal amount of agony. These individuals must become the lab rats and...scapegoats of an incomplete system designed with world peace in mind. With their fates literally intertwined, the Kiznaivers must expose their true selves to each other, or risk failing much more than just the Kizuna System.The story of Kiznaiver is nothing new. High school students are forced to be together and they eventually learn about each other and all that crap. I\'ve seen another anime that did pretty much the same thing called ""Kokoro Connect"". The only difference is they literally feel each other\'s pain and this is just an experiment while Kokoro Connect is some mysterious entity forcing high school friends to work together or else they suffer the ""consequences"".The plot of the show is decent and much of the show is focused on developing each and every main character in the series. I guess you can say that Kiznaiver has a ""Forced Character Development"". While that may be a bad move for most series, for Kiznaiver, it\'s not. That\'s the whole point of the series and it magically works.My review for this section will be short since I\'ll be focusing much of my review on the characters itself. Meaning most of my review will be on the ""Characters"" section.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)I don\'t know what it is about Trigger\'s animation that I find so appealing and unique. Maybe it\'s because the way they draw their characters or how weird the visuals and some of the character designs look. Whatever, it doesn\'t matter because I weirdly love it for whatever reason.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (8/10)Some of the OST\'s stood out like the theme that plays during the action scenes or scenes that has no action but is super intense but for the most part, the soundtrack is just average and not really worth mentioning. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME by Boom Boom Satellites"". The ED theme song is Hajimari no Sokudo"" by Sangatsu no PhantasiaI\'m sorry guys but I\'m going to be on the minority here and I will say that I hate the OP theme song. It\'s boring and I don\'t know what it is about the OP that people find appealing. On the other hand, I love the ED theme song. The singer has a nice voice and there are actual lyrics playing on the song instead of ""Woahhh Layyyy Youuurrrr Haaaaands On Meeee!"" which to me is not an actual song and more like a theme to something.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (9.5/10)""Character Development: The Animation""^^In my opinion, that title fits perfectly on what the show portrayed. When I first watched the series, I knew the character development would be amazing like Kokoro Connect and after 12 episodes, the show proved me right. Literally every single main characters here gets a screentime of their own and they will get a character development. It\'s like the Kizna Experiment is (not literally) stripping them down and exposing their main flaws and weakness that made them who they are today. Funny because I said the same thing when I wrote a review of Kokoro Connect.Anyways, at first, the characters may come out as either super-cliche or just plain boring but as the series goes on, you\'ll understand why they\'re like that and you\'ll love these characters for who they are. Well, I did anyways. An example is Katsuhira Agata. When I first saw his character in episode 1, I thought he was going to be one of those silent and bland protagonists that we have seen a million times before. I don\'t know what it is about the silent types in anime that Japanese audiences find appealing but I\'m tired of it. Except, he\'s not your typical silent dude. There\'s a reason why he\'s an insensitive and emotionless freak who doesn\'t feel any pain. They explained in the last 2-3 episodes and to be honest, those episodes were very emotional for me. To think how much kids have suffered just because of the Kizna experiment.Kiznaiver has one -- if not -- the best character introductions I have ever seen in my entire f*cking life. If you check Chibi\'s episode 2 reaction to Kiznaiver, you can see that I left a comment saying the same thing and apparently, a lot of people agreed with me. Why the hell would I say that though? I\'m going to explain. In my 1 year of watching anime, the way they introduced their characters is super boring and filled with expositions that makes it very hard for me to watch the first couple of episodes when I want to watch a new series. Kiznaiver is an exception. It\'s either introducing yourself to the party or you suffer the consequences. There\'s an exciting twist that makes Kiznaiver\'s character introduction so thrilling. Plus, during those character introductions..the experiment exposes that they may seem like your usual cliche characters that fits into one of the character stereotypes but there\'s a reason why they\'re even that way in the first place. The writers intended them to be that way and they have a reason why they\'re like that.When it comes to character drama, not everyone will like it and it is evident (based on what I\'ve read from people\'s opinions) that the community is split in half when it comes Kiznaivers character drama moments. 50% will like/love it and 50% will not like it because it\'s too melodramatic for them. If you ask me, I\'m kind of on both sides. While I agree that the show\'s drama is so over the top, like the love triangles and how everyone in the groups loves someone in the group, I also disagree with the fact that Kiznaiver\'s drama as a whole is melodramatic. Besides the love triangle or pentagram or whatever , the show did a good job with its drama. The dramatic story that I want to use is Maki and her friend Ruru and their relationship. In my opinion, it was very well done. When Ruru showed her feelings to Maki, Maki didn\'t give her back the same feelings. Even though Maki is in love with Ruru, she didn\'t want their relationship to go any more further because Maki knows her fate. If she responded to Ruru\'s feelings, it would have hurt her more emotionally once she dies so she decided to just ignore her. This is actually one of those ""Pick your poison"" moments. If she responded to her feelings then she\'d have to endure a more emotional pain once she dies while ignoring her would have caused her emotional pains too but not as hard or as painful as the first one. Their relationship also f*cking hit me right in the center of my heart which still hurts for whatever reason.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)I don\'t follow Trigger nor do I follow any anime news. So my expectations were at 1% when I first watched the series but after watching the first couple of episodes, I was very surprised. It exceeded my every expectations and after watching Kiznaiver, I expect every author/writer to write an exciting character introduction instead of our usual boring-ass character introduction. In other words, I\'m expecting changes.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]Kiznaiver was an exciting series to watch and it\'s a series that I didn\'t even plan to watch for Spring 2016. It exceeded my every expectations. While the show\'s plot may be weak, which is the reason why the show\'s overall score for me is an 8.5, the character development, on the other hand, is amazing. I never expected I would get emotionally invested in most of the main characters, especially Maki and her relationship with Ruru. In my opinion, the show\'s weakest plot point is its love triangle and some melodramatic scenes. After being disappointed with Trigger\'s Kill La Kill, Kiznaiver is currently the best show from Trigger. This makes me gain hope for Trigger and makes me excited for their future works.[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)Pros:+Amazing Character Development+Kiznaiver currently has one of the best character introductions+Trigger\'s Unique Animation+Most Character Dramatic moments are well doneCons:-Weak Plot-The Love Triangle Plot is completely melodramatic. scapegoats of an incomplete system designed with world peace in mind. With their fates literally intertwined, the Kiznaivers must expose their true selves to each other, or risk failing much more than just the Kizuna System.The story of Kiznaiver is nothing new. High school students are forced to be together and they eventually learn about each other and all that crap. I\'ve seen another anime that did pretty much the same thing called ""Kokoro Connect"". The only difference is they literally feel each other\'s pain and this is just an experiment while Kokoro Connect is some mysterious entity forcing high school friends to work together or else they suffer the ""consequences"".The plot of the show is decent and much of the show is focused on developing each and every main character in the series. I guess you can say that Kiznaiver has a ""Forced Character Development"". While that may be a bad move for most series, for Kiznaiver, it\'s not. That\'s the whole point of the series and it magically works.My review for this section will be short since I\'ll be focusing much of my review on the characters itself. Meaning most of my review will be on the ""Characters"" section.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10)I don\'t know what it is about Trigger\'s animation that I find so appealing and unique. Maybe it\'s because the way they draw their characters or how weird the visuals and some of the character designs look. Whatever, it doesn\'t matter because I weirdly love it for whatever reason.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (8/10)Some of the OST\'s stood out like the theme that plays during the action scenes or scenes that has no action but is super intense but for the most part, the soundtrack is just average and not really worth mentioning. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)The OP theme song is ""LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME by Boom Boom Satellites"". The ED theme song is Hajimari no Sokudo"" by Sangatsu no PhantasiaI\'m sorry guys but I\'m going to be on the minority here and I will say that I hate the OP theme song. It\'s boring and I don\'t know what it is about the OP that people find appealing. On the other hand, I love the ED theme song. The singer has a nice voice and there are actual lyrics playing on the song instead of ""Woahhh Layyyy Youuurrrr Haaaaands On Meeee!"" which to me is not an actual song and more like a theme to something.______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (9.5/10)""Character Development: The Animation""^^In my opinion, that title fits perfectly on what the show portrayed. When I first watched the series, I knew the character development would be amazing like Kokoro Connect and after 12 episodes, the show proved me right. Literally every single main characters here gets a screentime of their own and they will get a character development. It\'s like the Kizna Experiment is (not literally) stripping them down and exposing their main flaws and weakness that made them who they are today. Funny because I said the same thing when I wrote a review of Kokoro Connect.Anyways, at first, the characters may come out as either super-cliche or just plain boring but as the series goes on, you\'ll understand why they\'re like that and you\'ll love these characters for who they are. Well, I did anyways. An example is Katsuhira Agata. When I first saw his character in episode 1, I thought he was going to be one of those silent and bland protagonists that we have seen a million times before. I don\'t know what it is about the silent types in anime that Japanese audiences find appealing but I\'m tired of it. Except, he\'s not your typical silent dude. There\'s a reason why he\'s an insensitive and emotionless freak who doesn\'t feel any pain. They explained in the last 2-3 episodes and to be honest, those episodes were very emotional for me.

The main cast are a bunch of eccentrics, some stand out and some feel underwhelming. The stylistic visuals are nice to look at but any other show can uphold that characteristic. The Kizna System is an interesting concept that could have been used as a subversion of “the bonds of friendship” cliché, yet it tries to reinforce that very own cliché and even wander into romance territory.The “sharing of pain” is not properly grounded. What if the other person...gets sick? Will everyone get sick as well? The limits are not really set yet the show tries to venture towards the emotional territory later on which gets really complicated.  While it does try to promote empathy over sympathy, literally feeling another person’s pain or feeling is not a good way to demonstrate it. The main point of empathy is to understand what someone else’s feeling. This show just forces the character to feel something without really understanding why. Though they try to know the answer of the “Why do you feel that way” question, they don’t really achieve mutual understanding.The show should have just focused on one type of pain and further explore that through frequent character interaction. The background of some characters is pretty good, but the story fails to transform that into good character development. The romance could have been done well if not for the very complicated love web the story presented. All in all, the show had potential if not for the bad direction of the story and the weak foundation of the premise. I could have given it a lower score, but the aspect of enjoyment is still there. There are some good standalone episodes and the show itself is a decent time-waster. I just really believed that the show could have been something greater gets sick? Will everyone get sick as well?

Honestly I normally wouldn\'t rate an anime with a 1 unless I really, really disliked it, but this was definitely one of the most disappointing anime I have watched. A large part of the reason for that was all the unnecessary, forced shipping.I know that a lot of people hated Chidori, but I actually liked her. She had a lot of passion for Katsuhira, and loved him deeply. Not to mention she was friends with him for many years, and even...tried helping him to the best of her ability. I felt like this anime basically spit on her feelings, and made them out to be completely unimportant. What ticked me off the most (I\'m using nice language right now because God knows how much I want to curse), was when they force shipped her with Tenga. Uhm... excuse me? What? She\'s been in love with Katsuhira for how many years, gets her heart basically ripped out by him, and then goes along so easily with someone else? Makes absolutely no sense. I would have preferred her to end up with alone. Besides, Nico also liked Tenga, and I think she would have been good with him. Their personalities matched much better.And now let\'s talk about Nori for a second. Besides the fact that she is a completely cliché character with absolutely no personality, AT ALL... she\'s just annoying in general. She tries to act all mysterious and such, but in reality she\'s just... boring. And the ending made absolutely NO SENSE. Nori has just been holding all their pain by herself for all of this time? Yeah, how convenient--honestly it was just a cop-out for them to not have to kill her. The plot would have made MUCH more sense if she had died, and I\'m seriously not the type to want characters to die in anime--almost ever. If she had died, then of course their own pain could be returned to them. But no, they instead allowed her to live and somehow to even get with Katsuhira? It just makes very little sense. And that joke at the end about ""We haven\'t gotten there yet""... way to completely step all over Chidori\'s feelings. It\'s been two years since I\'ve seen this anime and it STILL ticks me off to think about this.Also some of the plot was confusing in general and not relayed properly--I\'m still not entirely sure what was going on towards the end there.And, in case you didn\'t see what I said up there, it\'s been TWO YEARS since I\'ve seen this anime. Literally two years. And it still irks me to no end any time that I think about it. Like it literally puts me in a bad mood, which is rather rare for me. So I felt it only fair to vent out my feelings here. I literally created an account for this reason.Chidori should have gotten with Katsuhira, but really, there shouldn\'t have even been any romance added into this anime. There are two things about anime that I hate the most: first few episodes are good, with a great idea, and the delivery is awful (I\'m looking at you SAO and Code:Breaker), and when there are forced ships that make no sense and that really weren\'t necessary for the plot to progress but which just serve as an easy way to further it. Anyway, over all this anime was a huuuge disappointment, which is pretty sad because it had great potential. Honestly they should re-do it with a lot less shipping, and a lot more focus on other emotions. Perhaps I\'m also hyper-critical due to my being a psychology student and knowing that there\'s a lot more to emotions than romance, but there\'s my take on it and I doubt anyone will be able to change my mind. tried helping him to the best of her ability.

Great Art Style with lot of colours and style2. Great characterization, with each character having an unique personality3. Soundtrack is great, with OP and ED matching the feelings of the start and the end of the episode4. Great selection of VAs which gives an satisfying feel.Cons:1. Story feels forced and congested.2. The characters are too different from others.3. It tries to link the characters to certain traits but fails.4. Tenga is too loud....5. Forced romance.6. Started like an mystery anime, but in truth is an teen drama. (Nothing wrong with teen dramas but felt kind of betrayed) 5. Forced romance.6. Started like an mystery anime, but in truth is an teen drama. (Nothing wrong with teen dramas but felt kind of betrayed)', 'There are so many things wrong with this anime and its setting.  The Kizna system in the end is just a plot device as a cheap explanation to have things make sense and fails at that.  The warning signs were right there from the first and second episode.  The protagonist gets pushed down some stairs, he\'s saved by having his pain shared among six other people (how the heck that works is anyone\'s guess), yet he and the six others right afterwards look and react totally fine, when the protagonist should at least have a couple broken bones and that pain should...have been distributed to the other six.  However, only six of the seven are summoned together and have this explained to them.  The seventh was purposefully left out to be another episode of the others finding him, which overall was just for episode count, because there was no underlying purpose to having him separated from the others in the main narrative.  Of course, everyone had this change done to them without consent and were abducted by a horde of mascots that roam the city for some reason.  The mascots continuously act as railroading personified throughout the series, and move the characters to where they need to be and dance to whatever narrative the plot needs them to.Now, the main characters are forced into this experiment with a threat of a ""bad end"" if they don\'t.  Their first task is completely nonsensical where they have to ""introduce themselves"", but really it\'s to share your most highly kept secret, and not telling will result in several traps bordering on death being activated to force it out of you.  Yet in the midst of this highly controlled environment they were placed in, one of main characters manages to get separated from the others somehow in order to give a hint of her dark and troubled past, and later appears in a mascot costume for some reason once the task is finally cleared.  Also, she gives her secret after their abductor already said they cleared their first task.  Oh, and one character\'s most valued secret is that she loves the protagonist.  She\'s also the childhood friend and next door neighbor.  Yep, a huge guarded secret there, and the first hint at one of many of the forced romances this anime will later try to shove in the audience\'s face in the second half.  So yeah, after that cluster of nonsense, this anime started out in the negative and future episodes would have to work to bring it up, which it never does.The fault is in half due to it\'s worldbuilding. Few things make sense and that\'s due to vagueness and inconsistency.  From what was told, this experiment was done once before, the city was constructed for that very purpose, with one third of the citizenry in on it, and ended in a huge failure.  As a result, 19 kids that were the subjects were robbed of their sensory system; some can\'t even go out into society.  That an experiment like this happened and not one mention of it was on the news or any social media not even as a rumor is ridiculous.  I imagine parents would be outraged and/or distraught for what happened, especially the parents to the kids that were experimented on.  But that\'s the issue isn\'t it?  While parents are mentioned, rarely any of them are shown.  The protagonist was a subject of the first experiments, yet he still gets the same cliche that his parents work overseas, when any caring parent after seeing what happened to their child would be with him no matter what.  The only parents that do appear aren\'t even any of the main characters\', but for a side character, and they only appear for a few minutes.Once learning the protagonist was part of the first experiment, you ask the question ""why was he chosen again?"".  It is never made clear.  It may have been to get his pain back, which is necessary for him to start emoting again (but it\'s really not), but later we learn that another subject is willingly keeping his and all the other kids\' pain in her, which is ridiculous and a contradiction to previous info (which I\'ll get to later), and the other subject\'s goal in the end was never for him to get his pain back despite earlier hints that\'s what she wanted, and starts off what is one of the most sorry excuses of a plot twist and final confrontation.  It\'s all just a mess.I look at the the two experiments done for the Kizna system, and they only have a few similarities.  The first experiment as a whole is even more ludicrous than than one we find our main characters in.  It started with a mistake that resulted in one kid out of nineteen was solely getting the pain out of 5 kids (jumps to all of them later for no reason).  Gradually, the kids that were having their pain transferred became desensitized, not just physically but emotionally as well that carried over to the present.  The current subjects didn\'t have these problems.  For one, the current subjects\' pain was distributed equally.  Second, theirs had a time limit and were freed after summer vacation, contrasting the original that continues to the current time.  If the researchers made improvements, how the heck did they test the modifications before the story starts?  Did they just administer it to the current subjects, and it worked?  But if they were able to fix the previous problems, wouldn\'t they be able to cure the first subjects?  You\'re left wondering because it is never explained!  It\'s instead used to set up one of the project members as some tragic character, because that person is the same kid that all the pain was transferred to.  The girl\'s circumstances get contradicted too, making the attempt at sympathy ineffective.  During certain moments the protagonist somehow is able to feel the pain of the girl through their Kizna link when from what was explained is impossible, even emotional pain in the last episode, when only the current subjects were able to advance to that level.  In addition, as I mentioned before, she\'s also willingly keeping the pain of the other previous subjects, which in no instance beforehand was ever hinted to be possible.  Her entire condition was because of a botch, and was something she had no control over.  However, in the final episode, we\'re told she does have control over it.Some may argue that the lack of consistency in the setting and it\'s rules is okay, because it would take away from the character interactions.  However, if your setting is crap, why would the characters be treated any better.  The answer is they aren\'t.  Late in the story, the focus shifts mainly on the girl from the first experiment and the protagonist\'s forced romance to her, and away from the six other main characters.  The seven are still in the midst of working out their drama, making this change in direction absurd.  The anime is supposedly about theses seven characters\' issues and how they bond through overcoming those problems.  However, their friendship is mostly told, not shown.  The times they are all together are limited, and when they split into smaller groups, it\'s always with the same people.  There\'s no diversity.  The reason is for the other forced romances that are again mostly told and not shown.  How forced is it?  They have to have side characters make a character sheet on who likes who, along with expressing how ""obvious"" it was.  The romance is also the main source of drama, as if it needed it.  Seven people are linked to their pain.  They have no clue if these people that forced them into it will keep their word and release them after summer vacation, and constantly have to worry about each others\' safety, especially when one of the seven is a masochist.  However, none of these very reasonable issues are utilized.  After their initial abduction and forced cooperation, the main characters just walk off what\'s happened to them and go home for the day.  The next day, they continue on normally, which is not normal!   They act as if they haven\'t become lab rats and had their human rights violated. Even when they find out their teacher and counselor are part of the project, they don\'t act realistically.  Only one of them gets angry; the others are far more subdued and calm.  What\'s worse is these two characters are only here to give exposition and act like giant scumbags.  It becomes more inconsistent when the counselor suddenly has a change of heart late in the series and believes what they\'re doing is inhumane and immoral, when she was shown to be able to cross that line well before and not show an ounce of remorse.Kiznaiver constantly tried to have it\'s cake and eat it too, even at the cost of situations and reactions being portrayed consistently.  It wants this SoL drama along with an over the top setting and situations, but in attempting to do both, does neither one of them well.  Seriously, in the end, why were none of the committee members arrested!? have been distributed to the other six.  However, only six of the seven are summoned together and have this explained to them.  The seventh was purposefully left out to be another episode of the others finding him, which overall was just for episode count, because there was no underlying purpose to having him separated from the others in the main narrative.

The first experiment as a whole is even more ludicrous than than one we find our main characters in.  It started with a mistake that resulted in one kid out of nineteen was solely getting the pain out of 5 kids (jumps to all of them later for no reason).  Gradually, the kids that were having their pain transferred became desensitized, not just physically but emotionally as well that carried over to the present.  The current subjects didn\'t have these problems.  For one, the current subjects\' pain was distributed equally.  Second, theirs had a time limit and were freed after summer vacation, contrasting the original that continues to the current time.  If the researchers made improvements, how the heck did they test the modifications before the story starts?  Did they just administer it to the current subjects, and it worked?  But if they were able to fix the previous problems, wouldn\'t they be able to cure the first subjects?  You\'re left wondering because it is never explained!  It\'s instead used to set up one of the project members as some tragic character, because that person is the same kid that all the pain was transferred to.  The girl\'s circumstances get contradicted too, making the attempt at sympathy ineffective.  During certain moments the protagonist somehow is able to feel the pain of the girl through their Kizna link when from what was explained is impossible, even emotional pain in the last episode, when only the current subjects were able to advance to that level.  In addition, as I mentioned before, she\'s also willingly keeping the pain of the other previous subjects, which in no instance beforehand was ever hinted to be possible.  Her entire condition was because of a botch, and was something she had no control over.  However, in the final episode, we\'re told she does have control over it.Some may argue that the lack of consistency in the setting and it\'s rules is okay, because it would take away from the character interactions.  However, if your setting is crap, why would the characters be treated any better.  The answer is they aren\'t.  Late in the story, the focus shifts mainly on the girl from the first experiment and the protagonist\'s forced romance to her, and away from the six other main characters.  The seven are still in the midst of working out their drama, making this change in direction absurd.  The anime is supposedly about theses seven characters\' issues and how they bond through overcoming those problems.  However, their friendship is mostly told, not shown.  The times they are all together are limited, and when they split into smaller groups, it\'s always with the same people.  There\'s no diversity.  The reason is for the other forced romances that are again mostly told and not shown.  How forced is it?  They have to have side characters make a character sheet on who likes who, along with expressing how ""obvious"" it was.  The romance is also the main source of drama, as if it needed it.  Seven people are linked to their pain.  They have no clue if these people that forced them into it will keep their word and release them after summer vacation, and constantly have to worry about each others\' safety, especially when one of the seven is a masochist.  However, none of these very reasonable issues are utilized.  After their initial abduction and forced cooperation, the main characters just walk off what\'s happened to them and go home for the day.  The next day, they continue on normally, which is not normal!   They act as if they haven\'t become lab rats and had their human rights violated. Even when they find out their teacher and counselor are part of the project, they don\'t act realistically.  Only one of them gets angry; the others are far more subdued and calm.  What\'s worse is these two characters are only here to give exposition and act like giant scumbags.  It becomes more inconsistent when the counselor suddenly has a change of heart late in the series and believes what they\'re doing is inhumane and immoral, when she was shown to be able to cross that line well before and not show an ounce of remorse.Kiznaiver constantly tried to have it\'s cake and eat it too, even at the cost of situations and reactions being portrayed consistently.  It wants this SoL drama along with an over the top setting and situations, but in attempting to do both, does neither one of them well.  Seriously, in the end, why were none of the committee members arrested!?', 'The plot isn\'t mindblowing despite the originality of the kiznaiver project (although I really liked the idea) and there are some scenes that are ""unnecesary"" if you take them like real events, but they are metaphors used to get the messages across.If you take seriously the points that brings to the table and think thoroughly about your memories, relations you had or have right now and...  the human condition in general, I think that you can really comprehend what they wanted to achieve and see how well they did it.I was skeptical and I though that it would be an anime just...good enough to entertain me on this week\'s bit of free time, but it really made me think about my life. It opened some wounds, I reflected on them and closed them again with a different point of view.Maybe all of this is because i\'m sensible today, but I can\'t help it but give it a 10 because of how much I enjoyed it :) good enough to entertain me on this week\'s bit of free time, but it really made me think about my life.

However, as I delved into the first episode, I realized it\'s so much more. It\'s the type of show you can binge-watch late at night and then feel empty afterward.It gave me vibes similar to ""Alice in Borderland,"" although not entirely the same. The story revolves around five teenagers abducted and forced to play the Kizuna system as Kiznaivers. Those participating are connected through pain, meaning if one member is injured, the rest feel an equal amount of pain. The first episode alone...is enough to get you hooked, unfortunately this anime isn\'t talk about more often.The characterization is excellent; each character is well-written and original. The art complements the anime perfectly, with its colorful and comfortable style exceeding expectations. In terms of enjoyment, I found the show consistently engaging, with plenty happening in each episode. The dialogue is also well-done, adding to the overall enjoyment.Overall, it\'s a great show with a strong theme of friendship and the unique concept of sharing pain with each other. is enough to get you hooked, unfortunately this anime isn\'t talk about more often.The characterization is excellent; each character is well-written and original.

I dont dislike the generic look either i realy dont but if you offer me a great looking burger, one that i have almost never seen before let me take a bite and afterwards take that burger and slap a turd on my plate im going to be pissed. This was probably the first sign that this show was going to be a shit show.Story-  I figured the story would have issues, before I even started watching and Trigger didn\'t disappoint as the story becomes a literal clusterfuck. For the sake of spoilers I wont say much but my main issues boil down too1) FRIENDSHIP CANT FIX EVERYTHING2) Poor Execution3) Kizna Experiment makes no sense4) Trigger didn\'t know where they were going with this (So to elaborate I think Trigger thought of the concept and the end but didn\'t know how to move their idea from point A to B. The shows suffers by being episodic and having the most boring middle sequence that i can remember from this season [from what i watched]. And at some point the show decides to go from very upbeat and happy to a teenage soap opera. Plus the only reason Trigger shows Kacchon\'s distorted flashbacks are so they can dangle the mystery over our head so we have a reason too keep watching)Characters- The characters are one of the parts of the show I actually enjoyed with characters like Tenga, Yuta (he actually stood out the most to me in the series I loved Yuta wish they used him more), Hisomu, and the two teachers sticking out in particular. However the execution of how these characters were used was horrendous. It boiled down too the story focusing on these fixed love triangles (WHICH THE SHOW LITERALLY TELLS YOU ABOUT ). Plus the lifeless MC Kacchon was literally boring as hell his screen-time was complete cringe, and also just because he couldn\'t feel pain doesn\'t mean he would become a lifeless robot. On another note Honoka\'s arc was pretty dumb and it was her trying to be an edgy hot topic wannabee, The only thing memorable thing about Chidori was the fact that she craved Kacchon\'s D more than i crave Rasin Bran in the morning, Nico was fun FOR THE FIRST THREE EPISODES then she  got shoved in a cage and was only let out to spit nonsense about friendship. Its a shame that this show squandered all the potential of these characters for example Hisomu: He was awesome in his first appearance He seemed dark edgy (and not like Honoka who was blander than a stick) an interesting parallel to the inital cast but then no hes a masochist who didn\'t want the group to unite for some dumb reason. At that moment I thought ok fine that was funny this will be some nice comedy relief, BUT THEN HE IS SHOVED TO THE SIDE AND PROVIDES ZERO IMPACT ON THE STORY AND BECOMES BLAND AS HELL. Thats really the problem of the show shoving aside interesting characters in favor of Kacchon whos defining trait is that hes the blandest person in a 10 mile radius.Sound- Really forgettable soundtrack how forgettable...... I forgotExecution: I keep rambling on about poor execution but how bad is it? pretty bad. So the big problem with this series is that it begins to take itself too seriously and evolves into this Soap Opera with little actual drama for the viewer to care about. It becomes a mess of love triangle drama and such that is overcome by ""friendship"". The show refuses to flesh out the interesting aspects of any of its characters as if its wants to rub in our faces how good the show could be if Trigger were to think about any actual interesting scenarios for the viewer to be sucked into.OVERALL: The show lacks the poise that Kill la Kill had and was a major disappointment by Trigger in my eyes. It went from a show that showed so much promise in its first 3 episodes but then went into full train wreck mode.

That\'s where I ran into Kiznaiver. I thought to myself ""hey that sounds like a neat premise, and it\'s made by Trigger too! Kill la Kill was pretty cool. This should be solid!""But by the end of it all, the only thing I know for sure that\'s solid in this show is the brick that is the main protagonist\'s personality. It is an experience for which I no idea how to feel about it.

So complicated that two of the support characters actually had to draw out a vusual diagram of who likes who.While we do get some very emotional scenes, it never feels like it really contributes to the development of the characters as people. For example, one girl reveals a very dark moment of her past that led to her being cold and distant. After this dramatic scene plays out, she goes back to being a complete bitch. Instances like this make me feel as if none of what I\'m seeing really matters, and it can be incredibly immersion breaking for people.Arguably the most frustrating thing about this show is that it has enormous potential to go deeper into complex themes surrounding it\'s science fiction premise. The ethics of child experimentation, the concept of the good of group over the good of individual, and the morality of the Kizna system. These are all themes lightly touched upon over the course of the series, but is unfortunately obfuscated by the confusing litany of ""friendship and love can overcome any obstacle"" that the characters keep spouting through the duration of the anime.Maybe it\'s just me.

I was a bit hyped, but the result is kinda dissapointing.Story: 5This story is about bonds of friendship and love with an interesting and original concept as starting line, which is the Kizuna system. However, this series have what i call the ""angel beats"" syndrome, the inability to express itself clearly in 12 episodes. The story, while enyoyable, feels so rushed, and it has repercussions especially in the characters and their relationships. You can\'t make a love triangle and develop it nicely in just 12 episodes. Imposible.Art : 7The...art and character desing is fairly good just as expected from Trigger. this anime doesn\'t have many action scenes to shine properly this animation quality, but is good enough. Animation from OP and ED kinda superb, especially OP.Sound: 6I found the OST quite common, just one or two soundrtrack that i felt good in that moment. However, the OP is ASTOUNDING, pretty damn original with a good song and superb animation as i mentioned before.Character: 6Let\'s go in. Each character is well ""characterized"", that is to say, you can distinguish each character and they have a different personality from the other ones. However, they are not well developed at all because the reasons mentioned before. You can\'t develop a proper love relationship in just 12 episodes, imagine FOUR and their feelings. In some of the cases, like Chidori\'s one (the tsundere girl) the love is quite obvious during the show, but there are some cases without a simple clue until the truth is revealed. It happens because yes. Not credible at all.Enjoyment: 6I have not bored watching this series,  it has some intense caps and pretty good arcs like Honoka\'s one. Moreover, the opening was always a gift to see.Overall: 6This is not a bad anime, it has a good idea and a nice potential. With 12 episodes more to develop better the characters, it could have been easily an 8, but it happens  to a large amount of series, so it\'s not Kiznaiver\'s fault at all.""Do you recommend this anime?""it\'s still a good view if you like love stories, friendship and melodrama.If you liked Kiznaiver, take a look to:- Toradora, with a way better developed love story and some similar slice of life in its way- Anohana, another story about a group of friends and their relationships well developed in just 12 episodesPD: Sorry for my english art and character desing is fairly good just as expected from Trigger. this anime doesn\'t have many action scenes to shine properly this animation quality, but is good enough.

Its a show about connecting. Yet for something so focused on character interaction and empathy, it is a show that has barely anything worth connecting with.=======================First of all, the story:The show follows an intriguing SCI-FI premise of characters being connected by pain and having to solve problems and psychological puzzles those running the experiment ask them to solve in a way being forced to deal with uncomfortable subjects and learn empathy.The premise is promising. Its not unique as something akin to that was already done with Kokoro Connect or even currently running western show  - Sense8, but...it is still something that holds promise. Character exploration and introspection can be enjoyable. Characters usually are where the substance of the show comes from.The problem with Kiznaiver is already hidden in the story description I gave - ""forced"". The show feels forced. The SCI-FI setting and lore are poorly fleshed out and exist solely as plot devices to force characters to have melodramatic interactions with each other. The problem with that is that the said interactions are shallow and poorly written. Characters do not behave like people. For the lack of better example, the narrative\'s understanding of ""feelings"" or ""interactions"" is on the level of 12 year old high-schooler teen writing emo poems on tumblr. The show is filled with cringe-worthy use of ""feelings"", ""sharing the pain"", but majority of interactions are basically teenage melodrama.For a premise with interesting SCI-FI elements and possibilities in the lore, the show does not bother to do anything with it beyond using it as plot device to force characters to have melodrama. The plot elements that ARE there are spaced out so much that the plot ends up very bare-bones and barely holds together as an excuse to have those interactions.=======================ArtArtistic design and cinematography is one aspect where Kiznaiver is actually decent to good. The show is filled with interesting shots, creative and dynamic use of colors and great visuals.  Its basically Studio TRIGGER trying to present SHAFT-esque visuals and mostly succeeding. Its one of Kobayashi\'s  best works in terms of that.It does suffer in terms of character designs, especially in terms of outfit designs - for supposed ""everyday teenagers"" the characters wear the kinds of clothes that nobody would wear casually. The kind of outfits that make the modern day designer collections look normal. It requires a SUBSTANTIAL amount of suspension of disbelief to believe that ""your everyday teenager"" would wear anything like that.=======================SoundIn terms of sound-track the show is nothing special. Hayashi Yuuki is not someone that stands out for me in terms of composer and surely the music is serviceable to work with the show without standing out, but nothing special, not anything I\'d listen on my own to.The show does have a brilliant opening song by Boom Boom Satelites, which is a good listen on its own, although not the best that band has produced in the time of their existence.=======================CharacterCharacters is where the show falls apart. For something that is supposedly so character-focused, Kiznaiver\'s characters feel stereotypical, manufactured and fake. You have typical emotionless MC, typical childhood friend, typical loony girl, typical megane, etc. You get the idea. The show tries to play it off as meta-aware by telling the viewer how they are supposed to fit the stereotypes, yet at the same time the show does nothing to make them feel more than that.While some characters like Niko are likeable in a way, everyone\'s existence begins and ends solely with their purpose of participating in melodrama:- Niko is likeable and decent character that not much is done with.- Chidori\'s whole existence revolves around childhood friend tropes.- Sonozaki is poor mans Senjougahara, that, unlike Senjougahara, lacks any strong characterization beyond her personality tropes.- Maki exists solely for her backstory(which has its own share of problematic tropes),- Tenga is typical ""dudebro"" whose only purpose is to overreact and act cool.- Yuta is barely fleshed out as a person and is used mainly with purpose of playing off the other characters.- Hisomu literally lacks any purpose or characterization at all.- The show\'s protagonist, Katsuhira, has interesting premise, yet terrible execution, which makes the character impossible to relate to and hard to understand, as sole elements of his character development are tied to VERY scarce plot moments.The characters are lack relatability and the end conclusion to their arcs makes it feel like a majority of cringy melodrama the viewer experiences was kind of needless and pointless.  For a character-drama, the show falls apart completely in terms of actual characters.=======================EnjoymentThe show\'s sole enjoyment value comes from two angles:- Either you are capable watching a mediocre show solely for sake of experiencing the directing and cinematographyor- You are capable of bearing a juvenile high-school drama and are okay with bare-bones plot and no real emotion in narrative.The show is like the show\'s protagonist - lacking empathy. I personally can\'t ""like"" or ""dislike"" it. The show just IS. It happened. But it lacks any qualities you can like or despise. Its fake, manufactured and stale.=======================OverallKiznaiver originally was intended as wacky Okada-esque action show, but via production process, was overhauled into a character drama, resulting in a show that is ill-prepared to accomplish what its authors want to accomplish and the lack of identity is felt through entirety of the show because of that.Its the kind of a show you watch because it is airing. And then, when the show has ended, you put the complete tag onto it and go ""Okay, I watched this."" without any real thoughts of feelings about it.Its a show that wanted accomplish so much, yet ends up accomplishing absolutely nothing - be it in terms of narrative or in terms of audience emotion. it is still something that holds promise.

To start with, the opening is a trippy experience with some slick visuals and a catchy song and the most memorable part of the show for sure, and I should note it has a pretty nice ED too. The character designs are for the most part pretty good and only Sonozaki is notably generic, and even then it actually works fairly well with her characters. The introduction makes her come off as rather crazy and...menacing and is actually pretty tense for what it is, basically just about revealing a secret about yourself, with characters getting decent starts: Tenga is the loudmouthed, fighting type who wants to live an exciting life and is a nice guy despite being a delinquent, Nico is the crazy girl living in a world of fantasy but is actually lashing out for attention, Chidori the girl with a crush who can't speak out, and so on. Our main hero, Katsuhira, has lost most of his ability to feel pain and so has difficult emphasizing with other people and has become dull of heart. Our heroes are made into Kiznaivers quickly: People who, through science, are bound together to experience each other's pain in order to develope a deeper connection.The primary problem the show suffers is simply that the show does not really explore these characters in any depth for the most part, with only Sonozaki, Katsuhira and Maki getting any notable screen time. I feel like this is the fault of the episode length: Only Maki gets a true arc to her and she is notably the best character in the show for this, even if Tenga is pretty fun. Katsuhira and Sonozaki come off as incredibly obnoxious for the first 1/4th of the show, with Sonozaki in particular coming off as extremely evil, but they have backstory that does explain their actions: Katushira frankly still comes off as unlikeable and is my second least favorite character in the show, but Sonozaki's backstory is very reasonable for her actions and frankly it would be weird if she DIDN'T come off as crazy given what it entails, I kind of vaguely liked her in the end aside from some pretty conflicted feelings of parts.Maki is notable for the fact she gets an actual character arc, which nobody else in the show does, and it is DEFINITELY the high point of the show, with a reasonably done backstory that for the most part does not feel overly melodramatic, is fairly logical and works into the themes of the show. I feel like if the show was about twice as long and had character arcs like this for all of the main characters, it would probably be actually pretty good. Well, maybe not everyone, since Katsuhira and to a lesser extent Chidori's are baked into the plot, but for characters like Nico, Yuta and Hisomu it would have been especially good. Hisomu I particularly feel the need to point out, as he feels quite out of place and pretty much a gag character with his masochistic shtick when he doesn't get any personal developement. Nico also is practically begging for a character arc that could have done wonders for the characters, but she is instead left a one noter. I also applaud Maki's backstory for having a tension/break between two same sex characters not surrounded around gay angst, but instead actual issues between the two, and in fact the show not even bringing attention to it.Story-wise, the show isn't amazing, but it does follow logical progression and avoids making too many major mishaps...except in a way the ending. I won't get into it as it would be a lot of spoilers, but the latter 1/4th of the show I am very conflicted on and I feel like it was definitely not the BEST direction to take it, if nothing else it was definitely rushed. I do wish to give the story some props for doing some logical things that many other, better constructed stories I feel don't despite being good ideas: For example, the secret shadowy organization getting their government funding pulled due to being too conspicuous for their results and the resulting actions. Artistically, the show looks quite nicely drawn and rarely suffers off model moments, and I do want to give some sound design props for the cool noises of Kiznaiver effects activating and the like.If you see more into the show's characters, then you will likely come to like it more: My personal issue was a lack of character developement and attachment to the characters in a series where such things are VERY important, the crux of it even, and some divided issues about parts of the plot. At 12 episodes, it is certainly worth a watch to decide for yourself, as it is if nothing else technically competent. If the concept was expanded on or redone, I can see something great comint out of it too, so that's a plus. menacing and is actually pretty tense for what it is, basically just about revealing a secret about yourself, with characters getting decent starts: Tenga is the loudmouthed, fighting type who wants to live an exciting life and is a nice guy despite being a delinquent, Nico is the crazy girl living in a world of fantasy but is actually lashing out for attention, Chidori the girl with a crush who can't speak out, and so on.

The unique and vibrant visuals as well as having a colorful and mostly unique cast of characters is unmistakably theirs, but that seems to be where the similarities end.Kiznaiver is a step away from their previous work, Kill la Kill, in a few big ways. Kill la Kill was centered around a relatively small cast of main characters, but with a color cast of side characters to fill the spaces. Kizvaiver takes a different approach, having eight characters as the focus and having few important side characters....Also, where as Kill la Kill was action oriented and strongly plot driven, Kizaiver is more comparable to a drama or a slice of life.Now, these changes definitely made distance between their two works, but was that for the best in the end? My answer to that question is both yes and no. I'll explain why in the body of the review.Story: 6Now, you would think for a story driven drama, the story would need to be string, right? Well, sadly, in kizaiver's case, it tends to feel confusing and pointless far more often then is feels driving. The plot seems to be there just as a tool to make the characters interact and feel emotions, and, in a way, I suppose that makes sense to the plot. That being said, it doesn't make the plot any better really. It isn't a terrible story, but there are a few holes and lose ends that never really go explained and motives which make little sense.Art: 10By far the best thing about this anime is the art. Beautiful, colorful, and unique, the art goes far to make up for what the anime lacks in some other aspects. The style is clearly Trigger, and the setting itself is very well done.Sound: 9Probably one of the best OP's of the season, and the ED was very good was well. Very good voice acting, and everything felt very well done.Character: 7While some of the character development was great, it felt as if a few of the characters were ignored for a vast majority of the show. 12 episodes is a short amount of time to try to introduce and develop 8 main characters, and I think they did a decent job with what they had. However, it seems as if it might have been too much for them, because a few of characters felt a little cardboard, or as if they were there more for decoration than for the plot. But all together, the characters were unique and well portrayed enough to earn a 7 from me.Enjoyment: 7Originally, I had rated enjoyment at an 8, however, after considering the fact that I had stopped watching this show after episode 4 and only continued after being goaded by a friend, I decided that 7 was probably a more accurate rating.This show takes a while to get going, and at first it is a little hard to see what Trigger was going for. But once you get past the halfway mark, everything starts to fall into place, and the show gets much better and more enjoyable to watch.Overall: 7This was a decent follow up to Kill la Kill, although being in a very different genre. It was not the masterpiece that some had hoped for, but it was definitely not a bad show in any regard. I would recommend this show to those who are looking for a beautiful and unique drama as long as you are willing to forgive some plot holes.

Not to say it is bad, but it isn't a show I could highly recommend, let alone re-watch.STORY 6.75: I know I hate that rating but I can't give it a 7, but i certainly don't think that it deserves a 6. I love the story about these characters, besides the MC and Nori, but the plot just doesn't work when you actually think about it. Why connect them through emotion and pain? Couldn't you just force them to go on a summer trip together or have them work on a project? It just sounds...like the writer thought it was a fun plot and just went with it.Art 10: Truly gorgeously animated and the character designed are like my second mix tape(coming out 2124, pre-order soon). That's really all I can say, i don't really think I saw any sight not worthy of being seen.Sound 9: The OP is FIRE, albeit a total rip of of another fire song. Everything else is fine, but I will give it a 9 because of how much I just love the op.Characters 8: Would most certainly be a 10 if not for MC and Nori. I truly thought they'd develop, but they just don't. I'm not saying that they don't change from time to time, but there is a difference from a character changing and a character developing. Moving on to the rest of the cast... I think they are great. They all have their own personality and flare to them and their interaction is what makes the show worth it.Enjoyment/Overall 7: I put both together because I, personally, believe that they coincide. This was my most hyped show of the season, so anything below a 10 is a bit of a disappointment(unlike my mix take, coming out 2567), but it is certainly not a bad show. I hate to make a review before the conclusion because ending is the most important thing, but when I have to stop a show with only seconds remaining, I believe a review is in order. like the writer thought it was a fun plot and just went with it.Art 10: Truly gorgeously animated and the character designed are like my second mix tape(coming out 2124, pre-order soon).

The seven students are selected to become Kiznaivers - people connected by a bond of shared pain among one another as test subjects for the Kizna Committe's end goal of world peace through connecting everyone through mutual pain and suffering. With this situation forced upon them, Katsuhira and the other students have to find a way...to understand and work with one another despite their differing personalities as their bond is tested over the upcoming Summer.[Characters]:Given the premise of the show, it makes a lot of sense that Kiznaiver would focus almost all of its attention upon its primary group of 8 characters and a fairly concise supporting cast. This approach worked well insofar as none of the character's felt all that underdeveloped with the exception of Hisomu Yoshiharu who was introduced after the initial introduction of the other Kiznaivers. The characters themselves are fairly archetypal at first glance - Chidori is a stereotypical childhood love interest upon introduction, Yoshiharu sports a pretty typical depiction of a masochist, Honoka is a pragmatic and distant intellectual, and the list goes on. What's interesting is how the show grows these characters out of their initial depictions into something a bit more intricate.Though the Kiznaiver's themselves vary in depth, one thing that is certain is that their archetypal foundations do a great job in setting them very distinctly apart before the show invests time into discerning the context of their character. Their designs aid in this distinction as each of them look immensely different, causing them to stand out from one another on a visual level as well. The importance of detailing this distinction between each of the characters is that the show relies heavily upon them having contrasting and conflicting personalities and if nothing else, the show sets this up well.Had each of the Kiznaiver's remained as they were when they were introduced in the first episode the cast would have felt overwhelmingly stereotypical and tiresome however they quickly evolved beyond this if only slightly. Though Katsuhira's lack of pain and emotions has left him quiet and introverted, he is far more observant and thoughtful than he initially appears and a good deal of the show is about him coming into a new sense of agency. Other characters like Honoka, Tenga, and Nico all have their fair share of intricacies that are contextualized and accentuated upon by the show as it explores each of them each episode - gradually revealing more and more about each Kiznaiver as they are forced to work alongside each other.The issues that arise within Kiznaiver's cast are less to do with the different Kiznaiver's on an individual level and more about the way in which they converse and act with each other. The plot pushes them along very deliberately and the characters act out in very extreme and exaggerated ways in order to promote the drama of each scene. Certain central characters such as Chidori are left far too one-dimensional to be taken seriously, her character completely defined by her attachment and romantic feelings for Katsuhira. All in all, Kiznaiver has a distinct group of characters most of whom possess pretty entertaining characteristics however the way in which they are utilized by the plot dulls their interest considerably. They are left feeling far too hyperbolic in their interactions and the resulting drama between them thus often feels absurd.[Art/Animation]:Kiznaiver's art and animation is its major strength and appeal as the show possesses gorgeous visuals. As mentioned above, the character designs are very recognizable and even unique in some aspects, going a long way in further differentiating the characters visually. The animation and character movement is flashy and expressive which worked well alongside the colorful and often extreme personalities present in the show. Kiznaiver had a wonderful variety of colors within its palette as well, its aesthetics heavily contrasting against one another with a heavy thematic focus on various shades of red. The animation was vibrant and entertaining and pretty much everything one would expect out of studio Trigger.[Story]:The narrative and overarching plot of Kiznaiver is where the show truly falls apart. Given it's character-centric premise and early introductory episodes it would be a fair guess to say that the show itself was similarly character-driven however as its plot unfolded this became gradually less true. The plot of the show as well as its themes focus upon forming bonds of friendship, overcoming personal struggles through the help of others, and acting empathically. These themes are plenty interesting and even more so when set against such an outlandish premise such as Kiznaiver's - a setting where 7 people share each other's physical and emotional pain. The critical failure of the show is in the forced and artificial way these attributes manifest within an already somewhat vague plot.The first episode of the show starts right into things, introducing the viewer to the Kizna system and the newly linked 6 students as it both explains the purpose of the experiment as well as their role in it. The second episode fills in the gaps as it begins to push the initially archetypal character introductions into a slightly more complicated light by forcing the characters to divulge certain information about themselves to their fellow Kiznaivers. The forced methodology that emerges becomes incredibly important as it sets the tone for how the show will behave for almost all of its future episodes. Rather than connecting the students and leaving them to organically solve their own issues or encounter their own hurdles, the Kizna committee plays an extremely active role in forcing them together and placing them in certain 'extreme' situations in order to generate data. Quickly the Kizna committee begins to feel like an unnatural writing tool for forcing drama to occur.By episode 4 the show starts to pair off certain characters with one another and their relationships and romantic interests begin to take center stage thereafter. Kiznaiver's resulting dynamic is a show about an enigmatic and shadowy organization forcing students who share each other's pain into chaotic and ridiculous scenarios in order to develop romantic melodrama. Rather than exploring the psychological implications of sharing each other's pain or emotional states the show opts to invest itself in their romantic interests in the typical style of Okada Mari, the show's writer. The artificial way in which the Kiznaivers are placed in each dramatic moment makes it hard to take the show seriously which is very problematic given how seriously the show takes itself.Something worth touching upon that would otherwise seem very unimportant is the presence of the Kizna committee's mascots - the Gomorin. Their appearance is very cartoonish compared to the rest of the character designs which makes a lot of sense given their mascot-esque nature however it is their chronic presence in all of the dramatic scenes where they truly feel out of place. In essence, they are used by the Kizna committee to incite moments of dramatic tension by attacking the students or chasing them in some manner which is perhaps the most obvious insight into how artificial the plot progression of the show is. Despite setting no precedent for being dangerous or harmful, the Kiznaivers overreact to them, essentially draining the scene of any possible dramatic tension given the non-threatening appearance of the Gomorin and the scene's straightforward progression.With all of that said, Kiznaiver is not completely bereft of good scenes and there are a few engaging moments throughout. The characters themselves are highly entertaining however it is the exaggerated and overly-sentimental scenes they are forced into that makes many of them fall flat.[Music]:Considering the nature of Kiznaiver its soundtrack behaves as one might expect - emphasizing the drama of its scenes with given tracks and otherwise providing a fairly standard backdrop for the show. For me, there weren't any particularly memorable tracks.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:In summary, though Kiznaiver might hint at something more complex and compelling through its premise and initial episodes it quickly devolves into a rather incoherent story focusing on teenage melodrama. I myself am not a huge fan of Okada Mari's writing and so I may have disliked the show more than one normally might and perhaps fans of her other works would be able to overlook certain aspects of the show and enjoy it to a great extent.Rating: 4I gave Kiznaiver a 4 because the way in which it attempted to conjure up a dramatic atmosphere felt forced and inorganic in how it was narratively presented. Though a handful of its characters were fairly entertaining, its cast also had a few one-dimensional and overly exaggerated characters which detracted from the cast. The visuals were terrific however they didn't dress the show up well enough to the point that its narrative and thematic issues could be overlooked, not that they ever could have.[Recommendations]:Those who have enjoyed Okada Mari's work in the past will likely enjoy Kiznaiver as well as the dialogue and themes are quintessentially her. Similarly so, fans of melodramas like Kokoro Connect, Nagi no Asukara, and AnoHana will probably find that Kiznaiver lies within their interests. Those who don't care for considerably sentimental character interactions and plot developments may want to pass on the show. to understand and work with one another despite their differing personalities as their bond is tested over the upcoming Summer.[Characters]:Given the premise of the show, it makes a lot of sense that Kiznaiver would focus almost all of its attention upon its primary group of 8 characters and a fairly concise supporting cast.

I got sucked in immediately by the art style and stayed for the plot.Everything in Kiznaiver well executed. It balances itself between character developement, giving us some slice of life (I mean, everybody is a teenager and has your average love problems and other things) while still providing science fiction backstory about a program that is intended to bring world peace. So Kiznaiver is a mix between Slice of Life and Sci-Fi which I don't see as often as I'd like to. One of my favorite...animes is Steins;Gate which did something similar.The anime itself is pretty close to perfect, the only faults I can think of is that at some very rare points it slows down a bit and I'd wish that it had more focus on the audio. For example, what makes Death Note so memorable is the OST while here they have stayed more safe without really bringing music to the front, opening being the exception because it was freaking AWESOME.Also, I have a longer review up on my channel on YouTube. MudanTV, would help a lot if you could check it out and leave some feedback. Thank you. animes is Steins;Gate which did something similar.The anime itself is pretty close to perfect, the only faults I can think of is that at some very rare points it slows down a bit and I'd wish that it had more focus on the audio.

Thank you."", 'Story: ""fair"" 6For the story I\'m being a bit harsh because its narrative could have gone smoother, less forced.. anyway animes this short are doomed to get forced plot development since they don\'t really have much episodes to correctly do it.I believe this anime\'s mistake is being too greedy for a 12 episode anime. It tries to get to some really deep spots in the plot which aren\'t quite satisfying. First episodes go really slow and it seems like they rushed the storyline too much in the last ones, specially in the last 2.Ignoring the greedy plot mistake let\'s get to the art..Art: ""very...good"" 8I don\'t see much remarkable stuff about the art, I believe any anime should have this smooth animation and the character art as well as their facial expressions are well-made. Its got a satisfying art and drawing style.Sound: ""good"" 7Mainly because of the opening I give it a ""good"", since the soundtrack isn\'t bad enough to be awkward nor good enough to be noticeable. The opening is very good in my opinion but the ending is nothing special, not attention-catching at all in my opinion.Character: ""very good"" 8Here is where I prize the anime. Its characters are the typical steriotypical characters, they\'re even meant to be it (not wanting to give spoilers but they get ""gathered"" together since they are distant stereotypes) but even so, I like it that their bound is what unites them and separates them at the same time, this is probably more of a ""story"" section point but I do think it\'s more about how their emotions evolve, and how they\'re expressed than about the actual storyline thing. Won\'t say much more since it could be a bit of a spoiler but this show does focus a lot on how we carry our emotions and how we get along with others since them, that\'s really wonderful.Enjoyment is a ""good"" 7I liked the show, saw it really quick cus I like watching animes as soon as possible, its a bit of an anxiety thing. You\'re gonna enjoy it, it has a good amount of romance, a bit of comedy even when it may not make you laugh it may get you into a good mood. It\'s emotive and if you arent too harsh is a good show, lacks a bit of smoothness in the narrative that\'s all.

Rape jokes are not funny at all.The characters are horrible, lame and void. Special mention to the one who is masochist. The protagonist is boring and the people in disguise made me ill-at-ease. To make it simple: a loli, a dark sasuke, a masochist, a crazy girl, a perv,... I mean, they are not endearing characters, not a single one.There are so many ways to develop an anime with a story like this and they chose the worst.Usually I don't write reviews but I've never disliked an anime as I dislike this one. I'm sorry but I...had to drop. had to drop."", 'Well, folks, it’s a landmark moment. We’re finally reviewing an original work written by the queen of normie melodrama herself, Mari Okada. I do think that emphasis on the term “original” is needed; from ToraDora to Blast of Tempest, Okada has done her share of adaptation work in the anime medium, each of them infused with her characters’ token super-charged emotions. However, in the spirit of attempting to truly understand creators through their own creations, here we are with Kiznaiver, which Okada wrote entirely herself. While it isn’t Okada’s first original series, it certainly has many hallmarks of her other work, so that makes it...a worthy candidate for this case study.Okada may be known for her style of drama, but a common trend across many of what I have seen of her screenwriting credits is a healthy dose of comedic hijinks, and this is ultimately what kept me from dropping Kiznaiver inside of the first episode. The cast is full of dumb caricatures (including a Kamina knock-off, because Trigger) who can’t think logically or grasp the fact that the drama between them is ridiculous, and herein lies the decently entertaining comedy; they make fun of each other’s idiosyncrasies and personality traits, coming off less like a group of friends (which they most certainly are not) and more a dysfunctional group of complete tools we love to watch fail at just about everything they do. Unfortunately, the strength of Kiznaiver’s comedy is undercut by its most glaring weakness. This series shares its biggest problem with many of Mari Okada’s teenage romance-dramas, and that is an unparalleled devotion to taking its love polygon seriously. And there is ALWAYS a love polygon.I want to make this as crystal clear as can be: drama only works when the writer deliberately and meticulously establishes WHY the characters feel the way they do. In the case of Kiznaiver, it’s as if the characters’ feelings were just magicked into them upon birth. The biggest exceptions to this are Honaka, who has her entire backstory explored, and Noriko, the main heroine, but the latter’s reasons for her (lack of) emotions are so totally external to her i.e. she had no agency in the matter because of the dumb sci-fi crap that her entire arc falls completely flat. I skipped my way through some seventy percent of the last episode because absolutely none of the setup was even remotely investing, the “payoff” felt so contrived, and there was next to no comedy to carry me through the experience. It’s not impossible to have a tense or meaningful drama injected with lighthearted moments, but what’s seriously odd is that while Kiznaiver absolutely believes the hype surrounding its own drama, its comedy takes every opportunity to undercut that drama’s weight. On no less than two occasions does the show actively make fun of itself, plainly stating how utterly ludicrous and laughable its love polygon is, and, even though I was laughing my head off, it was exactly at the first of these two moments that I knew Kiznaiver was starting to lose me. From episode 8 onward, that feeling only grew; I could practically see a curve showing how the comedy-to-melodrama ratio was nosediving, and my interest along with it.Perhaps I don’t understand how Okada’s brand of melodrama is appealing or why there is a market for it. Apparently, people want to see characters with completely overblown emotions with no logical basis for why they have them exhibit exaggerated outbursts. Is it supposed to be a vicarious expression of the audience’s own pent-up frustrations? I’d hesitate to say that for a very specific reason: NONE OF THIS LOVE POLYGON DRAMA IS REMOTELY REALISTIC. Regardless of how cheap it is, people want to see this drama because it matches their favorite perfect characters together with a saccharine smile while pretending to be complicated and way smarter than it is. That’s what I find really annoying; there is never, EVER a point to any of this drama. What message is to be found in a four-plus-way unrequited love story? Nobody in-universe cares that these kids are “hurting” because everyone knows it’ll all just blow over. Tween romance, in real life or otherwise, usually has next to no foundation; that is, idiot teenagers “fall in love” with each other because they think the other is at worst physically attractive and at best a worthy friend. Never someone with whom they communicate effectively, never a candidate for a lifelong partner, never someone with whom they can see themselves having a future, and only very, VERY rarely because they genuinely understand each other. Kiznaiver is not an instance of the latter, despite how hard it wants to be.This series suggests that by understanding one another’s pain we can form lasting bonds, but, again, it undercuts that message at every turn. For example, take the final arc, where there’s so much sci-fi crap that explains the reasons for a character’s pain that it makes the whole “people getting hurt” thing feel almost entirely alien. And even when that isn’t really a factor in the narrative, the resulting bond doesn’t seem to be based off of that mutual understanding, instead still adhering to that tween “liking” of someone of the opposite sex for no other reason than that person is there and fits some kind of attractiveness profile. I’m going to chalk this up to Okada trying to maintain appeal to the tweens by forgoing better writing i.e. having her cake and eating it, too. The resolution to Kiznaiver’s love polygon is entirely unfulfilling because it lacks any dramatic weight; characters shouting and crying loudly about their perceived “suffering” is not moving because the reasons for that “suffering” are laughably underdeveloped and the characters have no discernable reason to find solace in the partners they ultimately choose. The only quasi-exception is Tsuguhito because he made an honest effort to try and figure out what was bothering Honaka, but even then his reasons for pursuing her in the first place never evolve past “she’s pretty” and into genuine empathy.And that’s what is lacking from Okada’s works: empathetic characters. A cast full of sociopaths and head cases has the potential to be material for good comedy, and to Kiznaiver’s credit, that is well-utilized, but this cast does NOT suit an emotionally super-charged romance, and Kiznaiver is arguably the worst offender of Okada’s repertoire. For a series about feeling other people’s pain, feeling sympathy, there is a staggeringly small number of heartfelt moments where genuine care between two characters is on display. And if you want to read into these situations a bit further, you’ll find that it’s always the male figures who are portrayed as being the saviors, the ones who point out the problems and do all the work to find the solutions. Way to progressively eschew gender norms, Okada.Kiznaiver is a train-wreck of a romance drama. Its characters have enough life to make for good comedy but are repeatedly killed whenever the show dials up the serious factor. They become hollow shells that only serve to play into Mari Okada’s idealized unrequited love fantasies. In a single phrase, this is bad fan fiction, and that is a genuine shame. A series that had this much love put into its production deserves better writing; the animation is great, the background work is solid, and, while some of the designs are ridiculous, the character art is consistently high-quality. The music is a bit all over the place, but I welcomed its electronica beats, and let’s not forget the English dub, either. Sometimes characters pause when they’re speaking, but I found the voices very entertaining most of the time. This was a now-rare effort by Ocean Studios up in Canada, and although they don’t have the best track record with regard to anime dubs, I was happy with the results.Do I recommend watching Kiznaiver? Yes, but only for its visuals, comedy, and English dub. There is basically nothing else to enjoy, nothing worth returning to in this show, no deeper meaning to dissect, and no metaphors to explore that haven’t already been hammered into the audience’s skull, either in this show or any other Okada original work. It’s highly derivative, completely contrived, and fails to live up to the quality of some of its parts. I strongly urge you to consider passing it.Happy watching!- LC a worthy candidate for this case study.Okada may be known for her style of drama, but a common trend across many of what I have seen of her screenwriting credits is a healthy dose of comedic hijinks, and this is ultimately what kept me from dropping Kiznaiver inside of the first episode.

But nothing too major and its pretty obvious stuff if you’ve watched at least then first episode. But don’t raise your pitch forks if you think I’ve spilled too many beans.For any anime studio that makes a show that is all style, no substance, it is probable for anyone to denote the studio’s value (there is Ghost in the Shell, but that’s retro so it doesn’t count). Unless if its Trigger. If there is one thing that we could all agree with, are the unique character designs: essentially Disgea heads with their chibi proportions toned down and are plonked...on Shoujo-style bodies. Sounds odd, but it works in a refreshing visual sense that you won’t see from the onslaught of moeshit and the awkwardly large eye sizes from the mid 2000’s.It is scientifically proven by the enlightenment association that the OP is also elder god tier. ‘nuff said.The whole gimmick behind the Kizna project is sharing all our physical and mental pain to the others around us. Ignore how the entire economy and civilizations looks awkward if someone gives birth, or someone crying over a funeral and everyone is forced to feel sad, or someone being mangled over a red room, or for every person who eats a ghost chili therefore causing societal collapse – I’ll give the benefit of the doubt this time. You could say the show is inherently flawed by its conception, however, the means this kizna project is presented, is what matters here.And by well-presented characters, I only mean one-noted archetypes. I may slide by the emotionless protagonist – there were some understandable moments; the tsundere red head – who doesn’t have nearly as many TSUN moments, so praise fuckin’ Michael!  And I can’t even care about Sonozaki – similar to the protagonist but keeps all her emotions to herself; not like it matters since we only get to know her that way for only a total of 15 minutes tops. Nico is cute for the sake of being cute and is naiive as all hell. At the end of the show, did it really seem like the characters were fleshed out? But Tenga is a speck you don’t see often. It is quite a disappointment because there was no backdrop that made the characters who they are. Apart from Maki who makes actual sense.Speaking of good characters, Maki and Tsuguhito just work, due to the simple fact that their relationship is a logical one. Unlike most anime romances which makes a kiss the ultimatum; the end goal of all relationships.Relationships makes just as much sense as shipping discussions from fan fiction writers, or people who just wanna draw fappable doujins. I still don’t know how Nico started getting feels with red head dude; there is some sense with his feels on the tusndere archetype. Sonozaki X Kitsuahara is still emotionless, even when they received their emotions ironically.At the end of the day, Kiznaiver got the message out there: that uniting an entire social hivemind into an individual mass, as a means in achieving philanthropic ego for a cosmopolitan society: within each mind reads every other mind – alike that of a book – is a bad idea!Even if the story is just about some teenagers doing summer camps and having their lives risked for the sake of science without anyone’s consent – shouldn’t the police be there already? At least there were some legitimately funny moments sprinkled here and there. After all the episodic shit that is there to supposedly create character development (which barely happens), the huge plot twist was just anti-climactic as hell because I just can’t stop giving a crap with these one dimensional and under developed people!FINALE: 4/10 – Looks better than most spacky beans (with uniquely good taste).

And fails at everything else, or lackluster in general.', '""Your bound by your wounds""Can we just say that when Studio Trigger does an original work, they always succeed in both themes and being an overall great animes?.Kiznaiver is very different but having the same impact from Trigger\'s previous original work Kill la Kill however where Kill la Kill is through sheer battle lunacy, Kiznaiver is through sheer emotional extremes and thus can be extremely relatable even in this state.In terms of characters, the entire main cast are fleshed out characters with their own quirks here and there, but considering that we\'re looking at ""pain"" or ""emotional pain"" as a central focus, the anime develops...these characters naturally making the cast to be well-defined, solid and to be frank complex characters, not only on character development but backstory and once again being relatable. LA\'s favourite character became Niko Niiyama voiced by Misaki Kuno (well that and she reminded LA of a less psychotic but still genki Nui Harime) and LA felt that she was the glue that hold up the main cast together. Many of the characters were homages to previous Trigger/Gainax work, such as rambunctious deliquent Hajime Tenga voiced by Hitoshi Yanai being like Kamina from Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann, the mysterious deadpanned Noriko Sonozaki voiced by Hibiku Yamamura had shades of Satsuki Kiryuinn from Kill la Kill and ever worrying and caring Chidori Takashiro voiced by Yuka Terasaki was Yoko Littner from Tengen Toppa Guren Lagann, however besides Niko, LA had a soft spot for the harsh tsundere Honoka Maki voiced by Rina Sato...not only for her backstory, but Rina Sato did a great job voicing her.Relationship-wise to this anime, it slowly and surely becomes something of a love dodecahedron with plenty of unrequited love and really LA isn\'t complaining about the romance in this anime being one part love dodecahedron, one part twice shy relationship as it brings in the great amount of drama it has (consider that LA didn\'t say MELOdrama), the only three away from dodecahedron are the aforementioned Honoka, the masochistic Yoshiharu Hisomu voiced by Koutarou Nishiyama and the prideful idiot Tsuguhito Yuta voiced by Nobunaga Shimazaki.Finally LA would like to point to the main character of this series, Katsuhira ""Kacchon"" Agata voiced by Yuki Kaji was at first a deadpanned lifeless person with almost no personality besides his quirk of not feeling pain, but throughout the series, he grew as a character and through his interactions with the other cast members, he not only grew a backbone but a personality and if any character evolved through this series, it was well EVERYONE but also Kacchon too, especially him.The animation by Trigger, well like Trigger to have some solid animation across the board, from the unique character designs to the aesthetics of the Kiznaivers to even how the characters act are solid. The animation is overall solid and unique typical of Trigger.Kiznaiver\'s plot does bring up some plot twists here and there and by all means, it\'s justified and ""makes sense"" and LA really can\'t fault the writing for it either as even some of the more outrageous moments can justified all because Kiznaiver\'s theming, concept and execution were done excellently especially as a touchy and generalized subject of ""pain"" and LA isn\'t gonna lie, many of the plot twist to revelations the characters knew kinda got LA teary-eyed at times.Voice acting???..well what can LA say but the voice acting was stellar throughout the board to the point LA can\'t single someone out as the best voice actor, the voice acting was just that great.The ending was by in large, something immense wringing in the character\'s motivations, emotional highs and connecting it\'s core themes into this finale and even though the final episode\'s impact wasn\'t ""physically batshit crazy"" amazing like Kill la Kill, but emotionally it ""triggered"" all the right notes and although it had a message about friendship, it\'s not about ""defeating evil"" more like trying to bring out an ENTIRE CAST\' beliefs and revelation to the most emotional extremes. On the other hand LA thought the romance side of things did actually pull all the romantic notes decently enough with some official couples formed but some left up in the air and really LA isn\'t complaining, the ending was still great overall, OTP be damned or not.Kiznaiver like it\'s central theme of being connected through emotional pain, it\'s another great venture from a Trigger work and can be relatable (be it romantic or what have you) and by far this is LA\'s favourite anime of Spring 2016. these characters naturally making the cast to be well-defined, solid and to be frank complex characters, not only on character development but backstory and once again being relatable.

The animation is overall solid and unique typical of Trigger.Kiznaiver\'s plot does bring up some plot twists here and there and by all means, it\'s justified and ""makes sense"" and LA really can\'t fault the writing for it either as even some of the more outrageous moments can justified all because Kiznaiver\'s theming, concept and execution were done excellently especially as a touchy and generalized subject of ""pain"" and LA isn\'t gonna lie, many of the plot twist to revelations the characters knew kinda got LA teary-eyed at times.Voice acting???..well what can LA say but the voice acting was stellar throughout the board to the point LA can\'t single someone out as the best voice actor, the voice acting was just that great.The ending was by in large, something immense wringing in the character\'s motivations, emotional highs and connecting it\'s core themes into this finale and even though the final episode\'s impact wasn\'t ""physically batshit crazy"" amazing like Kill la Kill, but emotionally it ""triggered"" all the right notes and although it had a message about friendship, it\'s not about ""defeating evil"" more like trying to bring out an ENTIRE CAST\' beliefs and revelation to the most emotional extremes. On the other hand LA thought the romance side of things did actually pull all the romantic notes decently enough with some official couples formed but some left up in the air and really LA isn\'t complaining, the ending was still great overall, OTP be damned or not.Kiznaiver like it\'s central theme of being connected through emotional pain, it\'s another great venture from a Trigger work and can be relatable (be it romantic or what have you) and by far this is LA\'s favourite anime of Spring 2016.', ""As an anime established around people and how those people interact with one another, Kiznaiver’s cast should be memorable and fleshed out. However, for over half the characters, this just doesn’t seem to be the case as they fall short when compared to other anime with similar goals such as Hibike Euphonium and Zankyou no Terror.In fact, Kiznaiver flounders in almost every aspect aside from it’s stunning visuals and decent soundtrack. These strengths are made apparent in the anime’s opening theme which pairs a decent and memorable song with flashy visuals that catch the viewer's attention. I think this opening is also full of...meaning, focusing mainly on the eyes and reflections of the characters showing that the anime itself is about seeing eye to eye. However, after this fabulous opening, the show almost immediately becomes sour.We are introduced to our cast of walking tropes from the airhead loli to the guy who is extremely cold because of some dark event that happened in his past and, like most anime that feature similar tropes, these characters (excluding Maki, which we’ll get to later) barely change from their original state. When we leave off, Niko is still as much an airhead as she was episode 1 and Yoshiharu is still as masochistic as ever.Though some might fawn over “how unique this anime is making all these different tropes interact” there are actually many other anime that have something similar. This list, though extremely short, includes almost every generic harem that’s come out. It’s no stretch to say that, these interactions are in no way unique and a varied cast can be found in almost any anime made in recent years.Not only can varied casts be found easily, but so can relationships that are deeper than the ones found in Kiznaiver. Many anime breath life into the relationships the characters have with one another and try to make them as human as possible to best connect the characters to their audience. Kiznaiver, on the other hand, creates empty relationships between its cast. These platonic bonds that were forced upon them through the Kiznaiver system quickly turn into romantic interests. Literally every character is romantically attracted to another, creating a confusing web of love. Though I don’t think a show doing this is necessarily bad, I do believe doing this in a fashion where there is no clear reasoning for said attraction is. Kiznaiver, though an anime about relationships, falls into the latter of the two categories, making this simple, yet devastating mistake.However, these bonds are not the only problem this trainwreck of a cast has. The characters themselves undergoes little to no change throughout the series, the primary exception being Maki who has an entire arc dedicated to her. I found this arc to be the best part of the anime as it fleshed out and gave life to one of the it’s 8 main characters. If the anime had had arcs similar to this one for its diverse cast, I think it would have been much better. Unfortunately, Kiznaiver, most likely due to funding issues which only allowed them a meager 12 episodes, does not do this. It fleshes out Maki in her arc and gives Katsuhira a deep backstory throughout the course of the anime, changing the audience's perspective on him but leaving him relatively unchanged as a whole. However, the rest of the cast is left a mere reflection of their respective tropes.As stated earlier, the one thing that does remain constant throughout this anime (besides the characters personalities) is it’s art style, bringing us beautiful characters and scenery which are by far some of my favorites. Not only does the art style and animation breath some life into is rather dull cast, but it also remains constant throughout the show. From the fast paced scenes such as when the characters first meet to the slower ones where they’re sitting on a train, I found the images before me to be as stunning and catchy as those presented in the opening.The visuals alone are no reason to watch a show, however, and Kiznaiver fails to accomplish anything it was aiming for. It had poor writing, poor directing, poor relationships and most of all, poor characters and because it lacked these essentials, I have to say that Kiznaiver is in no way an outstanding show.Story: 4Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 4Enjoyment: 4Overall: 5 meaning, focusing mainly on the eyes and reflections of the characters showing that the anime itself is about seeing eye to eye.

What\'s the reason for this? I just couldn\'t bring myself to get back and watch the last couple of episodes of this garbage for a long time.Now, i can\'t bring myself to say it was ALL bad, no, far from it, the visuals and drawing style was superb (as expected of trigger), the characters where pretty good (the interactions between them where not however), the op and ed (as well as some of the other audio things) where great.. But those things, while important, are kind of an extra, the wrapping on the candy if you will,...and if what\'s under the said wrapping isn\'t good... Well, no matter how colorful and appealing you make it, the content won\'t become any better from it, and if you wrapped a piece of doo-doo, its still gonna be it when you open it up!Well then, what is the problem with this show? Three things, as far as i see it:1- the story. The story of Kiznaiver is extremely simple, almost non existent - some scientists decided to improve the world, by making a way to artificially share feelings... And then decided to try this on actual humans, and kids at that. It all went horribly wrong, as expected, and the actual story is about two of the luckier participants of this experiment who didn\'t turn into emotionless husks trying to get their feelings and identities back together. That\'s the idea at least, but... (see #2)2- Bad focus. The most troubled and therefore interesting characters are the protagonist and the girl who was in the original experiment with him, yet they get the least focus, and only towards the end of the anime. The rest of the show focuses on 6 individuals who barely fit in the show due to their ""problems"" being so common and insignificant (having no friends, unanswered love etc.. with the exception of one of them, who\'s close friend died, that\'s probably the only really troubled person out of the 6) that making such a big deal of it all is pretty much a joke that reeks of forced drama and downplays actual sorrow and problems.3- Infantilism and bad interactions. As i already said, the show focuses on 6 more or less normal individuals. Now then, unlike the protagonist, they should have no problem understanding emotions and the concept of friendship, right? WRONG. Despite being around 17 years old, they seem to have about as much understanding of their, and other\'s emotions as the protagonist, who LOST all of his. As a bonus, they seem to have no idea how to interact with other people, and what friendship means. Why? No reason. As a result of that, watching them try to communicate is a pain, and coupled with how big of a deal they, and the show makes of their tiny little worries, the result is annoyance and dullness, making the show a pain to watch.Final word - I would not recommend this show, it lacks in interest and any kind of impact and if what\'s under the said wrapping isn\'t good... Well, no matter how colorful and appealing you make it, the content won\'t become any better from it, and if you wrapped a piece of doo-doo, its still gonna be it when you open it up!Well then, what is the problem with this show?

I feel so... .... ... happy.', ""Remember that childhood bully who would punch others all the time? Would he still punch others if he felt just as much pain as the person he was punching? Kiznaiver is a theoretical system that applies a communist-style approach to pain; if I were to feel pain if someone else got hurt, it's in my best interest to prevent them from getting hurt right?Though the premise sounds extremely interesting, the show plays out as something between Kokoro Connect and Danganronpa. Basically, a group of teenagers are forced, against their will to become Kiznaivers, and forced to undergo various trials meant to try to connect them...even more so and to test out the limits of the Kizuna System. It's a rather wild ride that ultimately fizzes out. If you're looking for a thinking show, this isn't quite deep enough. If you're looking for a show about relationships, this is still pretty shallow compared to other shows out there (such as Kokoro Connect). Ultimately, it's a fair watch but I was really hoping for better.Animation:Despite the show's poster image, the animation quality overall is only average. The show is drawn in a very saturated color palette, giving it a comic feel, especially in bright scenes. Backgrounds are reasonably drawn but detailing is a bit lax. The characters themselves are easily distinguishable though also not particularly detailed. The show has very thick character outlines, especially noticeable in bright scenes. Character emotions are average overall, though half of our leads try to hide (or seem to naturally lack) them. Our protagonist Katsuhira lacks emotions to the point of annoyance, just as bad as the lead in Persona 4. And what the heck are the Gomorins? Anyone who doesn't get suspicious with a city full of these things is weird.There is surprisingly a lot of action in this show, but for some reason it all feels rather half-hearted despite characters having numerous near-death situations. Expect a good deal of fist fights, a lot of running, and even some explosions. There's a bit of blood but nothing particularly gory. As with most shows these days, there's the obligatory bath scene, otherwise it's not particularly ecchi.Sound:The show opens with a rather interesting choice for an OP; it's an electronic, heavily padded song that somehow reminds me of the OP of paranoia agent. Honestly, it's one of the more catchy songs that I've heard of late and apparently BBS's last song. The ED is a light rock piece that has a pretty good melody along with a few rather interesting pitch shifts. The BGM is fairly varied though overall it has an electronic inspired feel with a healthy dosage of fitting chaos. There are some action pieces when the Gomorins show up that give off some Arabic vibes.The cast is relatively mixed. We have veteran Rina Satou voicing an aloof girl and rising VA Misaki Kuno voicing a rather childish character. Junichi Suwabe also voices our teacher. The other VAs are either very junior or have had historically little luck getting large roles. I wasn't particularly impressed with the performance of many of the VAs for once, though perhaps that's just a consequence of the rather odd characters.Story:Kiznaiver's story is one big game. After being forced to become Kiznaivers, our band of characters, who supposedly would normally never get along, are sent through a series of quests ranging from giving introductions to helping each other out of dire situations. Just like Danganronpa, there is a group behind it all orchestrating this big experiment. The plot is one single thread that builds to an eventual (greatly foreshadowed) climax. As the story progresses, we find more about each of the main character's past, though Katsuhira and Noriko's exact past (hinted throughout) is kept from the viewer until the climax. There are quite a few twists along the way, but they all feel artificial as they're introduced by the researchers rather than the characters themselves (the researchers must have hacked Google or something to know so much about our main characters).There are numerous issues with the story besides the artificial feel in the execution. First, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there are strong plot shields (I mean come on, Katsuhira doesn't feel any pain). Second, the show doesn't present the researchers as particularly scientific. Human testing is rather difficult in the real world, and given all the uncounted variables, I'm not sure how they can actually deduce anything. To further make things feel immature, they added a bunch of brainless nobodies in ugly mascot costumes known as Gomorins. These apparently rampage across the city doing any bidding of the researchers- fights with these mascots makes this feel like some stupid offshoot of Power Rangers. Finally, why does the project span the entire city when they only need a handful of test subjects? It utterly fails to sell the scope and benefit of the Kizuna System. With all the issues, you just can't take the show seriously.Character:Compared to Kokoro Connect, the characters here feel inconsistent. Katsuhira isn't particularly relatable as he is practically devoid of emotions. Noriko is central to the plot, yet her behavior is incoherent at times and her role questionable throughout the show. Overall, though each of the primary characters is assigned a specific trait, they don't have very much depth. They develop relationships with each other in this show, but these are supposedly formed via intervention of the artificial Kizuna System, and thus they don't really feel real. Ultimately, none of the characters felt particularly relatable or even likable, thus greatly reducing my engagement level.Value:To really enjoy this show, you ought to watch it from the perspective that it's so bad it's good. It's not serious enough to engage a thinking mind, and the characters are not developed enough to move the heart. Though the premise is interesting, the artificial feel of the execution and the lack of meaningful, relatable characters destroy the enjoyment of the show.

It's a mixed bag, tbh, with the good parts being absolutely exceptional and the bad parts being really, really atrocious, and the rest being mediocre fluff. A lot of the writing is distasteful and really gross, and you almost have to pick and choose through the script and silently pray for a scene that won't make you want to throttle the writers. It wasn't until the midway point that the anime finally settled into itself after...the horrible beginning episodes, and the 7th episode is probably the pinnacle of the series.I majorly associate Kiznaiver with Bakemonogatari and Angel Beats, and after having watched to the finish, I'm even more firmly convinced that this is the extremely stylish, immature lovechild with an unexpectedly wise outlook on the nature of empathy.The only reason why I even rated the Character section above a 2 was because of The One Character (c'mon, everyone knows who I'm talking about) whose arc was given a deeply lavish attention to. The others, as enjoyable as they were (though mostly irritating) were really superficial caricatures. They were a vague collection of archetypes that mainly existed to be the mouthpiece to the writer's fauxslophical musings about friendship and emotions - which isn't bad, and it seems intentional. The problem is, just, for a series so dependent on human relationships, it was a huge strike.The art direction is absolutely amazing, and I would even say iconic at times. And it's a real shame about the characterization, because it's clear that the writers have a talent with writing character arcs. The problem is, they just didn't deem it to be a priority in a series where it kind of should've been emphasized to the point of overkill. The premise was really flimsy and contrived, and so was the plot.And the forced romance- really unnecessary. Really, really could've been avoided. the horrible beginning episodes, and the 7th episode is probably the pinnacle of the series.I majorly associate Kiznaiver with Bakemonogatari and Angel Beats, and after having watched to the finish, I'm even more firmly convinced that this is the extremely stylish, immature lovechild with an unexpectedly wise outlook on the nature of empathy.The only reason why I even rated the Character section above a 2 was because of The One Character (c'mon, everyone knows who I'm talking about) whose arc was given a deeply lavish attention to.

Really, really could've been avoided."", 'Kiznaiver Review(There is a possibility I spoil minor details of Kiznaiver in the following review. So be warned. I won\'t spoil any plot-heavy elements, but I do delve into the shows themes, as well as lightly describe a few characters and tease a late-series scene, but don\'t actually describe it in detail.)Kiznaiver left me with just one feeling at the end of its twelve-episode run: understanding. Not an understand on my part, but an understanding from the studio. It seems legitimately like Trigger understands something that other studios just do not about the human experience. Obviously, they have showcased understanding of what makes fun...things fun, namely in Kill la Kill, Inferno Cop, and Space Patrol Luluco, three of the most fun, hype, exciting, etc. shows I have seen since Gurren Lagann. But contrary to what the hedonists in your time will tell you, there is more to life than just having fun. I think, after instinct, humans have two basic ""things"" for lack of a better term: emotion, and connection. As people, we can both feel things that are not in the physical realm, as well as connect those feelings with others. In a way, we become part of each other, sharing our experiences and overcoming hurdles together. And before I continue any farther, I should say that I believe those two ""things"", those concepts of emotion and connection, are the driving force of Kiznaiver. They are the show, the story, the characters, the animation, and the sound. They pervade every part of this series, and they left me with something I had never quite felt in anime before.If I just score this show on the outline to the side, using Story, Animation, Sound, Character, and Enjoyment, I cannot do justice to Kiznaiver. Just like human emotions, there is an intangible to this series, something that can\'t just have a number slapped on it to explain it. The more I write about this show, the more brilliant I think it is. The only way to understand my true feelings is to experience the show, and funnily enough, experience is such a core theme of Kiznaiver. I couldn\'t tell you for certain if this was Trigger\'s intention, but damn is it successful. Since I don\'t believe the score\'s for the five categories will truly highlight why I love this show, I will say now that this intangible I speak of is also factored into my overall rating. That may be confusing, but it is the only way I can see fairly assessing the show.The story of Kiznaiver is interesting, using a textbook definition of science fiction as its plot. From Merriam-Webster, science fiction: stories about how people and societies are affected by imaginary scientific developments in the future. This is Kiznaiver\'s story, exploring how connecting pain between individuals can affect said individuals. Initiall, the show posits that world peace would be attained if this were applied globaly, but it doesn\'t focus on that. It instead uses a sort of slice-of-life format, choosing to zero in on eight main characters: Katsuhira Agata, Yoshiharu Hisomu, Honoka Maki, Niko Niiyama, Noriko Sonozaki, Chidori Takashiro, Hajime Tenga, and Tsuguhito Yuta, and delve into how their lives are affected by this ""Kiznaiver"", which based on the Japanese words for wound/scar and bond/connection. While Noriko Sonozaki archetypes the rest of the show\'s characters as ""Seven Deadly Sins"", it is my belief that this is one of the best casts of characters I have ever seen in terms of realism. I feel like in life I have met someone just as eccentric as Niko, someone just as closed-off and bitchy as Maki, someone as emotionally cut-off as Katsuhira, someone as confrontational as Tenga. The characters reminded me of the Great Gatsby, in the sense that they all felt like accurate depictions of people, not characters written for a story. Each one felt unique, and different, and it was wonderful to see. To add to that, the characters actually progressed from episode one to episode twelve. I was most surprised by Hisomu\'s progression from a seemingly-forgettable side-character to one of the funniest characters in the show, hands down. Each character reacted normally to situations, and didn\'t feel like some esoteric, philosophy spouting mouth-piece, but like people!Speaking of mouth-pieces, they were all fantastically voiced by their actors and actresses. In fact, all the sound of Kiznaiver was excellent. Hayashi Yuuki, the composer of the My Hero Academia, Death Parade, and Haikyuu!! soundtracks did this one, and he was wonderful. The music brought out emotions like nothing else I have seen in anime, making you feel melancholy, joy, elation, excitement, and levity. In addition to the show\'s OST, the OP by Boom Boom Satellites was an entrancing electronic tune, and the ED was a solid, catchy J-pop song. And I would be utterly remiss if I didn\'t comment on the sound design, especially of episode ten. The shows sound director, Kameyama Toshiki, crafted one of the most heart-crunching, bone-chlling, emotionally-haunting scenes I have ever listened to in the final part of episode ten. I also feel I must bring up the excellent performances by the voice actors in this scene. I mean it when I say I do not think I will ever forget the word ""itai"" for the rest of my life.And I guess I could not end the ""objective"" portion of the review without mentioning the animation. With Trigger, you have three options, animation-wise. One, Little Witch Academia-tier, which is consistently amazing through out. Two, Kill la Kill and Space Patrol Luluco-tier, which shows flashes of brilliance but also poorly animated sequences, whether by lack of funding or by intention. And three, Inferno Cop and Ninja Slayer-tier, which, to borrow Demolition D+\'s word\'s, embraces the ""clip-art animation techniques"". It brings me great joy to say Kiznaiver belongs in the top-tier of animation, surpassing Little Witch Academia. The design of the city looks modern enough to surprise you with sci-fi elements, but also feel eerily like real life. The literal animation showcases some amazing talent. For some reason, the shadows stood out to me. The color palette was superb, with vibrancy when needed and dullness when required. And the character design is something to behold. Each character looks unique, with the exception of Tenga, because he just looks like red-haired Space Dandy. Yuta and Hisomu were probably the most original designs I have seen in the Spring 2016 season. Also, the fashion. It\'s like the gods of good clothing taste blessed these animators, not only allowing for incredibly stylish characters, but also for bright, colorful, and stand-out clothes to associate with the characters. The clothing honestly did so much as to contribute to the characterization, that is how amazing it was.If you couldn\'t tell after slogging through my review, I have nothing but praise for Kiznaiver. It excelled at animation, sound, and character, while having a passable and intriguing story. But now I would like to attempt to explain the ""intangible"" I described earlier. Because that is what pushes Kiznaiver so far, not its superb animation, not its wonderful sound design, and not its diverse and animated cast of characters. No, it is the themes of the show, and their expression that push this show to new boundaries. To not spoil anything, pain, connection, and friendship are explored with more depth than I have ever seen. I believe that depth comes from the realistic nature of the presentation. You literally see pain, you literally see connection through pain, and you literally see friendship bloom because of that connection. The themes build upon each other, each one necessary for the other. Without pain, connection can\'t happen and friendship cannot either. With connection, then we would become isolated and most-likely calloused, maybe even jaded. And without friendship, we would lack a meaning expression of connection, and feel like pain and connection were purposeless. This is what I meant at the beginning when I said that Trigger understands. They simply get it. But what is ""it""? ""It"" is to be human. I often hear the saying, ""Humans are social creatures"". And they are right. Humans need connection and friendship, and while it is unfortunate, pain creates connections like nothing else. Pain births people into the world as babies, and often times, pain takes people out of the world. Pain is absolutely core to our being, just like it is absolutely core to Kiznaiver. Without pain, the show, the story, the characters, the sound, they are nothing. But with pain, they are connected. With pain, they are friends. And with pain, they feel love.I can never truly justify my 10/10 rating of this show. By no means is it perfect, as my rating of the story should prove. And I doubt anyone will really experience the same thing I felt when watching this anime. But the positives of Kiznaiver far, far outweigh the negatives. No show has ever so uniquely and so piercingly explored its themes in the way Trigger explored its themes in Kiznaiver. And no show will likely ever connect to me on the emotional level like Kiznaiver did. Isn\'t that funny in a sense? A show about connection passes through the TV screen, and connects with its viewers heart. That is something beautiful, remarkable, and something I believe is worth celebrating.Thanks for reading. things fun, namely in Kill la Kill, Inferno Cop, and Space Patrol Luluco, three of the most fun, hype, exciting, etc. shows I have seen since Gurren Lagann. But contrary to what the hedonists in your time will tell you, there is more to life than just having fun. I think, after instinct, humans have two basic ""things"" for lack of a better term: emotion, and connection. As people, we can both feel things that are not in the physical realm, as well as connect those feelings with others. In a way, we become part of each other, sharing our experiences and overcoming hurdles together. And before I continue any farther, I should say that I believe those two ""things"", those concepts of emotion and connection, are the driving force of Kiznaiver. They are the show, the story, the characters, the animation, and the sound. They pervade every part of this series, and they left me with something I had never quite felt in anime before.If I just score this show on the outline to the side, using Story, Animation, Sound, Character, and Enjoyment, I cannot do justice to Kiznaiver. Just like human emotions, there is an intangible to this series, something that can\'t just have a number slapped on it to explain it. The more I write about this show, the more brilliant I think it is. The only way to understand my true feelings is to experience the show, and funnily enough, experience is such a core theme of Kiznaiver. I couldn\'t tell you for certain if this was Trigger\'s intention, but damn is it successful. Since I don\'t believe the score\'s for the five categories will truly highlight why I love this show, I will say now that this intangible I speak of is also factored into my overall rating. That may be confusing, but it is the only way I can see fairly assessing the show.The story of Kiznaiver is interesting, using a textbook definition of science fiction as its plot. From Merriam-Webster, science fiction: stories about how people and societies are affected by imaginary scientific developments in the future. This is Kiznaiver\'s story, exploring how connecting pain between individuals can affect said individuals. Initiall, the show posits that world peace would be attained if this were applied globaly, but it doesn\'t focus on that. It instead uses a sort of slice-of-life format, choosing to zero in on eight main characters: Katsuhira Agata, Yoshiharu Hisomu, Honoka Maki, Niko Niiyama, Noriko Sonozaki, Chidori Takashiro, Hajime Tenga, and Tsuguhito Yuta, and delve into how their lives are affected by this ""Kiznaiver"", which based on the Japanese words for wound/scar and bond/connection. While Noriko Sonozaki archetypes the rest of the show\'s characters as ""Seven Deadly Sins"", it is my belief that this is one of the best casts of characters I have ever seen in terms of realism. I feel like in life I have met someone just as eccentric as Niko, someone just as closed-off and bitchy as Maki, someone as emotionally cut-off as Katsuhira, someone as confrontational as Tenga.

It’s been years since Trigger has made an anime series will full-length episodes (the last one being Kill la Kill), and it was time that Trigger works on larger project. It has a lot of things going for it; it’s got an interesting and unique premise, pretty art, and good-looking characters… what could go wrong? Kiznaiver does a lot right, but they do make some mistakes in the way. But Kiznaiver turned out to be one of the better anime of the season for many good reasons. The series does more than just being pretty....~{Story}~The premise of Kiznaiver might be the most original premise of the season. The story revolves around a group of teenagers that are forced to join the Kizuna System, where all of share and feel the same amount of pain when inflicted on one. The teenagers are used as test specimens for this experiment. The series revolves around these teens and how they share their feelings with one another in order to get along. It’s an interesting premise that’s actually quite unique. Though it may share some similarities with Kokoro Connect in terms of execution, as both series focuses on characters and character relationships. Kiznaiver, for most of the series, isn’t very story heavy. It primarily depends on the characters and their past to get along. Most of the character backstories are quite good, particularly Maki’s backstory. But the series felt too unfocused in the first half. But in the second half, the main story in put on the front lines and that’s when the series feels a lot better. And the story gets quite interesting and there’s some nice twists and reveals near the end. But the series starts to fall apart during its climax as the series starts to favor melodrama more than anything, and it makes the series feel too cheesy. The ending is too cliché and too predictable, thus making the ending disappointing.Story: 4/10~{Presentation}~Kiznaiver is made up of two structure. During the first half of the series, Kiznaiver is more character-driven than story-driven. The second half of the series, however, is the opposite. The first half of the series is used to establish its characters and create character relationships. This half focuses on backstories and lets the viewers know how the characters feel. During the second half of the series, reveals are made which makes progress for the story, character tension is created and the truth of the Kizuna System is revealed. Even though this half is used to focus on the story, character development is strongest in this half due to the tension created and how the characters react to it. The problem is that Kiznaiver feels like two different anime, due to a lack of flow between these two parts. And the series is very melodramatic (for the worse) throughout the series. Character reactions feel intentionally emotional, without feeling emotional. Unfortunately, the emotional pain felt by the characters isn’t felt by the viewers. And at times, scenes that should keep you invested might just make you laugh instead, and that’s not a good thing.Presentation: 4/10~{Character}~For a character heavy series like Kiznaiver, there needs to be heavy characters (sorry). And it doesn't turn out all that well. Our protagonist, Agata Katsuhira, is a very weird protagonist to say the least. He’s apathetic to the core. He feels no pain, he makes no emotion, and he has no goal. And he’s strangely likable. He has a good backstory and he shines the most in the cast. Sonozaki Noriko, however, felt somewhat lacking as a character. She starts off as a generic coldhearted girl, and by the end of the series, it doesn’t change much. Her backstory is good, but it’s hard to care about her when she wasn’t exactly likable in the first place. And unfortunately her relationship with Agata feels lacking. Takashiro Chidori was a more likable female character. Sure, she’s got a fair share of problems too, and she’s pretty selfish, but at least she made sense and felt realistic. Her and Agata’s relationship was done a lot better too. Tenga Hajime isn’t the most developed character, but he’s fun, likable, and has some good character relationships. Same goes for Niiyama Niko. Maki Honoka gets quite a lengthy, yet interesting, backstory, and ended up being one of the best characters of the series. Yuta Tsuguhito on the other hand, doesn’t get much development and ends up being one of the weaker characters of the series. And then there’s Hisomu Yoshiharu, and he’s just… yeah.Character: 4/10~{Art}~,What got me interested in Kiznaiver is the art, and it undoubtedly the best thing about this series. It’s absolutely beautiful to watch at times. The bright colors complement its art style and the background are really well detailed. Kiznaiver doesn’t aim for a photorealistic art style, but rather an abstract one. Character designs can be intentionally disproportional at times to add to the wackiness of the series. The character designs themselves are splendid. Agata’s look is really cool as his hair is a mixture of white and brown (for certain reasons you’ll find out later) and his look always remains the same. Tenga’s hair is quite wacky and it complements his character. Same goes for Niko’s eccentric clothes matching her eccentric characteristics. And Hisomu’s piercing-heavy look is quite unique. Pretty much every character design matches the character. The only problem is that the art is somewhat inconsistent. There will be moments where things feel less detailed, such as character models from far away.Art: 7.5/10~{Animation}~The animations are good enough to complement the art of Kiznaiver. The animation quality isn’t the most consistent as there are moments where the level of fluidity decreases, but when the animations are at its peak, it’s really good looking. As some may guess from reading the premise, Kizaniver isn’t an action anime, so animation qualities aren’t demanding. But Trigger does whatever they have to do properly.And the backgrounds are really well animated too, so that adds to the production values. Characters are sometimes intentionally animated disproportionally for style. It normally wouldn’t work well with other anime, but it works with Kiznaiver.Animation: 7/10~{Voice Acting}~The seiyuu cast in Kiznaiver does a very good job in what they have to do. There’s nothing that really stands out, but it’s fine the way it is. Kaji Yuki does a very good job as Agata, as he manages to make the character feel as emotionless as possible, and even during more emotional moments, Kaji does a good job in handling those parts too. Yamamura Hibiku also does a good job as Sonozaki, as she too manages to capture the emotionlessness of her character pretty well. Terasaki Yuka, Satou Rina, and Shimazaki Nobunaga all do a standard role as their characters. It’s nothing too special, but it works. Maeno Tomoaki does a very good job as Tenga, as he manages to capture his over-the-top and down-to-earth moments properly. Kuno Misaki also does a very good job as Niiyama, as she captures her character’s eccentric side properly. And Nishiyama Koutarou does a great job as the masochist Hisomu.Voice Acting: 6/10~{Music}~The music in Kiznaiver is alright, though it’s probably the OP and ED that shines the most. The OP, “LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME” can be described by one word: trippy. It’s so trippy and whack that it’s hard not to love it. Listening to it just makes me feel like I need to drop everything and zone out. It’s a very unique OP, complemented by some great music and addicting vocals. The ED, “Hajimari no Sokudo”, is also very good. Unlike the OP that heavily relies on the music, the ED relies on the vocals. And fortunately the vocals are pretty good in the song. It’s not as memorable as the OP, but it’s still good. The background music however is a mixed bag. There’s no track that stands out in the series, but there’s no track that left a spur impression on me. Better background music would have been better though.Music: 6/10~{Enjoyment}~Overall, I enjoyed Kiznaiver more than I initially thought I would. The only thing I saw from Trigger beforehand was Inferno Cop, so it was hard for me to understand this studio’s potential. That being said, Kiznaiver was good enough for me to try out Kill la Kill later. Kiznaiver had some characters that I liked, and some characters that felt average. The main premise was interesting and the story was nice, but there’s too many moments in the series where the drama was too much and, at times, made the series cringe worthy. And the ending did leave a sour taste in my mouth. But Kiznaiver, as a whole, was a good series. It wasn’t memorable, but it was fun while it lasted.Enjoyment: 5/10In the end, Kiznaiver is something worth checking out if you haven’t already. It’s got a good blend of drama, comedy, and romance, even if none of these genres ever get fully explored. The characters are good overall and that’s good for a character-driven anime. The premise is unique, but the execution isn’t up there. There’s too many moments where melodrama takes over and character dialogue can get on the repetitive side. The main story is good once it kicks in and there’s a good amount of reveals to keep you interested. However the ending might be a tad too predictable and cliché. But Kiznaiver manages to be a good anime despite its flaws, but it never gets to be the great anime it was setting to achieve.+ Interesting and unique premise that gets fully explored+ Characters are good and get adequate development+ Some really tense moments are present in the series and the story has some interesting reveals+ Art style is absolutely gorgeous at times and the character designs are very unique- Some of the dialogue can lack its impact and there’s a good amount of cheesy moments- Series ends on a low note due to a predictable endingOverall: 5.4/10 ~{Story}~The premise of Kiznaiver might be the most original premise of the season.

Character designs were so so so diverse and unique but they all fit the style so nicely and voices matched perfectly.Premise is extremely unique but pretty lackluster. The concept of the entire series just doesn't have a good enough base. It had a pretty weak start but my interest piqued in it around episode 3. I personally only really enjoyed one of the plot points surrounding one character and that only lasted 1-2 episodes. Many of the characters were ridiculously one-dimensional. The only thing that defined...them was their overall goal???Overall I would highly recommend just because of the art-- the style alone is enough to make this a 7/10. If you enjoy ridiculous drama and romance then this is the series for you. them was their overall goal???Overall I would highly recommend just because of the art-- the style alone is enough to make this a 7/10.

Just go and watch it you won't regret watching it.It's about friendship and how we're connected to each other through pain. Art style is so amazing it will make you feel the story so deeply.The idea of proportionally sharing pain among multiple people may sound like a pretty interesting premise for a series, but in Kiznaiver’s case it’s just that – a concept. Despite all the talk of shadowy scientific organisations, a grand plan for achieving world peace and some rather curious flashback foreshadowing, the main crux of Kiznaiver doesn’t do much in the way of carrying the show forward....If anything it’s just a method of getting all these wildly different characters together in the first place. Once the whole “if one person gets hurt the rest will feel it” thing is set up there isn’t much left to really do with it other than for it to act as a visual metaphor. As the 12-episode series approaches its conclusion and starts to answer some of the bigger mysteries of the series (why Katsuhira can’t feel pain anymore, Sonozaki’s true identity), what should have felt like huge revelations instead comes across as minor background material.

Mainly because the entire anime sort of waddles around the Kiznaiver system and the plot had other ideas in mind than just that. And secondarily because it\'s just not that well told. The anime is character-centric and isn\'t that good at expressing all of the characters\' feelings (especially Noriko Sonozaki) and when the plot tries to tie in several layers together at the end, it reaaaaaaaally doesn\'t work well at all.Art: 8 : It\'s Trigger.

No surprises, it looks good, it\'s well animated, it feels alive and is overall very well done and stylish.Sound: 8: ripoff of a-ha or not, that opening alone will let Kiznaiver leave a (small) mark in my mind.

NOT.Drama that forced audiences to empathize the characters was barf-worthy enough but forced romance too? *screams internally*I can still still tolerate good vs evil kind of angst but in the end this is all about a girl who strung along everyone around her with her problem. And what caught my interest in the first episode was nothing more than a charade to cover the lack of solid plot lines.The art was the only reason I didnt drop this because I'm a sucker for sleek animation.

You failed.Story:What is this anime actually about? Well, it starts out as a story about the Kizna system, that makes people feel each others pain. Bringing together a colorful cast of very different people and forcing them to more or less live together is a pretty interesting premise. Here's where the problems begin. Kiznaiver tries to be more and starts growing into several different directions, losing its focus on the way. First it (almost) drops the whole thing about being kidnapped and used as guinea pigs for a story about their growing...friendship, then we get a horrible teen love drama and then we go back again to the actual plot, but do something totally different with it. By trying to be something special, Kiznaiver fails to deliver and ends being a nearly episodic mess with no real conclusion. (Yes, it does have a conclusion, but there are so many things that were just ignored for it, that I have a hard time calling it that).3/10Art:If you've seen one of the other Trigger anime like Kill la Kill or Gurren Lagann, you know what to expect and that is what you will get. I enjoy Triggers artstyle, though taking place in a more realistic setting, they don't go overboard with crazy stuff, which is okay. However, one starts to see a pattern in character art, which I may criticize in future reviews of Trigger anime.8/10Sound:The opening is awesome, plain and simple. The ending is also okay. Voice acting in general is well done, a little over the top at times, but charming enough for me. The rest of the soundtrack was okay, not memorable but not distracting either.8/10Characters:This one is hard to rate. On one hand, I liked many of them, the roles they portray and the way they react to things. On the other hand, we have the mess of a story that makes them look like idiots, even though they are rarely at fault for this. My big issue here are the main characters, Kacchon and Sonozaki, who are completely unlikeable. It's not because they don't seem to have any emotions, but rather the fact that they don't seem to care about anything but themselves and hurt others as they please if it benefits their goals. For me, the ending does not redeem them.5/10Enjoyment:Kiznaiver gave me a hard time enjoying it. A promising start was followed by stupid decisions to take the plot into all the wrong directions. At around episode 9 it got so bad, that I was pondering dropping it. I managed to make t through, but my enjoyment died on the way. What pisses me off most about it is, that it was completely unnecessary. They could have just told a story about the Kizna project and I would have probably liked it. The way it turned out though left me unsatisfied. I wouldn't call Kznaiver a bad anime, but knowing what was ahead, I would not start watching it again.3/10Overall:5.4/10 friendship, then we get a horrible teen love drama and then we go back again to the actual plot, but do something totally different with it.

I honestly do not think they do this excellent anime justice; thus I thought I\'d throw in my two cents about it.The voice acting is superb in this anime.  Yuki Kaji, the voice-actor for the main character, expertly delivered the monotonous tone that was needed to convey the character issue - the loss of pain.  However, despite the monotony the voice actor portrays in the character, I was not, not even once, bored with Katsuhira.  From the first episode, the story developers easily establish the needed hints as...to why Katsuhira is the way he is and why his loss of feeling pain was actually not how he was when he was younger. As a watcher of the anime, I knew that something traumatic had to have happened to him.  Around episode 10, Yuki Kaji slowly changes the tone and intensity in his voice, offering more life to the character that wasn\'t present in the majority of the anime. At that point, I could literally hear Katsuhira slowly regaining his humanity, almost as if the voice actor himself was slowly realizing that pain is precious in its own way and that his character needed to have the desire to feel pain first before realizing that.The other voice actors also did an excellent job.  I found their delivery of the pain and suffering involved with getting their heart broken for the first time performed very well.  I was convinced that Chidori was in a lot of pain and that Honoka had suffered greatly in her youth. Yuka Terasaki delivered that pain in every line and I thought Rina Sato (Honoka Maki) stayed in character and delivered her lines well.   Overall, they all did well, and you always have to remember that the voice actors we hear all so often in animes do an excellent job anyway.  If there ever is a blame, it is in the story and how those characters are drawn to convey emotion.  There\'s only so much a voice actor can do.The story itself was excellent.  There are a few flaws here and there, but I""m not going to knock off a point for the story just because it isn\'t perfect.  Perfection is, simply, impossible.  Let me first start by saying that all of these characters are around sixteen, seventeen years old; so it shouldn\'t be a wonder that these characters are going to have high school related drama.  In other words, they are going to fall in love with their friends but find out that friend doesn\'t love them but one of their other friends...etc etc.  To be honest though, I thought the way the love stories developed was refreshing.  If you\'ve watched as many animes as I have, especially recent ones (e.g. The Asterisk War, GATE, Fairy Tail...even Fate/Stay Night...) I think you\'ll find the candid confessions of the other characters to be very refreshing, indeed.  (cough cough, Gray and Juvia anyone???)  I mean, how many times have you seen a girl character have secret, hidden feelings, blushing like no one can notice and stuttering at every word when she\'s around the MC?  HMMMM??? Yeah, a lot.  And how long does that last?  THE ENTIRE FREAKIN\' SERIES. In this anime, literally in the second episode, one of the female characters outright admits that she likes the MC. Let\'s just say that I was appreciative of that.I thought the use of the Kiznaiver system was a good way to push plot development and character development.  As other reviewers have stated, this anime is a character-oriented anime that involves a failed government program called Kiznaiver. This system started with nineteen adolescents (around the age of six or seven, although they don\'t specifically state that) with the hopes that if these children can learn to share their pain with each other, then world peace can be achieved.  This is pretty intuitive actually. I mean, how many murderers would murder (unless they were like Hisomu) if the pain they inflicted on others rebounded against them?  How many people would kill another if they were linked to that person knowing that that person they killed would be the end of them as well?  Murder would, for all intents and purposes, cease to be; war would end and everyone would become more conscientious of each others wants and needs. Sounds like a great idea....right?Wrong. There was a flaw in that system, resulting in devastating results for those children. I won\'t say why, for spoiler reasons. Once the sponsors and the government running heard of this failure, the scientists running the show were left scrambling to fix the \'error\' they had created while pushing forward a failed system that still had the potential to achieve their ultimate goal. This is where the anime starts.  Seven teenagers are \'kidnapped\' and taken to a facility where they are all put into the Kiznaiver program.  The anime is centered around these seven characters and through the series, they slowly become friends while learning how to cope with each other\'s pain.Friendship, itself, is the saving grace for the characters and is pivotal in explaining why one of the characters is dead wrong in her pursuit.  There is an underlining tone of being alone, of loneliness, and how that some people will try to do anything in order to achieve that.  Sometimes you end up hurting the ones you care about the most without even realizing it.  But that is the lesson of the anime; you can\'t go through life expecting not to get hurt and yet still live a fulfilling life.  A fulfilled life requires good friends, friends that will still like you even if you cause them pain or, you are in pain for whatever reason. To me, that is what this anime is really about. It\'s realizing the importance of feeling pain.  This anime plays around with that concept, such as in Katsuhira and Himosu. One doesn\'t understand pain and cannot feel it.  But at the same time, he acts lifeless and uncaring to his friends around him.  Himosu, on the other hand, loves pain because it makes him feel alive and it allows him to know who he really is.  That is the contrast with the characters and Himosu stands out for that reason.  Through pain, Himosu knows himself better than the others because they are afraid to get hurt. Katsuhira is the extreme version of that.The flaws, I would say, is that the anime isn\'t long enough.  I would have liked to see the love relationships developed more. Another flaw is that the final crisis in the last episode is weak (not super weak, but weak enough to cause me to think, ""the poop hasn\'t really hit the fan, yet"").  The anime also tried to make some of the characters immediate love interests, which I thought was very sudden.  If they had extended the anime, that could have been fixed.  But that wasn\'t really a problem since I got the gist of it.  I didn\'t need a lot of backstory with all the characters since it was pretty self explanatory where most of the characters stood.  I mean, adding the reasons why Tenga was a hot-headed fighter would have been unnecessary and distracting from the main plot, and diving deeper into Yuta\'s weight problem wasn\'t needed either.  I get it. Yuta was fat and he was embarrassed by it.  What else do I need to know? I do wish, though, that they had developed the MC\'s love interest storylines more. That would have been welcomed.Anyway, I\'m not going to edit this much. I just wanted to write something that was from the heart. I thought that was appropriate. to why Katsuhira is the way he is and why his loss of feeling pain was actually not how he was when he was younger. As a watcher of the anime, I knew that something traumatic had to have happened to him.  Around episode 10, Yuki Kaji slowly changes the tone and intensity in his voice, offering more life to the character that wasn\'t present in the majority of the anime. At that point, I could literally hear Katsuhira slowly regaining his humanity, almost as if the voice actor himself was slowly realizing that pain is precious in its own way and that his character needed to have the desire to feel pain first before realizing that.The other voice actors also did an excellent job.  I found their delivery of the pain and suffering involved with getting their heart broken for the first time performed very well.  I was convinced that Chidori was in a lot of pain and that Honoka had suffered greatly in her youth. Yuka Terasaki delivered that pain in every line and I thought Rina Sato (Honoka Maki) stayed in character and delivered her lines well.   Overall, they all did well, and you always have to remember that the voice actors we hear all so often in animes do an excellent job anyway.  If there ever is a blame, it is in the story and how those characters are drawn to convey emotion.  There\'s only so much a voice actor can do.The story itself was excellent.  There are a few flaws here and there, but I""m not going to knock off a point for the story just because it isn\'t perfect.  Perfection is, simply, impossible.  Let me first start by saying that all of these characters are around sixteen, seventeen years old; so it shouldn\'t be a wonder that these characters are going to have high school related drama.  In other words, they are going to fall in love with their friends but find out that friend doesn\'t love them but one of their other friends...etc etc.  To be honest though, I thought the way the love stories developed was refreshing.  If you\'ve watched as many animes as I have, especially recent ones (e.g. The Asterisk War, GATE, Fairy Tail...even Fate/Stay Night...) I think you\'ll find the candid confessions of the other characters to be very refreshing, indeed.  (cough cough, Gray and Juvia anyone???)  I mean, how many times have you seen a girl character have secret, hidden feelings, blushing like no one can notice and stuttering at every word when she\'s around the MC?  HMMMM??? Yeah, a lot.  And how long does that last?  THE ENTIRE FREAKIN\' SERIES. In this anime, literally in the second episode, one of the female characters outright admits that she likes the MC. Let\'s just say that I was appreciative of that.I thought the use of the Kiznaiver system was a good way to push plot development and character development.  As other reviewers have stated, this anime is a character-oriented anime that involves a failed government program called Kiznaiver. This system started with nineteen adolescents (around the age of six or seven, although they don\'t specifically state that) with the hopes that if these children can learn to share their pain with each other, then world peace can be achieved.  This is pretty intuitive actually. I mean, how many murderers would murder (unless they were like Hisomu) if the pain they inflicted on others rebounded against them?  How many people would kill another if they were linked to that person knowing that that person they killed would be the end of them as well?  Murder would, for all intents and purposes, cease to be; war would end and everyone would become more conscientious of each others wants and needs. Sounds like a great idea....right?Wrong. There was a flaw in that system, resulting in devastating results for those children. I won\'t say why, for spoiler reasons. Once the sponsors and the government running heard of this failure, the scientists running the show were left scrambling to fix the \'error\' they had created while pushing forward a failed system that still had the potential to achieve their ultimate goal. This is where the anime starts.  Seven teenagers are \'kidnapped\' and taken to a facility where they are all put into the Kiznaiver program.  The anime is centered around these seven characters and through the series, they slowly become friends while learning how to cope with each other\'s pain.Friendship, itself, is the saving grace for the characters and is pivotal in explaining why one of the characters is dead wrong in her pursuit.

AMAZING sound and music.  it was a feast for the senses, it was one of the few anime where I refused to skip the opening/ending themes. But because of the short season, a lot of thing were left up in the air.One thing in particular was a satisfactory backstory for a third of their cast. If you are going to have a large cast and a plot focusing on equality, then a fleshed out back story for all the main characters is just needed.Another thing was the...plot itself.*spoilers*If they had focused more on the Kiznaivers  bonding I would have been happy. More challenges before the Shipping Wars and the Climax happened. it was just kinda a ""how did they get from point A to Point B type of thing. It made the story fell disappointingly rushed (which it probably was for lack of time)All and all though, despite the problems I have. GOD this series was enjoyable because of the EMOTIONS.It gave all the feels, all of them. All of the main characters were very relatable  (despite me complaining about lack of backstory).In the end I really found myself thinking about who I am, What I have accomplished, and the bonds I have made. I think THAT was the best part of the show, the part that makes you think. The part that maybe, just maybe, helps you discaver a part of yourself. <3 plot itself.*spoilers*If they had focused more on the Kiznaivers  bonding I would have been happy.

If you did, it's worth watching like it's a ten. If you don't then it's worth watching like an eight. That's actually all you need to know. If you want to know why I think that let me now get to the review part.The biggest issue of Kiznaiver is in the nature of it's writing. The core idea is a story about people that literally share their pain. If you are interested in things like story writing or simply seen or read a lot of entertainment media like manga or anime then you might already have...an idea of what will happen in the series. In fact you can make a checklist and play a drinking game with it. There are just certain obvious plotpoints and twists that have to happen in this story to not waste it's potential and they obviously will. I can't recall any anime that previously delt with this gimmick yet I already felt like it's “another one on the topic”. It's good, don't get me wrong. Great even. It's an ideal storyline for a slice of life drama and trigger being an action-loving studio keeps it interesting and well-paced. They basically took something obvious and executed it as well as it was possible to execute, but the topic itself provided little maneuverability and space for imagination. Once you know the characters you will know what will they do. It's an uncanny feeling that shouldn't get you out of the story but it makes it difficult to judge it's quality. The idea is great and the execution is perfect. But there's little to no effort in coming up with the idea or executing it due to how great it is on it's own. Does a story like that deserve a medal? An award for being invented or picked? I don't really think so. That's why I gave it an 8. It's more than good but less than revolutionary or inspiring. Putting it in a weird spot.  What I can say for sure is that it's worth going through at least once and that it's by no means any worse than a 7.5, which is quiet a good grade anyway.What helps the story a lot are the Characters. The character design is very interesting. They are different, they look original but they also don't stand out too much from common people. They fit their realistic modern-day setting but also thanks to that setting can't really do anything outstanding that would make them anything more even if their interactions are quiet reasonable and always in line with their personalities. They're just great. Nothing more, nothing less.From the technical side the Art of the series is not bad. It has some nice colors and decent linework. I had a small issue with animation of running and only that. For whatever reason characters often run in a bizarre out-of-place fashion that actually took me out of the show a few times. It looks comedic even during dramatic scenes and it has no real purpose. It could be argued that it was done to make it look a bit more frantic but it failed at that. To outweigh that the show has some nice special effects and felt rather pleasant to look at overall. So I decided to rate it as a 7, but a 6 would also be in place.The sound has similar issues. It was more on the enjoyable side but nothing really stuck in my head. It's just fair.I would have to rate my enjoyment at 8. I'm coming mostly from the fact that I put a lot of attention to the story of the show I'm watching and I enjoyed the execution of the topic of the show a great deal. Even if I can't rate it all that high. Nothing really stood in my way of having fun even if nothing was really outstanding. You could compare it to a catchy song.

Sort of. Kiznaiver is the name of studio Trigger’s latest effort, a story revolving around seven students bonded together through their pain. Compared to the studio’s recent offerings it’s a story that is a little more grounded in reality, attempting to appeal to a very important element of humanity: empathy. That’s not to say Kiznaiver isn’t without the sumptuous visual quirks and energy in the cast that made their wackier works so enjoyable, but this time it comes with...more focus on drama and the relationships between characters. It’s a volatile concoction to try and bring under control and this new mixture doesn’t quite work. At times entertaining, Kiznaiver starts dipping into uninteresting side stories, leaves much of the cast one-dimensional and cranks the ‘drama’ dial up to embarrassingly high levels.Confused and frustrated by the experiment they find themselves wrapped up in, the group of seven have to delve into each other’s past and solve each other’s problems to avoid hurting themselves any further. There’s two stories going on in Kiznaiver which intertwine, one about the experiment while the other is how it all came to be. The latter was better at keeping my curiosity piqued but it doesn’t get anywhere near enough screen time. Kiznaiver only delves into its most interesting ideas towards the end of the series and it makes you wonder if some early episodes served any purpose against the grand scheme of things. From initially being a more light-hearted story it’s like someone smashed the ‘It’s time to get serious’ button at a certain point, making for an extremely jarring transition. The issue is that they forgot to prime the ‘character development’ switch, so the emotional punch Kiznaiver attempts to pull on you during its climatic moments becomes something more akin to a feather touch.Some of the humour and the way the main seven characters’ personalities clash with one another makes for some fun viewing, particularly in the opening third of the series. How much you as a viewer will take away from its more serious moments though may come down to your tolerance for Mari Okada’s brand of writing: Saturated with characters expressing their feelings loudly and struggling to accept relationships that begin to either form or break down. You can’t deny that the setting of Kiznaiver accommodates this to a degree (seven people forced to bear each other’s pain will definitely bring that out) but that doesn’t abstain it of guilt for some of the emotionally overwrought dialogue it spits.I feel much of my grief with Kiznaiver lies with Katsuhira as the main character. Katsuhira being such an emotionless shell is obviously an important part of the story. It drums up intrigue, especially with our quiet, white-haired lead posited against such an eclectic collection of characters. He’s designed to make you ask questions like ‘What brought him to that point? What can the group do to help? Why is he the odd one out?’ And at the start of the series it works well. There’s flashes of backstory and suggestions that there’s much more to him than meets the eye. That initial interest in Katsuhira started to dwindle the more the show went on because all those questions about him weren’t being addressed at an adequate pace. Writing such an emotionally-deprived lead can be a double-edged sword. It leaves plenty of room for growth but on the other side of the coin it’s difficult to stay engaged with shows where the supporting characters do more to entertain and progress the story than the main one does. Katsuhira’s character is so dry it becomes draining to watch, even when knowing there are layers shielding his past yet to be unravelled.Overall Kiznaiver is a show that falls well short of what it’s trying to achieve because it can’t balance its silliness – a perfectly fine thing to have – with a sprinkling of maturity. The interactions aren’t that realistic between the cast and that’s a crippling blow for a show trying to tackle something quite serious: What it means to live through the ‘human condition’. more focus on drama and the relationships between characters.

Can't you do anything besides unsatisfactory love triangles woman???The art direction is fantastic, so is the soundtrack.The character designs are really good, especially Agata.I think it's the characters that had the most thought put into them.Individually, they are great. But their interactions are really awkward and forced.The overall plot is full of great concepts executed poorly.The character's feelings get linked, they feel each other's pain. Both physical and mental, which is surely a premise for characters arguing with each other, falling out and etc.The friendship part was on-point....When they tried to add romance everything went to the shitter. Mari Okada is not good at romance AT ALL!She develops a certain pairing the whole time only to drop it like an anchor right at the end and instead the characters end up with someone else despite having absolutely no development with him/her.Now, this review is way too short and too vague but I do think you can sort of get a picture about it from what I said.I will most likely come back and revise this review sometime in the future.

It’s setting focuses around forcing a group of people to be bound together, like putting lab rats in a cage, and see how they interact with each other. Its drama focuses on how the system forces the problems that are supposed to be to each his own to be shared among all. Even its themes questions whether is it possible for relationships among friends to be made forcefully. And subjective to the viewer, one could deliberate whether the story progression, character reactions, and perhaps even the roots of all the drama that unfolds in general, to be forced as well.Perhaps the show’s writer observed his friends headbutting each other and beating around bushes that he thought if only understanding each other were to come easy, that if everyone had a sense of each other’s pain, mutual agreement to problems wouldn’t be as hard to come by.The concept of shared pain is intriguing. It basically puts the worldly concept of ‘All-for-one and one-for-all’ in the spotlight. From there, there are so many potential can of worms for one to open, so many issues to tackle. Thoughts like ‘Isn’t forcing understanding among one another, even for a good cause, self-righteous?’, ‘Wouldn’t people be caring and helpful to others not for the sake of the one who’s suffering, but for the sake of avoiding the suffering that they themselves experience?’, ‘If everyone can understand each other right away, then is effort to nurture a relationship, the very beautiful journey of making friends itself, redundant?’  are all awesome questions that could perhaps find its answers.Kiznaiver takes on a much light hearted, and arguably less mature style of storytelling. In typical fashion, the drama involves the cookie-cutter ingredients of romance, phobias and characters’ pasts. Regardless of originality, these aspects could still be heart wrenching for the viewers to see if done well. But unfortunately, one would probably not shed many tears as the phobias are brought up in that one single moment of fear, and then never brushed upon again. It was as if to say that phobias, which are actually really serious issues in real life, are just typical character quirks and has insignificant effects on daily life. The drama that comes from romance like heartbreaks and unrequited love does not seem as moving as it could potentially be as the characters develop feelings for each other a bit too easily. One could argue that romantic development among characters do not need to be given a dramatic episode with tears, embraces, or heart-to-heart talks, but the romance between certain characters were so out of the blue that I had to rewind on a few episodes to make sure that they had a genuine interaction with each other. Like how it’s useless if a house is built on sand, regardless of how well the dramatic scenes were executed, which they were, such a lack of build-up made it very difficult to feel empathy for the characters as the story unfolds. Perhaps romance wasn’t the main point of the entire show, but it was indeed one of the main causes of drama, and understandably so because of the love triangles, and they were done so poorly to the extent that certain characters were given love interests that were so unexpected as if they were asspull consolation prizes designed to quell the rage of an unhappy  shipper.  The character arc that explains why a certain character experiences trauma was the redeeming factor. Though nothing new, it felt complete.  It had flashbacks about the past to make us understand the character, it felt realistic as the character was portrayed as being in huge turmoil when reminded of said past. It also brings up the topic on how cruel the Kizuna system really is for treating such horrible experiences as a mere scientific observation, essentially bringing up a debate on whether relationships should be tackled via logic or emotion.For the weak-hearted who cannot stand too many depressing moments, rest assured, as the Kiznaiver ride could be best described as the emotional rollercoaster meant for children who can’t reach that certain height to join the adults. It does not bring one on a journey of emotional conflict and tension at every twist and turn, but also has those light-hearted scenes that provide relief for the viewers psyche before plunging into a huge downward spiral of conflict and drama once again. Events like a group of friends casually conversing at a family restaurant, going to a camp in the woods together are all shown in typical slice-of-life fashion before showing characters isolating themselves from the group by walking away with tears in their eyes after a painful realization.  Not to mention the bread and butter drama scene of characters confronting each other in a huge torrential rain. As expected of a drama, not eye opening, but not particularly bad. Up to this point, aside from the lingering thought of how the build-up of the drama could be more realistic with more development time, admiration for the show was still high. The main gripe that I have with the show is this: Afterwards, the mood of the whole show is lifted be it after a reconciliation that sometimes seem to be way to short, or even worse- through one of the main weaknesses of the show- gags that has no place of even being there. During some very intense moments of the show, viewers are thrown at with comedic scenes, which most of the time revolves around how the characters react in ways that are way out of context, as if to portray them as being ignorant to the predicament that they are in. Introduced to a horrifying system that binds all peoples’ sensations together? Sure, go ahead and fret about your crush being called by your first name. Being forced to yell out the thing that you don’t want to say the most before dying? Then let’s talk about your phobia of dogs, which was never mentioned again was of no contribution to the entire series.  These gags destroy the immersion of viewers who are trying to take the show seriously. Maybe these were done on purpose to avoid Kiznaiver as shown as being too dark to compensate middle schoolers who can’t endure serious drama, we’ll never know. Kiznaiver is the kind of drama with such a theme and setting that could potentially be done in a very mature and serious way, but instead was limited by the amount of unnecessary aspects that were mentioned.  Don’t get me wrong, no anime needs to be as dramatic as Clannad or Anohana to be called a great show. And even if that is indeed the case, Kiznaiver has great potential to reach that great standard. There’s nothing wrong with comedy in drama shows either, as it could perhaps be used for much needed character development, but Kiznaiver’s gags were so out of place that it tells that it doesn’t really know which direction that it wants to go, drama? Comedy? You can’t be a jack of all trades on this one.Since this show is basically about putting together different people into a huge pit to spawn natural conflict, the writers do seem to make an effort in making the cast as diverse and different as possible.  From different hair colour to different personalities to different pasts, one can’t deny that there is a distinction between them. Though different, they all share something in common, unoriginality. All of them easily slot in into a typical anime archetype. You have the muscle head who yells at every moment he gets, the childhood friend who acts all motherly around her crush, the quiet girl who snickers at every cringe moment she witnesses, the bubbly loli girl who could be very annoying at times, etc.  Factors to most character-driven shows that either define them as a relatable, moving drama or as the term ‘melodrama’ is: 1) The likeability of the character or 2) the growth of the character.  Are the casts likeable? The divide of character taste in the anime fandom makes this one hard to determine, as these characters can range from very lovable to wanting to see them die a painful death.  Like childhood friends? Well you’re going to love this one from start to finish. Hate lolis? Then here’s a medal of endurance if you manage to finish the series. There is basically no character that everyone could agree universally as a wonderfully written, they are just, different. Then there are people who are on the fence, hoping that these cardboard cop outs are able to break out of their character archetypes, show different sides of themselves which could perhaps define them as realistic human beings.  Did it manage to pull through? It ‘half-did’. The show isn’t stupid or terrible enough to show absolutely zero character growth. As the series moves along, the characters’ true vulnerabilities unveil. The loli shatters her happy go lucky shell and is shown to be able to feel sadness, the quiet girl is shown to finally overcome her past and hangs out with the group willingly. Though this does not involve the main cast, as some of them are really the same person from episode 1 to 12, change is there when needed and is not overdone.The plot is not tight-knit either. The main issue lies within its consistency. As much as we are told to have a suspense of belief when we’re entertained, this consistency issues lies with the overexaggeration of even the slightest of things that it’s impossible to overlook. For example, the Kizuna System is explained to us clearly that everyone will have the pain of whoever’s suffering be equally shared. The intensity of the pain then shown is terribly unrealistic, characters are shown to be thrown to the floor when a guy is slapped by a little girl and the same reaction is shown when a guy is being hit by a truck. Pinching your own cheeks can make the whole group feel the same impact as if you were punched in the face by a thug.  Not only that, something that was deemed as a fault by the Kizuna system, a very scientific problem, was instantly remedied by the power of friendship, as if it were just a flick of a magical switch. This makes the sense of realism in the show really lacking, and just like the many action movies in the cinemas nowadays,  Kiznaiver then requires me to switch off half my brain to enjoy it.There is no denying the fact that Kiznaiver is a very pretty show. Even the slightest details of reality like sun rays piercing through the gaps of the tree leaves as students walk along the pavement were not ignored. The animation when the Kizuna system is activated is so spectacular that it could make viewers feel like they had a jolt themselves.  The one scene where one of the characters were bound to a hospital bed and carried around was full of vivid colours that perfectly depicts the bizarre situation that our heroes are in. It is a genius in using colours and lighting that perfectly highlights the mood of the show. The Kiznaiver ‘marks’ on the characters were beautiful whenever they activate at their own different situations. Not to mention the Godly OP where the imagery far overpowers the music itself. (Even if you do not like the show, do get to see the Opening sequence as it is THAT good.)Being pretty yet disappointing lumps Kiznaiver in the same category as Kabaneri and Guilty crown, beautiful shows with huge potentials of writing only for them to disappoint. Be it because it was limited to the episode count or because of strict instructions by the higher ups who insist on inserting gags and other unnecessities. The idea of having a group of teenagers having their sensations being joint together by a system is inhumane and goes against all ethical principles in the world of scientific research. With such a dark synopsis, expectations were on how serious and mature this anime could be by challenging the viewers fantasies of friendships and relationships, that friendship goes beyond understanding people, that relationships is symbiotic regardless of your efforts. Viewers would probably expect to see characters in unbearable pain, with his companions suffering and blaming the sufferer to get a hold of himself. We could probably expect sources of their pain like their dark secrets to be forcibly revealed, and the pain would be like how one forcibly rips off a bandage off an infested wound. Kiznaiver did not totally fail in delivering these, but it just did not quite hit the mark.It is still a show with a great theme that has loads of take-home messages. In the end, it tells how our apathy cannot be purged that easily by means of understanding others sensations, how friendship itself isn’t something that can be forged via logical/scientific methods but rather with abstract and emotional things like bonds. Perhaps some of us see the emotionless and numb MC in ourselves, that though he doesn’t feel pain, he comes to realize that no man is an island, that no one’s pain is just their own as someone close to them will also feel the pain as well.Kiznaivers flaws are not big gaping holes, but are small mistakes that make up one huge leak. As amazing as it throws out its characters, message, and visuals in the limelight, it is unfortunately shrouded by the many smoke clouds that it brought with them. Kiznaiver epitomizes the word ‘Force’. It’s setting focuses around forcing a group of people to be bound together, like putting lab rats in a cage, and see how they interact with each other. Its drama focuses on how the system forces the problems that are supposed to be to each his own to be shared among all. Even its themes questions whether is it possible for relationships among friends to be made forcefully. And subjective to the viewer, one could deliberate whether the story progression, character reactions, and perhaps even the roots of all the drama that unfolds in general, to be forced as well.Perhaps the show’s writer observed his friends headbutting each other and beating around bushes that he thought if only understanding each other were to come easy, that if everyone had a sense of each other’s pain, mutual agreement to problems wouldn’t be as hard to come by.The concept of shared pain is intriguing. It basically puts the worldly concept of ‘All-for-one and one-for-all’ in the spotlight. From there, there are so many potential can of worms for one to open, so many issues to tackle. Thoughts like ‘Isn’t forcing understanding among one another, even for a good cause, self-righteous?’, ‘Wouldn’t people be caring and helpful to others not for the sake of the one who’s suffering, but for the sake of avoiding the suffering that they themselves experience?’, ‘If everyone can understand each other right away, then is effort to nurture a relationship, the very beautiful journey of making friends itself, redundant?’  are all awesome questions that could perhaps find its answers.Kiznaiver takes on a much light hearted, and arguably less mature style of storytelling. In typical fashion, the drama involves the cookie-cutter ingredients of romance, phobias and characters’ pasts. Regardless of originality, these aspects could still be heart wrenching for the viewers to see if done well. But unfortunately, one would probably not shed many tears as the phobias are brought up in that one single moment of fear, and then never brushed upon again. It was as if to say that phobias, which are actually really serious issues in real life, are just typical character quirks and has insignificant effects on daily life. The drama that comes from romance like heartbreaks and unrequited love does not seem as moving as it could potentially be as the characters develop feelings for each other a bit too easily. One could argue that romantic development among characters do not need to be given a dramatic episode with tears, embraces, or heart-to-heart talks, but the romance between certain characters were so out of the blue that I had to rewind on a few episodes to make sure that they had a genuine interaction with each other. Like how it’s useless if a house is built on sand, regardless of how well the dramatic scenes were executed, which they were, such a lack of build-up made it very difficult to feel empathy for the characters as the story unfolds. Perhaps romance wasn’t the main point of the entire show, but it was indeed one of the main causes of drama, and understandably so because of the love triangles, and they were done so poorly to the extent that certain characters were given love interests that were so unexpected as if they were asspull consolation prizes designed to quell the rage of an unhappy  shipper.  The character arc that explains why a certain character experiences trauma was the redeeming factor. Though nothing new, it felt complete.  It had flashbacks about the past to make us understand the character, it felt realistic as the character was portrayed as being in huge turmoil when reminded of said past. It also brings up the topic on how cruel the Kizuna system really is for treating such horrible experiences as a mere scientific observation, essentially bringing up a debate on whether relationships should be tackled via logic or emotion.For the weak-hearted who cannot stand too many depressing moments, rest assured, as the Kiznaiver ride could be best described as the emotional rollercoaster meant for children who can’t reach that certain height to join the adults. It does not bring one on a journey of emotional conflict and tension at every twist and turn, but also has those light-hearted scenes that provide relief for the viewers psyche before plunging into a huge downward spiral of conflict and drama once again. Events like a group of friends casually conversing at a family restaurant, going to a camp in the woods together are all shown in typical slice-of-life fashion before showing characters isolating themselves from the group by walking away with tears in their eyes after a painful realization.  Not to mention the bread and butter drama scene of characters confronting each other in a huge torrential rain. As expected of a drama, not eye opening, but not particularly bad. Up to this point, aside from the lingering thought of how the build-up of the drama could be more realistic with more development time, admiration for the show was still high. The main gripe that I have with the show is this: Afterwards, the mood of the whole show is lifted be it after a reconciliation that sometimes seem to be way to short, or even worse- through one of the main weaknesses of the show- gags that has no place of even being there. During some very intense moments of the show, viewers are thrown at with comedic scenes, which most of the time revolves around how the characters react in ways that are way out of context, as if to portray them as being ignorant to the predicament that they are in. Introduced to a horrifying system that binds all peoples’ sensations together? Sure, go ahead and fret about your crush being called by your first name. Being forced to yell out the thing that you don’t want to say the most before dying? Then let’s talk about your phobia of dogs, which was never mentioned again was of no contribution to the entire series.  These gags destroy the immersion of viewers who are trying to take the show seriously. Maybe these were done on purpose to avoid Kiznaiver as shown as being too dark to compensate middle schoolers who can’t endure serious drama, we’ll never know. Kiznaiver is the kind of drama with such a theme and setting that could potentially be done in a very mature and serious way, but instead was limited by the amount of unnecessary aspects that were mentioned.  Don’t get me wrong, no anime needs to be as dramatic as Clannad or Anohana to be called a great show. And even if that is indeed the case, Kiznaiver has great potential to reach that great standard. There’s nothing wrong with comedy in drama shows either, as it could perhaps be used for much needed character development, but Kiznaiver’s gags were so out of place that it tells that it doesn’t really know which direction that it wants to go, drama? Comedy? You can’t be a jack of all trades on this one.Since this show is basically about putting together different people into a huge pit to spawn natural conflict, the writers do seem to make an effort in making the cast as diverse and different as possible.  From different hair colour to different personalities to different pasts, one can’t deny that there is a distinction between them. Though different, they all share something in common, unoriginality.

And that\'s pretty much it.I\'ll start with, sadly, the biggest flaw of ""Kiznaiver"" - its plot. I suppose the storywriters simply hadn\'t known what they had wanted to focus on so the story is a weird mix of many different elements. The plot starts with a sci-fi-esque, dystopic approach but later on switches to full drama slice of life mode. The main themes are ""bonds"", ""sharing pain"" and ""connecting by wounds"" and these are shown repeatedly during the show. They are, however, shown in a very tangled...and muddling way making the plot dull. To add insult to injury, it feels like there\'s more focus on the love triangles, rectangles, or whichever combination than on the actual story, yet each of them is painfully straightforward and uninteresting.Just because I liked the characters doesn\'t mean they were written well. In fact, they either lack personality or originality. There\'s the generic tsundere emo queen, muscle-headed stud or a girl, whose only feature is that she has a crush on the main character. Few of them have some kind of backstory, although it usually doesn\'t give much insight into their personalities. Even though the show focuses attention on Katsuhira, the viewers don\'t know much about him and they even don\'t want to know because of how cursorily he is portrayed. My guess is that they aren\'t necessarily badly written but there\'s simply not enough time to develop properly that many characters in only 12 episodes.On the bright side, both art and music are quite impressive. The show has its own distinctive look and the characters\' drawing style is quite funky and it has its own unique manner. Throughout the show there are also some lovely backgrounds. Thus, I\'d say that the art is the best part of ""Kiznaiver"". What\'s more, the opening theme is really catchy and really fits the atmosphere of the show.

Eye-catching neons and pop colours everywhere. Has a twangy new angle of throwing an old ideology. The story-line is fairly good. In fact Trigger has done quite a good job drawing out yet another interesting story. They have a very fresh visual. I found their approach to their punchline of “feeling others’ pain” rather new and offbeat. It has a fun uptake on the matter. The characters all have their own personal spikes — some too aggressive , some goody-two – shoes… their...portrayal of comedy and seriousness is also offbeat however I was expecting a bit more of a dramatic ending. The series concluded on a low-key note though. It’s a total different feel from their previous  work, Kill La Kill.They story has style and  a fresh urban vibe. The characters are funny and have their own signature persona, each try to cope with the situation using their own views as well as mixing some views derived from their friends. Kiznaiver is like old wine in a new bottle – which is rather good… the ideology of feeling for others and understanding pain of others has been potrayed in a very technical way… instead of emphasizing on melodrama, heavy emotions to control the storyline … the anime established the essence of friendship in a very technically sound and urbanized way.In fact the protagonist, Katsuhira Agata, around whom the message of friendship and compassion spirals, is ironically a guy who cannot feel pain (physically or mentally) or for that matter cannot fully comprehend any human emotions properly. His perception of pain is almost nil for which he is easily targeted by bullies. It is rather interesting how such a boy with emotional apathy slowly adapts to and explains the emotional wavelengths of his friends. Katsuhira’s gradual evolution is interesting as he struggles to understand the emotions by logically mapping them or quantifying those unperceived emotions by deriving a new approach to the old ideology of connecting with people. The story skilfully guides the audience to this new approach through Katsuhira’s struggle. Noriko Sonozaki, the other lead of this story is also ironically another character devoid of emotional perceptions. It is rather funny how these two emotionally and perceptionally apathetic characters bring out the essence of unity, love, compassion, friendship and pain in full bloom as their friends struggleand help each other out.The story is worth a watch. It’s essentially the remix of an old song . Although the story is slightly predictable (well… its not a mystrery  genre), I think you wont be too disappointed. I personally liked it.

It’s essentially the remix of an old song . Although the story is slightly predictable (well… its not a mystrery  genre), I think you wont be too disappointed. I personally liked it. The comedy is an extra perk. The story has a neon and a lightweight appearance that will catch your eyes.My Rate: 7.5/10', 'The combination of Trigger\'s hyperactive visuals combined with Mari Okada\'s idea of what teen drama should be like was already considered a weird combination when Kiznaiver was first announced, but it was only upon airing that people realized just how much weirdness they can take. I\'m sure most of you have heard by now that the show is basically Kokoro Connect if it stuck to its initial concept and traded the grounded tone for a cartoonish one. Which is a bit ironic considering I connected more to the cast of this show than Kokoro, as well as Okada\'s recent dramas like Anthem of the Heart...- even though Katsuhira doesn\'t really do much more than the male leads in those shows in regards to affecting the plot other than get punched. Maybe it\'s because I\'ve gotten so tired of teen dramas trying to recreate realistic personalities that seeing one not even bothering to pretend is a relaxing breath of fresh air.It also helps that the concept doesn\'t really pretend to be realistic either, going for a straight sci-fi angle right off the bat in regards to the drama through the Kizna System: a scientific experiment designed to bring world peace by connecting people with a mysterious scar that\'ll allow them to share each other\'s pain and suffering, whether physical or emotional. Said experiment is used on seven students sharing the same class prior to summer break with the condition that they all stay connected for the entire summer and perform assigned missions that are so obviously intended to force them to be friends that there might as well have been a goals header explaining that fact. It\'s a bit hokey when you say it out loud, but what attracted me to the show were the possibilities of what the Kizna System could explore regarding teenage issues when said teens are forced by other people to confront them. They can be really annoying when handled improperly, but when they are, they hit the side of me that likes strong characterizations and social insight.With all that said, I really hate when anime thinks it can be funny, and it gets particularly annoying when it gets in the way of the drama. I know Kiznaiver is a Trigger anime and all, but it has a bad tendency of picking inappropriate times to remind us of that what with the ridiculous secrets some of the characters revealed in the initial game or the jarring tonal shifts in general. It\'s not quite Jun Maeda-levels of distracting, but I have a feeling it would have been if PA Works had been the ones behind this show instead. Hisomu in particular reminds me of the dude\'s useless male friends, right down to having no importance to the plot other than to be a masochistic outsider. The Trigger wackiness fares better when those mascots that I can\'t remember the names of are involved, but I have the sneaking feeling that they were intended to be scary - and if that\'s the case, no they\'re not.But let\'s talk about the drama itself. It\'s got all the cliches you\'d expect from the writer of Anohana: love triangles, teens yelling out their feelings as a moment of release, friendship is the most important part of your youth, and the cast being a mixed bag with half of them being decent characters and the other half being stereotypes who are only there to provide levity or more angst. There are also two important plot lines that are mostly connected through our monotone male lead: the one about the six classmates trying to deal with the challenges put upon them by the scientists whilst getting closer as a result, and the one about Kizna System arbitrator, Noriko Sonozaki, and her mysterious past regarding usage of the system in the past (with the former having the extra task of dealing with some other subplots). And I don\'t think both plot lines connect very well, especially considering the former is basically a teen drama with the scientists literally being the writer and the latter is a sci-fi thriller plot I\'d expect in an episode of Ghost in the Shell if GiTS\'s characters had any emotion whatsoever. Towards the end when the latter starts to become the main focus, it\'s right after the former experiences a (particularly forced even by the premise\'s standards) emotional climax and said climax mostly gets swept under the rug with what\'s left being conveniently resolved by this other plot line.But even if the show had only focused on developing one plot line for the entire length of its cour, I found the results of the Kizna experiment to be very disappointing. Getting a little spoiler-y here, but saying ""human emotions are too complex to scientifically analyze"" is an incredibly obvious conclusion and aside from Maki\'s arc, there\'s a disappointing lack of flavor to the show\'s usage of puberty other than saying it exists. I know the way it\'s told to us through the director\'s great visual direction has gotten some praise, but Kiznaiver is not a 30-minute OVA. It\'s a twelve-episode long series, and there\'s only so long that positive can carry the show when it goes on for that length.Overall, I\'m kind of meh towards Kiznaiver. It\'s not the worst thing in the world or anything and I\'d recommend it over most of the anime that aired this Spring. But like most shows of this type, it just doesn\'t live up to its potential. Half the cast end up contributing nothing substantial to the plot, the story doesn\'t go far enough with its premise, and the tone is very inconsistent all throughout. I suppose it\'s worth watching if you just want an emotional experience, since on those terms, I preferred it to other recent hits like Grimgar and ERASED, let alone every inexplicably popular VN/LN adaptation ever. After all, it has a good visual style, the other half of the cast are endearing (and it helps that they\'re the plot-important ones), and it does enough with Okada\'s formula so that it doesn\'t feel like you\'re watching a rehash of her previous stuff. Certainly seemed to have made a lot of my ""feels""-loving colleagues happy, although given the announcement of that upcoming Little Witch Academia series, they\'re probably prematurely passing on the ""Trigger\'s best anime"" crown by the time this review comes out. - even though Katsuhira doesn\'t really do much more than the male leads in those shows in regards to affecting the plot other than get punched.

They showed they are talented enough to build an emotional story with a psychological value and without excess of cliché, even if there is a little of that. A promising premise based upon a collective sharing of pain between 6 characters, because of a mysterious experiment which linked them.

A journey that most would have completed already in spectacular series such as Naruto or any...Gundam.The most interesting thing in this travesty of a show is its blindingly cool looking art style and music.Beyond that I'd say to try something a little more interesting.

Their first show I came a cross this season was the short wild and wacky tour de force of Trigger intellectual properties: Space Patrol Luluco. The other was Kiznaiver, which continues Trigger\'s trend of producing a respectable number of original works to go along side their adaptations.Our ""main"" character Katsuhira has an odd condition in which he cannot feel pain, be it physical or, as it seems, emotional as well. His close childhood friend Chidori protects him from those who would look to take advantage of him, and if you\'re thinking this is some grade...A shipping fuel, well you haven\'t even heard the half of it yet.I say Katsuhira is a ""main"" character in quotations because the show quickly introduced a number of other characters who are all far more interesting than the first two I\'ve mentioned. By the end of the first episode all these characters are abducted and given the show\'s trademark Kizna scars that bind them all together by making them all feel each other\'s pain. You might be saying at this point ""this sounds like a great plot for a suspense/ mystery show"", you\'re right it does. Unfortunately the blue haired Rei Ayanami clone in this show fucks that right up.Standard creepy blue haired emotionless doll character #241, Sonozaki explains all the details of the Kizna, how it works, what her and her organization hope to accomplish, etc. all in the space of a few minutes. She then explains that the group will have to complete tests together in order to avoid some non-specific penalty (These tests are beamed to the kiznas via hologram).All of this effectively takes out any suspense or narrative investment right at the knees. However, the worst part of it all is that the show still tries to play it off as though there is still some big mystery when clearly there isn\'t.The show would have benefited hugely if Sonozaki weren\'t introduced at all and the Kizna scars were never explained, only leaving the hologram notes of the tests that were now underway. Now that\'s a damn suspense/ mystery plot right there. But even then, there are so many group situations and group outings that are done for the sake of narrative convenience that are left poorly explained in every episode that the writers felt there had to be some anchoring point for the show to go from.Everything else from the show is solid though. The opening is nice, the animation and visuals are top notch even though the semi-futuristic light novel city trope is getting horrendously over used here in the last few seasons, and finally most of the characters do get some good development even though I found it harder to give a shit with each successive episode.Overall, if you\'re a Trigger fan like me you\'ll probably feel compelled to watch the show from flag to flag no matter what I say. As for the passing anime fan: take it or leave it, you\'re not going to lose sleep either way. Although, if you\'re willing to put in the time for it, the back half of the show is far stronger than the first.

It had tons glamour but nothing more. I feel like it was shooting for a story much bigger than itself and ended up looking like a plot made by children...whose lives revolved around making friends and sense of the concept of true friends.I am wholly convinced you could shortened this series down to only 4 episodes and it would have come out better. It just seemed to drag on and a few episodes felt like deja vu. Many episodes just hammered in the same idea, that yes they were becoming friends. Likewise every episode asked...the exact same question, Is it because of Kiznaiver or not? I feel like they could have removed the ""friends"" narrative and replaced it with a stronger love one. This would probably would have made for a solid romance anime.Nonetheless I still continued to watch, but i think that was due to its great animation and some feel good moments. It was somewhat enjoyable however muddled its narrative was. Even though it was inevitable that they would all be happy in the end, i still watched on. I can understand for some that they could completely dislike it outright, furthermore i would also understand someone who would fall in love with this anime. But i think my view stands within the consensus. Most definitely this was just a filler anime for me. What was a real insult to injury for me though was the fact that Sonozaki and Katsuhira could have had a much better resolution. The only tangible plot was between those two characters and there resolution only lasted 5 minutes of screen time.TL:DR: Kiznaiver is an extraordinarily average anime whose concepts exceeds its reality. Understandably to some it appeals to them, to some it doesn\'t. However to everyone else its damn well clear how average it is.~6/10 the exact same question, Is it because of Kiznaiver or not?

I get that Chidori liked Katsuhira because of who he was as a kid, sure, but I feel like the rest, especially Nico\'s, affections were random. You could say Tenga\'s developed from all his supporting and when he received from food from Chidori? Man, I don\'t know. If they were gonna use that as the main conflict, I wished they built it up a...little more.Speaking of building up--They made me feel like there would be some epic climax with Nori going a little crazy toward the end, but nope. Everything gets solved with a talk with a crazy backdrop and everyone (kinda) gets a happy ending. Talk about anticlimactic. Why does Nori even have so much power anyway? How come nothing happened between the initial experiment and now? Why do the adults do nothing in the show do nothing but act as comedic relief? Why would they put two new/young researchers on a project that\'s supposed to be the solution to world peace? I\'m not even sure what the Kizuna system was for anymore because it seemed like what they were trying to achieve didn\'t match what they were doing.Besides that, I loved the art. That\'s what drew me to the show in the first place. Everything is so bright and I liked the designs of the characters. For some reason, I like the out of place creatures that some anime tend to have so those weird bird things were cool. The OP and ED were enjoyable. Music has never been a big deal for me so I don\'t have much to say.The characters. Meh. They were given the archetypes of the Seven Deadly Sins by Nori, but even she said that they didn\'t adhere to them that well. I\'ve always hated characters that were defined by their attraction to someone else. Chidori and Katsuhira are prime examples of this. Chidori\'s basically Katsuhira\'s mom and all Katsuhira can think about is Nori. Sure, they\'re connected by the past and he wants to figure it out but Nori-chan this and Nori-chan that all the time kills me. Hisomu felt like such a waste too. They had one episode dealing with the fact that he loves pain and then for the rest of the series, his pain fetish is just for comedic effect. He doesn\'t actively try to get hurt anymore even though he was known for frequent visits to the hospital. It seemed like such a cop out.Despite my complaints, I rather liked the anime. The story itself could\'ve been fleshed out better and some of the characters could\'ve been less one-dimensional, though I guess that\'s the point. If you wanted to watch the anime because of the mystery of it, I think you\'ll be disappointed. I don\'t think the mystery was a big part of the story and the conclusion to it wasn\'t satisfactory, but the build up to it was interesting and that\'s good enough to me.Side note: I read somewhere that this was an insight or something to mental illness. Nori, with her overexposure to pain/emotions and how she takes meds to deal with it; Katsuhira, with his indifference to everything; and the rest of the cast who are ""normal"". Something about Chidori having unrequited feelings for Katsuhira is supposed to parallel how non-disabled people want to understand those who are but are unable to. Not sure how true it is, but it\'s an interesting thought, even though it didn\'t change my opinion on the show. little more.Speaking of building up--They made me feel like there would be some epic climax with Nori going a little crazy toward the end, but nope. Everything gets solved with a talk with a crazy backdrop and everyone (kinda) gets a happy ending. Talk about anticlimactic. Why does Nori even have so much power anyway? How come nothing happened between the initial experiment and now? Why do the adults do nothing in the show do nothing but act as comedic relief? Why would they put two new/young researchers on a project that\'s supposed to be the solution to world peace? I\'m not even sure what the Kizuna system was for anymore because it seemed like what they were trying to achieve didn\'t match what they were doing.Besides that, I loved the art. That\'s what drew me to the show in the first place. Everything is so bright and I liked the designs of the characters. For some reason, I like the out of place creatures that some anime tend to have so those weird bird things were cool. The OP and ED were enjoyable. Music has never been a big deal for me so I don\'t have much to say.The characters. Meh. They were given the archetypes of the Seven Deadly Sins by Nori, but even she said that they didn\'t adhere to them that well. I\'ve always hated characters that were defined by their attraction to someone else. Chidori and Katsuhira are prime examples of this. Chidori\'s basically Katsuhira\'s mom and all Katsuhira can think about is Nori. Sure, they\'re connected by the past and he wants to figure it out but Nori-chan this and Nori-chan that all the time kills me. Hisomu felt like such a waste too. They had one episode dealing with the fact that he loves pain and then for the rest of the series, his pain fetish is just for comedic effect. He doesn\'t actively try to get hurt anymore even though he was known for frequent visits to the hospital. It seemed like such a cop out.Despite my complaints, I rather liked the anime. The story itself could\'ve been fleshed out better and some of the characters could\'ve been less one-dimensional, though I guess that\'s the point.

So much promise. But, it has fallen to what I like to call, ""Seasonal Anime Syndrome"". This is when a show wants to tell a grand story is hindered by its run time of only 12-13 episode. (i.e Charlotte) Kiznaiver offered some of what could\'ve been the best characters I\'ve seen in the summer season. In the first episode you are introduced to a bunch of high school sterotypes. (Greased-up punk, cold and studious girl, the cutesy weirdo.) But in episode 2, it is revealed that...the cutesy weirdo acts the way they do as a desire to stand out. At first glance this would be great. Exploring seemingly one-note characters and exploring why they act the way they do as their true selves are forced out through the Kizna System, showing the complexity of teenagers as they struggle with mature and such. But after this revelation, it\'s almost forgotten, and the character doesn\'t change. This happens to all of the characters. Not to mention the one major arc focused around one of the characters is mainly backstory exposition with lesbians.But dear god it looks great. Also I personally loved the opening and ending songs, especially the ending. While not visually stunning, the song itself was wonderful. But I\'m no musician or artist so I won\'t go into detail.Personally I would\'ve preferred if the series was a full 26 episodes, covering and developing all of the main cast, with the final arc covering Katsuhira and Noriko, but that\'s just me spewing my ideas.Considering how negative this review is, I actually enjoyed the show a lot. But I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone unless they are a fan of Studio Trigger\'s style of animation. the cutesy weirdo acts the way they do as a desire to stand out.

But I wouldn\'t recommend it to anyone unless they are a fan of Studio Trigger\'s style of animation.', ""Kiznaiver is the newest addition to studio Trigger's list of anime originals.It was directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi, who has worked with trigger before but has mostly been doing the actual animation instead of directing it.Trigger's usual director Hiroyki Imaishi was busy with space patrol luluco while Kiznaiver was airing.But that's enough about the production, what is it actually about?And it's really a commentary on people's personal connections.What would happen if people would be able to directly experience others pain, and so on.Before I go into spoiler territory I'll talk about the Presentation of the show for a bit.As I mentioed above Imaishi wasn't directing this,...and as such the animation is considerably less crazy than Trigger's usual style.The character designs seem to compensate for the lack of craziness however, as they are all pretty out there and don't follow any usual formulas.Kiznaiver is pretty fun to look at, the its character designs work great in motion and the clear CGI backgrounds work fairly well as a contrast.The music for the series was made by Booming Satellites who have worked with trigger before.The opening and ending themes fit the show just fine and the backgroundtracks are fairly muted and consist mostly of electronic music.Trigger did go out of their way to make this series very colorful and that still gives it a fairly unique look.Now with that out of the way let's talk characters and story.I was wondering how Mari Okada's writing style would come to play in this series, because from the first three episodesI wouldn't have been able to guess her involvement in the series.But later on as there are almost two love triangles present at once as well as lots of drama in general it starts to get clear.Drama is a big part of kiznaiver and as such I think it's worth it to check if it's well done, and saying anything about Kiznaiver's drama is a bit difficult.On one hand the extreme amount of drama in Kiznaiver is easily justified in series by having the cast tied to each other through pain.But on the other the fact that none of them consciously chose to take part with the experiment lessens the emotional impact a lot.Essentially it's in-series justified forced drama and your enjoyment of Kiznaiver will greatly depend on your opinion of this.I thought that it was a fine way to include a large amount of drama in your anime with an added cool experiment, but it also made me feel more distant to the drama and thus it was pretty unrelatable.And yes it does play out a lot like a high school drama.But beyond just a device for drama there is an actual story to the Kiznaiver experiement itself, which I won't spoil here even though it isn't super important.Talking about the characters involved they aren't super detailed.The only ones that get a proper backstory are the MC and Sonozaki, the person who conducts and supervises the experiment.Though this might make it sound like the rest of the characters are bland, that isn't the case at all.All of the main cast are fairly eccentric teenagers and quite fun people to watch, even if they aren't that detailed.The relatability of the characters will pretty much depend on your personality.All of them have a part in the story except for maybe the masochist who seems to have been thrown in just to show how some people do indeed enjoy pain,but he didn't really have another purpose and doesn't really take part in the drama, which might make him relatable to some.I don't think Kiznaiver is in any way revolutionary or even super clever, but it was a fun watch none the less.If you like high school dramas or drama in general but feel like they're all the same Kiznaiver is pretty much just a slightly new take on it.It might take a while to get truly going but once it does I think most people would enjoy it. and as such the animation is

about Kiznaiver! It\'s a bit of a particular show, as it made me go from ""wow this show is so awesome!"" to ""oh god this is cringy and horribly written"" really quickly. This is why I decided to give it an average score.Story: 3/10There is not really any real plot to Kiznaiver, and that\'s why it is the weakest part of the show. There is one mini arc in the middle of the series that felt kind of satisfying, and the long overarching story which, quite frankly, makes no sense. Tons of things are left...unexplained, and the ending, which could have tied up many loose ends, ended up rushed and nonsensical. When I finished this show, I couldn\'t really tell what it was about apart from badly written teenage drama.The story played around with many edgy and deep themes but failed to deliver it remarkably. Everything felt forced, from the awful dialogues which repeated the same things over and over again about ""pain"", ""feelings"", ""friends"" to the deus ex machina and the totally unrealistic science kiznaiver bullcrap (I know it\'s Trigger, but still). What started as a light hearted and kind of fun comedy evolved into an awful melodrama that got worse after each episode. I couldn\'t feel anything for the characters, because their problems just seemed so unimportant. ""Oh my god he/she doesn\'t love me let\'s make a scene"" <--- This happened maybe 5 times in the course of the last 3 episodes. I actually wondered if some of the scenes at the end were not written by 13/14 years olds edgy teenagers with too many hormones, because this felt like it.Basically, ok start and middle, and a terrible ending.Art: 10/10I freaking love studio Trigger and its art. Can\'t find anything bad to say about the gorgeous palette of colours and the wonderful, natural flowing animations. The character designs were fun and remarkable. The visuals for the opening blew my mind the first time I watched it, and it was definitely the best visuals for an opening this season.Sound: 9/10I also loved the soundtrack. Wasn\'t really memorable (maybe because I only watched one episode a week), but amazing. The opening and ending were both incredible (the opening reminds me of the song Take On Me by a-ha, which I love.)Characters: 6/10This one is tricky to rate. At first, I was interested in all the characters. They were cliché, but well done. I was very curious about Hisomu, which was quite the enigmatic one and I loved Tenga and Chidori.Sadly, as the plot worsened, so did the characters. Tenga and Chidori became the two most annoying characters in this show, to the point where I couldn\'t even comprehend their tought process. Kacchon and Sonozaki, which were both mysterious, were developed the most, but with the way the dialogues were made I had trouble understanding what they felt. Hisomu, sadly, stayed as a comic relief character with a couple good scenes, and never got much depth to him. Nico, which I found a tad annoying at first, became the best character in the show for me. All in all, the characters had their good and bad moments. Most of the time, their reactions were not very realistic and felt forced.Enjoyment: 6/10I really wanted to enjoy this show. The great soundtrack and pretty visuals helped me forget a bit about the convoluted plot and dialogues, but not enough. Some episodes were a drag, while others were really fun. The finale wasOverall: 5/10This is not an horrible show per se, as it has a lot of redeeming features. If you are able to turn our brain off for a bit, or are into melodrama (I hate using that word that people use to diss actual good animes, but this is really what Kiznaiver is), then this show is for you. unexplained, and the ending, which could have tied up many loose ends, ended up rushed and nonsensical.

I didn't expect anything special. I was terribly wrong.In my opinion this anime is really worth to watch. If you like heart broken moments and a little bit of drama and comedy it's definitely good choice.I love Tenga in this anime.

You will not regret.TBH it's my first anime after a long...break. Now i am back and i want more psycho anime! QQ break. Now i am back and i want more psycho anime! QQ"", 'Kiznaiver is a show that\'s not entirely sure what it wants to be.  On one hand, it\'s a wacky adventure with colorful characters, and on the other hand it\'s a story about pain, friendship, and what it means to connect with someone.  It works well enough, but it\'s not as deep or amazing as it wants to be.  The parts using the profoundly strange setup for adventure and even some comedy are never quite as high energy as you want them to be, and because the show takes itself much more seriously than, say, Kill la Kill, it\'s much more restrained in...what it\'s able to do, shackled to the desire to do the serious end of its themes justice.  On the other hand, the show might not take itself seriously enough to give a good treatment to pain and bonding (for which my touchstone, though outside the sphere of Anime, would be Planescape: Torment) and the dramatic moments can fail to land because of it.The story, such as it is, is all over the place.  In a way, there are two of them, and they don\'t really interact as much as they dovetail.  Story One is the story that you get pitched in the beginning: seven profoundly weird people get connected in a way that causes them to share the pain they suffer with all the others they\'re bonded to.  It\'s adequately entertaining, but after a very strong first couple of episodes it starts to wear thin as the protocols of the ""Kizna Experiment"" come off as ever more forced and its results increasingly... nonsensical, and not in the ""fun and goofy"" way.  Eventually, in what was admittedly something of a return to strong episodes, it dovetails into Story Two, which concerns really only two of the characters, with the rest as a supporting cast.  Story Two is good, and it does need Story One in order to resolve, but I wish that the two stories had been more deeply interconnected -- we get some good setup for Two throughout One, but story One just ends fairly abruptly, like the writers realized they were out of things they could really do with it.  And for me, at least, the biggest problem is that it ends on a note where I would have liked to see it continue.  I can\'t fault this too much, but the dead end of the \'main\' track really rubs me the wrong way.Kiznaiver is, at least, a show with a very definite style.  The animation is flowing and the cast is literally extremely colorful in a really dynamic and interesting way.  I think there would be some entertainment value in watching Kiznaiver even if you muted the sound and killed any subtitles, it\'s downright impressive.  There are better shows, ones that actually do something spectacular, but Kiznaiver is very good for what it is.The characters in Kiznaiver, however, are something that I really can\'t let slide.  This is very much a character-focused show, in that several characters get episodes devoted to just trying to work them out, and... as that, it doesn\'t land.  I don\'t dislike these characters, but the only ones that actually felt like interesting, rounded people were the more peripheral characters.  Chidori, Agata, Tenga, and Sonozaki are all pretty uninteresting: Tenga and Chidori pretty much play one note each and Chidori especially doesn\'t get forced out of her \'comfort zone\' enough to really develop as a character.  It\'s a shame, she\'s performed very well and is central enough to the main story that I\'d like to see her have more issues, or for there to be other things she cares about, but with the single exception of her unrequited love the show is largely uninterested in actually exploring who she is, what she likes, or even what else might make her hurt.  And for all the weight given to her love, I\'m kind of at a loss as to why she\'s holding onto it so tightly.  She tells us a few things in the first episode, but they\'re all legitimately past-tense, and nothing about her situation or current interaction actually supports the depths of her feelings, especially with how badly locked out of the loop she is.Agata and Sonozaki have a different problem.  They\'re the most central characters (the ones critical to what I called Story Two) and... they both are given almost totally flat affects.  Now, there\'s a good reason why each of them has this trait, and as far as the design of the show I know why they did it and good for them holding on to that despite what\'s going on, but... boy does it make them unappealing as leads.  In a way, I guess it actually supports the theme of the show (that people need to share and understand each others pains in order to connect, even if that should be done through mundane mechanisms), because these characters never emote, and because of that you can never quite feel for them the way you might like to.  They have one or two good scenes together, and Agata has another on his own, but at some point Agata should have, at least, broken out of the dull, flat affect.  He does for a moment, but then he\'s back at it all the way to and through the climax.  It was a philosophically consistent choice, but in terms of developing good characters, it was the wrong choice.  Especially when two more of the side characters, Yuta and Honoka, have slightly different but still largely flat affectsI will say... I enjoyed the show well enough despite that.  The single loud notes of Chidori, Tenga, Hisomu, and Nico (along with the surprising depths of the latter two characters) make for a lot of good scenes, and while the writers still had material to work with the basic premise of Story One, it was really good.  Like I said before, I wanted to see that story continue, and I feel that in some ways the time that was spent on setting up and running Story Two could have been better spent extending and developing the depths of the basic Kiznaiver premise.  All the same, I didn\'t dislike Story Two, and it had some really good moments.  The show is at its best in episodes 1 and 2 and then sort of comes back into form for 8, 9, and 11.  The other episodes aren\'t bad, but I don\'t feel like they use their setup as well as they could, nor do they develop the right characters in the right way.  All in all, I\'d be willing to watch it again if I knew someone who wanted to, but I probably won\'t go back for seconds on my own.Story: 5Art: 8Sound: 6Character: 5Enjoyment: 7Overall: 6 what it\'s able to do, shackled to the desire to do the serious end of its themes justice.

It wasn\'t too much/ too overbearing, and was easy to follow.  I found myself drawn to the next episode, one after the other, on a search for answers and pieces to the puzzle.  For me, the story was one of this anime\'s strongest points!Art: 8/10As for the art, I thought it was great as well.  The colors and style used was enjoyable to watch and I feel the art really brought the characters to life.  All of the characters...were very distinct in their designs, from hair, to face shape, physique, and their clothing style.   I really liked the eyes, especially Katzuhiras\', despite them being blank and emotionless the whole time lol!!Sound: 10/10Well,  considering I\'m listening to the soundtrack as I write this review I\'d say it was pretty darn good!! The theme song was amazing and is probably one of my favorites, as well as the end song!!  as for the OST, it was very distinct throughout the anime.  I found myself identifying reoccurring songs in relation to the situations in each episode, which was nice.  For the most part, the background music stuck out when it had to during particularly emotional and intense scenes as well as in the quirky and funny ones.  Overall, the music was one of my favorite things about this anime!!Character: 7/10Now, don\'t get me wrong, the characters in this anime are some of my favorites but some of them were missing something.  To be quite honest, I loved all 7 of the kiznaivers, but while some were given loads of arc and development, some were just neglected in comparison.. I blame this on the amount of episodes, as 12 is not nearly enough for plot and and equal development of 7 individuals.  Also, I guess I\'d rather have a few VERY well rounded characters and good plot than a bunch of half assed ones, so in my opinion, the creator did their best with what they were given.Enjoyment: 10/10This section should be rather simple, as every episode left me wanting more.  I liked how the pieces to the overall plot sort of fell into place overtime, and watching the characters in the situations and predicaments they were thrown into was rather enjoyable for me.  Not saying their pain and emotional suffering was ""enjoyable"" per say, as it was quite heart wrenching at times, but this anime made be feel some strong emotions on this side of the screen, and in my book that counts as enjoyable.  I will pretty much sell my soul to any sort of content that makes me feel emotionally connected to fictional worlds and characters, being the expert escapist that i am!!Overall: 9/10overall,  Kiznaiver was probably one of my favorite animes\' to date.  Great story, awesome soundtrack, lovable characters, and lots of eye catching art!!  I would 100% recommend this to anyone and I\'ll probably be watching it again in the near future!! were very distinct in their designs, from hair, to face shape, physique, and their clothing style.

It means literally nothing and they endlessly repeat it, hoping it will gain meaning somewhere along the way. The author had the idea of making a story about people feeling the pain of others, and then literally couldn\'t put more than two thoughts together to form a cohesive story line or interesting cast of characters. Hell even 1 interesting character. The art was of standard quality. The sound was nothing memorable standard quality. I enjoyed almost no episodes of this show, other than maybe the first one, before I realized...that there was nothing beyond a simple premise. that there was nothing beyond a simple premise.', 'So kiznaiver just end and i loved it! The story was very good, the art and animations was very refreshing, and the best thing that the series had was its characters. i started to realizes  that the main 8 characters have their own color that is themed to them and their personality. like Agata is themed around gray or white because he is ""emotionless"" and i could go on but i this review is not about talking about small easter eggs.the story of Kizmaiver was great, but because of the idea of people being able...to feel each others pain through the kiza project, but how it uses it, to mess with each characters emotions and problems. There was a special bond that each character goes through, like what each character thinks about each other or their emontoinal past, like makes past and how she thinks that she (spoiler) killed her friend.I loved the characters and their personalities. many of the characters were very memorable, like Nico for how weird she is,or teenage for..uhh...how can i put this...HIPUUU SUUUMMERRRR...(you get a cookie if you get the joke) Anyways i love thatch character has their own problems and fears.I also like that they use their ""bond"" for comical sense witch made the show very entertaining.Over all KIznaiver is a GREAT anime for all kinds of people and a give it a perfect 10/10thx for reading this review to feel each others pain through the kiza project, but how it uses it, to mess with each characters emotions and problems.

This has only happened with a couple other animes (such as Casshern Sins and Charlotte) so I thought i\'d put forward my opinion.Kiznaiver is a show that uses a plot device one would normally associate with quite an intricate plot/mystery type anime, for a completely different purpose, which I believe is the source of much confusion. Kiznaiver\'s plot is character development. That may sound like a strange description for a plot, and it rarely is pulled off well. However when push comes...to shove I honestly think that the entire point of the show, essentially the shows \'plot\', was simply to create some characters and show how they/people bond. (as the show itself so often said). People complain that the plot seems directionless, especially in the first few episodes and they seem to miss that the reason behind that is it is introducing characters, the \'plot\' seems to be lacking because the show is focused on building beautiful characters. It even points out the \'stereotypical characters\' that it uses because that is half of the point of the entire anime (the ending basically summarises why they choose to use such ""Stereotypical anime characters"".I\'m not saying Kiznaiver was perfect, in fact I took a few days break around the middle of the show. However by the time I finished the show I was so connected to the characters and loved the way they all brought an individual perspective to the philosophy of the show. And all with incredibly well thought-out backstories that explain their personalities.For those people who love concise, 100% complete explanations for everything in a show, you will struggle with Kiznaiver. Even the process of becoming a Kiznaiver is completely unexplained, (MILD SPOILER) you go through a quick surgery and boom, pain shared with everyone else who has that surgery. That\'s it, no more explanation. And I like that, it would be completely pointless info-dumping that wouldn\'t have contributed AT ALL to the character development.I could continue raving about various aspects of the show that I think were misunderstood but I shant bore you any longer. All I can say is that I feel Kiznaiver set out to accomplish a goal of a story focused around a group of three-dimensional characters using a unique plot device to get across a philosophical point and show how important it is for human beings to bond together, even through the painful times (Maki? Anyone)And to the producers of Kiznaiver I say BRAVO! Mission accomplished you did a beautiful job.I mean common, episode 11, the scene with Kacchon and Hisomu!!! I just sat back and thought ""Wow, I love these characters so much"" It felt so NATURAL to me, and I was just like, yea, that\'s what friends are for. AND THAT WAS WHAT KIZNAIVER WAS ALL ABOUT. So I think it deserves all the praise I can give it.

There was so much emotion and I absolutely loved episodes 9 and 11. In episode 9, we found out about the love triangle of unrequited feelings and how depressing love can be. It teaches us something. Yes, it is not perfect. I shipped Nico and Tenga but the dude ended up with Chidori. But over looking that flaw, the anime is quite realistic when it came to drama. It wasn't too much, it was bold. The ending was a happy one too! (I am a sucker for happy endings)Everyone is...happy, they found true happiness, sadness and pain.P/SFirst review, sorry if it was crappy teehee happy, they found true happiness, sadness and pain.P/SFirst review, sorry if it was crappy teehee"", '(My review was deleted after the series finished airing, this is merely a copied version of it from when it was airing.)Art 10/10:The art is beautiful. It is eye appealing and fits the world that the anime is set in. I find that the art style is both colourful and dull when it\'s needed and fits the mood perfectly for every scene. It I think it truly couldn\'t be done any better for this show. The art style almost of reminds me of a brighter and more colourful Durarara!Sound 10/10:The intro is catchy and nicely animated. The song fits the show and it\'s...a song that anyone can get attached to quickly. Personally, I think it might even be one of my favourite introductions, ever! And the ending does not disappoint either!I can say without a doubt that I\'m not the only one who watches this show and dances a little bit when the intro begins!Character 10/10:The characters are definitely one of the stand out points in this show. They all are welly developed over the episodes which gets you really attached to them and nail biting at every sudden and horrible turn of events against them. But that makes the show even better! They are relatable too and truly have fitting and sensibly developed traits and personalities.Relationships play a huge part too. With multiple love interests, potential love interests and episode 8 (Which went specifically into the characters relationships, characters and story (Aka the episode where the creators used the episode to not only continue the story but to ship everyone together in a huge love triangle and confuse us viewers)), it gets you messed up to say the least. Getting confused over multiple ships is always fun to pull at your heartstrings and to debate over with friends (If you them of course).Story 10/10:This story is another huge stand out point for me. I\'ve never really seen an anime with such an original storyline. It\'s not everyday you find an anime about people linking together by their pain and emotion and unless I\'m blind, It\'s an incredibly original idea. I\'ve seen anything like it before.Other than it just being original the storyline is nicely thought out and there is never a dull moment. The plot advances throughout the series with twists and turns and angst and cute fluffy things. So be excited for that.Nothing is left unexplained and confusing stuff is typically gone into detail with so you can be left with a full understanding of whats going on instead of going ""Lol what?"".Enjoyment 10/10:As I\'ve probably expressed through my review, this series is amazingly enjoyable.

I just couldn\'t stop watching it because whenever I finished an episode, I just wanted to watch the next one.I had it on my ""Plan To Watch"" list for a while but I decided to finish some Anime series first so then I could...watch it, and I can tell you something... It was worth it, every episode.I didn\'t feel bored at ANY second, literally.Another thing, the theme is very good too. For those who don\'t know, Kiznaiver is about human relationships and sharing pain with our friends, it is some sort of common thing in our lives but it was awesome to watch an Anime that is related to that.The story was very well written and the characters developed very well throughout the show, the only thing I did not like about this Anime is the opening.Man, the op just doesn\'t match the Anime! Though the ending does fit much better comparing to the op.I guess that is really about it. Overall it was worth to watch and I did not give it a 10 rating because the ending of the Anime wasn\'t quite I was expecting (although it was still very good).Do I recommend you watching it?Sure.

One big reason could be the studio attempting their second TV series after the immensely popular Kill la Kill. With a show like that, it could be hard to top. However, after a while, I tried not to think about that. Instead, I accepted Kiznaiver for what it had to offer without comparing it to other works. It's very simple, but keeps it leveled, so it's not that grand in...scale. In the end, I think what really mattered was the message of the entire show.Of course, the characters are what helped drive the story/message forward. What's interesting about them is they're basically forced to get to know one another, which is something that normally would happen in a story that's poorly written. Obviously, this is intentional, and even then, for most of them it was hard to accept each other at first. Now that I think about it, this is kind of like how I dealt with my expectations for this show.It goes without saying that TRIGGER is always on their A game when it comes to animation. The character designs are individually unique and the movements can become either very fluid or just out there.

The characters develop greatly over the course of a few episodes and the way Kiznaiver is presented is more normal-pacing than a whole shit-load of exposition {yes, I'm talking about SAO}. I enjoyed this series very much and for the people that enjoy, Drama, Romance, and Sci-Fi, Kiznaiver is the go-to. There are, however, several flaws in Kiznaiver, as one would expect.1. Kiznaiver's protagonist, Katsuhira Agata, is totally unrelatable and emotionless.I found that I was completely uninterested in this character whatsoever,except his relationship with Nori and Chidori.2. I don't and will never understand...which retarded parents went to sign their kids up for the Kizna Experiment.if you don't already follow the series, you probably won't understand what I'm talking about, but I simply do not understand which parent with the right mind ever thought that sharing pain was a good idea.That's all the issues I could point of for now, but there are many other small flaws in the series. which retarded parents went to sign their kids up for the Kizna Experiment.if you don't already follow the series, you probably won't understand what I'm talking about, but I simply do not understand which parent with the right mind ever thought that sharing pain was a good idea.That's all the issues I could point of for now, but there are many other small flaws in the series."", 'Before I start the review,I\'ve known that this anime is originated from the game ""Kiznaiver"",However,after the anime ended,I wasn\'t able to find the game in google to  compare it to,so I will do review based on the story development of the episodes.Story: 7Honestly,the story started off really slow.On the first 2 episode,I really felt like droppingg the anime because it was too slow for me.But soon the story slowly starts to develop by first bringing the Kiznaivers together and bulding connection among them instead of forcing viewers to gulp some idea or storyline without explaining.It does not just throw a solution of mystery to...the viewer,it actually develops it and gives evidence on how it was solved and the background story(hint:Sonozaki Maki).However,the story does take a major turn with the drama which will probably blow your mind because how the story take a transition from kiznaivers being friend from suddenly they are in love with eachother and fighting over eachother like a chain reaction,when one person rejects,it just end up breaking the friendship between all of them. However I was kind of disappointed with how the story ended,because I wished they would reveal more of the history of Katsuhira and Noriko\'s time of kiznaiver experiment and how or why it started.The ending clearly seemed too rushed since it made my feel like the story could develop more after Noriko started an all out ""connection"" experiment in the city.However,the ending matches up so it was alright.Art: 7The art seems pretty unusual compared to other animes; it is like a game.So I\'m guessing the art is similar to the one in the Kiznaiver game.It\'s not half bad;the art does not bother as much at all.It gives an impression of the game so it\'s pretty cool to me.Sound: 5Starting of with the opening theme,it\'s pretty trippy.The sounds in the game also go along good with the overall progress of the story,but it\'s not overwhelmingly astounding.When there\'s a need for an action-packed scene,they add a combat-like music to sync with it. But most of the time,I kind of don\'t really notice the background sound because it is kind of subtle.Characters: 8The major characters in this anime are all connected to kiznaiver experiment,where Noriko and Katsuhira were the first ones to start the experiment as it seems like.But they gradually unpack the relation between the characters and their history.I would say they did a really good job with the development of the characters even though there are still some that are left totally unanswered.For example,they did not reveal the history o Noriko except that she was always ""alone"" and they did not also mention histories of the other kiznaiver that Noriko were friends with.However,the ending makes it end smoothly and they don\'t need to have a second sequel season. I wished they reveal more of the history of the characters in the anime except of just showing their personalities when it comes to the person they like. They kind of make the character relation look cheap because how it was suddenly all about love and love-triangles.Enjoyment: 7As I mentioned in the beginning of the review,I wanted to drop the anime when I started watching it.I actually it put off to the side to add it on my drop list.However,when it was almost halfway into the anime and they developed the relationship between the characters,it was more enjoyable and I wanted to watch what comes after.Before it was confusing with how everyone just popped into existence.But since suddenly it was all about love triangles,I did not enjoy it more.But those were only during the last 2-3 episodes so it was still interesting to see what happens between the kiznaivers after.Overall: 6The story was really interesting and unique before they brought love between the kiznaivers into the story.My excitement dropped after that even though I liked how the story progressed.If they didn\'t rushed it to end the story,I would\'ve given this anime a 7. the viewer,it actually develops it and gives evidence on how it was solved and the background story(hint:Sonozaki Maki).However,the story does take a major turn with the drama which will probably blow your mind because how the story take a transition from kiznaivers being friend from suddenly they are in love with eachother and fighting over eachother like a chain reaction,when one person rejects,it just end up breaking the friendship between all of them.

They kind of make the character relation look cheap because how it was suddenly all about love and love-triangles.Enjoyment: 7As I mentioned in the beginning of the review,I wanted to drop the anime when I started watching it.I actually it put off to the side to add it on my drop list.However,when it was almost halfway into the anime and they developed the relationship between the characters,it was more enjoyable and I wanted to watch what comes after.Before it was confusing with how everyone just popped into existence.But since suddenly it was all about love triangles,I did not enjoy it more.But those were only during the last 2-3 episodes so it was still interesting to see what happens between the kiznaivers after.Overall: 6The story was really interesting and unique before they brought love between the kiznaivers into the story.My excitement dropped after that even though I liked how the story progressed.If they didn\'t rushed it to end the story,I would\'ve given this anime a 7.', 'KiznaiverArtWhen I first started to watch this show, I was a little concerned with how the art presented itself. It seemed like it was one of those old cartoon styles everything that moved had a different color palate than did the background. But I found after watching it more and more and becoming significantly more invested in the show as a whole this didn’t really bother me. I really liked the way how nothing was to extreme and over the top in terms of colors (except of course Nico). it all seemed to come together really well and when things started to really heat up...i could feel the emotion that was present in each of the characters. The art style is anything but generic and actually unique in ways that make this show really pleasant to look at.Sound/MusicThe first thing one might notice about this opening song specifically is the similarity in the tune to a song called “Take On Me” from the ‘80s. And while that song is pretty cool, this song is way better in my personal opinion. This track is catchy and it is honestly one of my favorite parts of each episode. The other major thing I loved about the sound direction was the sound of pain that the characters felt throughout the entire show. When they were stunned with pain there was a shocker sound and it made me cringe just as much as the characters did. That kind of attention to detail brought me face-first into a show that I knew nothing about going into.StoryThe story in Kiznaiver is one of connection. These 7 people have seemingly nothing in common and one of them can’t feel any pain at all. But through a weird twist they all discover that they share a similar wound on their wrist, and whenever one of them feels pain, the others all share that pain equally. It comes out that they are part of a project that aims to study the way emotions are shared from person to person. At first it mostly deals with pain, but the deeper goal is to find how positive emotions such as love can be spread from person to person. It all wraps up with the nice little bow of a romantic subplot between a few of the characters that drive the story forward, even if I ship characters different than what the story says.Personal ReflectionI started watching this show out of sheer curiosity because of the summary provided on Crunchyroll. I wasn’t looking to really get into it, but I found that after I really learned about the characters, it became such a pleasing experience to watch. I would look forward each week to the next installment of the series in eager anticipation to see where the story was going to go. I have always wondered about how I would be able to share my pain and my emotions with others because handling it all on your own is not a good thing to do. This show supports the notion that friendship, even with people that you have nothing in common with, is important. There will always be people that are going through similar things as you, and even if those things get drastically different, we all bleed the same color; red. I highly recommend Kiznaiver.Overall Rating : 8.5/10 i could feel the emotion that was present in each of the characters.

I highly recommend Kiznaiver.Overall Rating : 8.5/10', ""Kiznaiver is the embodiment of “believe in the power of friendship”--- minor spoilers ---This anime is not what I expected as a Trigger anime. There are some good and bad points. The characters feel like they have more personality but because the cast is simply to big or the pacing is to slow I think they aren’t as lively as they could be. Most of the time the characters hold their treats and don’t develop much. Other than that they all become friends I think keeping the some of the characters as they are to much of a cliché.The story feels like it is all...over the place without a clear goal. That is not a big deal but since the setting of this anime is not like “slice of life” I expected a better follow up of events. Every “mission” didn’t deepen my bond with the cast as it should have been. Other than that there are two things going on it all feels messy. There is mc who has no emotions, then when he got hooked up with 6 other people I thought he was going to develop from that, but no. He just want his old love back. This struck me more as a nuisance rather than good story telling.There are subtle hints that the characters have deeper personalities, it doesn’t become very evident. I missed the parts where they actually complemented each other what was actually said in the anime itself. The cast was also represented as the seven deadly sins, but different. It was weird they mentioned this as reason of the Kiznaiver project at all. It just felt out of place when I finished the anime.While Katsuhira slowly changes, his development doesn’t feel satisfying. I think it is good he was so insufferable to watch, as that was his purpose. The conclusion about him is just not good.Luckily the humor was better than character presentation. The sudden slap kick jokes were relaxing as they didn't feel forced.While I think the characters are oddly presented and feel hollow, I did enjoy some dialogues. There were moments where the interactions sparked my interest. The thing im most bummed about is the fact that the kiznaiver device wasn't some kind of alien and that they didn't need to fight in outerspace, all connected to make the fights bearable. Missed chance Trigger. Other than a pleasing animation I don’t think the execution overall of Kiznaiver was brilliant. over the place without a clear goal.

""Character development""( I don\'t know if you can even call that) went 0-100 in one episode.Female MC has the flaws of the main character. And on top of that, were we supposed to feel sorry for her?oh no!...She had a sad backstory and was tortured ...so now the viewers should ignore the fact that she took the spotlight from the characters that had ACTUAL progression and development.ANIMATION:Some might think the animation was good because it was ""smooth"". But don\'t be mistaken! There\'s a difference between good animation and chaotic animation. This was a prime example of chaotic animation. Animation like story has things called pacing and intervals too. If you don\'t consider those things even the smoothest of animation won\'t come out looking good.ENDING:Finally, the ending sucked ass! Too hectic and out of pace. Some scenes were cringe too. This is one of the very rare times whena happy ending doesn\'t equate to a good ending.3 out of 10.

Its just another one of those ""POWER OF FRIENDSHIP"" type of animes.I get it why some people love it - the characters were quirky and some are lovable. But if you are one of those people who are watching coz of the protagonist (cool and emotionless) then dont get into this coz the protag is cool and emotionless...but in a different way.In my opinion, watch 5 episodes and if you dont like it then drop it. but in a different way.In my opinion, watch 5 episodes and if you dont like it then drop it.', 'Trigger back at it again with another extremely presentable piece of animated media. This time, I actually like it quite a bit.In a world where mascot attire is commonplace, 7 high school students, each matched to one of the 7 deadly sins, are abducted and neurologically modified to share one another\'s pain. No, this isn\'t the plot of a SAW movie, this is Kiznaiver- a Trigger property.As is often the case when I watch a Trigger property, I have mixed feelings.--story--The story is the weakest part of this show in my opinion. There aren\'t many noticeable plotholes, but the plot is mostly just...simplistic character driven drama stuff. This makes sense in the context of the show, so the structure alone isn\'t actually a problem. The moral of the story, around which the events of the story are heavily predicated, is far too simple to be thought-provoking. I\'ll spoil the theme: shared experiences connect people and connections lead to happiness. I mean, like, no shit. Humans evolved to coexist, it doesn\'t take a large-scale unethical research program to figure that out.--presentation--Where this show does get good is the presentation. Trigger is pretty good at this kind of stuff, and it shows. For the first time in a while, I watched an OP and found it worth my time. The song, ""Lay Your Hands on Me"" by Boom Boom Satellites, was the perfect numb-trip score to put over the whirly kaleidoscopic visuals. Despite my praise, the OP didn\'t have much in the way of storytelling, it was mostly just brief character and tone introductions. Even so, I thoroughly enjoyed it to the point where I\'ve actually gone out of my way to listen to it- a distinctly weeb thing that I hardly ever do.Aside from the OP, the sound design of the show is just average. No character stood out as miscast. I noticed that the teacher character from this anime is the same guy that voices Eraser Head from Hero Aca, so that was pretty cool. Other than that I\'ve got nothing.--characters--I liked the characters of Kiznaiver. Once they were established, they didn\'t act out. Most of them were tolerable and fun to watch, although at times I questioned their collective decision making skills. Also, that one guy looks like Kamina, which is pretty rad. Needless to say, as this is a Trigger anime, the character designs were memorable and color-coded, which made the anime that much more consumable.--overall--I liked Kiznaiver, but I don\'t feel strongly about it. This anime was a 7.4, according to my calculator, and yeah, I\'d say that\'s fair. I couldn\'t muster up an 8 for this, since it didn\'t leave much of an impact on me.

The anime, focusing mainly on the plot of love and pain, tries to express how human feelings work, through pain and friendship. I know it sounds a liitle bit weird, but wait. The main character is Katsuhira, a 17 year old boy who for a reason doesn\'t feel pain, and is somehow emotionless and indifferent in every situation in his life. He has a friend too, Chidori, which seems that is the only person it created a connection with. In a day, he with Chidori, and...with another 4 teenagers(5 in the end), are forced to join the so called Kizuna System as ""Kiznaivers"". Those taking part are connected through pain, so if one member is injured, all others will feel the same pain. From here, the story tries to tell every member\'s story in part, and express what, and how important love and pain are. You would probably say that is a boring story, and you found it as an anime trying to make drama from anything, but it\'s actually a story from which you should learn from. Human emotions have long been a distinct and hard subject to talk about, but this anime expresses them, and tries to teach you how they work and what pain and love are. An actually ""teach this"" for the bullies which should learn how emotions work. This anime is special, and makes you feel so amazing, and teaches you something very good. The characters are great, art and sound awesome, and the story miraculous, and it so deserves a 2nd season. with another 4 teenagers(5 in the end), are forced to join the so called Kizuna System as ""Kiznaivers"".

It is a story writhe with a wide array of emotions, from joy to anger, as well as a great deal worth of unspoken romantic tension, pointing towards the fact that the main characters are all quite young and still learning to communicate their feelings effectively. By connecting with one another through the experiment, the teenagers participating in...the experiment—Kiznaivers—grow tremendously and eventually are able to collectively overcome many of their internal struggles which have held them back in life and later form a bond that does not solely revolve around the Kizna project.Overall, Kiznaiver's story is a very unique journey about the intriguing concept of how human pain—through both emotional and physical wounds—can be interpreted in many different ways and affect both the one who receives the wounds and the loved ones that surround them. This is shown in many different ways throughout the story, both in current and past struggles, and can leave the viewer feeling torn towards which characters they sympathize with most. While watching the series, I oddly found myself sympathizing the most with the characters that I had liked least at the beginning of the anime, which is a product of great character development. However, there were many characters within the story that were neglected in terms of background information or character exploration. Creating connections between each of these characters while overcoming their individual pasts, with an increasing cast as the story continues, was a concept too broad to be communicated effectively in just twelve episodes. There were also many theories that surrounded the Kizna system and its participants that were too vague or sketchy at the end of the anime, which could have been given better reason with more show time.In terms of art, Kiznaiver's designs are very flashy for some characters while more simplistic for others, which effectively matches each character's personality, pointing towards the fact that people of many different backgrounds can come together to share a bond. The visuals for the background and setting of the anime were also done quite well but seemed to fade from one's mind to focus more on the characters instead, unless highlighting on a particularly emotional moment, like the last climatic scene of the series on Yugomori City's bridge. Perhaps the most unique thing about Kiznaiver's art style is the visual portrayal of pain that passes between the characters during their Kizna bond, shown as a brightly colored transition that quickly shoots across the screen and then disappears. Overall, the animation and art are both done well, but there is nothing extremely notable about the visuals, paling in comparison to the art of other works made by Studio Trigger.With that said, Kiznaiver is definitely a series one could enjoy quite easily as a means of passing some spare time, though it might not impress more critical viewers. However, it is also something that could potentially influence people emotionally and encourage viewers to pursue positive relationships with others, despite past or current troubles. Though it is a unique story with a touching concept, Kiznaiver is a series that is much too rushed and half-baked in theory to deserve a higher score. the experiment—Kiznaivers—grow tremendously and eventually are able to collectively overcome many of their internal struggles which have held them back in life and later form a bond that does not solely revolve around the Kizna project.Overall, Kiznaiver's story is a very unique journey about the intriguing concept of how human pain—through both emotional and physical wounds—can be interpreted in many different ways and affect both the one who receives the wounds and the loved ones that surround them.

Some love it and some hate it. I’ve found that one’s enjoyment of Kiznaiver depends largely on what type of plot you enjoy. I will give my opinion on whether I loved it or hated it and try to justify my reasoning.Story:\t9.35 / 10The story is an emotional roller-coaster, explored from the perspective of several different characters. Due to these differing perspectives, I got emotionally attached to the characters and the developments were really impactful. The strong point of the...story is how it handles its characters, which I will get to later. Kiznaiver also has a brilliant message that you are left with after watching it which has been stuck in my head ever since I completed it for the first time. And I am the kind of person to enjoy plots exploring emotions and appreciate complex messages that a show leaves behind. As a result, I loved the story of Kiznaiver, although I will admit that your enjoyment does depend on your taste in story types.Art:\t9.85 / 10Simply beautiful. The color palette is amazing and the environment is vibrant and alive. The animation is always great and everything is always on-model. The art style always reflects the tone of the scene. Visually among the best-looking anime I’ve seen.Sound: \t9.65 / 10Great soundtrack, especially in the big scenes where it matters. The English dub is really good as well. Kiznaiver does definitely get a massive plus in this category for its opening song, which is simply awesome.Character:\t9.6 / 10Writing-wise, the characters are where this show shines. Since it is all about the 7 main characters and their relationships, each one of them is well developed, but in entirely their own way. Some of the character aspects might be exaggerated, but in this case, almost all of these aspects are actually explained through character backstory. Also, since the lineup of main characters is so large, it is more likely for the viewer to be able to relate to at least one of them, since they are so wildly different.Enjoyment:\t9.7 / 10As mentioned before, I loved the story of Kiznaiver. Though some might find it slightly confusing, since the show never outright states what message it is trying to convey. But that leads to the viewer having to think about the show to find the message – which is the type of thought-provoking emotional story that I enjoy. I enjoyed the visuals, the emotions, the characters (some more than others) and I especially enjoyed the opening. I enjoyed watching Kiznaiver so much that I have re-watched it three times and I definitely will re-watch it again.Overall:\t \t9.65 / 10I think it is great. Not perfect, since there are some strange scenes and repetitive dialogue, but it succeeds on almost every other level. However, if the viewer cannot get invested in the characters for whatever reason or he/she doesn’t like to think further to see the whole picture that Kiznaiver paints, I can understand why it can be disliked.

I'm gonna finally write a positive review for something.With me piddling all over some other animes, getting a few removed etc. I think it's time for me to be positive for once. Besides in my HIV test.Story: 8!If you take out the characters from the anime, the story is shit. It's a normal teen drama that we've all seen before, and just like some of the characters, adds fuck all.But with the characters to connect it, it rises to the dizzy heights of basically alright.There are still a few things I'd change, but those are minor complaints....Art: 8!It doesn't really stand out either way, but I really like it personally. It has a great color scheme, and a unique artstyle that isn't the generic one with same-tone colors everywhere. It's *enjoyable*.Sound: 9!Oooh boy. I kept getting chills because the voice actors did such a good job with their roles. The soundtrack is awesome, and well done. Not much more to say about it, really.Characters: 10!If I had to summarize all the characters in one world, it would be relatable. You can feel that you'd do exactly the same thing in the situation. They're all very human, and engaging. You can feel that they understand the shit they're in, and that they try to cope with the situation at hand the best they can. I'd go as far as saying that characters here are *almost* as good as in Re:zero.Enjoyment: 9!A surprising anime, although only slightly cliche, a very enjoyable one. I have no complaints about the characters, which is in my opinion the most important part of an anime, because we're supposed to project ourselves onto one of those characters. That's why having a large variation of characters is very important.Overall: 9!WATCH IT. REASONS ABOVE. Art: 8!It doesn't really stand out either way, but I really like it personally.

They're all very human, and engaging. You can feel that they understand the shit they're in, and that they try to cope with the situation at hand the best they can. I'd go as far as saying that characters here are *almost* as good as in Re:zero.Enjoyment: 9!A surprising anime, although only slightly cliche, a very enjoyable one. I have no complaints about the characters, which is in my opinion the most important part of an anime, because we're supposed to project ourselves onto one of those characters. That's why having a large variation of characters is very important.Overall: 9!WATCH IT. REASONS ABOVE."", 'Kiznaiver is supposed to be an anime that highlights the problem of the natural loneliness that all people feel and what that loneliness can turn people into. Does it manage that? In a way, yes, but that way is so unrealistic and exaggerated that nothing whatsoever can be learned from the series.Plot: 5In core principle, I really like the idea of Kiznaiver. Connecting people through physical pain to connect them mentally - for a world without loneliness. The idea is beautiful and one that you could play a lot with.  Kiznaiver partly does that. The physical pain is first explored through a set of...(in general) previously unacquainted teenagers. After a few episodes, as they grow closer and more familiar, this develops to an exploration of their mental pain. At some point this culminates, while a different story is presented to the viewer in pieces. An older and more mysterious story which is probably my favourite part of the series (Katsuhira\'s past). So okay, they have everything covered. But rather than choosing this mysterious route they laid out in the beginning, they explore through slice-of life moments of exaggerated feelings and borderline hysterical behaviour. What could have been a great sci-fi is turned into a mediocre drama. And even the mysterious past crumbles in feelings during the last episodes.Aside from that, the episodes are rather mis-matched. The pacing is irregular and some of the episodes are so unrealistic that they don\'t even make sense (e.g. what Nori-chan did in the last episode). Some events seem irrelevant even if they are meant to be used for ""bonding"". Generally if the pace had been picked up, this series would have been a lot better.Art: 9This is definitely where the series excels. Gorgeous. I think that\'s the word for the art. Original character designs combined with a sense for detail, pleasant and detailed backgrounds, a very big focus on lighting and colours. That is what Kiznaiver\'s art is. Whether you like the design or not, the characters are beautifully drawn and all of them very unique. The eyes are the most detailed and spirited I\'ve seen in a while, light reflecting from them with excellent detail. The hair - especially when moving - is also drawn very detailed, making it possible to tell individual strands apart (Nori\'s hair..).Sound: 7Sound is neither really good nor bad. The opening has a futuristic feel that fits the series well, while the ending is nothing special. Quite common for a slice of life, though a bit fast paced.  The OSTs are pleasant and well-used to create certain moods. A few of them are memorable and I generally think they did a good job in making the OSTs sound a bit ""spacey"" to fit the show.Characters:7The characters are actually rather nice. They are all different from one another and make a good combination. Our main character, Katsuhira, is an odd-ball with no feelings. This may sound familiar, but they actually make him work very well and make him seem as realistic as possible. Other characters include an energetic loli, a softhearted muscle man, the usual likeable female friend, a cold and rather mean glasses girl, and a school prince. All of the characters are actually likeable, and though some are exaggerated,  others are downright sensible people (Honoka and Yuta actually seem like real people). Another strong point is how much we get to know the characters, their bad points, weaknesses and their past. It makes it easier to understand their actions.Now the reason I haven\'t scored characters higher is their relationships. Being together for a few weeks, these very different personalities are suddenly best friends. The things that they\'d do for each other after such a short period of time are way too many. Oh and let\'s not foget how everyone falls in love with each other. Their deepfelt confessions made me cringe. That said, I actually like the main couple.Overall: 6All in all Kiznaiver ruined a very good idea. There were some enjoyable moments, but generally the series was boring and delivered weirdly. But if you like slice of life with a twist, this might be for you. Most people can enjoy the series if you put your focus on art and animation - if you\'re an art freak this series is not a bad choice, because the story is not downright horrible, just about decent.

At times it succeeded--and very beautifully, too--and at times it made me feel like an AI had been told to write a series based on an algorithm.The general premise has a vaguely-shaped world split by a vaguely-mentioned war with a city being set as an experiment by vague, mysterious higher figures wherein people would try to get united via a 'kizuna' experiment consisting of using people cosplaying as the dog thing from Paranoia Agent to kidnap teenagers (carefully selected so that they were to be as different from one another as...possible), do clandestine surgery on them and have them share physical pain because of it in an attempt to see if they managed to understand each other that way.Here we have 7-deadly sin gimmick that doesn't even involve the actual sins unless you scrutinize, but that's fine. Each kidnapped teenager represents a 'modern day sin'and is pretty much forced to cooperate and 'bond' with the other teenagers until the end of summer.Teenagers? Bonding? Learning to empathize? Kidnapping? Sounds like a decent enough premise, right?Within the first half of the first episodes, the series's weaknesses begin to creep through. Granted, we can take in a silly premise. Granted, we've seen enough characters who randomly get white hair due to trauma to accept them with no second throught. Granted, we have seen brick-faced waifus and tsundere childhood friends and quirky crazy comic reliefs enough times to grow numb to them, too, but... that's the problem.You know what's going to happens before it happens because you've seen literally everything within Kiznaiver before. The characters are as recycled as the plot elements and themes, and this wouldn't be too bad with good enough execution (or else pretty much everything would be unenjoyable) but Kiznaiver tries to be Another Trigger Show without seeming to understand what has worked for their other works in the past.To elaborate: Trigger's characters are not the best. They're fun, they're unique, they're easily recognizable, but their role in an absurdist battle anime is not the same as their role in a character drama. Tropes and gimmicks don't make great characters; depth does, and that's what Trigger lacks. That's what ended up fucking Darling In The Franxx in the ass (ep. 19 onwards notwithstanding) and it's what affected this show the most.Did this have the potential to be great? Absolutely. I must admit I was quite charmed the first episode or so, but it soon became clear that we'd see no more of these characters than their quirks. Good character dramas demand depth. Would Toradora be as acclaimed if Taiga had been nothing but a tsundere? Would Anohana be remembered as fondly if Jintan's hikikomori status had been nothing but a funny haha quirks? I'm not saying every anime out there has to be a deconstruction, but if your characters are 2D, how are they supposed to keep a story based on them compelling?I'm part of the crowd that believes this would've greatly benefitted from 24 episodes instead of 13. Had they given everyone an arc and not just one (1) character and this would easily be one of MAL's darlings.Trigger is known for larger-than-life, gimmicky characters and humor, but that doesn't mean all their works have to be like that. The humor detracted rather than contributing, but the Gomorins were pretty cute and it was easy to see they didn't take themselves too seriously. Until they did. Not only are the cardboard characters a problem, but also the tonal dissonance. Am I supposed to laugh or feel bad for them? Why would you ruin what is supposed to be an emotional scene with a joke? Again, it's like they're trying so hard to stay Trigger that it holds them back more than anything at this point.It's not bad to stray from your roots. Not everything has to end in a giant robot fight and not every episode has to have forced humor in it.Ultimately, I feel like them trying to hard to make this fit their mold ended up in the series's demise. It was rushed, it was tonally dissonant and it felt like they were yelling at you 'Feel this way!' instead of letting empathy surface naturally. Kind of ironic, all things considered.That said, I really liked the concept of some of their characters (Agata beginning as an apathetic, detached individual and slowly thawing along the way, in theory or Yuta being this pretty boy hiding a massive complex behind an arrogant facade).

Beautiful animation but a poorly executed story. The premis of the show is great, the charachters sharing pain and emotion seems interesting enough,however, if that is the premise then the show obviously needs to be a charachter based show which is the major flaw here.A show like this only makes an impact if the charachters can make you connect to them and care about them. I personally had a hard time connecting with the charachters mostly because they were not like able. Also there is a prominent lack of back story for any charachter...that you might actually like.Aside from the charachters the plot is kind of all over the place with pacing issues included free of charge! There are also times when the plot gets a little hard to follow but that may have just been me. As for the rest of the show...The animation is great Bright and colorful and really catches your eye. Im not really knowledgeable about animation quality and specs but i do know that this is pretty good animation. The charachter designs are all unique and stand out alot. And i personally enjoyed the op so much that i watched it every time.Overall id say kiznaiver was fair to mediocre. If you are looking for charachters you can really sink your teeth into then this is not your show. But if you just want some shallow high school drama with colorful charachters, great art and animation then kiznaiver is what you are looking for. that you might actually like.Aside from the charachters the plot is kind of all over the place with pacing issues included free of charge!

Spoilers ahead!)Like everyone else (and that’s not hyperbole), I’ve experienced pain.After my first day at my first ever job, my shin splints made me unable to move my legs. When I was a kid, my heart sunk when my mother read some mean words I wrote about her in my journal. Continuous strep throat crippled me for months of my fifth-grade education.Pain has this remarkable ability to make us react to the world around us. However, pain is often not something felt individually. Rather, it’s shared. Shared between random people or the closest of family members.Kiznaiver...depicts pain shared between friends – and what such sharing not only brings but means.STORYThe anime begins with an ominous flashback – of a child presumably killing herself. When it returns to the present, Agata, Chidori, Tenga, Nico, Yuta, and Maki find themselves at the mercy of Nori. A girl who ties them all together through the Kizna System. As a result, these six (eventually seven) ordinary high-school teenagers each become a Kiznaiver.To be upfront from the beginning, Kiznaiver is not perfect. No story ever really is, but that’s a discussion for another day. So, for now, it is best to start with the show’s narrative problems.The most obvious issue the anime deals with is an overreliance on heavy drama. Exaggerated is another way to describe it. A scene like Maki screaming for her life in the middle of the day as a group of documentary filmmakers hound her means well (on a character and story level). But it lingers too long.Arguably, the premise itself invites this heavier drama. Literally connecting people through both physical and emotional pain makes these more out-there dramatic scenarios not so crazy. Still, Chidori crying and ranting for an extended period can start to get overbearing rather than emotional.Kiznaiver also has trouble with some of its exposition. Namely, Nori’s background. Hisomu, Agata, and Nico (as well as the audience) get a big info-dump about what happened in the past near the end of the season. Arguably, it was all mysterious, so it had to happen later. But the delivery wasn’t exactly interesting.The premise itself can also seem hindered when, except for the first major mission, the Kizna system feels underutilized. Not much variety or intrigue is added to their predicaments beyond just putting them all together and seeing what happens.The show may even have an issue on a world-building front. This interesting city does not see much action or exploration beyond the Gomorin workers and that one bridge. But this detail (and perhaps the others) may be knit picking because, after all, the anime is not about the world let alone the city.Indeed, it’s about these eight (including Nori) group of kids.Their journey begins where almost all other stories about friendship start: as strangers. Some are timid, some are uncaring, some are trying to be acquaintances. The building exploding around them obviously adds tension and a fire under their butts, but this high-stakes ice breaker pushes them past that initial, awkward state and down the right path.Said path is filled with many events that bring them closer together. Chasing after a rogue Kiznaiver. Hanging out at a getaway lodge. Taking their picture in a crammed photo booth.Simultaneously, through their pain-sharing connection, the anime starts to explore its theme on friendship. They can no longer only think about their sinful selves. Instead, they must think about each other, about how the other feels when they hit their head or fall to the ground. To them, friendship is some ways off, but the anime argues (at this point) that a physical connection is what can get them there.As they do more with one another and start acting on their thoughts, the show transitions. In their hearts and in their souls, new bonds form. They argue. Feelings surface. Relationships break apart. In this way, the anime starts to question its original idea. That maybe it’s not a physical connection that binds friends together – but an emotional one.Yet one of its smartest writing moves comes after their literal mind-reading climax: The show chooses to end their Kiznaiver status. Rather than carry it through to the end of the season (the perhaps expected routed), the anime has them all return to their normal selves.Of course, they are in a worse state than they had been at the start. But this, once again, demonstrates the anime’s thematic exploration. For, now, it’s both the physical and the emotional that drives them towards one another. Holding hands and dancing around in the hallway. Empathy in regards to rejection. Concern and worry that aches their hearts for their dear friend.But it’s the last scene that demonstrates how thoughtful Kiznaiver is. Poetically enough, it’s on that bridge, now a metaphor for bridging the gap between each other. As Nori stands above the others, she wonders what it is that makes people friends, the same question that the show and the audience has been pondering this entire time.Who else but Maki steps up. She declares that they are all disparate and different from one another. That it doesn’t make any sense that they could or even should be buddies. But it’s precisely because they don’t understand each other that makes them friends. For that spurs them to understand. To communicate and to care and to connect.That is, it’s not a physical bond or an emotional chain that makes them friends – it’s understanding those two connections that does.So, sure, the anime’s overly heavy drama, the sometimes-awkward exposition, and even the Kizna system itself aren’t exactly positives. But its thoughts on friendships and connections, empathy and understanding, turn it into a story that is meaningful in direction and powerful in purpose.ANIMATIONKiznaiver’s visuals continue to prove the show’s strength.Especially the art. The backgrounds are very realistic, detailed in their depictions. Parks filled with trees. Apartments decked out in accessories. Dilapidated buildings coarse with cracks.However, the lighting elevates the prettiness of everything ten-fold. Sunlight cascades on far-open skies. Shadows dance on their faces during a stormy night. Red warning lights and blue computer screens add variety.Together, the lighting and the realism turn Kiznaiver into a powerhouse of artistry.Not to be outdone, the character designs are likewise strong. All of them are colorful. Purple, teal, and orange, mixed with reds, whites, and brown, add to their flair. Different accessories, like charms, glasses, and wrappings, give them personality. And each has their own look. Tenga is tall, a bit burly, and tough. Nico seems as if she came straight out of a circus act. Maki’s plain outfit contrasts well with everyone else and gives her an air of maturity.Going back to the colors, such symbolism is always worth noting since it highlights parts of the characters. Agata’s all-white hair and clothes represent how dilute he has become emotionally. Chidori’s red-centric design coincides with her optimistic attitude. And Hisomu’s lavender look evokes a sense of delicacy that fits his masochistic self.As for the actual animation, Kiznaiver does well here too. Early on, segments like the camera panning through the group as the Kizna system comes online demonstrates this sentiment well enough. That’s a more extreme case. But, even throughout the season, the characters are constantly running around, taking actions like jumping off bridges into traffic or attacking one another, and reacting in over-the-top fashion (especially Nico).CHARACTERSKiznaiver focuses on eight specific characters (listed approximately in order of appearance): Agata, Chidori, Tenga, Nico, Yuta, Maki, Nori, and Hisomu. Now, given the logistics, that there are only twelve episodes to investigate them all, it’s impossible for the anime to flesh them all out completely.Even so, the anime has trouble in this category.In terms of strong and weak, the cast is split down the middle. On the positive side sit Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata. On the negative side sit Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu.There’s almost no question that Maki is the best character the anime offers. In the beginning, she is standoffish, unwilling to cooperate with the others let alone try to befriend them. Coupled with her declaration that she “killed” someone, it puts her in a prime position to develop over the course of the season.And at that she does. While she continues to push back against the others, either by intimidating Yuta or giving the cold shoulder to Nico, her dark past comes to light. As one-half to the famous “Charles de Macking,” she and her best friend Ruru collaborated on a manga that became incredibly popular with the middle-school crowd. Unfortunately, Ruru’s feelings for Maki were ones that Maki did not want to respond to. When Ruru passed away from a fatal disease she always had, Maki blamed herself for shutting her friend away during her most dire time.But once she reads the final chapter of their manga, and she sees that the others are willing to (literally and figuratively) dive headfirst for her, she lightens up and finally becomes their friends.When they all go through their downward slump, Maki seems to go back to her former self, too. But, as her police-speaker speech reveals, she views them as her friends after all that has happened, signifying how far she has come. If nothing else, her having a romantic relationship with Yuta proves that she is not the same person that she was before.Chidori’s development isn’t as pronounced, but it is easily the harshest. While it is infuriating to see her continually try and fail to connect with Agata on a level beyond just friends, her role of disrupting the relationships (through the multi-love-interest angle that ensues) helps everyone involved. Including Chidori. For, taking part in the experiment, speaking her mind, and ultimately accepting her loss to Nori, she grows up and takes the first steps towards moving on.Nico manages to take a top-spot character-wise as well. But why? Compared to most of the characters (and what some of the lesser ones suffer from), not much is known about her besides her eccentricity and that she does not, in fact, see fairies.What she lacks in foundation, though, she makes up for (coincidentally enough) in spirit. She believes that “Friends are soy sauce! The omnipotent seasoning! Much better than sugar or salt!” Her affable personality, with her constant cheeriness and happiness, makes her an advocate of the anime’s main themes on friendship and understanding. That is, she views the others as her closest friends for no tangible reason other than they just are – and that’s perfectly okay.Agata is arguably the main protagonist of Kiznaiver. As an emotionless husk (which is just describing him and not putting him down), he feels no pain. At all. On both a physical and emotional level, he just exists as this guy who goes through life not really knowing who he is.Most of his time is spent thinking. He does his best to think about the other characters, the situation he is in, and, most importantly, himself. Meaning, for the most part, he does not actually have much of an impact on the events at hand.That said, his connection with Nori and being one of the original Kiznaivers gives him some clout as a character. Not a lot and not surprising, but it is cool to see this twist with him later in the season.At the very least, his emotional cry when meeting his friends from the past and his words towards Nori as he attempts to save her near the end of the series demonstrate, however slightly, his change as a person.Again, Agata’s change is nothing spectacular. It may even be considered too small to outweigh his overall low impact. But unlike Maki who starts at the bottom, and unlike Nico who starts at the top, Agata starts in the middle. Neither mean nor nice, neither not-friends nor friends. So, his miniscule step forward is, for him, something positive.Those four – Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata – are the strongest characters in the show. On the opposite end are the other four: Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu.Nori is purposefully surrounded in mystery very early on. Her words on connections and her general air of mystique make it difficult to comprehend what it is she exactly wants. Furthermore, she’s not often around. While the other seven cooperate, she is understandably controlling events on the side.Sadly, this pigeonholing leads to a lack of focus on her character. It’s obvious that she knew Agata or, at the minimum, was related to him in some form. But the anime’s rushed attempts at providing her some backstory or trying to explain away the pain she has sealed away leave her character in a confusing, messy state.As for the other three, they simply follow in Nori’s footsteps but to a much greater degree. In other words, the anime does not have much of a place for them in the story let alone for them individually.Yuta hardly receives any time for himself, and, even when he is involved, it’s either for the brunt of a joke or all the attention goes to Maki. He at least moves away from his arrogant-jerk status, so it’s not as if he fails as a character.Tenga is a cool guy, protecting Agata and looking after Chidori. But, beyond his crush on Chidori and being the only one capable of taking on their adversaries, the show doesn’t spend much time on him.Hisomu has it the worst, though. After his recruitment episode near the beginning of the season, he does not do or say much outside of loving pain.But perhaps the biggest fault with the cast is not on an individual scale.Some of the characters have clear relationships. Agata and Chidori, Maki and Yuta. Yet a lot of them don’t. How many times does Hisomu interact with the others? Do Yuta and Nico have any memorable moments together? What about Chidori and Maki? Nori and anybody else besides Agata?Another way to put it, the anime does not do enough to bolster their group dynamic. The story’s themes on friendship and understanding are clearly there. But, when they themselves are not equalized in their relationships, it almost goes against the show’s own ideas.One last note. The characters and their “sins.” Nori describes each of them with a sin in mind – sloth, greed, etc. – but the anime does not fully explore this idea. A mistake, given how much emphasis it gained near the beginning of the story.SOUNDWithout a doubt, Kiznaiver’s strongest musical component is its opening track. In all honesty, it’s not very involved. Possibly nearing repetition. But that simplicity gives it strength. The triumphant tone, the “lay your hands on me” lyric, and the feeling of friendship permeate the piece. It’s both fun and fitting – a winning combination.Voice acting comes next. Everyone involved with the project does well in their respective roles, especially Misaki Kuno as Nico, Yuka Terasaki as Chidori, and Tomoaki Maeno as Tenga. Nico’s high-pitched voice, Chidori’s emotional range, and Tenga’s upbeat attitude were only possible thanks to the VAs’ strong performances.The ending track isn’t anything particularly special, but it does have its merits. The strumming guitar that leads into the prominent piano, combined with the vocalist’s ever-so-slightly emotional singing, creates a bittersweet tone. Said tone follows a handful of the relationships within the show itself: Romance does not blossom, but friendship stays forever. (An idea reinforced by the all the girls appearing in the ED’s visuals with flowers in hand.)The original soundtrack does not have anything outside of the standard offerings. Funky, techno beats for the slice-of-life events and melancholic, violin ensembles for the dramatic ones. Not that it’s used with poor timing or anything similarly negative, but the OST does not stand out in any notable or positive fashion either.Finally, the Kizna-system sound-effect. The electric, computerized sound that played whenever the group shared their pain always sounded like it hurt.ENJOYMENTMany know that I am big on themes. I believe that a story with a message to convey is stronger than one without. Because stories don’t just exist to entertain us; they exist to let ourselves grow.For this reason, I liked the show. Its focus on friendship and connecting made me laugh, it made me emotional, and it meant a lot. I used to hang out with my own best friends all the time in elementary school. I once talked about them in another review; we were called the “Five Musketeers” because that’s how close we were. So, it wasn’t just cool to see this ragtag bunch of kids become friends. It was meaningful and relatable.That’s the high end. On the low, low end sits Chidori. More specifically, how the anime treated her throughout its run. In short, I didn’t like it one bit. It was bad enough that she was denied or pushed away from her happy, romantic ending. But episodes eight and nine, where she gets ignored and has her heart torn out (multiple times) made me think to myself, “If they nail her romantic coffin shut any tighter, she’ll never be able to escape.”Which is part of the reason why I am not a fan of her (future or implied) pairing with Tenga. I like them individually. Chidori is a kindhearted girl, and Tenga is a noble dude. But, given all the events against her and how he became essentially the rebound, it didn’t sit well with me for a few days after completing the show.Same idea applies for Agata and Nori. It makes sense that they would end up together (once again on a character and story level), but it just doesn’t feel right that he chooses this girl he forgot about for years and years and years while he tosses aside Chidori who always tried to be there for him.Romance is king in my eyes, so these two outcomes are bone breakers for me. Especially Chidori’s treatment. However, I was still a fan of two other major parts of the show.The first is (perhaps obviously) the romance between Yuta and Maki. Watching them quarrel early on, Maki “breaking” over him at the getaway lodge, and Yuta running into the ocean at her behest made for some nice moments between them. But it was her last line about him eating fattier foods that sealed the deal: “Then I won’t have to worry about pests flocking to you.” Man, that line was good. It had me grinning big, and it made it clear that their relationship would thrive in the future.The second is my favorite character in the whole show: Nico. Yes, she was hyper, kooky, and cute. But, above these more superficial traits, what struck me the most was her attitude.In a way, she reminded me of myself. I like to think everybody is my friend (unless you are a real jerk to me or others) no matter if we just met or if we’ve known each other forever. Nico is the same. Her high value of friendship, her willingness to be there for others because that’s what friends do, was a sweet treat to say the least.Kiznaiver muscles through the pain to deliver a show filled with execution. The story’s themes on bonds, the strong artistry, and that simple yet wicked OP are medicine for the body and the mind. A handful of bumps, like the unnecessarily heavy drama and some unexplored characters, sting. Yet it beats shin splints, mean words, and strep throat without question.SUMMARYStory: Fine, while exaggerated drama, slight over-exposition, and not enough done with the premise exist, the thematic exploration on friendship is both meaningful and powerfulAnimation: Great, beautiful art, nice character designs, and above average actual animationCharacters: Fine, Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata are strong, Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu are weak, and missing group dynamics hurt the friendship ideaSound: Fine, great OP, okay ED, okay OST, and above-average VA performancesEnjoyment: Fine, while Chidori’s treatment was wholly unlikable, the overall ideas, the romance between Yuta and Maki, and Nico’s fun, relatable character made it a worthwhile experienceFinal Score: 6/10 depicts pain shared between friends – and what such sharing not only brings but means.STORYThe anime begins with an ominous flashback – of a child presumably killing herself. When it returns to the present, Agata, Chidori, Tenga, Nico, Yuta, and Maki find themselves at the mercy of Nori. A girl who ties them all together through the Kizna System. As a result, these six (eventually seven) ordinary high-school teenagers each become a Kiznaiver.To be upfront from the beginning, Kiznaiver is not perfect. No story ever really is, but that’s a discussion for another day. So, for now, it is best to start with the show’s narrative problems.The most obvious issue the anime deals with is an overreliance on heavy drama. Exaggerated is another way to describe it. A scene like Maki screaming for her life in the middle of the day as a group of documentary filmmakers hound her means well (on a character and story level). But it lingers too long.Arguably, the premise itself invites this heavier drama. Literally connecting people through both physical and emotional pain makes these more out-there dramatic scenarios not so crazy. Still, Chidori crying and ranting for an extended period can start to get overbearing rather than emotional.Kiznaiver also has trouble with some of its exposition. Namely, Nori’s background. Hisomu, Agata, and Nico (as well as the audience) get a big info-dump about what happened in the past near the end of the season. Arguably, it was all mysterious, so it had to happen later. But the delivery wasn’t exactly interesting.The premise itself can also seem hindered when, except for the first major mission, the Kizna system feels underutilized. Not much variety or intrigue is added to their predicaments beyond just putting them all together and seeing what happens.The show may even have an issue on a world-building front. This interesting city does not see much action or exploration beyond the Gomorin workers and that one bridge. But this detail (and perhaps the others) may be knit picking because, after all, the anime is not about the world let alone the city.Indeed, it’s about these eight (including Nori) group of kids.Their journey begins where almost all other stories about friendship start: as strangers. Some are timid, some are uncaring, some are trying to be acquaintances. The building exploding around them obviously adds tension and a fire under their butts, but this high-stakes ice breaker pushes them past that initial, awkward state and down the right path.Said path is filled with many events that bring them closer together. Chasing after a rogue Kiznaiver. Hanging out at a getaway lodge. Taking their picture in a crammed photo booth.Simultaneously, through their pain-sharing connection, the anime starts to explore its theme on friendship. They can no longer only think about their sinful selves. Instead, they must think about each other, about how the other feels when they hit their head or fall to the ground. To them, friendship is some ways off, but the anime argues (at this point) that a physical connection is what can get them there.As they do more with one another and start acting on their thoughts, the show transitions. In their hearts and in their souls, new bonds form. They argue. Feelings surface. Relationships break apart. In this way, the anime starts to question its original idea. That maybe it’s not a physical connection that binds friends together – but an emotional one.Yet one of its smartest writing moves comes after their literal mind-reading climax: The show chooses to end their Kiznaiver status. Rather than carry it through to the end of the season (the perhaps expected routed), the anime has them all return to their normal selves.Of course, they are in a worse state than they had been at the start. But this, once again, demonstrates the anime’s thematic exploration. For, now, it’s both the physical and the emotional that drives them towards one another. Holding hands and dancing around in the hallway. Empathy in regards to rejection. Concern and worry that aches their hearts for their dear friend.But it’s the last scene that demonstrates how thoughtful Kiznaiver is. Poetically enough, it’s on that bridge, now a metaphor for bridging the gap between each other. As Nori stands above the others, she wonders what it is that makes people friends, the same question that the show and the audience has been pondering this entire time.Who else but Maki steps up. She declares that they are all disparate and different from one another. That it doesn’t make any sense that they could or even should be buddies. But it’s precisely because they don’t understand each other that makes them friends. For that spurs them to understand. To communicate and to care and to connect.That is, it’s not a physical bond or an emotional chain that makes them friends – it’s understanding those two connections that does.So, sure, the anime’s overly heavy drama, the sometimes-awkward exposition, and even the Kizna system itself aren’t exactly positives. But its thoughts on friendships and connections, empathy and understanding, turn it into a story that is meaningful in direction and powerful in purpose.ANIMATIONKiznaiver’s visuals continue to prove the show’s strength.Especially the art. The backgrounds are very realistic, detailed in their depictions. Parks filled with trees. Apartments decked out in accessories. Dilapidated buildings coarse with cracks.However, the lighting elevates the prettiness of everything ten-fold. Sunlight cascades on far-open skies. Shadows dance on their faces during a stormy night. Red warning lights and blue computer screens add variety.Together, the lighting and the realism turn Kiznaiver into a powerhouse of artistry.Not to be outdone, the character designs are likewise strong. All of them are colorful. Purple, teal, and orange, mixed with reds, whites, and brown, add to their flair. Different accessories, like charms, glasses, and wrappings, give them personality. And each has their own look. Tenga is tall, a bit burly, and tough. Nico seems as if she came straight out of a circus act. Maki’s plain outfit contrasts well with everyone else and gives her an air of maturity.Going back to the colors, such symbolism is always worth noting since it highlights parts of the characters. Agata’s all-white hair and clothes represent how dilute he has become emotionally. Chidori’s red-centric design coincides with her optimistic attitude. And Hisomu’s lavender look evokes a sense of delicacy that fits his masochistic self.As for the actual animation, Kiznaiver does well here too. Early on, segments like the camera panning through the group as the Kizna system comes online demonstrates this sentiment well enough. That’s a more extreme case. But, even throughout the season, the characters are constantly running around, taking actions like jumping off bridges into traffic or attacking one another, and reacting in over-the-top fashion (especially Nico).CHARACTERSKiznaiver focuses on eight specific characters (listed approximately in order of appearance): Agata, Chidori, Tenga, Nico, Yuta, Maki, Nori, and Hisomu. Now, given the logistics, that there are only twelve episodes to investigate them all, it’s impossible for the anime to flesh them all out completely.Even so, the anime has trouble in this category.In terms of strong and weak, the cast is split down the middle. On the positive side sit Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata. On the negative side sit Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu.There’s almost no question that Maki is the best character the anime offers. In the beginning, she is standoffish, unwilling to cooperate with the others let alone try to befriend them. Coupled with her declaration that she “killed” someone, it puts her in a prime position to develop over the course of the season.And at that she does. While she continues to push back against the others, either by intimidating Yuta or giving the cold shoulder to Nico, her dark past comes to light. As one-half to the famous “Charles de Macking,” she and her best friend Ruru collaborated on a manga that became incredibly popular with the middle-school crowd. Unfortunately, Ruru’s feelings for Maki were ones that Maki did not want to respond to. When Ruru passed away from a fatal disease she always had, Maki blamed herself for shutting her friend away during her most dire time.But once she reads the final chapter of their manga, and she sees that the others are willing to (literally and figuratively) dive headfirst for her, she lightens up and finally becomes their friends.When they all go through their downward slump, Maki seems to go back to her former self, too. But, as her police-speaker speech reveals, she views them as her friends after all that has happened, signifying how far she has come. If nothing else, her having a romantic relationship with Yuta proves that she is not the same person that she was before.Chidori’s development isn’t as pronounced, but it is easily the harshest. While it is infuriating to see her continually try and fail to connect with Agata on a level beyond just friends, her role of disrupting the relationships (through the multi-love-interest angle that ensues) helps everyone involved. Including Chidori. For, taking part in the experiment, speaking her mind, and ultimately accepting her loss to Nori, she grows up and takes the first steps towards moving on.Nico manages to take a top-spot character-wise as well. But why? Compared to most of the characters (and what some of the lesser ones suffer from), not much is known about her besides her eccentricity and that she does not, in fact, see fairies.What she lacks in foundation, though, she makes up for (coincidentally enough) in spirit. She believes that “Friends are soy sauce! The omnipotent seasoning! Much better than sugar or salt!” Her affable personality, with her constant cheeriness and happiness, makes her an advocate of the anime’s main themes on friendship and understanding. That is, she views the others as her closest friends for no tangible reason other than they just are – and that’s perfectly okay.Agata is arguably the main protagonist of Kiznaiver. As an emotionless husk (which is just describing him and not putting him down), he feels no pain. At all. On both a physical and emotional level, he just exists as this guy who goes through life not really knowing who he is.Most of his time is spent thinking. He does his best to think about the other characters, the situation he is in, and, most importantly, himself. Meaning, for the most part, he does not actually have much of an impact on the events at hand.That said, his connection with Nori and being one of the original Kiznaivers gives him some clout as a character. Not a lot and not surprising, but it is cool to see this twist with him later in the season.At the very least, his emotional cry when meeting his friends from the past and his words towards Nori as he attempts to save her near the end of the series demonstrate, however slightly, his change as a person.Again, Agata’s change is nothing spectacular. It may even be considered too small to outweigh his overall low impact. But unlike Maki who starts at the bottom, and unlike Nico who starts at the top, Agata starts in the middle. Neither mean nor nice, neither not-friends nor friends. So, his miniscule step forward is, for him, something positive.Those four – Maki, Chidori, Nico, and Agata – are the strongest characters in the show. On the opposite end are the other four: Nori, Yuta, Tenga, and Hisomu.Nori is purposefully surrounded in mystery very early on. Her words on connections and her general air of mystique make it difficult to comprehend what it is she exactly wants. Furthermore, she’s not often around. While the other seven cooperate, she is understandably controlling events on the side.Sadly, this pigeonholing leads to a lack of focus on her character. It’s obvious that she knew Agata or, at the minimum, was related to him in some form. But the anime’s rushed attempts at providing her some backstory or trying to explain away the pain she has sealed away leave her character in a confusing, messy state.As for the other three, they simply follow in Nori’s footsteps but to a much greater degree. In other words, the anime does not have much of a place for them in the story let alone for them individually.Yuta hardly receives any time for himself, and, even when he is involved, it’s either for the brunt of a joke or all the attention goes to Maki. He at least moves away from his arrogant-jerk status, so it’s not as if he fails as a character.Tenga is a cool guy, protecting Agata and looking after Chidori. But, beyond his crush on Chidori and being the only one capable of taking on their adversaries, the show doesn’t spend much time on him.Hisomu has it the worst, though. After his recruitment episode near the beginning of the season, he does not do or say much outside of loving pain.But perhaps the biggest fault with the cast is not on an individual scale.Some of the characters have clear relationships. Agata and Chidori, Maki and Yuta. Yet a lot of them don’t. How many times does Hisomu interact with the others? Do Yuta and Nico have any memorable moments together? What about Chidori and Maki? Nori and anybody else besides Agata?Another way to put it, the anime does not do enough to bolster their group dynamic. The story’s themes on friendship and understanding are clearly there. But, when they themselves are not equalized in their relationships, it almost goes against the show’s own ideas.One last note. The characters and their “sins.” Nori describes each of them with a sin in mind – sloth, greed, etc. – but the anime does not fully explore this idea. A mistake, given how much emphasis it gained near the beginning of the story.SOUNDWithout a doubt, Kiznaiver’s strongest musical component is its opening track. In all honesty, it’s not very involved. Possibly nearing repetition. But that simplicity gives it strength. The triumphant tone, the “lay your hands on me” lyric, and the feeling of friendship permeate the piece. It’s both fun and fitting – a winning combination.Voice acting comes next. Everyone involved with the project does well in their respective roles, especially Misaki Kuno as Nico, Yuka Terasaki as Chidori, and Tomoaki Maeno as Tenga. Nico’s high-pitched voice, Chidori’s emotional range, and Tenga’s upbeat attitude were only possible thanks to the VAs’ strong performances.The ending track isn’t anything particularly special, but it does have its merits. The strumming guitar that leads into the prominent piano, combined with the vocalist’s ever-so-slightly emotional singing, creates a bittersweet tone. Said tone follows a handful of the relationships within the show itself: Romance does not blossom, but friendship stays forever. (An idea reinforced by the all the girls appearing in the ED’s visuals with flowers in hand.)The original soundtrack does not have anything outside of the standard offerings. Funky, techno beats for the slice-of-life events and melancholic, violin ensembles for the dramatic ones. Not that it’s used with poor timing or anything similarly negative, but the OST does not stand out in any notable or positive fashion either.Finally, the Kizna-system sound-effect. The electric, computerized sound that played whenever the group shared their pain always sounded like it hurt.ENJOYMENTMany know that I am big on themes.

The way the characters essentially jumped out of the screen and beckoned for attention left such an impression on me that I actually cited it as my favorite show of all time for a little while. What I didn\'t know at the time, however, was that the mastermind behind the series, Hiroyuki Imaishi, would go on to form Studio Trigger several years later and, as many fans of the studio say, ""save...anime."" And while I don\'t necessarily believe that anime needs ""saving"", I believe it\'s pretty easy to say that Trigger has definitely established a name for themselves. After completing Kiznaiver, I can understand why.Kiznaiver follows the lives of a group of teenagers that are thrust into an experiment in which all of them become connected by an implant known as the ""Kizuna"" system (Kizuna meaning ""bond"" in Japanese). Following the implant, our protagonists are told that any pain any of them receive from this point on will be evenly distributed amongst the entire group. Obviously, the teens take turns freaking out but ultimately accept their fate. I mean, how long can this possibly last? It\'s just an experiment, right?Well, as things progress, the Kizuna project begins to look a little too in-depth to be considered ""Just an experiment"". The pain that everyone shares, which is purely physical at first, snowballs into a system that connects not only their nerves but their hearts and minds as well. Not only can the group feel each other\'s physical pain now, they can feel each other\'s, well...feelings. This creates an atmosphere in which each individual is afraid of even thinking, let alone doing anything harmful. As interesting as that sounds, the real beauty of Kiznaiver lies in the after-effects this implant system has on the group.Each member selected for the experiment is vastly different from the next -- each being specific embodiments of anime tropes or stereotypes (Interesting fact: Each member actually represents one of the Seven Deadly Sins). Having these completely different people thrown into a singular group and forced to cooperate with each other is obviously going to have its ups and downs. Despite that, many of the characters find ways to look past their differences and form their own unique bond, separate from their forced one. This bond, however, winds up unintentionally amplifying anything that the Kizuna system forces on them, resulting in a giant mess of emotions easily visible to themselves and us viewers.THIS PARAGRAPH IS SPOILER HEAVY. As the series progresses, we begin to uncover more secrets of the Kiznaiver experiment. Sonozaki Noriko, the girl who acts as the figurehead for our protagonists\' Kizuna group, is actually an experiment herself. In fact, she and Katsuhira have their own unique Kizuna that leaves long-lasting impressions on both of them. Basically, Sonozaki was selected to carry the burden of everyone else in the original Kiznaiver group, which was comprised of children given up by members of the lab. What this essentially means is that Sonozaki was feeling the pain of around twelve children at once, while none of them felt anything. And, as if that wasn\'t enough, the system amplified itself within her and could only be subdued by large doses of drugs that had to be administered to her nearly 24/7. The end result was Sonozaki becoming almost as much of a zombie as the other kids, who were left with no original emotions of their own.Katsuhira, also being an original child, has not felt anything in years. But, as his Kizuna system with his new ""friends"" begins to dissolve, those feelings come rushing back. Little by little, he remembers what it\'s like to be alive; he remembers all of his old friends. In fact, he even visits them in one of the last few episodes and goes on to create possibly the most emotional moment of the show when he realizes that they\'ve become more like dolls than actual humans.Following several group-disbanding fights, our characters must fight battles with themselves in order to determine what exactly they want to do from this point on. However, these battles aren\'t easily fought as each of them still have residual pain from the experiment left over. Eventually, they all meet up again and, after a few more fights, it is revealed that this pain is actually not from the experiment at all -- it\'s the pain of actually being connected to one another. The experiment was a success in that manner, considering that each body remained linked in a unique and personal way.Kiznaiver teaches us a lot about friendship, bonding, and free will. It demonstrates that forced friendships are nothing more than artificial, worthless creations while, at the same time, showing us that sometimes you can find beauty in unexpected places. Even though our characters were unlikely candidates for friends, they wind up becoming just that. It shows us a lot about how being judgemental can tear something apart before it even begins and, honestly, it\'s really beautiful. The characters were so well fleshed out that their relationships seem to parallel real-world friendships and romances. It becomes nearly impossible to root against any of them.Kiznaiver teaches us that even in our darkest moments, there is still light. It\'s just that sometimes you might need a little help finding it.In Summary:Trigger demonstrates that they\'re more than just good looks and comedy in this well-written and incredibly beautiful original series. Kiznaiver utilizes a realistic, intimate cast in order to lure the viewer into a fall sense of security that may just wind up tearing them apart from the inside out. With themes and lessons that parallel real-world friendships and what it\'s like to be miserable, it\'s quite hard to not take something away from this series. Don\'t watch this with a friend, as you will be compelled to awkwardly hug one another after it\'s over. Kiznaiver is a fantastic anime that shows us the true meaning of friendship while still having time to remind us of what it means to be alive. anime.""

The experiment was a success in that manner, considering that each body remained linked in a unique and personal way.Kiznaiver teaches us a lot about friendship, bonding, and free will. It demonstrates that forced friendships are nothing more than artificial, worthless creations while, at the same time, showing us that sometimes you can find beauty in unexpected places. Even though our characters were unlikely candidates for friends, they wind up becoming just that. It shows us a lot about how being judgemental can tear something apart before it even begins and, honestly, it\'s really beautiful. The characters were so well fleshed out that their relationships seem to parallel real-world friendships and romances. It becomes nearly impossible to root against any of them.Kiznaiver teaches us that even in our darkest moments, there is still light. It\'s just that sometimes you might need a little help finding it.In Summary:Trigger demonstrates that they\'re more than just good looks and comedy in this well-written and incredibly beautiful original series. Kiznaiver utilizes a realistic, intimate cast in order to lure the viewer into a fall sense of security that may just wind up tearing them apart from the inside out. With themes and lessons that parallel real-world friendships and what it\'s like to be miserable, it\'s quite hard to not take something away from this series. Don\'t watch this with a friend, as you will be compelled to awkwardly hug one another after it\'s over. Kiznaiver is a fantastic anime that shows us the true meaning of friendship while still having time to remind us of what it means to be alive.', 'This will be a short review from after just finishing this anime. The following is a copy/paste comment of my immediate feelings following the final episode.I got so into the characters. They were all unique and felt so real. All the ugly and beautiful aspects of human beings. The theme on friendship and the systematic connection of physically and emotional feelings. Very nicely done anime. That ending was the icing on the cake. Character 10/10. Music 10/10. Art 10/10. Ship Complete! 10/10.The only con I had was only the reasoning I had at the beginning of watching these episodes and questioning the system, logic, and...immoral aspect but if I just take it all with a grain of salt and just watch the anime. It will be a fun ride. immoral aspect but if I just take it all with a grain of salt and just watch the anime.

If you've made it this far into my review I would like to take the time and wish you a good day and a good night. However even now I am still lacking characters which cannot be said for the show, they were pretty decent, not the best but I mean given Trigger's and Gainax's history they were pretty solid. Same goes for...the story line, it was pretty typical Trigger with some weird story, but unlike with other shit anime like Kill la Kill, it was actually quite good. the story line, it was pretty typical Trigger with some weird story, but unlike with other shit anime like Kill la Kill, it was actually quite good."", ""This is one of those mindfucking animes (excues my french) the art is mindblowing, and the story is FENOMINAL.

That story is just so.... orginial.This anime is truly beautiful, I sure did get a little confused at some parts, but that's okay (I hope?). I love this anime, mostly because it's so emotional, it's so deep and...... just HUMANS MAN. I freaking loved the art, it was so beautiful,...and don't even get me started on the intro and outro.

Sadly, the 2 last episode leave a sour taste in my mouth.Let\'s start with the good stuff out of the way...The story\'s pretty great, playing around with the connection of friendship. It\'s a pretty great concept with a mix of ""TRIGGER"" magic actually makes a pretty decent and engaging story.Art, great. Not really surprised with the art style and it really makes watching it pretty nice. It somehow makes me fall in love with both the environment and characters.Character, lovable. Interesting...back story. Amazing development of characters. Romance is a bit of a stretch, but still keeps you on edge.Sadly, the last 2 episode seems to make it went from 100 to HOLY SHIT DAFUQ YOU DOING SENPAI, PLEASE STOP real quick.

It's very original and the foreshadowing is pretty cool.Story (10/10)So far, it seems, that the story will have you hooked. You want to know more and more, every episode. That's how I felt. I was happy I was able to watch it straight, instead of having to wait for a new episode weekly so I could get my fix, instantly. I'm pretty sure it will have the same outcome on most people.

You could predict the ending at around episode 10, and it was parly cliché, though the ending was still very good nonetheless!Art: 8,5/10Don't get me wrong, the art is very good!

What a masterpiece! Bless Trigger for taking on these kind of deep stories!It's sad to see people in the comment getting butthurt over the ships. This isn't you average drama-bestgirl-wifu shit.The story is very well written and focused on emotions and emotional pain. That's some advanced stuff most people are not mature enough to understand.I love how well they did the character development.

I\'m honestly impressed. Are you feeling alright Trigger?The first time I read the plot in the anime chart and saw the animation studio my first reaction was ""Oh God, it\'s those idiots again."" But I guess everyone deserves a fifth chance, because honestly the anime turned out pretty amazing.In a futuristic city of Youdon\'trememberland, the protagonist Katsuhira lives a relatively uneventful life of being continuously beat up and bullied away from his money. He does not react to this however, because he is physically completely immune to pain. It\'s not that he\'s trained to ignore it or something, he physically has no sense of...pain whatsoever. His lack of pain has also apparently numbed out all his other feelings as well, with him usually showing no reaction whatsoever. Along with him is his ever-whining friend/potential love-interest/annoying red-head, Raikiri. She spends the majority of her time criticizing him, which will quickly make the viewer hate her, but moving on:SPOILERSA mysterious girl, Noriko, traps the two, along with a few other characters with a ""Kizna"" (literally: pain) mark, inserted to their bodies through surgery. This mark links all their pain senses together, making the pain (both physical and emotional) of one being felt by the others as well. This only goes 1 direction for Katsuhira though, since he is completely oblivious to the pain of others as well. I do not want to spoil too much here since this is something that you should watch for yourself, but the Kizna mark keeps strengthening over time, starting to link way more than just their sense of pain, slowly breaking them. Also needed to be mentioned, Noriko seems to have some connection to Katsuhira, who seems overly emotional and caring when it comes to her, despite it being her fault that they\'re all in this situation. This often enrages Raikiri of course.Really, it\'s an anime mainly focused on drama. It does not exactly present any grand philosophical questions, but rather just shows the character development of the people. That said, there are some problems with the characters themselves. Katsuhira comes off as strangely sympathetic, and I get the feeling that the show was actually going for the opposite of that so they could redempt him in the final episodes. Same goes for Noriko, who acts like a bitch for the most part but for some reason you instantly like. The revelations in the final episodes of course confirm those feelings. Other characters on the other hand fail though. Both Tenga and Raikiri come off as unintentionally annoying, especially in the red-head\'s case (:P). Actually let me persist on that.The red-head female lead is F@CKING AWFUL. She cannot make up her mind, is overly judgmental of businesses she has no place sticking her nose into and basically subtly bullies the protagonist into romancing her, while enforcing her standards on him. While Noriko acts like a bitch and oppressively, you know that deep down she\'s just a tortured soul, captain B!TCH over here constantly ACTS like a victim just to grab people\'s attention, while pretending to be the leading force that cares about the rest of the group. You know, as I write this I am reminded of Lori from The Walking Dead. Yeah, THAT bad. My favourite being when she\'s throwing a tantrum because Katsuhira hugged Noriko after a mental breakdown, wishes for him to hug her as well and the rest of the group practically bullies Katsuhira into complying despite he himself having absolutely no desire for that whatsoever. And when he does it THE B!TCH STARTS COMPLAINING AGAIN. Aaaargh! ""Hey Rick, I want you to kill Shane. Oh my god! Why did you kill Shane? You\'re a monster!"" You hypocritical, manipulative, drama-queen B!TCH! And they\'re trying to show her as SYMPATHETIC.CONTINUATION:Ok so what you read above was the original review when 11 episodes were released. The review was taken down because I hadn\'t received the complete anime experience or something (I think the mods around here take down reviews based on Darts games), so here are all the important details from the last episode, obviously spoilers:-.............Aaaaaand I got nothing.

The premise was interesting and unique. I really enjoy psychological aspects of anime and this one really intrigued me, especially around the time when they began to connect emotionally instead of just physically. It appealled to something I strongly believe in which is that people really don't know how to connect emotionally with others, even if they're family or friends. This anime was incredibly unique in it's story and brought about some interesting questions about aspects...of society that are rarely outwardly acknowledged. Not to mention the animation is very nice, and it has a really cool opening.

In Kill la Kill they discussed feminism and societal corruption within capitalist systems, which they did wonderfully, and the story was obviously thought...through very thoroughly, however this time with Kiznaiver they spoke of teens emotions, and  although all of the studio's members were obviously once teens, I don't think any of them ever experienced growing up with Autism, nor did they contact anyone who did to try and understand it better.SOOOO the basic plot of Kiznaiver is seven students becoming connected in order to TEACH the characters Sonozaki Nori and Katsuhira about how to PROPERLY SHOW THEIR EMOTIONS AND INTERACT WITH OTHERS. Although the other characters don't share their emotions with others properly either, so the whole thing just becomes a learning experience for all of the teens on how to properly interact with others and deal with their sin. Yes they call it sin. Each character has something in their past that makes them act a certain way around others, that gets in the way of them properly interacting with others, and Trigger decided to call it that character's sin. So basically Trigger thinks that anything that gets in the way of people interacting with others must be something freaky in their past, that is JUST IN THEIR PAST, and that they should just GET OVER IT.OOOooh you were born DIFFERENT and sent to a lab to be lab rats.

Oh its still concurrent, like anytime you accidentally show emotion in public, you look up to see someone near by that you either don't know, or is a classmate that you have to see everyday looking at you like there is and always will be something wrong with you that you can't fix?) GET OVER IT. And if you don't? well... You look like those vegetable kids that can't like think, in our opinion.OOOooh you were fat as a child! you still feel ugly and insecure about yourself, and act a certain way because you think it will make people like you better, oh... are we trying to get you to do the exact same thing by telling you you need to act more smiley and social and interact with others as if you were happy.

At least their not suicidal... and EMO!Overall Kiznaiver wasn't a complete waste of time because of the animation and it's worth it's bit in humor as well , I just didn't like it too much, and I don't think anybody who was remotely similar to any of the characters at any point in their life would enjoy being made fun of in this way either."", ""Only read this if you actually watched the whole animation.Some of my review might give a little spoils.I watched the whole anime in this day, and woah,I'm seriously disappointed at the CLIMAX of Nori-chan and Agata.The climax didn't have that much impact to me, its very good but I'm UNSATISFIED.Then the ending is somewhat disappointing because I don't know...or is it because I didn't saw Agata and Noriko k***e*?!I think that was it!!!and the one of the reason why is that they didn't Animated all of the 19 kids and just a few of them.I didn't feel any emotion when they were talking...about the children 12 years ago (in the sound actors/actress voice) it just didn't feel completely emotional to me.Tsuguhito Yuta is fat when he was a kid and that's that, the background topic is not so emotionalHonoka Maki, this is where I really come crying like YEAH!!!Yoshiharu Hisomu, I loved this guy when he was introduced with a BIG MOANNico Niiyama, her background story is too unrealictic or should I say shes too childish when she talked about reasoning about her fairies...Hajime Tenga, I like this dude when he rumbled with those extras that was bullying someone. and splitting the money by a certain percentage became higher later.Chidori Takashiro, when I first saw her in at first, I totally liked her Dere~ attitude and the moment she came looking for support in her love life, this is when I came to like her cuteness even more.Katsuhira Agata, this wonderful MC is too much to bear even for me. He slightly fulfilled his role as an emotionless guy. but he was very good at the climax.Noriko Sonozaki, the moment I saw her. I know for sure that she is the Teen Version of Esdeath in Akame ga Kill. but her mature personality lacks something I don't know the term for it.

Its just very colorful and beautiful, like, everything, but mostly the characters. And this show is all about them.The show starts with a lot of mystery. Who are these people? How were they pick? Whats this big project all about? All this gets eventually answered, but the show is all about character development, their relations and the drama built among them. You can expect some very touching moments. You get to eventually know and like every character but the MC, which i cant explain he is ""like that"" without spoilling.The...initial mystery and somehow comedy scenario is slowly replaced byt a suffocating, yeat pleasure to watch drama. Liked Kokoro Connect? It feels A LOT like that. I would love a second season, focused on their relations, but it seems unlikely to happen.Overall, and intense and enjoyable show. initial mystery and somehow comedy scenario is slowly replaced byt a suffocating, yeat pleasure to watch drama.

The story is quite simple, a group of seven persons with completely different traits are bound together by the Kizna Project and they become Kiznaivers. The Kizna project is very simple each one of the members shares the pain they receive as equal because of a wound that was inserted into each one of them. If you expect an anime about action packed scenes / and a very complex story. Then you might consider not...watching the anime. Now even if the anime focuses on relationships and characters this is not a excuse if it has a lack of a solid story, and in Kiznaiver this is not the case because even if its lacking in some aspects its still decent enough to catch your attention. They way Kiznaivers choose the seven characters is quite simple, each one of them has a quality known as ""the modern seven sins"", Although this part is not well explained, each of the chosen ones represent the so called theory of the modern sins.The Story:  7/10So as my last paragraph just stated, this anime has a very unique story but it definitively could had been done way better. The idea it uses is based on the 7 sins, which are Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy and Pride. Most of them still apply on a daily basis but the anime decides to ""update"" them, as in modernize it. The characters apparently portray what is called the modern sins. Which ill talk later on the character section. So overall the story brings out an interesting idea which is the modern sins. I already explained the Kizna system, and the purpose which I forgot to mention is the Kizna system is made so everyone can understand each other and by that it could bring peace to the world since they would all feel the same way. Now the reasons of ""to save the world"" is very clitcheish so in that sense the story took a generic approach.The Characters: 8/10So, each member represents a sin, so the characters are all completely different. None of them share similar traits and they way they are portrayed are all over the top for the sake of exaggerating so called ""sins"". Now, this might backlash if the anime fails to demonstrate and explain each character and if by mid season you feel no connection to the cast then the show failed completely. One thing I realized is that most modern sins have no actual correlation with the original sins which kinda ruins the whole idea.Katsuhira Agata aka Kacchon:He is the main protagonist, He represents the modern sin of ""The Gudon"" (The Imbecile). He is a gloomy person who barely shows any affection to others. He has a special trait, which has nothing to do with his sin, which is that he cant feel pain at all. Since he cant feel pain, that makes him develop a cold personality and its shown that for him is really difficult to have friendly relationships with other because he lacks of personality. His cold personality later takes a big part of the Kizn Project.Chidori Takashiro:Female protagonist, She represents the modern sin of ""Goody Two-Shoes"" which means that is a person who tries to be as good or clean as it can humanly be possible. She has a love interest for Kacchon and is shown since episode 1. She and Kacchon are childhood friends. Aside from her romantic feelings to Kacchon, she is just an over the top person who is very caring about others and often places his friends over herself.Hajime Tenga:he is the ""Muscle-Headed Thug"" which is portrayed as the delinquent who always prefers to take the problems up front rather than run away.Honoka Maki:She is considered the ""High and Might"" sin, which means that is the person who believes she is over everyone and no one is at her level.Tsuguhito Yuta:He is the ""The Cunning Normal"", Is the one who places alot of emphasis on the way he looks, and hate when someone does not recognize his appearance.Nico Niiyama:She is the ""Eccentric Headcase"" She is like the comedic relief of the series, She energetic and positive, acts immature.Yoshiharu Hisomu:The ""Immoral"", He is the weirdo in the group, he has a similar personality as Nico, He is childish around her but acts mature when needed.Sonozaki:A emotionless, cold girl who is the leader of the Kizna System, and works as the host of the 7 protagonists.Sound: 8/10The Opening song is called, Lay Your Hands On Me and is done by the group BOOM BOOM SATELLITES. Its an amazing song, really catchy and takes the attention of the viewer really fast. As for the Ending song, called Hajimari no Sokudo by Sangatsu no Phantasia. Aside from the opening and ending, the soundtrack of Kiznaiver is not very memorable, Its mostly the opening that attracts the viewer.Art: 8/10Based Trigger delivering, Each character has a unique way of looking, they are really distinguishable from one another. The backgrounds and overall scenery is really great and amazing. Its really different from your typical modern anime look.Enjoyment 9/10:I believe this is where my positive review comes from, Kiznaiver sets a goal and eventually completes it. The characters are likeable and completely unique in their own way. As a fan of drama, I personally loved the series and go as far to say its probably one of the best anime this season. While is far away from a masterpiece, I believe Kiznaiver delivers and is executed correctly.And for the lazy fucks out there:TL;DR: The anime is has somewhat lack of good story, but its complemented by the good characters which is what the anime is mainly focused. By no means the story is bad, but it definitely could have improved in multiple ways. 8/10 as in is definitely good and ill recommend it. Its unique in its own way, and even tho the whole concept has already been done (Kokoro Connect), its not that similar.Please give me feedback since this is one of my first reviews. Any type of feedback (good/negative) is heavily appreciated. Thank you! watching the anime.

Maybe there are not enought episodes, it's a little short the anime, and with this amazing story, they could do more episodes or a second season, because the feels that makes the last episodes are: This is not the end, I'm sure, they will do more episodes.But saddenly, not. Maybe in a future, they will change their minds and start a second season, or maybe not, maybe we need to imagine our own end for this anime.The only thing that I don't like about the anime, was the...speed of the story: The problems was forced for this continued speed and the same when the problems are solved. All was fast.But it's an emotional anime of course, I cried so many times watching this anime, for this reason, I want second season.Sorry if it's dificult to understand my review, I'm a spanish fan, so, I tried to write english without mistakes. speed of the story: The problems was forced for this continued speed and the same when the problems are solved.

While others might have found the plot a bit too strange or the reasoning for this flimsy, I was able to suspend my disbelief and really get into the show.However... Despite this rather positive introduction, this show only received a 7/10. This is mainly because I felt like the series strayed too far later on. Let me elaborate:While I was watching the first 7 episodes, I was enjoying the show immensely and I was certain that if the show kept going like this then it'll get a 10/10 from me. However...episode 8 onward seemed to take the show in a completely new direction which I felt only hurt the show. The main cast (with the exception of our main character Katsuhira) and even the main premise took a backseat to following a major side character (at least, I consider them a side character) and their backstory. I feel like this overall hurts the show as some of the main characters are really left under-explored (1 character especially).While the 2nd half wasn't bad, it definitely felt like the show peaks at episode 6/7 and only goes downward afterwards. However what is consistent is the beautiful art and animation! Most of the character's designs look great and the way they're animated gives each character their own flair as they move and interact with each other. Speaking of the characters, a lot of them are rather well done. There seems to be a lot of criticism towards the characters however while I do feel like Nico and Tenga were under-explored, I feel like (with the exception of 1 character) most of the main cast developed enough or had enough characterization that I was invested in them from the beginning, even Katsuhira while he came off as fundamentally uninteresting, which I feel is deliberate, he has this aura of mystery surrounding him as well as his interacts with others kept me interested in him from the beginning.While I do think the story taking a dive in the second half is the biggest issue the show had, I felt like there was another major issue in the form of Hisome. Hisome was a character with a lot of potential and I thought he was going to be one of the majorly explored characters especially with some of the hinting early on, however he ended up being the most under-developed character who just didn't seem to fit into the story and generally just came across like he shouldn't be in the show. I do feel like he had an occasional good scene or two, he did not have enough to justify his existence in this anime and I feel like it would have been really easy to do so.However despite this, I'm still giving the show a 7 which is a Strong 7 to a light 8 because I really did enjoy this show. Episode 1-7 are still 10/10 in my books and even though I felt the story dived afterwards, I still enjoyed the ride. The show is solid and at least deserves to be checked out but it could easily not be someone's cup of tea especially with the sheer amount of melodrama in this and not melodrama as a negative buzzword but melodrama has a genre which this is probably one of the best in terms of being a melodrama. If you're into that genre, you're likely to enjoy this show as well. episode 8 onward seemed to take the show in a completely new direction which I felt only hurt the show.

Nevertheless it is still another generic anime about making friends, but with an interesting plot which gives this anime in particular an upper hand on others.Some aspects of this show are so enjoyable at times knowing when to be comedic and serious, there is a good balance between the seriousness of the show and the lighthearted feeling of the show, which makes it a good anime to watch either alone or with friends.This beautifully drawn show is easily recommendable to anyone who appreciates a decent plot, memorable characters, comedy and amazing...artwork.Ever wondered what it would feel like to be in someone else\'s shoes? Feel the pain which they feel? Kiznaivers shows this in such a unique way, by connecting 6 completely different characters and one such person who feels no physical nor emotional pain, which is an intriguing aspect of the show.Story 6/10This is one of the strengths and weakness of Kiznaivers, a unique characteristic of the show, but the writing and execution could\'ve been improved in a vast amount of areas.Much of the plot is obvious from the start, and it seems extraordinarily interesting to begin with, but it turns out slightly disappointing as there isn\'t much progression in the plot which is one of its weaknesses, you end up expecting more about the ""Kizna System"" but end up with barely a handful. The plot is also somewhat generic putting antisocial characters together and seeing how they progress.What\'s very likeable indeed is the way the characters are put together through distress. on the other hand it should\'ve been implemented further and in better ways.Sound 10/10Flawless. The OSTs, the voice acting, and the OP and ED are a musical marvel.Art 10/10Flawless, one of the very strong stubborn aspects, the art and each character design is so unique to any other anime I could think of which is one of the main reasons for driving me to write this review. The characters and scenery are beautifully drawn and the OP pulls you in into the kizna world.Character 6/10One of the pros and yet again flaws of the show. We are given 6 blank canvases to watch how they develop or given back story on. Yet the anime turns up with very little information on each character (other than their ""dark secrets""). And One character (Hisomu) is not developed at all, he\'s literally there for no reason, other than the one or two comedic scenes. He was a blank canvas and they could\'ve given him an amazing backstory, instead they just allowed him in the background.The good aspects though were the characters which were developed and feel like they\'re ""complete""(such as Kotaru at the end of the show). I honestly loved how the show put together 7 completely incompatible and unique characters together, each character is memorable and everyone can find themselves in at least on of the characters.Enjoyment 9/10By overlooking some minor flaws in such a pristine anime makes this very enjoyable to watch.What is also interesting is seeing the progression of putting these incompatible characters together and then the show experiments on their friendship and development through the series.What I certainly enjoyed about the series were the ships I would discuss with my fellow anime fans, that just makes it interesting, it\'s certainly a show you can watch with others, discussing which character you can closely relate to or which ship you prefer for each character. The story combined with the visuals certainly allow this anime to be enjoyed to a very high extent.Overall 8/10+Visuals+Sound/Voice Acting/OP and ED+Original Story+Character Development+ Amazing Drama/Romance+ Very enjoyable relaxing anime to watch+ Unique Characters- Somewhat Generic- Lame Writing for Said Characters- Background info missing- Plot drops off- Had more potentialVerdict:Very likeable anime, Generic although containing unique aspects. artwork.Ever wondered what it would feel like to be in someone else\'s shoes?

Those are basically the words I’d use to describe Kiznaiver.It started off very strongly. Katsuhira’s backstory was intriguing, Chidori was a really strong portrayal of a good ‘childhood friend’ trope, Tenga was the obligatory loudmouthed yet kindhearted character, Nico was the quirky but fun to watch one, and Maki was just overall brilliant as well as probably the best developed character in the series. Liked most of the characters initially. Hiromi annoyed me slightly but did add amusement to the anime – putting a character with his particular tastes into a group like theirs was pretty funny to watch.I...couldn’t really get behind Sonozaki’s character (especially in the last few episodes), and found Yuta bland and forgettable.  Their characters weren’t badly done exactly – Sonozaki did actually add quite a lot to the interactions between the rest of the cast – but for some reason I just really didn’t like her. I also felt that Chidori’s character deteriorated somewhere around the middle of the series until she was basically one-dimensional, but this did get fixed near the end.The premise was really original – totally unrealistic, but interesting all the same. The concept of feeling each other’s’ pain was clever and creatively executed. Good way to add drama without it feeling forced. Made me think quite a lot.Awesome op, nice ed too. Liked the music overall, and the art and animation were fabulous. Seiyuus were great.The plot was really riveting until the final few episodes, which were kind of a let-down, to be honest. The last 3 eps felt poorly written and rushed; they did ruin the anime a bit for me. However the closing few minutes managed to redeem it - they were sweet and heart-warming and at least gave the anime a good send off in its final moments.Altogether, I enjoyed it.

A quick, quirky and entertaining watch.', ""i started this series with almost no expectations. synopsis seemed interesting enough but tbh i was wondering if it would be one of those shows that'll just crash and burn or i'll roll my eyes till they fall off my head.so i was pleasantly surprised to find myself enjoying it as the series progressed, especially from maki's arc onwards. i think what really made me like the show are the characters. not sure why some people say they're cliched bc i find them an interesting bunch. some of them are unique, some of them are realistic portrayals of how teenagers act..and the emotionless ones aren't...just emotionless. (maki has the best lines and nico is best girl, so pure and lovely)the plot's ok. there were some raise-eyebrows-are-u-sure bits but there were also plenty hit-you-in-the-feels moments so they balance out i guess. i found the last ep a little bit lacking though (plotwise). not sure if it's just me but the plot lost me a little towards the end. i mean, it made enough sense but there wasn't that boom oh man this is darn good, that kinda thing.in general, it was enjoyable for me because i liked the characters and their banter, there were humourous moments, a few nice scenes that made me tear up a little and of course, some pretty intense parts as well. a lot of people have praised the art -- it looks easy on the eye and the colours are pretty, an added bonus. music goes well too. so yeah, give it a go. just emotionless.

The main characters development especially with the other characters in the anime is incredible. Through out the story him and 6 other teens in his class are tasked to do what they are told in order to ""connect"". As the teens go through out the story they progress in the connections and bonds. A lot happens throughout the story and towards the end you find out about the past of the main character. The story starts off a bit slow but then progresses into a full on sprint in the end then it suddenly just slows down allllll the way...again then picks up which with the story worked well. About 3/4ths in i was starting to feel heart break after heart break and with in the few last episodes there is a bundle of emotions. As someone who isn\'t easily moved by things whether is heat break or over excitement, especially when it comes to non real life situations or things, I give this anime an over all 10. If i feel any heart moving emotions over an anime its and instant 10 for me. Being i\'ve watched over 160 anime and about 60+ days worth of time I have only been moved by about 5-7 anime and even then only 1-3 moved me as much as this one did. the last two episodes had my emotions spiking and the whole anime had me hooked to the point where I had to watch the whole thing in one sitting which isn\'t too rare for me like the heart moving part is. One thing I think should be addressed is that this anime has quite a bit of romance in it although there isn\'t officially any romance going on until the end and there definitely isn\'t any real relationship type material until the very end i think it could of scrapped by with the romance category just because of the fact that it is strongly based on love the two major plot points have to do with love and each other\'s feelings, and in the end there is about 5 minutes or more of real romance material which is tied in from the character development through out the story. I would recommend this highly to anyone who enjoys anime about a group of people developing together and facing past traumas and experiences together. Overall a great anime. again then picks up which with the story worked well.

Overall a great anime.', 'I have to say, Kiznaiver is very unique just like most of Studio Trigger’s shows. From the art style to the story and characters, all of it is so different and it is a breath of fresh air in the anime world. Although one thing to not about this series is that is not for everyone in my opinion. If you are one person who is looking for action here, you won’t find it; it’s just pain, sorrow, and a lot of drama and relationships.Story: 8/10Kiznaiver’s story focuses around 6 teenagers who are abducted and have their pain connected to each other. They become...testers of the Kizna system which was trying to bring world peace. Now this story is just great overall. Trigger still is able to tell a unique story and have it be interesting for most of the time. Now it was a bit slow in the beginning episodes and it was kind of boring there but the latter episodes are probably some of the best I’ve seen in a while. Although the story gets sort of confusing sometimes and some things may not make any sense, it is still a great story that focuses on the characters and their desires. The story itself excels at drama related moments and pulls them off so well. The problem other viewers may have with the story though is the melodrama of this story. There is a lot of it and it succeeds in pulling your heart. The show is mostly dialogue like the Monogatari Series with minimal fight scenes. It also includes some romance and that romance is good. I’m honestly surprised that is not on the genre tags. Overall, if you enjoy you dialogue, melodrama, and romance, then this story will appeal to you.Art: 9/10Studio Trigger yet again gives us a very interesting art style. Although some people may not like it, I personally love it. It’s so refreshing to see it compared to the one used in most shows today. Everything is well animated and set piece design is just amazing. Everything is detailed and it is absolutely beautiful. I wish I could call this a masterpiece of art but Studio Ufotable has shown me that there is better art out there, especially with the Kara no Kyoukai series.Sound: 8/10“LAY YOUR HANDS ON ME” is a great Opening by BOOM BOOM SATELLITES. With great animation and unique song that isn’t normally heard, it definitely makes for a memorable OP. The ending, “Hajimari no Sokudo” by Sangatsu no Phantasia is also a great ending song that fits with the ending of the series. The OST is great and helps out a lot during the melodrama moments.Characters: 9/10Kiznaiver presents us with some great characters. All of them are interesting in their own way and showed us great development over the course of the series. From the relationship development to the development of each character’s personalities, traits, and feeling, I feel that Kiznaiver’s writers should be commended for making such great characters. Their designs are all unique and the pain they experience is something that the writers tap into and expand on. Most of them are interesting from Katsuhira who cannot feel pain to Chidori who loves him, Sonozaki who is the mastermind behind the experiment, Niko the cute and adorable character that is like Mako for anybody who watched Kill la Kill, Tsuguhito, the guy who nobody really cares about, Tenga, the bully turned into more of a good guy, and finally Honoka, the one with probably one of the most tragic backstories in the series. As much as I want to continue on talking about the characters, I would venture into spoiler territory so you’ll have to watch it if you want to find out but it is well worth it.Enjoyment: 8/10I enjoyed watching Kiznaiver. Its uniqueness and being made by Studio Trigger really hooked me on at the start. It went down a path I didn’t expect but it was well worth it as it made for a great series. The only main problem I have with the series was that I was sort of bored during the beginning part of the series and some things just didn’t make too much sense to me but overall, it a good anime and I enjoyed it.Overall: 8/10Kiznaiver is a unique work from Trigger. It has an interesting story with great characters to compliment it. Trigger never fails to impress me with their art style and the sound was great. I enjoyed most of this series and it’s definitely something I would recommend to someone. Although this series will not appeal to everyone, it’s good to give is a shot.Watch if:-\tLove drama shows such as Anohana or Nagi no Asukara-\tLike to see a unique art style such as those found in Kill la Kill, or the many of the Shaft anime.-\tWant lots of dialogue-\tWant a unique story-\tWant great charactersDon’t Watch if:-\tYou are looking for action-\tDo not like lots of dialogue testers of the Kizna system which was trying to bring world peace.

Everyone was specting a Kill la Kill like-story. And that\'s not what we got at all. And honestly I am kinda glad trigger changed their shonen go-to perspective and try to innovate with this seinen directed story.Well then let\'s jump to full-on review!STORY AND SETTINGS:The story revolves around a group of students from the same class, all with different personalities, that are selected to participate in the project ""KIZUNA"" that it\'s a project to connect or bond with other individuals by sharing...pain/wounds. The whole city they live in was just created for the purpose of this project, even though their citizens don\'t know.It\'s a pretty interesting concept, and even though trigger has had another animes about ""human interaction/connection"" this was a pretty fresh approach to that. They d set the purpose of the anime very clear since the beginning and that\'s an A+ for me. Since it\'s set aroud a very sci-fi looking setting, but a little bit more modern and ""today-looking."" So we can see relatable characters interact with each other and kinda develop and grow at a same pace which is really nice.I think the story is original and enjoyable. The only thing I have to complain\' about it, would be the huge time they spent in explaining the love tiangles.ART AND OST:I think the artstyle/visuals took a huge role on this anime.  The colors, the shading, the backgrounds... could really tell you what was going on  in each scene. They artstyle was pretty clean and inviting. The animation is smooth looking.As for the soundtrack, it is not epic or memorable but pretty likeable, since it\'s full of energy and techno infuses.CHARACTERS:Kiznaiver doesn\'t have those memorable, overheroic and sacrificial characters. Other tan that they just show teenagers with different and pretty clear personalities. One good thing that this anime did was it\'s characters.Because they clearly showed their strength and their weaknesses and balanced it out, this also made them interact with one another in different ways. They are all pretty exciting and heartwarming in differnet ways. Tenga will probably stay in my memory for a long time (haha).OVERALL:Kiznaiver was not the best anime of the season, but it\' close to my heart.The characters gave me a bit of tears, laughs and reminded me a lot of my own group of friends which was really important, and I think everyone could relate to it, becuase it touches a human weak spot that is realating to other human beings.For me this anime was a great methapor for ""Putting yourself in the shoes of the next person."" And it teaches us that we can understand each other and what they feel, but we would never connect to at 100%. pain/wounds.

I created an account just to review it lol. The ending is awesome, and it has a very thoughtful message. I would definitely recommend this anime to everyone.Story: 9/10It\'s a fast pace story and with each episode, you learn something new about the characters. The plot itself is very interesting and the character\'s feelings are all very believable. This is a character-driven story, each episode or two centers around the ""missions"" given to them by the people...conducting the kizuna experiment and how they choose to complete the missions. In the beginning, the missions ended happily, with positive results for the experiment; however, the experiments are getting more dangerous. They are forcing the characters to reveal things about themselves that they would rather not share, especially the painful things. In turn, the results turn out to be pretty disastrous.Characters 9/10All the other reviews I have read pin the characters for just being their stereotypes, and I thought so too, originally. However, the more I watch, the more I see that they are all very human, and also very similar. They\'re very believable and their problems and fears are very relatable. Their development is great.Ar 10/10Awesome eye candy hahaSound 8/10The voice acting is amazing. I couldn\'t really catch on to much background sounds though, maybe because I couldn\'t hear it over the sound of how awesome Yuta is) The op and ed are awesome.Enjoyment 10/10(Read first part)Overall 9/10 conducting the kizuna experiment and how they choose to complete the missions.

With it's unique art style and character driven story, it really stands out among other shows. Certainly, it does have some weak points like the really slow pacing and some things don't get properly explained, but I enjoyed it a lot.Kiznaiver is an anime about pain and friendship. It's about being connected to each other and how to accept each other. The plot doesn't even matter that much, sometimes it seems like there is no plot at all, while the characters aimlessly mess around. So please: don't watch it only for the plot.In my opinion, Kiznaivers strong points...are the visuals (Studio Triggers art style is always a win) and the interesting characters who seem shallow at the beginning but develop into well-rounded and understandable leads.The music and the voice actors are also noteworthy. They manage to portray the emotions and personalities really well.So after all, if you like to watch character driven, friendship-themed anime with a bit of drama, then I'm happy to recommend this show to you. are the visuals (Studio Triggers art style is always a win) and the interesting characters who seem shallow at the beginning but develop into well-rounded and understandable leads.The music and the voice actors are also noteworthy.

Friendship! Bonding! Relationships are sugoi desu and you deserve to be loved nya~If that made you cringe, stop now, because this is literally what Kiznaiver is all about and would be nothing without it.As stated in the summary, the seven main characters of the show are connected together by this particular wound, which means that they start to feel each other's pain and emotions, thus driving them much closer together as friends and potential lovers to tease fans. As we delve deeper into the series, we see that our main character, Katsuhira, has the inability...to feel pain and fails to empathize with others, which is a frustration and a mystery to the other six characters we grow more familiar with. We also realize that all of this is part of an experiment with a sinister backstory---sometimes, the best intentions lead to the worst results.Brilliant concepts. But you know what I said about how great intentions don't exactly equate to great results?To put it in short, the story jumps and drags. For an anime about the chemistry of its characters, you either learn a ridiculous amount about them, or nothing at all. (Spoiler, but there are THREE episodes about the tragic back-story of ONE character out of the SEVEN they focus on. A quarter of the series, basically.)What drove me to keep watching was what the writers decided to do with the concepts, even if it fell flat at times. The second half of this series is where shit hits the fan and it gets AWESOME. Only problem is that you need to go through the first.ART: 10I mean...it's Trigger. The stylistic beauty is there, as you would expect a Studio Ghibli movie to be visually stunning.I don't have too much to say aside from the character design is lovely, and the animation is fluid. But again. Trigger. They didn't LOSE THEIR WAY on this one.HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAI don't get paid for this.SOUND: 9LAAAAAAAAY YOOOOOOOOUR HAAAAAAAANDS ON MEEEEEEEEGreat theme. EXCELLENT and chaotic soundtrack to match the show's tone. Violin is used masterfully in the background to relay distress, piano denotes beauty. Kiznaiver does an excellent job with manipulating your emotions through its melodies.Also, the voice acting is splendid. Extra points to the voice actress for Nico, who apparently has an already filled resume of kawaii desu des des characters with squeaky, energetic, diabetes-giving voices. I'm excited for a dub.WHIIIIIIIIILE I'MMMMMMM BLEEEEEEEDING OUTCHARACTER: 7They're all likeable, from the angsty main character to the blatant female version of him. In all honesty, however, I can't remember most of the names. All I remember was that...I liked the tropes. Again, that's not exactly high praise considering that the entire purpose of the show is to follow the deep connections between these characters, which eventually stem into last-minute romances and the obligatory training camp episode.However.There is one character that I need to scream my praises about.NICO.Okay, so Nico is, in short, the weird one. But out of everyone, she is BY FAR the most interesting and delightful. She has this innocence towards the concept of forming a relationship with someone, as she is the most blatant example of an outcast: bizarre dress, third-person speech, etc. She, unlike most of the characters the show follows, is very human and relatable. We all have that one friend who tries too hard to stick out, and maybe not the friend that gets off to pain or beats people up after school but has a petrifying fear of dogs. She's human, and it's refreshing to see...for lack of a better term, another larger-than-life Mako. If you can't find a reason to watch this show but you want to, make Nico your reason.Everyone else? Eh. Katsuhira is cute in an angsty way, I guess.ENJOYMENT: 8This show, with its bright colors and building story with unpredictable pacing demanded my attention. As an avid fan of Kill la Kill's style and character, I was stoked for Trigger's next brainchild.And for good reason. It was fun to follow, albeit difficult at times. It was a delight to watch the conflict and the resolution. I never had thoughts of quitting, and after taking a break due to working at a summer camp, I was excited to dive right back in.The OP is so fun. You could tell that everyone had a great time making this show into life. Watching the pre-episodes that documented the making of this series showed the passion put in after the success of Kill la Kill, and when the performer has a good time, so does the audience.OVERALL: 8While I had a few qualms with Kiznaiver, wishing they did some things in the plot differently and better smoothed out the story, (maybe it would have been better if it was given a second season?), I am rather pleased with what was given.We all watched Kill la Kill and Gurren Lagaan to have a great time and a riveting anime experience that we won't forget for a long time. I don't know if this anime reached that caliber, but the style and the Nico made it rather close to that.I believe Trigger did an excellent job with this one. Of course, not their best, but if you're looking for something that will stitch you up after Matoi sliced you down, this should at least suffice. to feel pain and fails to empathize with others, which is a frustration and a mystery to the other six characters we grow more familiar with.

The story idea was a great one, though i feel like they could have given it a little something towards the end. Personally the last episode was rather disappointing.For the most part the characters were fairly unique, taking a stereotype and adding a slight twist to what the audience would typically expect from said character, and really the only spot I found lacking here was Chidori. I feel like the only reason she was there was to get her heart broken and we see very little development from her compared...to the other characters. *cough* Mary Sue *cough*.I felt like there was a bit of  lull in the pacing with episodes 4-6 but the characters kept bringing me back to it with all of their unsuspected actions! to the other characters. *cough* Mary Sue *cough*.I felt like there was a bit of  lull in the pacing with episodes 4-6 but the characters kept bringing me back to it with all of their unsuspected actions!', ""Studio Trigger's newest anime attempts to go into new territories, specifically different genres compared to what they're used to. Kiznaiver is a drama filled with the neat concept of a hand full of selected teenage students who can feel and equalize each other's pain. It's neat in concept but in execution it lacks in many areas and becomes a whirlwind of eye rolling and ends up being a sort of cliche. If Trigger did anything right it was probably the art, being fantastic, colorful and expressive with action-based scenes being fluid and detail in areas that matter. The op by boom satellites is a great...example of Trigger's visual mastery (great song btw). Anyways, all-in-all the plot simmers down at a certain point and becomes flacid around the second half though there are still some great moments to be found. example of Trigger's visual mastery (great song btw).

Having to witness a group go through an organziation\'s plans against their will or rights was interesting.I have a phobia of pain, more specifically empathetic pain.Our main cast is taken in for an experimentation, the Kizna System, where the group is connected by each others pain. Slowly but surely, we start to see how much this can amount on people.It starts out with physical pain. When one person gets hit, everyone will feel the same hit.Then came emotional pain. From despair and sadness, comes the...pain making us cry. It could even be from positive emotions, like happiness or joy.Finally, came the most invasive pain of the lot, Heartache. The pain from a person\'s desires. While others may not have much heart towards something, they could feel when someone in the group had great feelings that they would\'ve never noticed themselves.Think of it all as this, I\'m attached to you through the Kizna system, and were are in different rooms;I get punched in the gut, we both will experience the pain of it. You\'ll be like ""The hell? It hurts! Where\'d that come from?!""I get saddened from seeing an animal get hurt, we both feel gloomy. You\'d react as ""Wha-what? I\'m not doing anything wrong, I\'m not feeling hurt, why do I suddenly feel depressed?""I start to think about this girl I like and become all stupidly fuzzy and spew desires that I would personally love, even if you share none of my desires, you feel and know fully what I am feeling about this girl I like.The questions from watching Kiznaiver were;Isn\'t this way too invasive?If I get punched in the gut, they feel the pain, but what about the effects like getting winded? Do they also get winded?Is this in anyway a step towards peace?All in all, it was inquisitive to me. The twist had wrung my phobia the hardest. Orange hair girl is best girl. There were times I could relate, and times I\'d just be ""What in the heck is this?.""Kiznaiver isn\'t mind blowing, but it\'s not distasteful. It\'s interesting to see how our variety cast deals with the situation at hand. If you liked Danganronpa or 999, this might be a nice small little anime to get your brain thinking on these types of scenarios.I wonder what a story would be like if everyone was forced to possess each other.

Actually, the path it took to get there was equally as surprising, if not more so.Building around a concept I've never watched or even thought of before, the connecting of people through pain and even deeper, Kiznaiver gets an easy 9/10 just for its concept and story. But in terms of execution? It only gets a 7.The story is interesting, thought-provoking and actually really emotional. It made me think about things I've never thought of before, and although that's not something new...with regards to anime or any shows/movies I've watched, this one hit a little harder than the rest.As interesting as the story is, I have to look at the anime as a whole. In terms of pacing, it felt a little all over the place towards the end. Crammed into 12 episodes, the climax of the show starts to occur within episode 8 and spans right till the end. The show wrapped up the ending real quick. As a marketing device, quickening the pace of the story towards the end, this works. I couldn't stop watching from episode 7 onwards purely for this reason. But I couldn't help but feel like it was too rushed and that I hardly had time to make sense of everything.Thankfully, that doesn't change the feelings it's supposed to elicit. I'll admit, towards the end, I was a little bored. It was clear how it was going to end, but I was happy seeing the aftermath. Romance may not be at the centre of this anime, but it definitely has its role, and I enjoyed seeing it.The characters deserve a 9/10. Chidori, although painfully flawed, manages to make herself a little more likable. Tenga, Nico and Hisomu are the comedic relief in this. Nico especially, is just a ball of joy, no fault with her here. Yuta and Honoka seem to be the only somewhat normal ones, which bring the group down to earth a little more. And then the MC, Katsuhira, whose character development makes me feel like a mother watching her son grow up. Their personalities are all balanced out to make this show work. They each play a role in the story, and learn from each other. I enjoyed seeing them all together.And I wanted to hate this anime for the sensitive story it was trying to tell, what with the earlier experiments going wrong, but I couldn't bring myself to do so because it all worked out. Not that the end justifies the means (though sometimes it does, albeit rarely), just that I had to appreciate Kiznaiver for managing to make me feel so strongly about a fictional story.The art style suits the anime. Not impressive animation wise, but it fits. I like the character designs, and it's a nice change from the usual basic character designs that most animes have now.Overall, despite me having rated it a 7, I'd still recommend watching this. Though the concept isn't straight forward, and probably has a few plot holes (I refuse to think any harder than I should), it's successful in telling the story and ending it. If the pacing was better and some things were tweaked, it would probably be an 8. But it wouldn't hit a 9 simply because it failed to establish an attachment between me and any of the characters. As much as I enjoyed the characters, I didn't really care for them, and that's a pretty big flaw for me.Either way, I still liked the anime and would recommend this. An easy watch, good characters, thought-provoking plot and no open ending. with regards to anime or any shows/movies I've watched, this one hit a little harder than the rest.As interesting as the story is, I have to look at the anime as a whole.

I found this anime pretty enjoyable, or should I say unique. throughout the series I hungrily tasted every single episode, feeling refreshed every minute. you might say: the story is rushed, characters are cliche or even the idea is trash, but for some unknown reason I just find this particular anime so nice and interesting to watch. so if you are someone like me who has watched so many anime with the same art styles, characters and...story why not give Kiznaiver a try, it might make a 'connection' with you in some way.story - 6/10: really I have to say the story was happening a bit too quick. from the start of the problem to all character's acceptance only used 3 episode. it looks like they are so quick to accept the fact that they have just been kidnapped and been experimented on that they are nearly inhumane. also, the story itself has a lot of plotholes, from a simple problem like suddenly fell in love with some you met for 2 days to the contradiction between the explanation and the actual thing in their 'experiment' ( no spoilers ). BUT, it was enjoyable anyhow. ;)Art - 9/10: expecting nothing less from Trigger. another really unique art style that is just as colourful as NGNL but with a better skill at drawing quality and details like P.A. works. I have nothing really to say apart from the fact that it is simply so wonderful to watch and enjoy.sound - 9/10: I'm not really an OST guy, I basically rate based on how each song has an impact on a particular scene. but the main soundtrack in the anime usually when Gomorin comes out in really nice.character - 7: all characters are pretty enjoyable most of the time, maybe more at the start.- so we got the emotionless main character who let himself get beaten up which is pretty unique I should say.- sonozaki, probably the main female protagonist who is also emotionless- chidori, main character's childhood friend who likes him just like how every single other childhood friend who likes the main character.- always cheerful nico- tanga the thug- honoka the high and mighty- yuta the hot guy- lastly, the wiedo hisomu who is a masochistthey are..... interesting i guess. ;)overall I gave this anime 8/10 hoping people would appreciate these kinds of unique work more than they are now. if you are still not sure, give these anime a tour, cuz they are quite similar in some way: anohana and megakucity story why not give Kiznaiver a try, it might make a 'connection' with you in some way.story - 6/10: really I have to say the story was happening a bit too quick. from the start of the problem to all character's acceptance only used 3 episode. it looks like they are so quick to accept the fact that they have just been kidnapped and been experimented on that they are nearly inhumane. also, the story itself has a lot of plotholes, from a simple problem like suddenly fell in love with some you met for 2 days to the contradiction between the explanation and the actual thing in their 'experiment' ( no spoilers ).

Also, rant warning, sorry.)Finishing Kiznaiver and Classroom of the Elite on the same day really made for a day full of disappointment, albeit for entirely different reasons. In Classroom of the Elite's case, it was due to the looseness of the adaptation, causing them to really fail to reach Classroom of the Elite's full potential. However, in regards to Kiznaiver, Trigger happened. Before I go any further with that line of thought, I'd better throw out there that...I did enjoy Kiznaiver a lot, I just didn't like the direction that it went around episode 9. The sad part was that I saw it coming. I told myself that this was a Trigger work and something bizarre was bound to happen, pushing the show over the line. It just seems like a curse at this point. Anything Trigger touches ends up breaking the bounds of ridiculous after starting off really strong.Production-wise, Kiznaiver simply exudes that Trigger quality. The animation is smooth and pleasing, especially in the early episodes. As the show goes on, you can tell that the animation quality fades somewhat to 'normal' quality, which works just fine. The character designs are a huge strength in Kiznaiver as well, every single character has a unique design and color scheme to pair with their respective 'sins' or negative quality. It all comes together to really make the characters pop and give each their own unique personality without even having them say a word. As far as the soundtrack goes, none of the OST songs really shine in my opinion, but the opening alone causes me to give the audio an A+ from me. Visually, the ending is great, but the song is just kinda average, which works, since it's carried by its visuals anyway. All in all, Kiznaiver is really solid on the technical side of things, as expected from Trigger, as this is really where most of their works shine. However, up next is where I'll kinda go off on Kiznaiver.Favorite Character: Yoshiharu HisomuHuh? The Masochist? The one who shows up like 3 episodes in and gets the least amount of screen time and development? I mean, yeah. Ironically enough, he is literally the only character that has an ounce of common sense in him. He's probably the only true friend of the seven, as evidenced by the fact that he stuck with Katsuhira even in his darkest time. I think his being my favorite character has more to do with the fact that the other characters really annoyed me at certain points of the show, whereas Masochist was really steady and reliable. Despite that, there was a point in the show as it was waning that I realized that Masochist had grown a lot. No longer was he the loner who cared only for his own self-pleasure, he had become quite the caring friend. Even though it was subtle, I definitely noticed that he grew. So, call it lack of development or a strong character, it really doesn't matter.Chidori was a hair away from taking favorite character from Masochist, but I decided against it due to the fact that even she annoyed me at a certain point. It was brief, but enough to not choose her. On a more ranty note, I am really kind of pissed with the way that Kiznaiver used Chidori and every other Kiznaiver that wasn't the main character. To start with Chidori, she was just shafted the entire show. Whether it was being cockblocked by Noriko or her Kiznaiver friends, she had the most rotten treatment of the entire cast, which was really painful for me, because she was my favorite character for the majority of the show. Not to mention that the show kind of forced her into submission as the number 2 girl and settle for the 'other guy' for no reason other than the writers had a hard-on for Noriko. Yes, I am salty, but what's new?That kind of leads me into my two big issues with Kiznaiver. The first being that the ending sucked and the second being that fact that they basically sideline the Kiznaivers for Noriko in the last third of the show. These two complaints kind of go hand-in-hand, so I'll discuss them together, along with complaints about specific characters. First, is the Noriko problem. Why is she important? Because. Because why? Because she shares a past with MC-kun! I'm being a little dramatic with this complaint, but that's kind of the theme of Kiznaiver, so I'll go along with it. My big issue with Noriko is that she becomes the main character at the conclusion and that causes all seven of the Kiznaivers to be shoved to the side. The very same characters that you spent 9 episodes getting attached to, thrown away for a character that really wasn't given any real importance other than being the Kiznaiver initiation mom. I get it. It was foreshadowed from the beginning scene that she was important, but at least make her part of the story for the middle half of the show. Obviously, I'm being really salty about this, but it just baffles me that the show took such a hard turn and became all about her in the end. And yes, this also has to do with the fact that my Chidori ship didn't sail.Honestly, I don't even really need to go into too much detail with the ending because of what I've laid out already. Basically, Noriko, the emotionless doll girl, has an extremely emotional response over a threat on the Kizuna system, which is her everything and tries prove that it works by converting everyone into Kiznaivers. And this is after 10 or so episodes showing the seven main characters learning empathy, how to talk about their emotions and secrets, and developing trust in each other through the Kizuna system. Tell me where an ending like I described above fits into that kind of small scale story? I could probably just leave it there and I feel like my point would be made. The fact is that a large scale ending was so forced. Kiznaiver up to that point was all about the character's relationships with each other, which was really good, but for some reason, Trigger decided that we needed some conflict for the ending. Why don't we instead go for a smaller scale resolution with, I don't know, our main cast instead of only MC-kun and his emotionless childhood friend that he loves for some reason?I have way more to complain about, but I'll keep it smaller for these, which deal with the other characters in the main seven Kiznaivers. The biggest annoyance for me was Hajime the dumb, strong guy. At first, I kinda liked him, but then somewhere down the line, he just became a white knight justice warrior kind of a character and began acting in the most irritating way. I just didn't understand where he got off berating MC-kun, who was a moron to be fair, when he himself was doing the exact same thing to poor Nico. Who was, by the way, also a great character. I have no real complaints about her, except how she had was that she was almost completely used a tool to unite the Kiznaivers and give friendship speeches. It just would have been nice to see some individuality from her. On the topic of low development, pretty boy Tsuguhito got the background development, he grew up as he supported Glasses-san through her tragic past. Thinking back on it, Tsugihito's growth may actually have been as good as Masochist's low key development, but it was just so understated that he was so easy to look over. Glasses-san, Honoka got pretty good screen time, enough to have her own arc. Her arc dragged on a little long in my opinion, but it was nice to see real development occur among the Kiznaivers. Lastly, we have MC-kun, Katsuhira, who's name I just had to look up because I forget it all the time. His development was actually really satisfying to watch unfold. Each episode, he was slightly more expressive and caring towards his friends, except for Chidori cause screw her, right? I'm kidding, of course, his treatment of Chidori wasn't really his fault. He tried his best, but Noriko always ended up messing everything up between them, which was annoying to watch, but such is anime, I suppose.As I glance up at my lines of ranting above, I have to wonder if that means that Trigger actually won. Clearly, I ended up caring enough about their characters to write so much on how I wished they had gotten more screen time and development. I do want to restate that I enjoyed watching Kiznaiver, especially early on. It was just so full of melodrama and love triangle shenanigans that it almost ruined it for me. I'd also like to apologize for ranting so much, but I only did it because I truly think that Kiznaiver could have been amazing if it had just stayed more grounded and not tried to shoot for the moon. Even though Trigger didn't work on it too much, I got Darling in the FranXX flashbacks as I was watching. All that potential early on, wasted with a overly ambitious ending. Hopefully Trigger learns from these shows and SSSS.Gridman and Promare finally break the Trigger mold and succeed!

I would definitely recommend. Loved almost every part of it, especially the evolution of the Kizna\'s connection. I would think that people who are seasoned ""anime veteran"" might not like this much because it seems that after this came out quite a few people copied it. But if you haven\'t seen an...anime about firmly connection complete strangers, this is a great place to start. Great visuals aswell! anime about firmly connection complete strangers, this is a great place to start. Great visuals aswell!', ""Kiznaiver is one of those animes that you always hear people talking about, but after you watch it, it seems as if no one else has heard of it.The story had a lot of potential and I feel like if they were to have taken the plot, but made it more serious, that it would have made this anime much better and way more understandable than it was.The art was amazing, rarely would I look at the screen and think that the picture I saw was bad. Even with the ruined plot, the...art completely carried me through the 12 episodes.The idea behind each of the characters were really good, but I feel like it was executed badly. It always felt like they were trying to hard to make these characters who they were supposed to be, that it kinda ruined everything for me. I mean, every two seconds it was either screaming for no reason, crying over a guy for 12 episodes straight, and then right as he starts dating she goes and completely forgets about him. All the characters change out of no where throughout the season, and become mad and sad for the smallest things.The sound wasn't bad by any means, I thought it was good compared to most of the other things about the show. It also helped me even out the enjoyment to a 5/10.Overall it's a 5. Now granted, I did watch the whole season high, and I am typing this while high too, but nothing about this plot made sense to me. Characters emotions were flying out of control for no reason what so ever. They never explained what they were using the Kiznaiver for, or why it only lasted for the summer. Also how tf did nobody get arrested? She literally tried to take over japan with her puppet army or whatever. And now they're all lovey-dovey with eachother like nothing ever happened. The whole season was a wasted of time to watch, this is not recommended at all. Do not watch, unless you want to hear two people that can't complete a sentence without pausing 50 times in the middle of it. art completely carried me through the 12 episodes.The idea behind each of the characters were really good, but I feel like it was executed badly.

The feeling that you don\'t care anymore, it feels kinda good at the same time scary. Those feelings that weigh you down but there\'s no body there to help you carry them, sometimes you think you\'re all alone and nobody cares. But in the end all of it was just a dream and in the morning you wake up and must face reality. Pain is a part of you, you cannot run away from it and must face it and endure...it. Live your life to the fullest. Because pain makes you who you are.So! As for the story of this anime it is quite good actually, i was amazed how the plot envolves and showcases everyone, well ofcourse due to the fact that they have lots of main chars in to this anime obviously, even side characters they also have back stories; The story is about Katsuhira who doesn\'t feel any pain at all, like nada even if you punch him bleed him he would never even flinch no emotions at all whatsoever, that makes him a good target and a good punching bag for bullies and he doesn\'t care if anything happens to him and then came in the main HERO of this anime! Haha just kidding! He was saved by his classmate Hajime and soon after made a contract with him and later they became friends.

It would be nice if the drama was more natural and not literally being enforced by a group of people but I think that aspect is to send the end message more clearly. By no means do I think this show is a masterpiece, a 7/10 for me at best, but I think people are hating it a little too much for this arbitrary reason when there are other problems that I think matter more.For example, the whole end plot point of Shinozaki...being able to return their feelings, I find it damn hard to believe that a lab and a group of people who put her through that pain were unable to return the pain in over 10 years but Agata could in less than a couple months.Shinozaki also noted that she didn't like them how they were but clearly is smart enough to know that if they had their pain they would've gone back to normal.The whole end climax feels like way too much and I started getting Darling In the Franxx flashbacks as they kept ramping up the climax even further and further. There was a point where I thought this anime was going to be ruined for me because of the ending.That's all the negative stuff I have for it, now the positives:The art and character designs are really well done imo especially for the guys. As well as this the voice actors do a great job and the ost placement in the earlier episodes made me really feel and get enticed with the characters.The characters are all very unique, I liked all of them and the way they had their background expressed was finominal even if it was forced throughout. This is especially true with Maki and her case.Finally the story is pretty okay, it groups characters together with a looming organization above head and shows that said organization had the power to literally control the city later on. The story matters less than the characters though because at this point I see this show more as a character introspective drama rather than a sci-fi action show and I'm pretty sure most people would agree with me.Anyways give it a try, the first couple episodes are definitely the best of the series so if you drop it after those I wouldn't blame you. being able to return their feelings, I find it damn hard to believe that a lab and a group of people who put her through that pain were unable to return the pain in over 10 years but Agata could in less than a couple months.Shinozaki also noted that she didn't like them how they were but clearly is smart enough to know that if they had their pain they would've gone back to normal.The whole end climax feels like way too much and I started getting Darling In the Franxx flashbacks as they kept ramping up the climax even further and further.

It's an extremely average teenage show.As expected from Trigger, they did great with the animation. I liked the art style and character designs.But overall...I'm disappointed for this anime. Disappointed because it showed really great potential.It had a great premise. The idea of sharing pain between individuals could go around and create a wonderful drama setting that can trigger events that will lead to character development, and progress the story as a result.They did this wonderfully! But only up to a certain point. Episode 1-6 got me excited. But after the arc where they discover that Sonozaki...was also a Kiznaiver, the story and the characters wasn't able to progress as wonderfully as it did in beginning. Majority of them seemed one-dimensional still. They are not as relatable as they could potentially be in the circumstances that they were put in.What went wrong with the anime is that it has no clear direction of what emotion it wants to imbue to the viewer. There are points wherein they could make the viewer feel emotional by maximizing some of the dramatic elements, but instead it chooses to make you laugh. It's too lighthearted that sometimes the characters' emotional baggage doesn't seem to authentic.I would recommend watching Kokoro Connect instead. was also a Kiznaiver, the story and the characters wasn't able to progress as wonderfully as it did in beginning.

We really need to place ourselves into the...shoes of these characters, I understood how guilty Maki felt leaving her friend and feeling like she caused her death, I understood how hurt and broken Chidori must have felt when Katsuhira showed how much he loved Sonozaki. Though maybe Nico liking Tenga was just a bit forced because there needed to be some background as to why she took interest in him.The character development mainly of Katsuhiro was one hell of a trip, from an apathetic person he was at the beginning to experiencing what it\'s really like to cry (for his former childhood friends), it was really amazing.Sonozaki of course has a strong charm and I love that character so much, after her background was revealed, we start to understand why she does what she does and that she really is a good person. The smile at the end was so good :)Story:The pacing in this anime is very good, can\'t seem to find a massive flaw in it. Even time jumps seem very appropriate and the reaction of characters to the events that take place don\'t lose the essence of what makes their character, it really is interesting and engaging. The mystery surrounding Sonozaki and the other characters, and how it slowly reveals itself is a very great tool used in this anime, kept me hooked all the way.The ending of this anime is quite satisfying because of how all the characters ended up connected to each other without the Kiznaiver system. Their bonds strengthened like between Maki and Yuta, and of course Katsuhiro and Sonozaki are picture perfect ships, while the other characters have decided to continue living and not be burdened by how the people they like don\'t return their feelings because these characters are more than that, they are not just defined by their relationships but have individuality & personality.Sound:The OST of Kiznaiver was so refreshing as it is really one of a kind and eminating positive energy, truly a work of art and very pleasant to listen to. The voice acting was also so good, especially the direction of small changes in Katsuhiro\'s expressiveness as he progressed and developed real emotions.Art:Not to get into the art much, but we can see it\'s definitely unique with very great emphasis on contrast of vibrant colors and the boring colors of the city and environment. It holds up very well by today\'s standards. Also the movement for example of Katsuhiro\'s side glance as he looks slightly upwards is also so smooth and I really love it!Conclusion:Truly a great work of art with great character development and a great story line. The only critique I can give is probably the introduction of too many concepts in the Kiznaiver universe that have not been well developed like wtf are Gomorins and how did they get so much funds for the Kiznaiver project until they were able to create a whole city and underground infrastructure besides the really vage explanation of ""sponsors"".

Great animation, interesting premise, and cool characters for the most part. However, by around the halfway mark, it became apparent that this anime was going down the tried and true anime tropes of 1) Extremely Dense MC who oblivious to everything 2) Childhood friend who is extremely attractive, caring and likable, but needs to have her heart broken 3) Main girl who barely knows the MC, has the personality of a wall, but gets to win in the end because the author/screenwriter says so. I dunno, I\'ve seen this...trope so many times, you start to get a little salty about it after a while. I honestly don\'t understand why these series of tropes get reused so much, specifically the ""breaking the sweet childhood friends heart"" is the trope that bothers me most. In real life, I don\'t think there would many guys would wouldn\'t develop feelings for their childhood friend if they were as hot, likable, and caring as Chidori. In the anime world though, it\'s the law that you need to be indifferent to them, pretend like you don\'t recognize their feelings, and eventually break their heart. Again, this trope is not unique to Kiznaiver, but I\'m pretty salty still whenever I see it. trope so many times, you start to get a little salty about it after a while.

It’s because we don’t understand that we wonder what the other is thinking and try desperately to understand every word they say… You end up thinking too much about the other person, and being close to them becomes painful so you try to distance yourself… I believe you become friends with somebody by doing that over and over, and that’s how… As much as I hate to admit it, it’s how I became friends with these guys.” – Maki HonokaTL;DR- Set in the near future, kiznaiver takes place in a city assumed to be normal. Here, our main character...katsuhira agata resides and he is anything but normal; he has lost his ability to feel. He cannot feel pain nor emotions and is the constant target for harassment by bullies who exploit him for money. His childhood friend chidori tries to protect him from this by being there for him as she hopes that he will return to normal as her memories remember him. Chidori and agata are kidnapped, alongside 5 others to take place in a series of experiments called the kizna system. In this experiment, in the name of achieving peace, your emotions and feelings are shared between the participants, whether it be pain or elation. This story thus follows these 7 teens, along with the mysterious Sonozaki who watches over the teens, as they start to develop bonds between themselves, however forced they may be, because they hopefully can change the future world from ruin.Similar-Kokoro connect- The central theme in this show is to reveal everything you have to those involved. Kokoro connect is more supernatural and has the theme of being unwillingly chosen to participate in an event where your emotions and pain are put on a table for others to see. Kiznaiver links through pain whilst kokoro connect switches it up, from random thoughts being projected to someone else in the group to switching bodies with one another. They both cover essentially forced bonds between people and the episodes show growth as the main cast slowly warm up to one another. Romance is also involved in both anime s with clear understandings behind why the character likes the other one rather than just arbitrarily told. There's a sort of love triangle in both animes, which if youve watched both you would understand but I’m not going to spoil it. Both have an abrupt ending that the ova solves and packages the anime neatly, with a satisfying ending.Ano Hana- The central main cast in both anime’s are thrown into chaos as they are forced into an abnormal situation where they have to kindle or rekindle relations with one another. We get to see a lot of character development in both shows, with unique takes on situations and the plot gets thicker and thicker as the episodes continue but both are really not melodramatic at any point. Ano hana is much more dark and filled with ideas of how things could have been whilst kiznaiver covers more of the doing things part. Many faults of the characters are shown and solved and the ending of ano hana has a more bittersweet ending.Art- Artistically, this anime is excellent, with the attention to details that are maintained throughout the show for seemingly unnecessary things and the splash of colours here and there. The art definitely does match the anime as its over the top most of the time with a cartoony theme that just screams perfection. The character designs are entrancing and follow a classic with a modern flair twist to the art. The character designs did well to reflect the emotions of the characters in the scene incredibly well.

We see this directly as the teens initially hate one another but through trials and tribulations become closer and closer. The shared pain aspect allows teh kids to understand the other party more than through empathy or sympathy could do. A study was done called pain as a social glue, whereby it found that in three separate experiments with varying amounts of pain, that sharing painful experiences with other people promoted more trust and more interpersonal relationships. These were measured through perceived bonding through a survey and an economic game. In another study it found similar results where undergrad students were subject to pain that didn't outwardly impact their emotions, but the perceived bonds within the members increased significantly. This study suggested that shared pain not only increases a sense of solidarity but can boost group co-operation. This kind of bond is called survival bonds according to sociology and is still being researched into to this day. Back to kiznaiver, through these experiences the kids become true companions, effectively proving the point of the kizna project. Tp be true companions is the idea that these people are like a real family, you may not like the other but you can depend on them in a crisis. The theme of bonds is further developed by sonozaki, who was relentlessly experimented on as part of the first kizna project which left most of the participants incapacitated with her feeling all of the kids pain at several multiples higher then what the kids had experienced. She believes that humans require connection with others and that’s how bonds are made, the more connections you have with someone the stronger the bond is. This is generally true as there is an effect dubbed the similarity attraction effect whereby the more similar to another person or a thing you are, the more attracted you are to it. This is where the saying birds of a feather flock together originates from. Sonazaki feels like it's only natural for people to want to leave their mark on someone else and is longing for such a connection. By extension, the others part of the kizna system are the same, they feel lonely and left out for some reason or another, whether that be unrequited love or lack of feeling pain and emotions but through the kizna system they get this feeling of being together. Love hurts most of the cast, with a complicated love circle but it's shown that this shouldn't stop you from loving or feeling things because it's inevitable to be hurt in life, but to close yourself off from others is not inevitable.ThoughtsKiznaiver on the whole was a brilliant anime with a great ending. The use of colour coded characters was much appreciated as it helped make the main points of the anime-the story itself- stand out without being obtrusive but helped make the story make more sense. The use of sci-fi rather than the supernatural was also quite interesting as it strayed off from what this genre usually entails. I loved how the anime assumed that the viewer had more information than the characters and toyed with this idea but my main gripe was that most of the twists were too obvious, that isn't to say that the twists were bad but they were in line with expectations which kind of drew attention away from the intricate plot. There's also the idea that the main characters represented the seven deadly sins, with katsuhira being sloth due to his indifference to situations, Tenga being wrath, honoka being pride, chidoris being envy, nice being gluttony, yutas being greed and hisomu being lust. Like I said the story is intricate but sometimes overshadowed by cheap tricks.Overall, I enjoyed this anime as it showed the effects of pain in forming bonds with one another and was incredibly enjoyable to watch. If anything you take away from this show, it should be that pain shouldn't cause you to hole yourself in, rather it should be the final push you need to achieve what you want. katsuhira agata resides and he is anything but normal; he has lost his ability to feel. He cannot feel pain nor emotions and is the constant target for harassment by bullies who exploit him for money. His childhood friend chidori tries to protect him from this by being there for him as she hopes that he will return to normal as her memories remember him. Chidori and agata are kidnapped, alongside 5 others to take place in a series of experiments called the kizna system. In this experiment, in the name of achieving peace, your emotions and feelings are shared between the participants, whether it be pain or elation. This story thus follows these 7 teens, along with the mysterious Sonozaki who watches over the teens, as they start to develop bonds between themselves, however forced they may be, because they hopefully can change the future world from ruin.Similar-Kokoro connect- The central theme in this show is to reveal everything you have to those involved. Kokoro connect is more supernatural and has the theme of being unwillingly chosen to participate in an event where your emotions and pain are put on a table for others to see. Kiznaiver links through pain whilst kokoro connect switches it up, from random thoughts being projected to someone else in the group to switching bodies with one another. They both cover essentially forced bonds between people and the episodes show growth as the main cast slowly warm up to one another. Romance is also involved in both anime s with clear understandings behind why the character likes the other one rather than just arbitrarily told. There's a sort of love triangle in both animes, which if youve watched both you would understand but I’m not going to spoil it. Both have an abrupt ending that the ova solves and packages the anime neatly, with a satisfying ending.Ano Hana- The central main cast in both anime’s are thrown into chaos as they are forced into an abnormal situation where they have to kindle or rekindle relations with one another. We get to see a lot of character development in both shows, with unique takes on situations and the plot gets thicker and thicker as the episodes continue but both are really not melodramatic at any point. Ano hana is much more dark and filled with ideas of how things could have been whilst kiznaiver covers more of the doing things part. Many faults of the characters are shown and solved and the ending of ano hana has a more bittersweet ending.Art- Artistically, this anime is excellent, with the attention to details that are maintained throughout the show for seemingly unnecessary things and the splash of colours here and there. The art definitely does match the anime as its over the top most of the time with a cartoony theme that just screams perfection. The character designs are entrancing and follow a classic with a modern flair twist to the art. The character designs did well to reflect the emotions of the characters in the scene incredibly well.

I just watched the entire thing for a second time, and I must say I loved the experience of watching it this time just as much as I did the first time.All of the characters are so diverse and yet each one of them are enjoyable characters. This anime made me genuinely laugh; and with how isolated and stressed I\'ve been feeling with all this COVID lockdown stuff, that\'s really saying something. I know that the main point of this anime isn\'t to be funny, but the characters and the unique bond they have...with each other just felt so real and uplifting as they really started to grow on each other.I think the main point of this anime was to really get the viewer to feel the pain the characters were feeling, and boy, did this anime deliver on doing that. There were love triangles all over the place. And to be honest, that did get a bit frustrating because I wasn\'t ever sure who would end up with who until the end, and I had couples I was seriously rooting for. But still, I liked that this anime didn\'t go the normal route of ""everybody gets what they want in the end, and the couples are exactly what you\'d expect them to be!""...Overall, I feel that this anime deserves much more praise and hype than its getting. Is it perfect? No - just like any anime out there, it does have a few things it could improve upon story-wise. But it was still very enjoyable and definitely worth a watch in my opinion. with each other just felt so real and uplifting as they really started to grow on each other.I think the main point of this anime was to really get the viewer to feel the pain the characters were feeling, and boy, did this anime deliver on doing that.

I really tried to push all the way through this anime but I found myself putting the dub on for the last two episodes I watched and barely paying attention. This show would be much better off if it didn't contain the absolute horrendous love plot that it does. The characters aren't memorable at all. The music is average. The visuals for TRIGGER are beyond sub par to me. Genuinely disappointed I did not like this series at all because I was excited to start it. Don't watch this.I wanted to end my review here but MAL...requires that reviews be a certain length. Well I'm not sure what else to write other than visceral comments. This show sucks ass.

It was serious (yet not too much of it) and the story was building up as it moved ahead (which was really good).I like how the characters start to grow up just as the anime moves ahead and it shows that they have some sort of experience that they have reached to the current point.The romance in this anime was also subtle until when the triangles are revealed which i found the delivery pretty cool.I also like how the connection is found among the random set of people and how they still stick by each other. For me,...in this story, the meaning of friendship is renewed as I can feel the emotions behind the characters.Though I am going to point out that I hate one character - Yamada Sensei as I dont understand which person would be so ruthless to sell their own students into such a predicament. Even when things turn for worse, he is the one to instigate them despite not being the villain. However his partner seems to have better sense.I could also see the selfishness of humankind as well as the selflessness in  a different manner through out the anime. Plus I got to see the carelessness of the head figure when it comes to taking care of the society.Overall, this is a great anime to watch as I did enjoy myself. in this story, the meaning of friendship is renewed as I can feel the emotions behind the characters.Though I am going to point out that I hate one character - Yamada Sensei as I dont understand which person would be so ruthless to sell their own students into such a predicament.

The emotions of love, hate, anxiety, sadness, etc. All of them combined into this masterpiece of an anime. The music was good as well as the character development. The Mc matured every episode as they each got closer and closer with each other. Forming...there bonds with one another and getting hurt , this anime was amazing. Agata and noriko from the start i thought they'd be together. The chemistry they have was great whereas chidori it just lacked that emphasis. Chidori throughout the season was just selfish and just wanted an unrequainted love. Tenga was a bro the whole series through and through, aong with yuta. Maki and nico grew on me over time but after 6 or 7 episodes i grew to appreciate their characters. The relationships at the end all made sense after completing the series.

However, I enjoyed it more than I thought I could.Story-------The story is based on fulfilling world peace by using individuals as lab rats to share their pain, physical and emotional. These individuals have to understand each other help each other with their pain. At first I thought this would be boring but the story was outstanding. The story follows the male protagonist showing that he recieves no pain so he doesn't mind if he...gets punched by bullies. As this experiment continues, he tries to learn more about himself and it is truly outstanding (10).Art and Sound------------------The art is the key piece in this anime.

It's like playing minecraft since alpha and suddenly putting shaders on for the first time. It is truly outstanding (10).The sound is passes you by seemingly. It's really nice and doesn't stand out too much which is what you want from sound. Even the opening had great music in synergy with the art, which is rare sometimes since I usually find myself skipping intros; not with this one. It is outstanding (10)Character------------All of the characters drawn and voiced are absolutely perfect, everyone is unique with amazing characteristics. Even the background characters have their essence. Katsuhira doesn't feel pain, Niko is a complete nonce; Noriko is elegant while retaining that final-boss essence; Chidori is the type who makes her feelings obvious without knowing it; Hajime is like a red-head version of Kenji off of School Rumble.

I only started watching the series because I saw a gif on tumblr that looked cute and began watching the series (only to find that the gif was from the very last 3 minutes of the entire series lol). The story was very emotional and knew how to keep it\'s audience up close and personal with the characters. I felt like the ending kind of tied everything together.Art 10/10I mean aside from some weird looking mid-frames the characters in their posture alone had an energy about them. Tenga...for example always had a presence like he was never static in a scene and when he did move he was expressive. The design of the characters themselves were fitting and unique, like nothing I\'d ever seen in an anime before. I really loved the fluid movements and the use of colour in any given scene . Very well thought out from an artisitic standpoint.Sound 10/10Again, connected the audience on a deep level. Even during quiet scenes there was that element of anxiety that the series intended for you to get from the lack of sound, and excited, action filled scenes were always heart racing and the music kept up with it. The voice actors were very suitable and I especially like Katsuhira and Tenga\'s voice actors!Character 8/10The villain could have had a better redemption arc. If anything that was the only flaw with the ending where they wrap it up like ""We\'re all fine now"" but the audience (or at the very least me) still couldn\'t really forgive the villain for what she did. And the purple theme character (his name escapes me right now) could have had a less uncomfortable signature trait. ASIDE FROM THAT the other characters were very enjoyable and I could relate to each of them personally and the struggles they were going through.Enjoyment 10/10It was never a dull moment with this anime and it was the same level of enjoyment the second time I watched it all the way through with my friend (who also loved the series).

I love the roller coaster of emotions towards the end and I like how it ended I guess. I\'m just dissatisfied that there wasn\'t closure for some characters. The ending sorta reminded me of the ending of ""Charlotte"".The art is absolutely amazing. The graphics were consistent and top notch through out the whole series and there never seemed to be any dull scenes. The scenery were all drawn to either compliment or intensify emotions being brought out by the scene....The music was outstanding as well.

I was just so disappointed with how they managed the plot. Most of the mechanics of the Kizna System weren\'t explained enough and we still don\'t know what really happened ""12 years ago"".Also they seemed to play around with character development too much, especially with Honoka. She just kept on going back and forth so her character development seemed a bit weird. And where the hell did the Nico ---> Tenga thing come from (Sorry if that counted as a spoiler, I just needed to point that out to prove a point.)? This is exactly why I think this series is also lacking in character development. It\'s understandable to focus on the main characters but simply letting character development fall off on other characters is a flaw.Over all, I really liked this series even if I was a bit disappointed.

Agata's situation, in particular, is a unique one as he suffers from a lack of apathy and an inability to feel pain.On paper, Kiznaiver seemed like it wanted to offer a stylish, yet interesting, commentary regarding personal communication between others with the Kizuna System being the means in which this theme is explored. The exploration of this is a bit hit-or-miss throughout Kiznaiver's run, but the positives of this...are still strong enough to prominently stick out and I will highlight these before covering the rather significant flaws of the series. A major positive for the series is the character exploration it offers up to several of its characters. A recurring theme with the major characters in Kiznaiver is how each one has dealt with loneliness. Kiznaiver takes some time to explore the personal dilemmas affecting several of the show's teenage cast to show how each have dealt with their issues before becoming involving with the Kizuna System project. This exploration led to some genuinely engaging plot developments with a couple characters, particularly Agata's unique situation and a personal trauma affecting Maki. The Kizuna System as a concept also has its effective moments to highlight the flaws of attempting an inter-linked system for people to know the thoughts and emotions of one another that shows that in spite of the potential barriers that direct communication offers for mutual understanding, it's still a better alternative than compromising your personal thoughts and pains through directly connecting them to others.In spite of these strong positives though, Kiznaiver's very premise does carry with it some major issues. The premise it attempts is a bit too grand to effectively pull off for a 12-episode series. This is quite noticeable in the anime's second half when its storytelling starts to take a hit quality-wise as it rushed with attempting more heavily dramatic and grand storytelling compared to the more grounded and mundane developments of the anime's first half. Some story elements in the second half explored have their moments they shone through such as more fleshing out of Noriko's character, but it still doesn't make up for the sloppy and rushed execution of the anime's second half. Another consequence of this issue is that a number of characters that make up part of the Kizuna System testing do get shafted in focus and depth due to the anime's limited episode count, thus limiting how much connection the audience could potentially develop with them. Perhaps if Kiznaiver were given a higher episode count or devoted another season to allow itself more time to develop its cast and premise, the series could have been a more cohesive package as a whole.As it is, Kiznaiver's high moments with its character focus and premise exploration shine through enough to make it an above-average offering as an anime in spite of its very premise being too grand to effectively explore in its 12-episode run. I would still at least recommend checking it out once as it what moments are effectively conveyed still make it a worthwhile watch. are still strong enough to prominently stick out and I will highlight these before covering the rather significant flaws of the series.

The Kizuna System as a concept also has its effective moments to highlight the flaws of attempting an inter-linked system for people to know the thoughts and emotions of one another that shows that in spite of the potential barriers that direct communication offers for mutual understanding, it's still a better alternative than compromising your personal thoughts and pains through directly connecting them to others.In spite of these strong positives though, Kiznaiver's very premise does carry with it some major issues. The premise it attempts is a bit too grand to effectively pull off for a 12-episode series. This is quite noticeable in the anime's second half when its storytelling starts to take a hit quality-wise as it rushed with attempting more heavily dramatic and grand storytelling compared to the more grounded and mundane developments of the anime's first half. Some story elements in the second half explored have their moments they shone through such as more fleshing out of Noriko's character, but it still doesn't make up for the sloppy and rushed execution of the anime's second half. Another consequence of this issue is that a number of characters that make up part of the Kizuna System testing do get shafted in focus and depth due to the anime's limited episode count, thus limiting how much connection the audience could potentially develop with them. Perhaps if Kiznaiver were given a higher episode count or devoted another season to allow itself more time to develop its cast and premise, the series could have been a more cohesive package as a whole.As it is, Kiznaiver's high moments with its character focus and premise exploration shine through enough to make it an above-average offering as an anime in spite of its very premise being too grand to effectively explore in its 12-episode run. I would still at least recommend checking it out once as it what moments are effectively conveyed still make it a worthwhile watch."", ""My feelings wanted to explode right now for this series but something just held me back after watching the last episode.I'll go straight to the point, Kiznaiver started out really strong mainly because of its art (damn it A+ graphics going on!) but plot-wise it was a bit hard and confusing to understand. Personally, I was hooked with the series but not to the point that I would spent countless nights thinking theories and rants as I sleep.Story: 8/10I felt the plot was in the middle of a sci-fi/mystery/romance tug of war with a pinch of slice of life. I did get that the...author wanted a solid plot for the series but I felt everything just went overflowing and was a bit strained or forced. I just wished the author went with a lighter and easier plot to digest for the audience because frankly, this anime really had a goo potential.Art: 10/1010 OVER 10. ENOUGH SAID.Character/Enjoyment: 8/10:I have no complains with the characters and I honestly did like them. I don't mind peeking through their loop holes because I find each character really easy to get a long with as you watch the series.Did I enjoy Kiznaiver? Yes... and 1/8 No.I was really expecting something with the last episode. Kiznaiver started real good and but I just felt that my expectations weren't met. Maybe because of the overwheming plot the author put in that made me pull  2 stars back from giving this series a 10. Or maybe my inner rage for the ships in the series (HAHA)? I just can't put it into words.Overall, I would still recommend Kiznaiver. If you want something fresh, good art (YES GOOD ART), and a mix of sci-fi/mystery/romance/slice of life going on.

Well, this anime captured that situation. Close enough, at least. So let's get to why this anime was so good.As usual, let's start with the plot: At first, I thought it'd be another anime with a normal protagonist meeting a girl and facing many obstacles. But I was wrong. It wasn't just focused on the MC, it was focused on all the characters. It was as if all 7 of them were main characters. Well, apart from Nico, but I'll get to that later. Usually, mixing genres would lead...to disaster, but this one had a mix of Romance and Slice of life in it, despite its Sci-fi and Supernatural elements, which was blended together well.In my opinion, the characters are what stood out to me the most. As stated before, it's like every one of them is the MC. And further character development only proved that. You may say that each of them are flanderized characters, but I digress. And with the help of the kizuna system, we actually see more to them than we expect. The only exception is Nico, who's basically there as a mascot. If it weren't for this flaw, I would've given this anime a 10/10.Art is good, as expected from the ones who made Gurren Lagann. But it's also because of the art style that made me realize some of the characters look similar to their previous shows.In conclusion, this anime wasn't bad, but not perfect. But as reviewers, it's our job to share our pain and feelings to everyone, just like the kizuna system.

So, are you ready to be a kiznaiver?"", 'I\'ll say this up front: Kiznaiver is essentially a collection of anime tropes, well-worn plot points and generic character archetypes. The thing is - that might be the point.Studio Trigger really pulled a fast one on me with Kiznaiver. Based on the premise, as well as Trigger\'s previous works (including Kill la Kill and Gurren Lagann (yes I know that\'s technically Gainax, but it\'s the same crew)), I had expected this to be a high-concept sci-fi romp with increasingly ludicrous scope and stakes as the show went on. The first episode did nothing to dissuade me of this belief, as we\'re introduced to a cast...of characters who, it seems, VERY INTENTIONALLY recall Trigger\'s previous hits (don\'t tell me that\'s not Kamina. That\'s definitely Kamina), who are bound together by some pseudo-science mumbo-jumbo so they share each others\' pain, and apparently also gain superhuman resiliance. Sounds like a setup for a pretty good techno-dystopian adventure, right? Throw in a sinister organization with limitless resources apparently led by a stonefaced, long-haired high schooler, and I\'m ready for Kill la Kill 2: More Clothes.But that\'s not what Kiznaiver is. What Kiznaiver IS is a high-concept slice-of-life in which a group of high schoolers are bound together by some pseudo-science mumbo-jumbo so they share each others\' pain, and then we learn a lot about their feelings. There is still a sinister organization with limitless resources apparently led by a stonefaced, long-haired high schooler, but the show veers away from the insane stakes of Kill la Kill or TTGL and instead focuses nearly entirely on the bedeviled pain-sharers and their growing relationships. It\'s Kill la Kill 2: More Feels (and also More Clothes).I can\'t help but feel that Trigger played we viewers\' expectations of their own work against us. The similarities between Sonozaki and Kill la Kill\'s Satsuki, for example, or Tenga and TTGL\'s Kamina are too strong to be mere coincidence. Even Niko is basically Mako with a bit of Nonon thrown in. The fact that this is ""only"" a slice-of-life show, albeit one with a sci-fi bent, seems to intentionally be a bit of a surprise, especially considering Trigger\'s body of work to date. They knew we would assume this was going somewhere crazy (possibly to the center of the galaxy, possibly to the planet of the life fibers), so instead they subverted our expectations by keeping things very intimate.Somehow, Kiznaiver manages to play to Studio Trigger\'s strengths while still being somewhat of a departure compared to their previous work. The animation is, it should go without saying at this point, gorgeous (this IS Trigger, after all), and the character designs are well-executed if extremely unoriginal (a bit more on that later). Through clever management of this limited cast and a reined-in storytelling style, Kiznaiver manages to tell a story that is at once personal and has far-reaching implications without getting lost in its own ambition. That alone is commendable, but doing that while also making the characters so darn likeable is impressive.The interesting thing about those characters is that every one of them is not much more than a classic anime archetype (with the notable exception of Hisomu) - you\'ve got your gutless protagonist, the cute neighbor/friend, the meathead with a heart of gold, etc. etc. There\'s even an estranged childhood friend! Early in the show not-Satsuki even shows a little slide deck with each of the main characters and their archetypical nicknames. This shows that the use of generic character archetypes is completely intentional, and instead of detracting from the quality of the show, contributes to a metatextual theme.And make no mistake - Kiznaiver IS a metatextual show. In most slice-of-life shows, we watch a group of characters live, love and laugh with little or no ""greater"" conflict - and generally the characters are all close friends by the end (if they weren\'t already). Kiznaiver actually writes into the plot itself a REASON for why all these mismatched archetypes would even spend time together in the first place - not an after-school club, but a sinister science experiment that literally binds their feelings together. There are characters that manipulate the main characters\' relationships - just like the writers of an anime. There\'s even a plotline about writing a manga that intertwines with the authors\' real-life romance! If it were any more metatextual, it\'d be FLCL. Kiznaiver is postmodern in its approach - this is a show ABOUT SoL anime - just like Trigger\'s other show this season, Uchuu Patrol Luluco, is a show ABOUT silly sci-fi adventures.But all this high-falutin\' literary trickery would just seem like masturbatory fluff if the show didn\'t also have a strong emotional throughline. Kiznaiver has a real heart, and I was moved quite strongly by the show several times. The characters are so well written that even though they\'re essentially tropes, you come to care about their relationships and the strength of their group friendship.All in all, Kiznaiver is an impressive little show with a mean postmodern literary bent and a liberal dose of feels. The animation, voice work and overall sound design are excellent, and while the plot isn\'t terribly deep, it\'s all pulled off with so much confidence and skill. Kiznaiver is very good - maybe just shy of the greatness Trigger\'s previous works achieved. This season, Studio Trigger boasted that they were going to ""save anime"" - if Kiznaiver is any indication, they might just be the heroes we need. of characters who, it seems, VERY INTENTIONALLY recall Trigger\'s previous hits (don\'t tell me that\'s not Kamina.

Kill La Kill was a visual and audio feast for the eyes and ears while Little Witch Academia was one of the most perfect short films I had ever seen. I was expecting a lot from Kiznaiver when I heard of its existence; did it live up to my hype?Story: 3/10The plot (and how it is presented to the watchers) is one of the tools that a content creator has at their disposal for telling a compelling and...complete story. Other things like audio and visual elements help the overall package of a movie/show but the plot is usually an important part of the puzzle. Kiznaiver unfortunately fell too close to the Kill La Kill camp when it came to its plot coherentness. It is obvious that Trigger wanted to make a character development driven show since the over-arching plot does a very poor job of connecting the dots. Why things happen and the “how” leading up to key events in this show are not really driven by plot elements; they are almost entirely character driven “through the power of love/friendship” (kind of like Interstellar). I really cannot give this part of the show any higher than 3/10 due to how the plot was presented. If the lack of story driven elements did not bother you in Kill La Kill then it won't bother you here.Animation: 9.8/10There are 3 great things about the animation in this show. The first was the background architecture and general visual aesthetics. This is a thing that when done really well it makes you really appreciate the creative minds behind the show. The buildings (and bridge), character clothes, and greenery were so amazing that each frame of animation could be a pretty decent background picture. It's obvious that they wanted to flaunt their stuff in this show; and they did. The second great visual thing Trigger accomplished in this show was something that was done really well in Kill La Kill; fluid scenes. The animation in general just flows really well in almost all situations. Fighting, walking, running, and standing conversation scenes just ooze with detail whether it is in motion or facial detail. The last great thing that this show flaunted was the character models. Yes some of the characters look like they were straight up ripped from other Trigger shows but they look great in this show too. The females were super cute and the males were believable. The voice support for each character helped make them more believable on screen but we will get to that in the sound part.Also wanted to point out that the lighting (in all conditions) was amazing. Freaking amazing lighting.Overall it was an amazing visual performance from start to finish.Sound: 9/10I don't normally comment on the opening/ending songs but I have to give props to the opening song by Boom Boom Satellites. It somehow fits in perfectly with the vibe of the show; I cannot really describe it. Onto the audio elements actually in the show, one reason why I am rating this section so highly is because the performance from the voice actors is absolutely out of the park. Each character has an extremely well done performance behind the microphone. They just fit in so well; I really do not know how else to describe it. Music used during the show was pretty good and it fit in when needed.Characters: 9.5/10This is what will make or break the show for a lot of watchers. If you do not like the cast after the first two episodes then you need to drop the show because the characters are the lifeblood of this show. There isn't a deep story being told in the background; it is literally the forming of the friendship between these strangers. I am rating this section so high because of how awesome the character interactions were in the entire show's running. It felt so tangible and fluid that I was honestly taken aback at first (especially since it is so good even early on in the first episode). Each character has a good amount of growth and towards the end you will start to either love or get pissed off at certain characters depending on who you are aligning with.Overall: 7.8/10I was worried that I was going to go too fanboyism on this review but after averaging all the components together, 7.8/10 feels just about right. The show did everything correct (even above and beyond on some elements) except falling flat on the “deep” plot that I was hoping would be present. If you want an amazing character driven show about strangers becoming friends that also incorporates some of the best visual and audio elements then this is absolutely a show for you. Trigger is getting better and better so you better watch out. I honestly cannot wait for the newly announced Little Witch Academia TV series to come out. It is going to be so freaking lit.Enjoyment: 8/10Thanks for reading my review!

It\'s easy to praise an anime this good that lacks magical girls, mecha and powered up transformations. I can easily say this is my second nominee for anime of the year. The hard part is explaining why it shouldn\'t win. Now before I get into that, let me reveal something here. This anime is a deconstruction of the stereotypical anime characters. That\'s why there\'s no clear villain, everyone takes their turn playing that role; with the other Kiznaivers playing the role of hero. And that\'s brilliant! It\'s a...real thinking persons anime which I love though is the bane of others. The humor is well balanced and well placed. And fan service doesn\'t come into play. This seems like the perfect anime. I don\'t want to build suspense so let\'s dive in.One: ""The world will know true pain, and fear of that pain will put an end to war...It will lead the world to stability and peace."" - Pain; Naruto. It\'s a increasingly annoying anime cliche now. It\'s like creators aren\'t reading works to the end to understand why ""the human instrumentality project"" is a bad ideal.Two: Sequel limbo. Do I want to see more of this? Is it a complete work? Is there more story to tell? I see room for more but is that what we want? One doesn\'t think this about top tier anime. I\'d want to see more but more seems to water down the whole. And I wouldn\'t want to watch these characters endure stereotypical high school anime episodes. The beach, summer festival, valentine\'s day, some one\'s birthday etc.Three: The end of heartache. So if it\'s not a sci fi adventure series it must be about unrequited love triangles. You know my least favorite thing in anime today. I won\'t spoil it here but I\'ll just say they had plenty of time to solve their problem. It just so high school.For the record my favorite character is Yoshiharu Hisomu and this is the primary reason why this otherwise great anime suffers from ""Beautiful, but not perfect syndrome."" I don\'t want to spoil anything here but my fundamental understanding of this character took away from this series a bit. Needless to say he\'s the character needed to bring this situation to a close, that\'s why he\'s introduced last. Any earlier and he can solve this problem. Were he motivated to do so. That\'s what made him great his motivations. Conclusion, watch it unless you\'re a die hard action fan. real thinking persons anime which I love though is the bane of others.

Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryWell, aside synopsis I can only tell that story had powerful and spiraling emotions. The whole system feels cruel, tragic but at the same time was a beautiful push for human bonds.I find it hard to review story without spoiling, but all I can tell it that story felt powerful, interesting and fairly unique. It could been a lot better if given more time. As lot of things felt very ""last minute plot pushing and expanding"". I feel more time for some of the drama and the...backstory of the whole research project should have been given. On top of that finale felt rather rash and spontaneous.But other than that it was beautiful storytelling about characters with their own issues, complexes and the bonds that grew between them. Sprouting into all sorts of emotions and offering fairly scarring emotional pain and strain of it.A splendid story especially if you can relate and understand the pain and all sorts of other dark feelings that were presented in this story.✦Art & SoundVisuals and animations were absolutely stunning.As for music/OST .. it was good, but didn\'t really impress me. Weren\'t fond of opening song as well.✦CharacterLong story short, various ""modern"" stereotypes that did somewhat annoy me at start but I grew onto most of them.Also did adore main character as I saw a lot of myself in him. Aside looks. But the whole ignoring the pain (in his case actually physically having reduced pain), the inability to understand himself and those around him. As well the whole avoiding people by giving in to them or simply ignoring them while being pushed around and so on. So he had his issues and was fairly stoic/robotic, but yet still as always those ""depressive"" Anime characters end up making me feel jealous especially because they tend to have someone who is beside him, love him and eventually expand into more bonds. Whenever it\'s strong friendship or romantic type of love with one of the female characters.#Skippable rant paragraph# This type of things somewhat anger me and gives another impact to solitude. Which kinda often wants me to be skilled director and make one actually depressing Anime and give it strong emphasize of losing self. Life long chaos and pain and on top of that a true loneliness, where is no magical ""childhood female friend who actually loves me and ends up being my savior"". And toss on top of that character being someone who lost control of his body as well thus make the MC round depressive character. Type of character that everyone hates (including himself) looks and personality wise and thus give grand finale of death that no one will care about anyways.ANYHOW.. I went a bit off topic, but moral of the story is MC is another depressive character that gets saved by people around him.All other characters also have their issues, quirks and pasts. But I feel that there is no need to explain them as well.There were also few interesting side-characters that somewhat got a bit too little weight of importance. Meaning I felt as they should gotten a bit more backstory and explanation. But well, 12 episodes is fairly limited.✦Enjoyment & OverallAll I can say is. Depressing story with fairly dark drama that blossoms beautifully and enjoyably.I did feel quite emotional quite a lot, loved the main MC (Katsuhira) and were intrigued about the whole scenario.I personally find it an interesting idea to share pain in literal meaning. But not for such ""grand and good"" reasons, but rather for reasons of simply wanting someone who just tells with ego ""get over it""  or ""just do that to fix that"" and so one to taste the pain someone lives in and then see if they shrug off fix in such an easy manner as they claim...Aside that, it was beautiful how Anime characters blossomed and how strong their bonds became and how caring, worrying they became of each other. That is the magic of fiction. To see, experience and enjoy things that do not exist in reality.Also, this Anime will get my TOPFAV tag.TDLR; Want to see powerful Anime of bonds and emotions with fairly grim plot and setting? Then check it out. If you are the type to not comprehend this or ""shrug off"" such things/feelings. Then don\'t bother. backstory of the whole research project should have been given. On top of that finale felt rather rash and spontaneous.But other than that it was beautiful storytelling about characters with their own issues, complexes and the bonds that grew between them. Sprouting into all sorts of emotions and offering fairly scarring emotional pain and strain of it.A splendid story especially if you can relate and understand the pain and all sorts of other dark feelings that were presented in this story.✦Art & SoundVisuals and animations were absolutely stunning.As for music/OST .. it was good, but didn\'t really impress me. Weren\'t fond of opening song as well.✦CharacterLong story short, various ""modern"" stereotypes that did somewhat annoy me at start but I grew onto most of them.Also did adore main character as I saw a lot of myself in him. Aside looks. But the whole ignoring the pain (in his case actually physically having reduced pain), the inability to understand himself and those around him. As well the whole avoiding people by giving in to them or simply ignoring them while being pushed around and so on. So he had his issues and was fairly stoic/robotic, but yet still as always those ""depressive"" Anime characters end up making me feel jealous especially because they tend to have someone who is beside him, love him and eventually expand into more bonds. Whenever it\'s strong friendship or romantic type of love with one of the female characters.#Skippable rant paragraph# This type of things somewhat anger me and gives another impact to solitude. Which kinda often wants me to be skilled director and make one actually depressing Anime and give it strong emphasize of losing self. Life long chaos and pain and on top of that a true loneliness, where is no magical ""childhood female friend who actually loves me and ends up being my savior"". And toss on top of that character being someone who lost control of his body as well thus make the MC round depressive character. Type of character that everyone hates (including himself) looks and personality wise and thus give grand finale of death that no one will care about anyways.ANYHOW.. I went a bit off topic, but moral of the story is MC is another depressive character that gets saved by people around him.All other characters also have their issues, quirks and pasts. But I feel that there is no need to explain them as well.There were also few interesting side-characters that somewhat got a bit too little weight of importance.

You can read it here: http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/oldsite/pom/pom_behaviourism_wittgenstein.htmIt represents the dilemma that we all share as human beings with minds. We can't know unless we communicate those feelings whether through language or facial expressions. By having the Kiznaiver experiment, it allows for them to feel the pain of others as well instead of having to understand it through another perspective..I feel this knowledge holds more truth because often times language cannot truly represent one's own emotion or...feelings such as pain. You can't truly know the pain unless you've experienced it yourselfWhy is this? Because pain for one person is not the same for the other person. Another person may have a higher tolerance to pain than another. Notice how the main character,  Katsuhira, has no pain at all..cannot feel pain..cannot truly comprehend the pain that everyone around him is going through. Even for people who understand pain, emotional pain..mental pain..are even more difficult to describe versus physical pain..and those vary tremendously among each individual.So in terms of story, I thought it was great in how it represented this. In terms of character, I thought it represented the many complexities that arrive when you try to understand another person's emotions and feelings. It started with physical pain and it led to more complex forms of pains such as emotional or mental which I think are the three main forms of pain.I probably did a terrible job in trying to describe this broad topic, but it really is a great philosophy. I really encourage people to read more into philosophy of mind and the many theories that are behind it. Even the crazy concepts like Descartes's dualism are great reads. I think this is what the main purpose of the series is about..understanding the limitations to communicating how you feel, but in the end, you don't have to truly understand pain to connect with someone. Despite not being able to truly know another person, you can still connect with them on a deeper level and that's the take-home of the ending of the series.Hopefully this will help some of you understand what was going on. feelings such as pain.

It’s name was Heroic Age. It wasn’t bad per se. It was just… really boring. The characters, the setting, the animation, and the everything. I tried watching it, in vain, three times but I always fell asleep.Anyways, after a string of many lost games in League of Legends last night, I finally decided...to get back into anime again. I spent a good while thinking about what to watch. Then, suddenly, Kiznaiver came to mind. I wanted something good. Something interesting. I knew Studio Trigger would deliver. Good or bad, whatever they make at least has you interested.Unlike most people who went into Kiznaiver thinking it to be another Kill la Kill or Inferno Cop (lol), I watched it knowing what to expect. Quite a number of people who watched the show while it was airing complained that it was rather slow, never went anywhere, or the characters were one-dimensional. Hell, some viewers even lamented the fact that it was nothing like Kill la Kill. Absolutely no fan-service whatsoever.Kiznaiver is Trigger’s first attempt at trying something different. All of its shows till now have been either parodies, focused on action, or both. Even Little Witch Academia follows this. I, for one, am glad that Kiznaiver is very different from Trigger’s usual works.Simply put, Kiznaiver is a mild case of character study. It doesn’t just lightly touch it’s subject matter nor does it go fully into psychological territory. It is very apparent from the second episode of Kiznaiver that it is a show meant for fun with a bunch of melodrama here and there. Exactly what I thought it would be.So how come, you would ask, Kiznaiver interested me so? Well, other than the characters themselves, it was mainly because of the huge plot device that is known as the ‘Kizuna System’.The Kizuna System is basically just having surgery performed on the seven main characters so that if one of them has pain inflicted on them then they all feel. Over the course of the show, as the Kizuna System progresses, if one of the ‘Kiznaivers’ feels any strong emotion then that emotion is felt by all of them. Then we go into reading the heart. Interesting concept, no? But, like I said before, the Kizuna System is just one big plot device. Without the Kizuna System, the anime would just have been an over-dramatic slice of life. This plot device helps create a balance – giving you the false illusion that something evil is afoot. This helps keep the oddities of the characters and their behavior in check and helps the anime not into Korean soap-opera territory.Now, to the meat of Kiznaiver. The characters!Katsuhira Agata is the main focus, in regards to the characters, of Kiznaiver. He is devoid of emotion and cannot feel physical pain. An emo without the trademarked black look. Along with his childhood friend, Takashiro Chidori, he and a six other students from his class are abducted and chosen for the Kizuna System experiment. They are told they have to expose themselves to each other for the sake of the experiment. For the sake of world peace.A point to note: no matter what angle you analyze the Kizuna System from, there is no logical explanation for HOW it will help attain world peace. Even the show doesn’t explain how. So, while being an effective plot device, the Kizuna System is also one of Kiznaivers biggest cons.Anyways, back to the characters.Tenga Hajime is the thug who secretly has a huge heart. Yuta Tsugihoto is the spaz who pretends to be what he’s not – an arrogant tool. Niyama Niko is an eccentric Hollywood blondie who pretends to be eccentric because she thinks she isn’t (whewie). Maki Honoka is… well it would be a spoiler. And, finally, Hisomu Yoshiharu is a masochist in denial who, in my opinion, is the most rational character in the show.All of these guys and gals are gathered by Sonozaki Noriko who is adamant in proving the success of the Kizuna System for it has already failed before.Seeing of all these characters interact with each other and step out from their single dimension into the third is a fascinating treat. With grounded and witty dialogue, the characterization comes out just great. Exactly what it feels like when I talk to my friends. Yes, even Nico.It’s a shame that a lot of viewers just went with the first judgment of the characters and deemed them to be caricatures till the end of the show. Kiznaiver is slice of life disguised as action (but there is no action at all) so a lot people were left bored during the middle of the show which was just character development for the finale. I’m not really sure if this is a fault in direction, script, or Trigger’s image itself. Oh well, you win some and you lose some.Kiznaiver’s music is OK, I guess. The opening ‘Lay Your Hands On Me’ by Boom Boom Satellites which bloody amazing for me since that kind of electronica and rock usually doesn’t sit well with me. The ending wasn’t bad – just that I’ve heard a lot of songs like it so I just skipped it. As for the background music, nothing special. The hard violin, techno and beats certainly suited the show but overall, nothing memorable.The animation is gorgeous. For once Trigger got its budget under control and created a show with no slacking in animation. The character designs are a neat break from the usual fare you see in modern anime. Light and long bodies with a lot of curves and fluidity topped by a bright color palette. Good stuff.If Kiznaiver had a thorough quality check for its plot then it would truly have been something special. But, the Kizuna System’s flaws and the contrived wishy washy ending deal a serious blow to it’s overall goodness. Also, the world building needed some polishing too. No matter how good the characterization in a show is, without a properly fleshed out plot you’re not going have many heads rolling and that’s a damn shame.Right as the show ended, I thought it was an 8.5/10 in my book. But, today after giving it some thought, I think it objectively deserves a 6/10 at most. But it’s a 7/10 for me thanks to the fun I had watching the characters grow. Since this is a review, I'll input the 6.Recommended for those slow nights when you suddenly feel like ringing up some friends but can’t because they’re busy.

Or if you don’t have friends and feel like wanting to make some."", 'The thing about interesting premises is that, as well conceived as they are, they do not alone a great series make. There are many masterpieces of anime out there with intricate plots and layers upon layers of mystery, but there are just as many slice-of-life series in which nothing extraordinary happens, and which stand out all the same because of good execution.And, of course, we have stuff like Kiznaiver — which starts from a good, solid scenario, but fails to live to its potential because of how clumsily it’s carried out.Kiznaiver is a production of Studio Trigger, a name we have learned to associate...with the outlandish and bizarre. It’s the studio first original effort after the success of Kill la Kill, and it owes to it — as well as Gurren Lagann — some character designs and themes. Hiroshi Kobayashi, who has worked in series such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Psycho-Pass, is the main director here.Like I said, the premise is intriguing: we start with our main character, an apathetic high school student by the name of Katsuhira Agata, being abducted and undergoing forced surgery to become a Kiznaiver; that is, to be psychically linked to five other teenagers so that, when one of them suffers a wound, the whole group feels the pain. The whole experiment is supervised by a mysterious stoic girl called Noriko Sonozaki, who will stop at nothing to get the results she wants. Together, Katsuhira and his fellow Kiznaivers — overprotective childhood friend Chidori Takashiro; teenage delinquent Hajime Tenga; troubled ice queen Honoka Maki; snotty casanova Tsuguhito Yuuta; cutesy space-case Nico Niiyama; and strangely mature masochist Yoshiharu Hisomu — must learn to navigate their strengthening bond, as well as solve the enigma behind the conception of this Kizuna System.And, from reading this last paragraph, you must have noticed what I believe is the greatest issue with Kiznaiver: way too many characters to properly develop in twelve episodes. The series would have done better in a 24-episode format, or maybe as something with a little less focus on human relationships; as it is, there simply isn’t time to go deeply into all of the Kiznaivers’ personalities, or to show them bonding with each other in a realistic way. Add to that how ridiculously impractical the Kizuna system is, and how there’s no good explanation for the people involved hold, and it’s harder and harder to buy into the story.Since the plot relies so heavily in character work, it falls apart when said character work doesn’t follow through. The Kiznaivers face harrowing situations to strengthen their bonds but, even accounting for stress as a catalyst, it’s hard to believe they could become that attached to each other; when the characters start visibly suffering due to their relationships, the experience is undermined by the fact that they met less than two weeks ago. It’s a little bit like watching Takumi proclaim his concern over the multitude of girls he just met when every other episode of ChäoS;HEAd has shown him to be completely uninterested in the outside world — although, to Kiznaiver’s credit, it never quite reaches that level of nonsense.(What really bugs me about this is that, while the aforementioned ChäoS;HEAd was struggling to adapt the history of a visual novel within twelve episodes, Kiznaiver is not an adaptation of anything… which means the people responsible for creative decisions did all of this on purpose. WHY.)Now, not everything is a tragedy; when it comes to technical aspects, Kiznaiver delivers. The character design, though slightly derivative, is *gorgeous*, refined, and more beautiful than anything the studio had released before. Even if it isn’t used as cleverly as in Kill la Kill, the animation is fluid and smooth; it’s easy to recognize and appreciate the studio’s frantic, fast-paced signature style. The ending of episode 10 alone is worth the existence of the entire project. As for the musical score, I can’t remember anything in particular about it, which means it must have served its purpose without too much dissonance; I think the real jewel here is the ending sequence, with the combination of the soft-spoken vocals and the animation of the girls that hits all of the right places.Also worthy of note is the voice actors’ work; they move the series along when the story doesn’t. As usual, Yuuji Kaji delivers a stunning performance as Katsuhira Agata, using his impressive range to move easily from a quiet voice to a yelling protagonist when the character needs him to. I was not acquainted with their work before, but both Hibiku Yamamura and Yuka Terasaki carry their characters nicely, in opposite ways; if Chidori’s speech in episode 5 hits home, it’s all due to Terasaki’s amazing voice work. The other actors pull their weight, lending voice to their characters in ways we’ve come to expect from their other performances; for example, Hajime Tenga doesn’t show all the range Tomoaki Maeno is capable of, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t do his utmost to bring the character to life.In the end, however, Kiznaiver is proof that it takes more than a good idea and cool visuals to sell a series — you need planning, coordination and, maybe, some down-to-earthness to recognize when the project is getting away from you. It’s not, like, an affront to mankind, or something that will burn your brain if you watch; but it pales in comparison with other series in the same year and even with the rest of Studio Trigger’s catalogue. with the outlandish and bizarre.

The story started great, different from what I have seen so far but towards the end, it went completely downhill...I like the idea of the anime - sharing pain, emotions, and thoughts with other people, but the execution in the series was not good in my opinion.At first, I really enjoyed everything and was ready to rate the anime at least a solid 8, but then at one point, the plot started turning into this forced love drama, which was honestly so annoying to watch... It makes me so angry...even talking about it.*spoiler alert*Let\'s take Niko for example, her character is adorable, she ""believes"" in fairies, wants to be friends with everyone, etc. All great. And then suddenly turns out she is into Tenga??? why was this necessary? She is interesting enough on her own, there was no need for her to be added to the \'love drama\'... There isn\'t any indication of her being into him in the whole duration of the series. If she were to like someone I would\'ve expected it to be Maki and honestly, that would\'ve made a lot more sense. It would\'ve even added to the plot a lot more than her being into Tenga.And then ofc let\'s talk about our beloved main character Kacchon... I love him honestly, or at least I did until his crazy obsession with Sonozaki became too much for me.Alright, I get it the boy has past childhood trauma but was that whole love drama even necessary? The story would\'ve been a whole lot better if he ended up with his not-totally-out-of-her-mind childhood friend -  Chidori. It could\'ve been such a cute story and it would\'ve made sense - she confessed that she liked him at the beginning of the anime... I don\'t even need to explain, it all adds up if you\'ve watched it. But no... then the Sonozaki obsession goes too far. Seriously I loved her character too, but this witch is totally out of her mind! I get why Kacchon is so interested in her, especially bearing in mind the flashbacks he was having, however it would\'ve been enough if they just ended as friends. It is extremely unrealistic that he still \'loves her so much\' when he didn\'t even remember her at first and they were only spending time together for a short amount of time as children. I really hate how she intervened with everything and overcomplicated things.The anime could\'ve been great without the whole \'love drama\' aspect and even if there were to be some couples I think those would be the ones that would make total sense and add to the story:Chidori and Kacchon - childhood friends, neighbors, she always takes care of him, he begins to get his emotions back and understands her feelingsHonoka and Niko - Niko is so keen on being friends with Honoka, but she refuses bc of her past trauma yet Niko reminds her so much of her beloved Ruru that she gives love a second try // or Yuta and Honoka - idk they just had some cute moments and he seemed to care a lot about her, so I think they would be a cute couple.The other characters are great on their own in my opinion. Everyone would\'ve just become best friends and Sonozaki would join them. Happy ending.In conclusion - all characters are great on their own, the idea is also great, however, the story got ruined because they forced it too much and it became a very annoying soapy love drama at the end. even talking about it.*spoiler alert*Let\'s take Niko for example, her character is adorable, she ""believes"" in fairies, wants to be friends with everyone, etc. All great. And then suddenly turns out she is into Tenga??? why was this necessary? She is interesting enough on her own, there was no need for her to be added to the \'love drama\'... There isn\'t any indication of her being into him in the whole duration of the series. If she were to like someone I would\'ve expected it to be Maki and honestly, that would\'ve made a lot more sense. It would\'ve even added to the plot a lot more than her being into Tenga.And then ofc let\'s talk about our beloved main character Kacchon... I love him honestly, or at least I did until his crazy obsession with Sonozaki became too much for me.Alright, I get it the boy has past childhood trauma but was that whole love drama even necessary? The story would\'ve been a whole lot better if he ended up with his not-totally-out-of-her-mind childhood friend -  Chidori. It could\'ve been such a cute story and it would\'ve made sense - she confessed that she liked him at the beginning of the anime... I don\'t even need to explain, it all adds up if you\'ve watched it. But no... then the Sonozaki obsession goes too far. Seriously I loved her character too, but this witch is totally out of her mind! I get why Kacchon is so interested in her, especially bearing in mind the flashbacks he was having, however it would\'ve been enough if they just ended as friends. It is extremely unrealistic that he still \'loves her so much\' when he didn\'t even remember her at first and they were only spending time together for a short amount of time as children. I really hate how she intervened with everything and overcomplicated things.The anime could\'ve been great without the whole \'love drama\' aspect and even if there were to be some couples I think those would be the ones that would make total sense and add to the story:Chidori and Kacchon - childhood friends, neighbors, she always takes care of him, he begins to get his emotions back and understands her feelingsHonoka and Niko - Niko is so keen on being friends with Honoka, but she refuses bc of her past trauma yet Niko reminds her so much of her beloved Ruru that she gives love a second try // or Yuta and Honoka - idk they just had some cute moments and he seemed to care a lot about her, so I think they would be a cute couple.The other characters are great on their own in my opinion. Everyone would\'ve just become best friends and Sonozaki would join them. Happy ending.In conclusion - all characters are great on their own, the idea is also great, however, the story got ruined because they forced it too much and it became a very annoying soapy love drama at the end.', 'The idea behind it is pretty genius if you ask me, I was really excited for it but then I saw some reviews saying it was a let-down so I was only mildly excited going in. This was a bit different than I imagined but it explored all kinds of possibilities with the ""you get hurt, I get hurt"" scenario and I really appreciate that. When it\'s funny, it\'s really funny, when it\'s not, it\'s serious.This is from the team behind Kill la Kill which I\'m sure you already know, but the style shows for it even though I never watched Kill la Kill,...I can tell just from  what I do know about it. There are some dark moments and humor which is to be expected from the team above but don\'t expect a bunch of blood or gore or anything, there isn\'t a whole bunch of action sequences like Kill la Kill, this is more grounded and has more of a focus on character.Chidori is my favorite character of this anime but all of them have something to bring to the table and they individually go through that. The whole ""seven sins"" thing was kind of pointless and didn\'t make much sense, maybe it\'s something of Japanese culture that I don\'t know of but it wasn\'t really necessary for the storytelling. There\'s also a certain thing that happens towards the end regarding Kacchon\'s apathy that I think they could have gone a little deeper into to answer more questions but it\'s fine. The anime has some nice messages and is overall pretty good. I can tell just from  what I do know about it.

Fresh and popping animation, Trigger at its best, oversaturated summer frenzy vibes.Really nice and exotic music that adds a lot to the aesthetic allure.Story wise is quite good, mostly character driven.If you've watched AnoHana you'll soon be able to guess, without even checking, that it was written by the same author. Same concept, only in a sci-fi context.Much more drama and love dynamics between the teenage characters, sometimes to the point of being histeric, but in a cathartic way.

The artwork is a delight to look at and the animation and some of the shots are downright gorgeous. The soundtrack is also marvelous.Where Kiznaiver fails, however, is that it sets for itself lofty goals.Kiznaiver tries to tell a character based story but doesn't have enough runtime to do so. To say that the pacing is breakneck is an understatement. Most of the characters remain underdeveloped, which is a crime. The show tries to take the audience high up in the sky, perhaps too close to the sun, but never really reaches...those lofty heights it aims for because of the limited number of episodes. This is one show I wish that the studio had taken more time to flesh out the narrative with. At least with 20+ episodes. Probably less than 30 would have made it an easy 10, but we never get to know the characters long enough and so any empathy and pathos doesn't really connect.If there's going to be a large cast of characters and the episode count is low then I suppose that's just the natural outcome of the narrative is that it is going to receive a rushed job and the pacing is going to be wildly off. I get that writing can be difficult and most of the time writers would rather commit suicide than continue to put words to page, but there's really no excuse for being lazy. And that really is what the script is. Neat premise, though. those lofty heights it aims for because of the limited number of episodes.

It allows us to be closer to one\'s feelings and get the exact idea of what they are thinking and how they are feeling at the moment. While the idea of bonding through pain and suffering may be a solid one, is it okay to feel everything that someone else feels? Is it okay to understand all the pain of the person the moment it hits them? Is it really okay to understand through pain and not words?Kiznaiver is a system that connects...individuals through their pain and distributes them evenly among all those connects to give everyone a jolt of what the other is feeling, be it physical pain or an emotional one. Connecting through wounds really does seem like a good idea unless we connect with our hearts and know the things that are better when expressed with words. These are the emotions that belong to the person feeling them, and he/she has all the right to express them in words, for these ultimately create a bond between others that hearts can never hope to achieve. The pain tells us that it\'s okay to be hurt and in misery as long as we have someone with whom we can talk it out and share the pain that we felt. The Kiznaiver system hoped to create a world where everyone was connected through pain, to achieve ultimate peace and happiness but what happens later is something you must see for yourself.The animation on the anime is really good as each episode deals with utmost care and this helps the anime to just reach one level higher.

I wanted to like this anime but it\'s a no from me.', 'Hiya,Just finished the anime and I wanted a place to dump my thoughts on it. Kiznaiver follows a group of 7 characters that are forced to test out experimental technology that connect each of them by their pain. Essentially if one person feels pain, that pain is split 7 ways between that person and the others. I think this anime has an incredibly vibrant and dynamic art style (it is Studio Trigger after all) and the main themes resonated pretty deeply with me. While the story kept me entertained all the way to the end, there are some questionable events and motives, and this anime...suffers from overexplaining every little detail, as if the audience couldn\'t piece the simplest inferences together.I thoroughly enjoyed watching the characters develop a strong friendship as a result of the system, and I also enjoyed how the anime showcased the terrible consequences that it could entail. This anime pushes the good old message about the importance of empathy (quite literally). Being able to share in this common experience brought these misfits together, and sharing pains and later emotions helped them understand each other. But, as the experiment runs on, certain characters fall for each other, and the anime for two episodes turns into some kind of weird love polygon (as each character can feel the love of each other character). This leads to a constant bounce of extreme jealousies and heartaches, which soon overloads the system and puts each participant in a loop of constant pain. Humans aren\'t built to literally take on the mental burdens of other people\'s emotions, so over exposure to the acumination of extreme emotions felt by multiple individuals on each other was bound to overrun the boundaries of safety.After the characters lose the system and part ways, they all realize they miss the friendship they had. One character brings all of them together, they all confront the antagonist, and its happily ever after. As human being we all have a Kiznaiver system built into us. We don\'t need to be literally connected to the feelings of other people to have at least a basic understanding of what other people are going through. While being the catalyst for the friendship, the bonds each character shared wasn\'t reliant on the system. It simply opened their eyes to being more aware of how other people felt, and thus opened the possibility for mutual understandings. There\'s a scene in the show where the characters are shocked to feel empathy. Even though the Kiznaiver system has been removed they all feel pain in their hearts for the misfortune of one of their friends, and they\'re all like ""Why do I feel this way?"" It felt like watching AIs discovering what it meant to be human lol. But, I guess that was the entire point of show.Now on to the more iffy parts of the show. I absolutely hated listening to the over explanation of every little detail of the show. For example, we find out about the backstory of the main antagonist, and anyone with a functioning brain would be able to tell how the antagonist\'s past fueled her present motives, yet even that had to be ruined by incessant dialogue spelling out everything. Also, many of the main plot points and event like the finale didn\'t really make sense. How did a small covert and dying organization have the manpower to conduct such a Danganronpa ass takeover of the city? Why did the green haired teacher run the same exact experiment on his current students when his biggest regret was how the experiment affected his previous subjects? Although it has its downsides, I found Kiznaiver to be plenty entertaining, and I though it shined at what it was good at.

Infact, all the characters of Kiznaiver have designs that go well with them as a person. The story is what really drew me in. It's about a city that seems to be normal, but is a giant experiment to see how people connect through pain and suffering. It was an...interesting concept that I hadn't seen done before in animes.

Kiznaiver delivers a memorable story with complex and interesting characters, a decent plot, and a fucking awesome op!While the art might be the strongest element Kiznaiver has to offer, the amazing cast of characters comes pretty close too. There are 8 main characters and while that might seem like quite a lot, Kiznaiver seems to pull this off really well. Out of the 8, the narrative focuses most on Katsuhira Agata (so out of everyone he would be the main protagonist) but it still manages to make time for the other characters so the viewer gets acquainted with everyone on an equal level by the end of the story.Nobody felt like a background character in the friend group because they were all treated like real individuals who had their own lives to deal with! We clearly get to glimpse into their wants, struggles, and worries. Nobody felt like they were only there to serve a generic character purpose like being the ""pretty friend"" or the ""athletic friend"" or the ""funny friend"". By the end, all of them felt like fully fleshed out, fundamentally flawed human beings that truly grasp at your heartstrings.As for the plot, it\'s essentially a character-driven story that deals with themes of pain, empathy, communication, forgiveness, and being able to forge genuine connections through friendship (and possibly something more too, cough *love* cough). Does that sound kinda corny to you? Don\'t worry because Kiznaiver tackles these topics with maturity and doesn\'t spoon-feed you the morals.Lastly, the op is hype as fuck! And that\'s saying a lot coming from me, a mere mortal who usually skips anime openings (gasp! I know, how dare I?), who could not resist how bloody awesome this opening was! The song ""Lay Your Hands on Me"" was just such a flawless pick-- it along with the art style in the opening credits were absolute perfection! It was definitely a notable introduction to the anime: with a lively song to kick things off, an amped-up color scheme to display the animation quality and making fun, stylistic character design choices to showcase their individual personalities.Overall, I highly recommend it!

Kiznaiver is an anime that explores the depth of relationships, bonds, and expression. A deeper meaning can be expressed through its theme of ""sharing of pain"" which is prevalent throughout the entire anime , through the kizuna bonds. It accurately demonstrates the emotions of the characters, thoughts of the characters, and the extent of these categories. The demonstration of such categories allows us, as the watcher to be slowly etched into the reoccurring theme of the story which is primary based upon relationship bonds.This series boasts an art style that is unique...to Studio Triggers, a clean style with minute details which accentuates the appearance of each character. The animation i\'d say is ahead of its time in 2016, boasting quick cut scenes and no odd 3D CGI scenes that we all detest. The voice acting for this anime was superb, the voice actors did an incredible job in demonstrating the emotions of the characters and the tension within various moments within the anime. The changes in tone and volume expresses the weight of each scene accurately. The \'music\' however was quite lackluster, it did not surprise me, it was really just slightly below average sounding very mechanic. However, despite this lackluster music, i do believe the placement of the music was superb in brining out the story in each scene.All in all, despite its slight shortcomings in terms of audio, i thoroughly enjoyed this series. The romance elements were well demonstrated though not overpowering the story. The anime was made in such a way that all the other factors in the anime did not deter the watcher from the main meaning behind it , which was ""bond"" . In the final scenes i felt a deep sense of satisfaction and a slight forlorn sense as the anime was coming to an end. Sadly, there looks to be little hope in a season 2 as the anime ended off quite conclusively with the shut down of the kizuna project and the Main cast each finding their own romance and place in society. to Studio Triggers, a clean style with minute details which accentuates the appearance of each character.

Trigger Studio has been one of my favorites because of their unique art style and addiciting soundtracks. But behind all of that, this show\'s story did not interest me at all.From my perspective, I feel like they took a meaningful and broad statement, tried to make it perform as a literal sense (even though it\'s an abstract concept) and executed poorly. The characters felt too forced to be categorized and one dimensional. For example, Yuta. He\'s the ""flirty"" character but has a dark past and likes someone plain...despite his popularity amongst girls in his class. How his character progressed during the story, especially on Maki\'s episode, did not change my perspective of him.That\'s one of the issues for this show, the characters lacked dimension and was hard for me to enjoy any of them. Chidori is your typical, goody two shoes that likes the protagonist but has a hard time confessing their love to them. I never found her interesting even though she showed her vulnerable side. And that applies to all of the main cast. Even though they showed the side that is opposite to their main personality, it felt too forced for the audience to like them. Basically, I did not enjoy none of the characters because of their forced stereotypes they are put into. I find this ironic, since Shinozaki mentioned that they named the students ""The Seven Deadly Sins,"" but has stated later that none of them fit the roles.Also, I realize that most of the characters are being selfish once their emotions were being put out. Well, it can\'t be help though. Human emotions are complex.Another major issue was the dissonant tone within the plot. There were forced dramatic and comedic scenes that ruined the flow of the story line. It made me confused on which emotion I should feel to connect to a certain scene. I feel like they did that to get the audience\'s attention, but it didn\'t work so well.I found that as I progressively move closer to the final episodes, I kept skipping scenes. After finding out the truth behind the Kizna System, I\'ve already predicted the ending and the buildup didn\'t do a good job keeping me interested. In addition to that, Shinozaki\'s selfishness is what also made me skip a lot. You don\'t have to let people experience your pain for them to understand. Just hearing you out is enough for them to comfort you, that\'s all. That mf can take psychology classes istg-However, the scenery and art style is amazing, as expected from Trigger. The character designs matches their personality, and the details whenever it\'s a close up shot of a character is eye-catching. Sadly, the story didn\'t match up.Overall, I understood its meaning and what sort of message this anime show has to offer, but it didn\'t execute appropriately. Instead, there was a lack of fluidity, plenty of dissonant tones, and bland character tropes.

The art of this anime first was like, AMAZING, and that was the only pull it had on me then I actually watched it. I watched it all in 2 days, it was so good.First of all, I love all the characters, we have such a good variety and everyone gets good screentime to share their stories and be a part of the plot. The characters aren't very dull, and if you consider their looks dull, their personality makes up for. The anime's artstyle is so bright and colorful, and...conveys the actions and expression of each character very well.

It should be, then, an anime about human relationships, specially friendship, and on how empathy, or the lack of it, shapes the way we relate to other people.And it is to some extent an anime about that. Yet I feel that way too much time was wasted on comic scenes and side stories, specially in the first episodes, leaving thus what should have been the main theme of the anime mainly to few scenes of...the last episodes.I must say though that in those scenes some beautiful words are indeed said by the protagonists about friendship, love and emotions. However, they would have counted much more if only the anime had spent more time showing the characters actually getting to know each other better rather than engaging in some random chase scenes just for action's sake.So, overall, it's a fine anime on human relationships - which had though the potential to be much more than just 'fine'. the last episodes.I must say though that in those scenes some beautiful words are indeed said by the protagonists about friendship, love and emotions.

Captain Kirk, Star Trek V: The Final FrontierI read about this anime a few years ago, but I didn\'t give it a chance until now. So, was Kiznaiver any good? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?StoryThe premise of this anime (people sharing an emotional connection through pain) is inherently silly; then again, every single anime out there is silly to a certain extent, and to Kizaniver\'s credit, it\'s able to make that premise work. That said, the show is so obsessed with its own message and themes that I found it...a bit self-important sometimes. Every 5 minutes or so, the characters talk about how much they need to share their feelings and their pain with somebody else and that it\'s not right to keep those feelings bottled up. The message is certainly in the right place but it could have been handled a lot better. (6/10)CharactersI found it hard to care about Katsuhira and his group of friends when they are forced to hang out with each other by the most artificial of circumstances. While they do develop a genuine bond and become mildly better people at the end of the story, it takes them the entirety of the show\'s run to do that and they certainly tested my patience along the way. It was also hard for me to care about Katsuhira and Noriko\'s love story (if you wanna call it that) because it feels so bland and predictable and the show tries to force viewers into caring about them rather than let viewers care about the characters and their struggles in their own terms. (7/10)ArtAs expected of a TRIGGER production, Kiznaiver is a visual marvel. Everything, from the characters to the backgrounds, looks so beautifully designed. If nothing else, you can enjoy Kiznaiver for its technical merits. (8/10)SoundsThe soundtrack is nothing special, but the vocal performances were incredible. Some of you are probably gonna criticize Rylan Strachan (Katsuhira) for sounding bored and sleepy and Natasha Strickey (Noriko) for sounding like a computer, but that\'s exactly the point. The problem with the characters wasn\'t the VAs, but rather the material the VAs were given to work with. (7/10)ConclusionIn closing here, I did enjoy Kiznaiver but it took its sweet time to become good and I found it a bit self-important melodramatic. The message and themes of Kiznaiver have been done better by other works of fiction, but fortunately, Kiznaiver doesn\'t need to be a masterpiece in order to be enjoyable. I don\'t need every anime I watch to be a life-changing experience, I just need them to be good stories and Kiznaiver accomplishes that.

I'm probably in the minority for saying this, but the backstory for the main two characters Agata and Sonozaki (i.e. being raised in the experimental facility, etc.) felt really lame, and for how hard this show tried to make me care about these two characters, I just couldn't.The development of the side characters, or rather secondary-protagonists, was pretty good though. I cared about them. The character arc for Maki in particular was spectacular, and is one of the redeeming qualities of the show.Another thing, this show looked INCREDIBLE; one of...the greatest, if not the greatest looking anime I've seen to date.

(If...there’s one. I wish) -_____- there’s one. I wish) -_____-', '(So there is a little mess up on this OVA. There is only one episode so I will be reviewing that. Episode 0 will be in Is this a Zombie? Of the Dead OVA since I see that one being part of the second season.)There is not really any reason why this OVA actually exists. In fact, I also don’t understand why the last episode of the first season actually exists as well but that’s in itself something I shouldn’t really talk about because of spoilers. This OVA is supposed to be based between the first and second season but they really don’t talk...about what happen in the first season, don’t hint to what’s going to happen in the second, and just seems to have its own little short story adventure.When talking about the characters, their personalities really have not changed all that much. We still have the basic premise of the characters with the over active Haruna, the rather bland Ayumu, and the rather harsh tsundara Sera. We do end up getting a little bit of reasoning behind some things they do, like for example why Sera wants to cook, but it makes me wonder why they couldn’t of just put that into the main story line. It was actually a rather decent story that didn’t take up to much time, so why have it in an OVA where it really wouldn’t make much difference. This was something that would help define her character in the main series but they put it in with all the extra stuff.We sadly get very little of Eucliwood, sort of pushing her to the side. I don’t know why they just through her to the side but they did. Instead, we seem to have some stories focus on the side characters that really had no real place in the main story. Characters like Taeko Hiramatsu. Don’t know her? Well she is the girl that seems to show up in the background and has twin-tails in her hair. Ya… I didn’t get who she was either till the strange short story talking about her. What does she have to do with the main story? Absolutely nothing, just a side character that likes Ayumu from a distance and never actually says she likes him.I think the only character that they changed the personality out of the blue was one of Sera’s friends from her village. Saras(yes, I understand how close that name is to Sera’s but I did not make it) seemed to turn from rather cold and strict to a bit of a pervert when it comes to Ayumu’s ass. Just... right out of the blue, she seems to keep staring at it and says she can’t get enough of it.Can I ask this though, was it really necessary to center in on all the perverted shots… including the ones on Ayumu’s ass? I know OVA’s are known for showing off a woman’s body and they are trying to do a parody off that showing the guy as much as the girls… but I mean really. I do like though that they do ask a burning question a lot of fan girls are probably asking. What is that you may ask? Why it seems to be what Ayumu’s preference is of course. Is it top or bottom?… ya… I didn’t really want to know that but that’s just what this OVA seems to want to show so I’m guessing the fans really wanted to know.The artwork is just the same as season one, rather good looking for the most part although I kept feeling grossed out when they centered in on the crotch shots. Since it is an OVA, they went all out in showing what they could not show on TV without making it a hentai. I’m glad they stayed away from making it a hentai but it’s so close that I felt slightly violated. Again, I do feel I understand why they do some of the things they do, being a parody of all the other genres makes it easy for me to think that the OVA was being a parody of OVAs, but still.The voice actors are really good as well, seeming to all of been from the first series. I like that they kept these voices since they both worked really nicely for the characters and the fact that changing them would have been probably changing the very idea of that character. Other then that, really nothing more to say on the matter. It’s good, not great, but it’s pretty good.Overall, you can probably skip this OVA and not miss anything except the odd feeling of wanting to smash your head into a table. Ok, so it’s not all that bad, just the perverted jokes seem to be that bad. The rest just feels like a normal show that should have probably been put into the series. about what happen in the first season, don’t hint to what’s going to happen in the second, and just seems to have its own little short story adventure.When talking about the characters, their personalities really have not changed all that much.

Kyokou Suiri Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44204/Kyokou_Suiri_Season_2,"['(It\'s a step up at least)Well... after a somewhat short wait for season 2, here I am once again watching a series that I will most likely completely forget everything about within 2 months of watching.Is Kyokou Suiri bad? No, by no means is this a bad series. However, there isn\'t... anything special about it. The story had potential but is executed poorly, the voice acting is okay, and the characters are semi-decent. One of the few things I do like is the animation. Although considering I tend to only watch stuff from the early 2000s, I guess that\'s to be expected.I will say however,...S2 is definitely a step in the right direction and definitely held my attention for most of the episodes. S1 was a ""too much speaking"" type deal. It moved extremely slowly in my opinion and the last few episodes, with all the build-up they had, felt extremely boring, and the main fight(s) against the big-booba, no-face, lady felt somewhat ""dry."" Although there are still cases of this in S2, there is an increase in quality/attempt to move away from this. This shows concept is quite interesting, however, its execution could have been/could be a little better. It still feels like the show hasn\'t embraced a certain ""genre"" and is still teetering on the line between five. One minute they\'re talking about something really dark and the next they\'re cracking a joke. On top of that, the story feels a little confined still. There are few ""stakes"" and the number of characters is still too few to make the story feel like it has a ""presence"" in the world they live in at the moment. There isn\'t anything BIG... something that I\'m gonna be like ""ok...ok, I like that,"" there isn\'t anything Special, which causes the series as a whole to be very forgettable.Now that it\'s leaning more/fully toward an investigator/detective type of anime, I guess a slower plot and lots of talking is to be expected, and maybe it\'s on me for expecting anything different.Considering that the same man who made Blast of Tempest made this, I guess I might have had ""high expectations"" for this series as a whole, however, it still feels to me like another mediocre entry into this season\'s roster of shows. After coming back to watch S2 to see if it was more ""my taste,"" it wasn\'t.  Once again this series is by no means bad, it\'s just really slow for my taste.

I think this is the question that Kyokou Suiri is getting at. The series does not attempt to answer this question in a grandiose kind of way with supernatural creatures attempting world domination. Instead it looks at it from a much less intense but nonetheless dramatic angle— covering such themes as supernatural romance, revenge, and murder.Story:While the first season focused a lot of time on the Steel Lady Nanase arc which many people did not...enjoy, the second season follows several short individual stories, each taking up only a few episodes. This keeps the story feeling fresh with a new mystery to look forward to after each arc. In her typical fashion, Kotoko Iwanaga leads the viewer and indeed the other characters to believe one thing is happening while subtly dropping hints for when she makes the grand reveal of the truth at the end of the arc. This leads each arc to a close with a satisfying conclusion. Kyokou Suiri’s primary means of conveying the story is through conversation and flash backs of ""what-if"" scenarios. If you easily get bored of listening to characters talking in one room for an entire episode (albeit with a few of the aforementioned ""what-if"" scenarios thrown in) then this anime is not for you. That being said, if you enjoyed season one, then you will like season two.Art & Sound:I have no complaints nor anything to applaud regarding the art and sound. The opening is nice to listen to and fits the series well. The voice actors did a good job which is important in a series with so much talking. The art style and animation have no obvious flaws. It’s overall decent with nothing special or concerning to note.Characters:Our protagonist, Kotoko Iwanaga, is someone who takes her status as the goddess of wisdom seriously and will help the supernatural beings with their problems. However, she feels little obligation towards human society and mostly does what she wants regarding their affairs. She is smart with good reasoning skills. In addition, she can be very funny, especially when teasing her boyfriend, Kurou Sakuragawa.Kurou mostly just follows Kotoko and goes along with her schemes. His unique abilities are an important part in many of Kotoko’s plans and they help her get to the truth of the mystery. His cousin, Rikka Sakuragawa, is also important to the story but spends most of her time running away from Kotoko and doing things behind the scenes.Neither of these two really experience any character development through this season, but it doesn’t really take away from the series since it has a story driven by events, not the feelings of our protagonists.Enjoyment:I found Kyokou Suiri Season 2 to be a pleasant watch and better than the first season. Viewers that like mystery and supernatural elements will certainly find this series to be something worth their time but should be aware of the lack of a large, complex overarching storyline and the reliance on dialogue as a means of storytelling. One thing that makes this series enjoyable is the story does not get so complicated or contrived that it becomes hard to follow.Overall:Kyokou Suiri is an anime that only some people will be able to enjoy. If you do not fall into this grouping, then it is unlikely that you will enjoy this series. That being said, the second season does improve upon the series conventions established by season one and this makes it more enjoyable overall. enjoy, the second season follows several short individual stories, each taking up only a few episodes.

There were anticipated sequels, new IPs, anime originals. But one that stood out and has still been haunting me was 'The detective is already dead'. And although no one has put it into words, having finished the second season of In/Spectre, I think this anime were trying to surpass the aforementioned one. But before proceeding the comparison, I want to deal with the most boring part of the review: the technical aspect.Visually the anime isn't falling apart even in the latest episodes, where most b and lower tier anime usually...exhibit degradation due to lack of budget. But it's not a tall order, bearing in mind that there is almost no action, nor has too many animation either. The anime consists of dialogs with sporadic change of the camera angles. The music isn't spectacular, but in contrast with the plot I can even call it good.You know that feeling when you like some anime or media in general and you want to break down your most favorite part of it to demonstrate its majesty. And I also wanted to do the same with the first episode, but for a different reason of course. Unfortunately, the quality of the first episode represents the quality of the whole show. Nevertheless, I'm still going to describe it just to convey the essence of the storytelling.First off, we get remembered what happened in the previous season, then the mystery is being introduced. After that the main girl and her aide appears and immediately resolve the mystery. This pattern is cornerstone of the show. Someone meets the problem, and the mc, using her wisdom and ability to communicate with supernaturals, resolves it. There are no investigations, collecting evidence, deducing. Even her communications with spirits  aren't mostly shown. And that basic concept is repeating throughout the whole show. In the very first episode, after mystery was being solved, there is a fight with a giant orc. And the demonstration of the aide's ability is made so bad that you wouldn't be understand it without a narrator. Even if the same approach was used in the manga, it's not a solid excuse to adapt it the same way. And of course this single fight is the only fight that happens in the season.Down the line the author decides to throw a curveball and change the standard formula. Now we have the investigation of a murder that happened more than 20 years ago with several participants. The head of a family claims that he killed his wife and asks his kin to reveal the method of the murder. But instead of doing this, they immediately rule him out and, for some reason, start admitting that they separately conspired to commit the murder as well. And all that boils down to who has an alibi (because everyone had a motive kill her). Given that it's an affluent family, their members could easily hire a hitman and not kill her by themselves. Afterwards, the true killer inadvertently reveal himself, and the situation where the two party claim they are criminals takes place. And the main girl without any proofs concludes, using her wisdom of course, that the real killer is dad's relative, not dad himself.As you can see all mysteries are solved in the most anticlimactic way. The only investigation consists of the discrepancies. And anything aside from them could have possibly fix the situation. Unfortunately, the interaction between characters and combining of the supernatural abilities, which were in the first season, are gone. The main characters get zero development and the new introduced characters feel rather flat.At this point I should admit that In/Spectre didn't reach the bar of The detective already dead the animation. There are still relatively consistent storytelling and the setting is based on urban fantasy world which gives a solid explanation why the mc know much more than anyone else. But do not worry, the second season of the detective was announced to set a new bar in mystery/detective genre. exhibit degradation due to lack of budget.

And I also wanted to do the same with the first episode, but for a different reason of course. Unfortunately, the quality of the first episode represents the quality of the whole show. Nevertheless, I'm still going to describe it just to convey the essence of the storytelling.First off, we get remembered what happened in the previous season, then the mystery is being introduced. After that the main girl and her aide appears and immediately resolve the mystery. This pattern is cornerstone of the show. Someone meets the problem, and the mc, using her wisdom and ability to communicate with supernaturals, resolves it. There are no investigations, collecting evidence, deducing. Even her communications with spirits  aren't mostly shown. And that basic concept is repeating throughout the whole show. In the very first episode, after mystery was being solved, there is a fight with a giant orc. And the demonstration of the aide's ability is made so bad that you wouldn't be understand it without a narrator. Even if the same approach was used in the manga, it's not a solid excuse to adapt it the same way. And of course this single fight is the only fight that happens in the season.Down the line the author decides to throw a curveball and change the standard formula. Now we have the investigation of a murder that happened more than 20 years ago with several participants. The head of a family claims that he killed his wife and asks his kin to reveal the method of the murder. But instead of doing this, they immediately rule him out and, for some reason, start admitting that they separately conspired to commit the murder as well. And all that boils down to who has an alibi (because everyone had a motive kill her). Given that it's an affluent family, their members could easily hire a hitman and not kill her by themselves. Afterwards, the true killer inadvertently reveal himself, and the situation where the two party claim they are criminals takes place. And the main girl without any proofs concludes, using her wisdom of course, that the real killer is dad's relative, not dad himself.As you can see all mysteries are solved in the most anticlimactic way. The only investigation consists of the discrepancies. And anything aside from them could have possibly fix the situation. Unfortunately, the interaction between characters and combining of the supernatural abilities, which were in the first season, are gone. The main characters get zero development and the new introduced characters feel rather flat.At this point I should admit that In/Spectre didn't reach the bar of The detective already dead the animation. There are still relatively consistent storytelling and the setting is based on urban fantasy world which gives a solid explanation why the mc know much more than anyone else. But do not worry, the second season of the detective was announced to set a new bar in mystery/detective genre."", 'I would like to preface my review by pointing out that the show gets a lot of unwarranted criticism for being the kind of detective show where deductions are made up (they don\'t use solid, concrete pieces of evidence), but that is exactly the point of the show and they are done quite intelligently while integrating the supernatural into them, something which is best exemplified by the ""yuki onna"" story arc that stretches from the second to the fourth episode of season 2. The fake deductions in the show work towards solving the problem at hand in a more wholistic way, taking into account its...other aspects, which is more than just solving the mystery of the problem mechanically (like, for example, just deducing who the culprit is, as opposed to maybe trying to give the victims closure as well).The flaw of the show instead can be understood from another very common criticism, i.e., there\'s way too much talking. Now that isn\'t an issue on its own. After all, Monogatari series does that, and it\'s an incredible series. The problem with the show is actually the inability to properly integrate the intellectual masturbation of the author into a larger more visceral extended plot with more of the fun elements present in it. To give a rough and simple example of the idea, imagine you\'re playing a complex military strategy game (game 1) and imagine playing another game (game 2) that has the same gameplay but this time it is embedded into a great story (like, let\'s say it\'s set in the world of the Youjo Senki light novel and you\'re Tanya). It\'s obvious which is better. The short yuki onna arc feels like the former. Even when the arcs are longer, the visercal elements are not that many.The aforementioned yuki onna story arc, with which the story\'s main selling point (MSP) peaks, i.e., false deduction, also highlights best the main flaws with the show. We are introduced to a yuki onna and her human darling, both of whom are not all that endearing to you, and you get to see their story for 2 episodes (ep 2 and 3), following which you get our FMC and MC making contact with the duo, doing the deduction work (regarding the issue of the duo) in the final episode of the arc, and delivering a brilliant piece of deduction-exposition that lasts for that one whole episode (ep 4). Brilliant as it was, your ability to care for anyone is non-existent and that includes our main characters, and you can guess the entertainment value of the arc from that (for the majority of people). There aren\'t more fun elements woven into it. It\'s too to the point. You just made a setup and provided the solution to it with no viewer involvement. THIS is its main and fatal flaw.Now imagine if the same yuki onna story were woven into a longer arc where our MCs were roped into the story of the yuki onna, where they get to have some good interactions with each other and other characters for us to watch, and they get involved with the tale of the yuki onna which makes us care about the tale since you can\'t really care all that much about side characters. Finally, the whole of the otherwise brilliant deduction comes at the end of all that, like at least 3-4 more episodes down the line after the author made you engrossed in the story by making the FMC or the main overarching story get involved in the short and to the point story arc with elements such as more FMC-Mc interactions, some interesting jokes etc put into it. The brilliant deduction would then be the closing act of this long arc and would be elevated to another level.Another way to see this flaw can be from understanding how interesting detective shows are written in general. We need just one phase of it for the sake of this review, which is the exposition phase of the deduction. In this phase, while the exposition goes on regarding the culprit and his modus operandi, there are also things like creative banter between the characters you\'ve come to like and some quirky behaviour of theirs that gets shown while the deduction is going on (as punctuation marks in the exposition). A show like this with longer expositions than usual needs more of that or something similar, the purpose of which is to endear us to the characters and to the show, which in turn also endears us to the story and the other elements as a side effect. Sadly, it\'s not that well done. Take the example of a similarly supernatural but much less intelligent show with a much less intelligent writer doing this specific thing better: Undead Girl Murder Farce.All in all, Kyokou Suiri is a flawed work of an intelligent man, which despite having some charming things (like the FMC kotoko ofc) ultimately falls a bit short in reaching the level of viscerality which would raise it and its intelligent aspects (some brilliant false deductions) to the level of a masterpiece, or at least a really great show. A 6/10 with ""mixed feelings"" for this particular but fatal flaw.Tl:dr needs a bit more waifubaiting and fun times to make it the great show it should have been~~ other aspects, which is more than just solving the mystery of the problem mechanically (like, for example, just deducing who the culprit is, as opposed to maybe trying to give the victims closure as well).The flaw of the show instead can be understood from another very common criticism, i.e., there\'s way too much talking.

The story starts off somewhat interesting, but eventually trails off.

There's a few funny moments which work well enough, but that's not good enough to fill an entire episode with.

As a special episode that premieres before the main series\' debut, expectations coming into this was more for popcorn entertainment value than anything else. Let\'s face it, even the title (Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart) of the special implies fan service and really, you\'ll get it right at your face.The first few minutes of this episode has some of the most suggestive camera angles in the franchise. It invites attention with the main heroines in skimpy swimsuits. There\'s actually a reason for this as Blessing Software is looking for new...ideas for their project. Megumi is still the centerpiece of their work and so as a way to make her feel ""comfortable"", everyone decided to go to the pool as a more fitting setting. Tomoya also ends up there where he seems to be trying to rid of his earthly desires.Romance rivalries is still pretty evident. Two of the main girls make moves to get Tomoya\'s attention. In fact, Utaha makes a bold move to manipulate events as part of an elaborate plan to spend alone time with Tomoya. Michiru still displays her tomboyish personality while not being afraid to use her sporty body as an advantage. That leaves Eriri where she\'s more of an oddball in this rivalry. She\'s still the same Eriri we come to know yet she isn\'t as bold as the other girls. There\'s probably a reason for that as she has an inferiority complex about her body. The main title of the series, \'Saekano Flat\' might even be a reference for this. Finally, we also get a familiar reappearance of Izumi as she returns to thank everyone.Beyond the fan service, the episode itself serves as a reminder that Saekano is still about game making. Blessing Software still work as a group regardless how silly their methods are. Tomoya is caught in the middle while Megumi fills the role of the ordinary protagonist. The fan service serves more as a way to give fans a treat as all the girls looks fairly nice in their swimsuits. However, this special isn\'t and shouldn\'t be used as a way to give audience an impression about the entire second season. It merely serves as a way to get viewers back into the franchise.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season. It's an episode solely designed to show off just how lascivious, almost criminally so, Misaki Kurehito's character designs are. Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second. First, romance. The episode doesn't even try to hide the fact that all of the girls are competing to vie for...male lead Tomoya's attention. Nor does it have any reason to; after all, this is a romance show.But first and foremost, it's a series about a doujin circle, Blessing Software, and their endeavours to create a dating sim in time for a Winter Comiket release, and fortunately this episode isn't all about swimsuits and skinship. It does show off a segment of genuine teamwork within the circle with Michiru handling BGM, Eriri handling art and Utaha handling the script. And while minimal, I do hope the season has more of the teamwork and less of the screenshot-worthy moments though....forgive me if I'm a little tired. I've been using the Windows key and the Print Screen key together for quite a lot in the past 24 minutes.In the end, it's important to remember that this episode is almost certainly not an indication of what the second season is likely to entail; it's more a chance to show off Kurehito-san's art. And what a showcase it was. male lead Tomoya's attention.

Its almost been 2 years  since the series last debut.. and what better way to make a comeback  than a special fan service episode.Well other than the boobs and bikinis , some plot is involved too (yeah ! right the ""PLOT"") . Blessing software is working hard as usual .. and they want to make a scene where the heroine is in a swimsuit ,along with the protagonist near a pool ( you know...the standard stuff). And  along with Kato, the entire group gathers in private pool to provide some moral support  to the heroine .... and u can guess what happens after that .The artwork ( done by masterful hands of A1) is beautiful as usual. The color palette is the same and the character design has not changed much too. But hey... its still beautiful as usualOverall the anime offers little more than fan service and is not for the people who have not seen the original series..... but hey the fans of original series can enjoy it nonetheless tho.. the standard stuff).

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Good riddance, Saekano.', ""maybe lil bit of spoiler..Unexpectedly went into this anime thinking it would be similar to the first one (S1), but oh boi was I wrong. I cried my ass off in the final few episodes with the sudden turn of events. Now I feel utterly lost..i was routing for utaha since the very beginning and now kato improved so much in this season specially after ep 10, like so much..hahabut still i stand to my words, Well Utaha is the only one who selflessly loves him. So it's understandable that you want her to win. :D.to be completely honest, I kinda felt that a relationship...between him and Utaha would work out fantastically within the fact that they spent a long time working on a very difficult project like writing an entirely new route.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season.

Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked.

Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season. It's an episode solely designed to show off just how lascivious, almost criminally so, Misaki Kurehito's character designs are. Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season. It's an episode solely designed to show off just how lascivious, almost criminally so, Misaki Kurehito's character designs are. Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

It does show off a segment of genuine teamwork within the circle with Michiru handling BGM, Eriri handling art and Utaha handling the script.

I've been using the Windows key and the Print Screen key together for quite a lot in the past 24 minutes.In the end, it's important to remember that this episode is almost certainly not an indication of what the second season is likely to entail; it's more a chance to show off Kurehito-san's art.

Blessing software is working hard as usual .. and they want to make a scene where the heroine is in a swimsuit ,along with the protagonist near a pool ( you know...the standard stuff). And  along with Kato, the entire group gathers in private pool to provide some moral support  to the heroine .... and u can guess what happens after that .The artwork ( done by masterful hands of A1) is beautiful as usual.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week.

Good riddance, Saekano. right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively.

The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season. It's an episode solely designed to show off just how lascivious, almost criminally so, Misaki Kurehito's character designs are. Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

It does show off a segment of genuine teamwork within the circle with Michiru handling BGM, Eriri handling art and Utaha handling the script.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season. It's an episode solely designed to show off just how lascivious, almost criminally so, Misaki Kurehito's character designs are. Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

It does show off a segment of genuine teamwork within the circle with Michiru handling BGM, Eriri handling art and Utaha handling the script.

I've been using the Windows key and the Print Screen key together for quite a lot in the past 24 minutes.In the end, it's important to remember that this episode is almost certainly not an indication of what the second season is likely to entail; it's more a chance to show off Kurehito-san's art.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

She\'s still the same Eriri we come to know yet she isn\'t as bold as the other girls. There\'s probably a reason for that as she has an inferiority complex about her body. The main title of the series, \'Saekano Flat\' might even be a reference for this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better.

Good riddance, Saekano. right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad.

Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design.

Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season. It's an episode solely designed to show off just how lascivious, almost criminally so, Misaki Kurehito's character designs are. Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

This isn't some kind of recap of season one, nor is it a plot-heavy prelude to the upcoming second season. It's an episode solely designed to show off just how lascivious, almost criminally so, Misaki Kurehito's character designs are. Oh, and there's a little bit of story there too.In a very simple note, this episode serves to remind us of what elements characterized the first season and almost certainly will be a recurring feature in the second.

It does show off a segment of genuine teamwork within the circle with Michiru handling BGM, Eriri handling art and Utaha handling the script.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

She\'s still the same Eriri we come to know yet she isn\'t as bold as the other girls. There\'s probably a reason for that as she has an inferiority complex about her body. The main title of the series, \'Saekano Flat\' might even be a reference for this.

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

Blessing software is working hard as usual .. and they want to make a scene where the heroine is in a swimsuit ,along with the protagonist near a pool ( you know...the standard stuff). And  along with Kato, the entire group gathers in private pool to provide some moral support  to the heroine .... and u can guess what happens after that .The artwork ( done by masterful hands of A1) is beautiful as usual. The color palette is the same and the character design has not changed much too. But hey... its still beautiful as usualOverall the anime offers little more than fan service and is not for the people who have not seen the original series..... but hey the fans of original series can enjoy it nonetheless tho.. the standard stuff).

Here we go.A series is usually going to suck if the first episode gives you a bad impression. Just look at Digibro\'s ""How to Recognize a good (or terrible) Anime (In Just One Episode)"" videos where first episodes of popular anime are either praised or ridiculed in great detail before discussing how elements from episode 1 are seen in the rest of the series.With that said, I can safely say...right now that Saekano Flat\'s first episode is not good, and is not motivating me to finish the rest of the series.To begin, let\'s look at the ""plot"" of this episode. Basically, Aki and co. are at a luxurious hotel to work on the visual novel. We wouldn\'t know this for the first few minutes because all we see is a bunch of fanservice shots and discussions regarding how ""That anime"" got a second season"" with bickering between Utaha and Eriri about how ""That anime"" is either bad or good respectively. And thus begins the problems. This episode has NO real plot. At all. The episode is just Aki and co. fooling around at either the pool or other parts of the hotel, with the pool scenes taking up the majority of the episode. These scenes are just nonstop fanservice with the only person trying to work on the game there being Eriri. The other scenes are slightly more tolerable, but still very annoying, especially the scene where Utaha tried to force Aki to head off to a love hotel. Point being, despite the title ""Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart"", emphasis on the first two words, using fanservice to cover up a severe lack of plot is a definite ""No go"" in my book.And then we get to characters...Oh boy. Aki is still your typical cringy LN protagonist, but what saved him previously was how effective the other girls were at calling him out for basically everything. Not so in this episode. Aki gets away with everything this time around, from cringy statements such as this series getting ""Six seasons and a movie"" to sensible behaviors such as running away from Utaha during the bar scene. In other words, to throw one of S1\'s saving graces away with a snap of a finger is just distasteful. As for everyone else, Eriri is still the jealous and angry childhood friend, Michiru is still the ""interested"" cousin, Megumi is still cute and boring, and Izumi is still Eriri\'s rival. As for Utaha... what happened? Utaha was hands down the best character in S1 with her interesting behavior, sensible actions, and nice design. Here, she\'s just as annoying as the other girls, throwing out her old behavior in the process, with no amount of ""Rinri-kun"" being able to deal with her this time around, the bar scene being the best example of her change. Essentially, degradation of characters and already bad characters staying this way yield a crappy cast.As for audio/visuals... they\'re still good thanks to A-1 Pictures, but S1 looked and sounded better. I found many more choppy pieces of animation this time around, and the annoying colored filter from Season 1 is back. The new OP is decent, I guess, but I\'ll forget it in a week. Same goes for Izumi\'s song at the end.Saekano Flat Episode 0 is bad. Very bad. Between a nonexistent plot covered by fanservice, bad characters, some of whom were once good, and slightly worse audiovisuals compared to S1, this episode completely sucked. I will not be watching the rest of Saekano Flat; this episode showed me that the series in general will probably suck, so screw this.

As a special episode that premieres before the main series\' debut, expectations coming into this was more for popcorn entertainment value than anything else. Let\'s face it, even the title (Fan Service of Love and Pure Heart) of the special implies fan service and really, you\'ll get it right at your face.The first few minutes of this episode has some of the most suggestive camera angles in the franchise. It invites attention with the main heroines in skimpy swimsuits. There\'s actually a reason for this as Blessing Software is looking for new...ideas for their project. Megumi is still the centerpiece of their work and so as a way to make her feel ""comfortable"", everyone decided to go to the pool as a more fitting setting. Tomoya also ends up there where he seems to be trying to rid of his earthly desires.Romance rivalries is still pretty evident. Two of the main girls make moves to get Tomoya\'s attention. In fact, Utaha makes a bold move to manipulate events as part of an elaborate plan to spend alone time with Tomoya. Michiru still displays her tomboyish personality while not being afraid to use her sporty body as an advantage. That leaves Eriri where she\'s more of an oddball in this rivalry. She\'s still the same Eriri we come to know yet she isn\'t as bold as the other girls. There\'s probably a reason for that as she has an inferiority complex about her body. The main title of the series, \'Saekano Flat\' might even be a reference for this. Finally, we also get a familiar reappearance of Izumi as she returns to thank everyone.Beyond the fan service, the episode itself serves as a reminder that Saekano is still about game making. Blessing Software still work as a group regardless how silly their methods are. Tomoya is caught in the middle while Megumi fills the role of the ordinary protagonist. The fan service serves more as a way to give fans a treat as all the girls looks fairly nice in their swimsuits.
