Hakuouki: Sekkaroku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10350/Hakuouki__Sekkaroku,"['Well first i thought this was yeah ""Fan service"" of course- but after seeing these valuable episodes i\'m pretty much satisfied both with the main season and this. It simply added the required finishing touch.This is the 6 piece OVA of the franchise Hakuouki which is mainly comprised of tragedy. And this could be the only episodes which clings to the emotional side of the characters since in the main season  focuses solely on battle and sadness.Story:Well as you all might know Hijikata Toshizo the Oni Lieutenant and Okita Souji as simply saying the ""Shinsengumi"" it revolves around them, and a girl...is thrown at the lions den to see how it would go. Well as much as i want to put it bluntly, these lions are very much dignified and refined men than well most of the ""Lions"" i have ever seen.Art: Superb. No flaws.Sound: Average Opening and Ending- since it\'s an OVA it\'s al right i guess.The voice dubbing is admirable. Same soundtracks used in the anime is present here.Characters: This is the highlight. Whilst the main season went like a pistol-very fast not giving many characters their screen time) This gave a lot of consideration to acknowledge  their feelings to the ""Otome"" It also shows most of the sides we should have seen in characters- which they could have thrown in the first season- but who am i to question the budget of the directors for that?Enjoyment: Thoroughly enjoyed- pasted a smile on my face- this was light hearted/deep and slow but there could be sadness whisked in their that you\'d see if you dwell deep into the episode.Overall: Remember it\'s fan service - no questions asked. But for a fan it was extremely enjoyable to see their favourite characters once emotionally unleashed. I gave it an 8- because the creators did a sound job focusing on one scene of the anime and then creating various scenarios out of it. is thrown at the lions den to see how it would go.

I've seen her character SO many times, so that was a little disappointing. The art style isn't quite the way that I like it, but considering it is from around 2007 that is to be expected. One thing that I absolutely could not stand was (SPOILER ALERT) the fact that EVERY SINGLE GUY DIED. Literally, all of them except Shirunai and Kyuuju. T^T Overall though,...it was decent. I mean, I liked it enough to watch all the episodes (even the ones from the main series, first and second season) all in one day, lol. it was decent. I mean, I liked it enough to watch all the episodes (even the ones from the main series, first and second season) all in one day, lol."", ""Honestly I'm a big fan of the Hakuouki series as a whole, but out of all of the various OVA's, Movies, Series, etc. I believe this is my favorite little mini-series.If you haven't watched Hakuouki & Hakuouki Hekketsuroku than it's important to watch them first in order to understand the more intricate details about the overall story.I love this because it shows us the boys a bit more and how their relationship with Chizuru is, and why she's important to them (the game that the anime is based on is an otome one, afterall!) and it also gives us more light-hearteded enjoyment as well,...since the main series is a bit heavy.Plus, we get to see how these characters are not flat copies of one another, or just trope-y otome love interests, they are interesting, well rounded individuals that all have their own flaws and strengths. I think it's a very good addition to the collection of already great works for this series. since the main series is a bit heavy.Plus, we get to see how these characters are not flat copies of one another, or just trope-y otome love interests, they are interesting, well rounded individuals that all have their own flaws and strengths.

This really rounds off the other two seasons of Hakuouki. I just wish Chizuru was left out. She is useless. Uselesssssss!Also - SAITOU HAJIME IS LOVE. <3 <3 <3 Although his feelings for Chizuru made me annoyed, I was able to let it go - it IS a reverse harem of sorts so as the only female heroine it is a necessary part of the plot for all these amazing men to dote on her (it would not make sense if that weren't the case).I still don't understand why the...female protagonist has to be like that. I thought maybe some of her supposedly 'demonic' powers would be displayed but no such luck!Well, I'm done ranting. It was a good watch  this one. female protagonist has to be like that.

I found the original plot to be serviceable but straightforward and relatively unremarkable, and it has not been changed much in this movie outside of minor details. However, the remake does include some tweaks to the climax and additional character moments that I liked. It is also visually interesting; besides the switch to digital animation and updated designs for many...of the extinct animals, the art style in this film is much more experimental than that of most other Doraemon movies.If you could only watch one version of Nobita's Dinosaur, either the original or the remake are fine to view on their own, and I give both the same rating. This one is arguably a better movie by a small margin, though the original has the context of historical novelty going for it. of the extinct animals, the art style in this film is much more experimental than that of most other Doraemon movies.If you could only watch one version of Nobita's Dinosaur, either the original or the remake are fine to view on their own, and I give both the same rating.

Black Jack (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/2213/Black_Jack_TV,"[""This anime has to be by far one of the best I have seen ever.The story revolves around a scary lookinghalf masked,black caped looking doctor(he does resemble Dracula in a way!),by the name of Dr Black Jack.The doctor holds the reputation for being the world's best surgeon,but only works for the 'rich'.Thoughinitially you get a feeling that this guy is pretty greedy,but in reality he is a very kind hearted man.The anime boasts of a very independant storyline.Most episodes remain independant of each other,with each storytouching your heart in a very unusual way.The animation is really good and if you are wondering why the styleis...soo similar to Astro  Boy's,then you should know that both the original Manga's were authored by Osamu Tezuka.Overall the anime is excellent and I would reccommend everyone to atleast try watching the series once. soo similar to Astro  Boy's,then you should know that both the original Manga's were authored by Osamu Tezuka.Overall the anime is excellent and I would reccommend everyone to atleast try watching the series once."", ""In short, this anime is excellent in the fact that it doesn;t revolve around guns and action, but it's not slow and dragging. The idea of a doctor saving lives is excellent, and the dramatic [and some times a little ridiculous] ways is more than entertaining. I've watched most of these episodes three and more times, and will probably continue to do so. The animation may seem a little too childish, but I assure you that the subject matter isn't really. And, it's generally accurate, so you may learn a little anatomy at the same time. I highly recommend this anime, both to first time...watchers and die hard anime fans. watchers and die hard anime fans."", ""I watched this show right after watching the OVAs and right away I can say that Black Jack TV was a\xa0lot less dark and more kid-friendly than the OVA, but it's still very entertaining.\xa0Some of the stories will touch your heart and others will actually make you laugh. I'm glad we got some episodes that revolved around Pinoco and what she and her friends do in their free time, since in the OVAs it seemed she was always stuck at home waiting for the doctor to return. This version of Black Jack was less serious and more comedic, but that does not mean I enjoyed...it any less. I'm glad that I watched this show, and I'm also happy with the amount of episodes there are. it any less. I'm glad that I watched this show, and I'm also happy with the amount of episodes there are."", 'Black Jack is one of Mr. Tezuka\'s most famous works next to Astro boy of course.  It portrays the medical world through the eyes unlicensed doctor, Black Jack, as he gets all sorts of unique and life changing tasks and surgeries he must perform to the best of his abilities.Story: 7The story follows Black Jack, a mysterious doctor that has sort of an unknown past as everyone only knows him because of his reputation.  According to almost everyone in the show, this man is superb in his surgery abilities and is one of the best doctors in Japan.  Each episode...is it\'s own new case that I found to be always unique.  Even though most of the episodes are stand-alone, each of them are well paced and do a good job explaining the story for that episode.Art: 6Now even if the design is a little childish and perhaps a little hard to look at, I found myself glancing more at the emotions each character depicts.  Even if the characters are unsightly, the emotions they portray stand out to me the most.  Tezuka knows how to make us feel for a character by creating emotions through facial gestures.  What we can\'t get by looking at his art, we can get by looking at the emotional value of the characters.Sound: 8The music in this show I just simply adored.  From the intro, to the music in the show, everything I enjoyed to my heart\'s content.  I\'d have to say if I were to pick my favorite intro, it would for sure be ""Here I am"" by globe.  The vocalist of the song was great, as were the instruments and such within the song.  The only problem I had with some of the songs was that they got a bit repetitive sometimes.  Some songs played multiple times in one episode and that got a bit bland for me.  Thank God the music was actually good.  Otherwise I wouldn\'t be giving it this praise right now.Character: 7I wanna say the only character I enjoyed was Black Jack.  Pinoko got annoying as hell real quick, and I already knew I was going to hate her.  As for the episode related characters, they were just there so you\'d feel sad for them.  I couldn\'t have emotional bonds with them because all episodes were only 1 parters.  If an episode extended to 2 parts, then we could start talking characters.  As for minor characters, they weren\'t stand out at all.  I guess that\'s why they\'re minor, so that\'s only a nitpick.Enjoyment: 9I for sure really enjoyed this anime.  My only problem: wayyyyy to long.  Seriously, I\'m all for making an anime long if it has a story to go off of, but it doesn\'t.  This series would have worked as maybe a 24 episode series at best, but 61? That\'s a little much Tezuka.OVERALL: 8Yeah I say for sure check this one out.  If your a fan of House or doctor shows, do it.  You won\'t regret it.  And hey, if an episode seems awful 10 minutes in, just skip it.  It won\'t matter.  EXCEPT the Pinoko episode.

Don\'t skip that one, trust me.  Have a good day!', 'Let me start off with this, Black Jack 2004 is NOT a bad series.It just pales in comparison to most other adaptations and even the original Tezuka manga which it loosely adapts. Many stories are a mixed bag due to all the changes they had to make for the Heisei era. A lot of the more brutal chapters had to be toned down due to appealing to a younger audience in the modern times. (Well, it was modern almost 20 years ago 😅)You might think ""Oh well, I don\'t like brutal stuff much anyway so that\'s fine with me."" but many of the stories...really were just straight up butchered due to the missing dark themes or were changed too much to the point were Black Jack almost seems like a side character. Why? Because they keep choosing to focus on the actual side characters instead!The worst of all had to be the re-adapted ""Pinoko Love Story"" which was changed into the episode ""Pinoko\'s plans for adulthood"". For spoilery reasons I can\'t say too much but I can say one thing, Pinoko Love Story really just hit harder and overall characterizes both her and Black Jack in a deeper way.Heck many episodes really make it clear that the studio saw Pinoko as nothing but a surrogate daughter to Black Jack which, I mean I can get why from a mainstream perspective, but at the same time they missed the point of her entire character in that case???Overall, should you watch it? Ehhhh, it shouldn\'t be your entry point. Perhaps if you want a more light hearted experience yes but otherwise I would not reccomend it. really were just straight up butchered due to the missing dark themes or were changed too much to the point were Black Jack almost seems like a side character.

I'm not much of an anime fan, but I really enjoyed Black Jack. I became interested because the main character is a doctor and I love medical fiction. Black Jack in a brilliant, but unlicensed surgeon. While he often charges exorbitant rates to the rich who seek him out, he also provides his services for free to the poor and animals. The anime chronicles his adventures as the mercenary doctor travels the world with his sidekick, Pinoko, a girl he saved from certain death. The interesting thing about Black Jack is his total contempt for the law when he's seeking to save...the life of another.The anime was written by a doctor named Osamu Tezuka. Using his extensive knowledge, he creates a dark, but engaging world of rouge medical professionals who both heal and kill. While the scenarios are often outlandish and teeming with fantasy and pseudoscience, I found Black Jack to be engrossing. Many of the more fantastical elements include easy transplants with no fear of rejection, unknown diseases that are mystical in nature and surgeries performed at the speed of light.Each episode is self contained with little continuity. The nice part about this is you can watch one without having to have seen them all. One of the most interesting things in the series is the detailed aspects of the surgeries Black Jack performs. You learn about his character not through what he says, but what he does. While he's basically a lawless pirate, his personal code of ethics forces him to do his all in his pursuit to save the lives of his patients. This deep commitment to the Hippocratic Oath often puts him at odds with both God and man.The most interesting secondary character is the Black Queen, another rouge physician that Black Jack falls in love with. She's arrogant and heartless, known for her penchant for amputation. It's obvious Black Jack sees her as his soul mate due to their many similarities. But her infamy causes her trouble and there's another issue, she's already engaged. During the course of her appearances, you see slips in her cold facade that hint of warmth in the block of ice she calls a heart.It should also be known that I am VERY MUCH INTO medical thrillers as a whole. Big fan of house MD, and I even started a website based on my passion: http://www.hyannisdoctors.comOn the whole, I'd recommend Black Jack to anyone who enjoys medical thrillers.

As episodes pass, you get sometimes flashback episodes where you learn a bit about the main characters. Isn\'t much else to say about story. I guess some diseases and medical components of the story might confuse viewer now and then, but for the most part everything gets explanation. Probably the weakest link of the story would be that few stories/episodes were quite far fetched and moronic. But overall story was quite enjoyable.✦Art & SoundWere good, that\'s all I...can really comment. It has it\'s odd/unique artstyle/character designs and quite enjoyable music&OST. It isn\'t anything amazing nor anything bad, it is simply good.✦CharacterIt\'s episodic Anime, thus most characters don\'t really matter. But now and then some side-characters show up at later episodes as well. So in a sense it\'s quite good balance of main character importance & presence and side-kicks/characters method of surfacing now and then. Rest of importance regarding main cast, explains synopsis anyhow.Probably only thing I would have to mention is the sidekick Pinoco, she truly frustrates and annoys me. I\'m never been fond of brats. But her flashback episode which explains, who she is, was quite disturbing, especially after I googled afterwards certain thing on medical side.✦Enjoyment&OverallIn a nutshell it\'s a enjoyable episodic medical Anime about notorious/genius unlicensed doctor and annoying kid side-kick brat.

But I found this Anime quite enjoyable and will end up watching the whole franchise.', ""Mysterious guy and his mentally challenged midget assistant travel around the world eternally enveloped in rain solving mysteries in form of medical issues. It's a science show written by someone who clearly doesn't understand or know science. And am not referring to completely made up conditions and illnesses, but general behavior of supposedly genius doctor everyone envies who doesn't know he should wear gloves when bisecting infected animal corpse and then not to use his hands to wipe sweat. It's common things like that which every doctor should know instinctively that are missing from this show and it's throwing me off completely.Animation is actually great...even for today's standards. You can tell it's the old way of shading and drawing but quality still holds today with its gorgeous backgrounds, many different camera angles and plenty of animated shots. No shortcuts here. Sound and music are also great and varied.For the most part, characters are well acted and well written with one notable exception, his mentally challenged midget assistant. She introduces herself as 18 years old and yet behaves like a child, while looking like one as well. At some point we learn more about her condition but regardless of that it's hard to forget she is claiming to be engaged to the doctor. Anyway you take it she feels very out of place but luckily doesn't ruin the show.If you can ignore those few things, you'll probably enjoy this show. I on the other hand keep dropping it at around episode 20 or so. even for today's standards.

Date A Bullet: Dead or Bullet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40416/Date_A_Bullet__Dead_or_Bullet,"[""Are you, like me, a fan of Kurumi, but not a fan of Date a live ?Well then, here are some good news.Only fighting, no harem trash, no annoying characters, no ecchi, just Kurumi ! 100% Kurumi.Unfortunately, the movie is only 24 minutes long, so the story is incomplete.It focuses mainly on the characters introduction, and explains the plot, or the reason for the battle, with some briefs flashbacks on Kurumi's past.But apparently, there is a second part, I hope it will be as good.Because what's better than a movie for Kurumi ? Well, two movies of Kurumi of course. "", 'I am not a big fan of Date a Live to begin with but I was excited when a movie featuring Kurumi Tokisaki was announced. Her character is without a doubt the best thing from Date a Live. Her abilities, design, and character in general are very interesting so my disappointment with this movie was even greater.Sadly this ""movie"" is 24 minutes long and is just introducing new characters. Thats it. Thats the whole ""movie"". It is just an introduction for the next movie.I really hope that the next movie will be worth the wait. But this was an absolute letdown. ', ""Date a live is back and it's great to see our beloved Kurumi again especially in her own story.Okay, I first thought that it was supposed to be a movie that is an hour-long but I watched the first episode and it was 24 minutes, standard time for animes. It was great how the premise of the story is shown in the middle part and didn't narrate it in the first part. If you really love date a live, even if you don't know anything about this, you will just keep watching it, idk for Kurumi? lol. Also, the subtlety was shown, not revealing...who was really the Kurumi that died. The art is so cute for the other characters but also for Kurumi but I kinda miss the old art. I think it would be more good if the director at least clipped a flashback about Shido to hype up the fans watching this. who was really the Kurumi that died.

Cause the plot of the anime really differs from what i read and it was a huge disappointment to me. I wanted more emotions, more action, more character development and MORE SENSE!!!! Is it only me that thinks a bunch of stuff doesnt add up?! OKay, the main character IS...Kurumi, but doesnt make the WHOLE anime a great one.The setting is great but it is ruined.

I was extremely excited when they announced an adaptation was coming for Date A Bullet in the form of a movie. Heres where that goes wrong. It\'s far too short. With the first ""movie"" part being a limited 25 minutes, it is difficult to introduce the plot, the characters, and show any real progression in such a short amount of time. However, I am genuinely impressed by how well it was handled. Though brief, we were able to grasp what had happened to...Kurumi, where she had ended up, and what her objective was.  We were introduced to all the characters as well. It wasn\'t perfect by a long shot, but I was genuinely impressed for what it was, although I admit my bias towards this series.As for the anime, the sound was great, the art was beautiful, the animation was fair for a relatively new studio, being so short the characters could have definitely benefited from an actual length movie, but it is what it is.Overall, if this simply had a longer runtime to expand on the world, the characters, and the story, I would have rated this a 10/10, however I will have to end this with a 9/10. It was still an exciting watch, any fan of DAL or Kurumi in general will appreciate watching this! Kurumi, where she had ended up, and what her objective was.

Yeah you got your animated Kurumi fanservice and some cool soundtrack. But the plot.... even the oroginal Date a Live series are rushed. This one is on steroids and hardly makes any sense compared to the books' setting.  It somewhat does the job as a story linker about Kurimi's past... but there are so many essential events  that just got cutted out. I can't really recommend as a stand alone animated spinoff as well... For me it was a huge dissapointment. And the...animations were also too sketchy...

I can't imagine people outside of the target audience being awayed away with it.As for me I was never enthusiastic about DAB and expected it to be a disaster but it was quite pleasant to watch. I like that Kurumi's personality is very much like in the original, as I find it to be not only hers but also the movie's biggest charms(it's refreshing to have an anti-heroine for protagonist).That being said I'll list the things that, in my opinion...make the movie worse or don't make it good.-Art&AnimationDAL always had stiff animation and although I appreciate that's not the case here I don't like how Kurumi changed.

So, was Dead or Bullet any good? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe story continues from the OVA of the anime\'s second season, where Kurumi\'s clone is absorbed into some sort of void and now she finds herself in some sort of battle royale, the prize of which is the fulfillment of any...wish. I have to say, the battle royale genre is kinda reaching oversaturation in the anime landscape but it can still be interesting if the story puts an innovative spin on it.

I\'m interested to see how her relationship with the antagonist, the White Queen, will develop and which roles will the Quasi-Spirits (yes, Quasi-Spirits are a thing) will play. The best character in this movie has to be Hibiki, if only because she\'s the only one who seems to be on Kurumi\'s side, even if they\'ll have to become enemies eventually.

It\'s always a pleasure to listen to Asami Sanada\'s talents as Kurumi and she has fine chemistry with Kaede Hondo (Hibiki). The other VAs are kinda underutilized in this movie, however, and the only one who will stay in the end is probably Saori Onishi (the White Queen).

It won`t go into much detail and there will be some spoilers.)INTRODUCTION:Date a Bullet: Dead or Bullet is short 23-minutes anime film set in the world of the main anime date a live. It is set, presumably, after the end of the OVA, KURUMI`S ONCORE. It follows Kurumi`s clone that we saw in the OVA, as she finds herself in a different world, and in the middle of a battle royal.CONTEXT:Alright, let’s get the elephant in the room out...of the way. I`m not a big fan of the date a live anime. I watched all 3 seasons, and I felt them really boring and repetitive, with an extremely out of focus, over-blown and predictable plot-hole story, which isn`t paced well, accompanied by plot points that are absurd in concept and in execution. This led to a slow burning, boredom inducing experience, which nearly killed me and took me years to recover from. But the only good thing that I can remember were the spirts, their abilities and backstory. And I really wished we can see more of their story. So, I was really interested to see this film and hope to GOD it didn`t suck.Thankfully it didn`t. I really like and adore this film, and think that it’s a great introductory point for something larger. But so far, this film is little more than that, a start and promise for something big. While there are fight scenes, dialogue, character deaths and all other such things you would expect. All of them serve a purpose of introduction and none feel wholesome.This was a point which I wanted to clear out at the start, because I think this film still has a lot of heart and does a fine work in executing all of its ideas, in a meaningful and enjoyable way.STORY AND CHARACTERS:First things first, the story and how good it is and was told. Both of them were handled well with exceptional skills. I won`t talk spoilers, but I will say that the story is pretty simple and direct. The plot is not complex and there are really no twist or epic moments that film builds up to. But that doesn`t mean the story is boring or uninteresting. The overall narrative and its different points are engaging. The main premise and other plot points like the queen and wish are interesting. And many different scenarios and fight scenes will surely keep the story entertaining, even if they are shorty and not many. And all of them are well directed and animated, paced and introduced correctly. There is no time travel, dating, concert contests, or another bullshit that was is in the main anime.All of the plot points that are present here are good and well executed. And are accompanied by good characters. All of them are spirts, each with their own sets of abilities, as you would expect. They each wield different weapons and abilities, and have their own, little bit of personality and motives. But just like the story, their names, design, and abilities are pretty simple and basic (apart from the Queen`s). And they are never as complex and engaging as the ones in the main anime. But also like the story, they are used, introduced and handled well. The short but well directed and focused fight scenes and character dialogues before, during, and after the fight scenes, add more depth to them and the story. Chances are high that you will at the very least like and enjoy the story, if not love and adore it, especially when you see it unfold on the screen.But there are two things which are absent from the story. There is no part that introduces you to the different main story points (the spirits, and their origin), and Kurumi`s character. And because you don`t know about her past and relationship to Shido, or Shido in general (I know I forgot about him), you will not understand her motives and desires in the film. Let alone care for her. There is also no plot point or character conflict that gets resolved, or any long plot focused fight sequence.ANIMATION AND MUSIC:The animation and music, you will also find very serviceable here. It is simple and noting extraordinary. But it blends well with the film`s tone and there is now shortage of good pieces and a very appropriate ending song. The character and the overall settings are also well designed and beautifully animated. All of this combines to give you a worthwhile and entertaining experience. Two word I thought I would never use for something associated with date a live.CONCLUSION:I really like what this film has to offer. But I think there is a lot of missed opportunity. The absence of an introductory sequence and a much larger complex narrative, and the general feeling of confusion and incompleteness, might not lend well to many. And many who don`t know this anime`s world, will surely be among them.Thanks for reading. I hope you like the review. And if you like the film, do watch the next one. It will not disappoint. of the way. I`m not a big fan of the date a live anime.

But just like the story, their names, design, and abilities are pretty simple and basic (apart from the Queen`s). And they are never as complex and engaging as the ones in the main anime. But also like the story, they are used, introduced and handled well. The short but well directed and focused fight scenes and character dialogues before, during, and after the fight scenes, add more depth to them and the story. Chances are high that you will at the very least like and enjoy the story, if not love and adore it, especially when you see it unfold on the screen.But there are two things which are absent from the story. There is no part that introduces you to the different main story points (the spirits, and their origin), and Kurumi`s character. And because you don`t know about her past and relationship to Shido, or Shido in general (I know I forgot about him), you will not understand her motives and desires in the film. Let alone care for her. There is also no plot point or character conflict that gets resolved, or any long plot focused fight sequence.ANIMATION AND MUSIC:The animation and music, you will also find very serviceable here. It is simple and noting extraordinary. But it blends well with the film`s tone and there is now shortage of good pieces and a very appropriate ending song. The character and the overall settings are also well designed and beautifully animated. All of this combines to give you a worthwhile and entertaining experience. Two word I thought I would never use for something associated with date a live.CONCLUSION:I really like what this film has to offer. But I think there is a lot of missed opportunity. The absence of an introductory sequence and a much larger complex narrative, and the general feeling of confusion and incompleteness, might not lend well to many. And many who don`t know this anime`s world, will surely be among them.Thanks for reading. I hope you like the review. And if you like the film, do watch the next one. It will not disappoint.', 'I gonna be honest here. I just watch this mini(?) movie to kill time and also to feel like I use my Free Premium Access in the most efficient way.So basically a battle royale featuring the Best Girl from a very popular LN series taking down every girl she meets at that isolated school setup? Yeah, the premise doesn\'t intrigue me, not even once. Also heard that this first part derived away greatly from the spin-off LN material and I can see why.The animation fight scenes neither great nor bad. Just average though the protagonist\'s abilities\' designs and transformation (?) sequence are made beyond expectations.Nevertheless,...not even the protagonist\'s Best Girl status can save this first part from being a dull & uninteresting to watch on your free time. The exposition dumps, especially when the new characters are being introduced through that, are also part of the reasons why this spinoff feels monotonous.I\'m about to watch Second Part so to sum up, I suggest you only watch this spinoff series if you\'re a dedicated fan of the protagonist whose role in the main series has somewhat make her earn ""Best Scene Stealer"" title. not even the protagonist\'s Best Girl status can save this first part from being a dull & uninteresting to watch on your free time.

Hibike! Euphonium Movie 1: Kitauji Koukou Suisougaku-bu e Youkoso,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31989/Hibike_Euphonium_Movie_1__Kitauji_Koukou_Suisougaku-bu_e_Youkoso,"['Since I\'m a big fan of Hibike! Euphonium, I decided to watch the movie yesterday and this movie was just 1 hour and 43 minutes of RECAP OF THE 1ST SEASON.Don\'t expect any new scenes in the movie because I can assure you that there aren\'t any. If you\'re going to watch the 2nd Season of Hibike and you\'ve watched the 1st Season but it\'s been a long time since you watched the 1st Season then you can watch the movie as a refresher because all the important plot points are in the movie. Otherwise, watch the 1st Season if you want a true...experience of Hibike! Euphonium or if you want to know why Asuka is best girl because the lack of Asuka in this movie is goddamn frustrating.Oh and the credits song is the OP from the 1st Season. The difference here is it\'s an ""Orchestra"" version but TRUE is still singing the song. If you want to hear the orchestrated version of Hibike\'s OP 1 then go ahead and go knock yourselves out.There\'s not much else to say about the movie, I suppose. It\'s just a recap, after all. Even though I already watched the 1st Season, I still enjoyed the movie. experience of Hibike!

Even though I already watched the 1st Season, I still enjoyed the movie.', ""To sum it up: it's a compressed version of the first season. It does however, have minor new scenes. Emphasis on minor. And it's only two. I'll go through what they are at the end of this review because it's a slight spoiler from the first season.I definitely recommend you watch this if you want to freshen up on what happened in the first season before watching the second season. But I do NOT recommend to watch this if you haven't watched the first season. It skips out on a lot of details that was in the first season and it'll ruin the experience...for sure. So if you are here because you'd rather watch a compressed version of the first season rather than going through the 13 episodes... hear me out and just give it a chance. Trust me when I say you will not regret it. (The animation/visuals in it are SO stunning).Minor spoilers ahead (is this even considered a spoiler tbh?)The added scenes were:1) They extended the scenes in the Sunrise festival, which was nice.2) They added a scene of Yuuko Yoshikawa and Mizore Yoroizuka interacting, which was NOT included in the first season. Glad they added it in though because it followed up within the second season and now things make more sense.As far as recap movies go, this is a solid 7/10. Good enough for a review of the first season, but not good enough on it's own. First time writing a review btw, so I hope it was helpful! for sure.

We all knew that we wouldn't get so much new material in this movie long before it came out (even though there are some scenes that weren't included here and there throughout the movie). So for those who want new materials by watching this movie, don't be surprised or disappointed if didn't match your expectation. Because as I already said this is only a recap. I also recommend people who are new to this show to watch the first season first and then...watch this. It's better that way. ;)On the other side, for those who loved the first season and want a fresh-up for what this series were about before jumping to season 2, I truly recommend to watch this short one and half hour movie rather than rewatching the whole season 1. This is my reasons for it.Story: 7/10I think the plot is very good made. It's a recap so you expect less story and scenes than what were in the series. I think they have done a very good job, but if I were to point out something negative about the plot it would be the events in the movie happens too fast. They jump from one scene to next in a instant. I think it would have been better to give each event a bit more screen time than it got.Regardless of that, I am glad they have included the most important scenes from the series. To spoil less as possible I will only mentioned some scenes that is worth mentioning. For instance most of the great scenes that surrounds Reina and Kumiko (our favorite yuri couple in this series, xP) have been included and they have been done very well too. Also they haven't forgot about the important scene that surrounds Reina and Kaori about who were going to play the trumpet solo in the competition. There are also other great scenes some other good scenes.Art: 10/10Just like how KyoAni didn't disappoint in season 1 (and also currently in the second season), they certainly didn't disappoint here either. Personally I think they did a better job with the animation in the movie than in the series. The animation is great throughout the whole movie but what really amaze me and my reasons for giving it a top score is very small details with the animation that goes so well with the plot.For example in the last scene before the band begins to play Kumiko and Asuka have a small talk. Asuka is a bit sad here, but that fades away with Kumiko's positive words. This is also shown with the animation. Right after that the lights gets turned on and the band start to play. Maybe it's not a big deal, but to me it were a sign that this wouldn't be their last competition and that they would even aim higher higher to the nationals after this. There is also many other good details that can be told, but I like to hold it short.Sound: 7/10Overall throughout the movie the sound were good. It's a music anime so it's expected to have good sound. But what I loved is that they have picked the best music pieces for this recap movie. In the series, as far as I remember, there is much more practice and a lot more music good pieces are played. But I am glad they took the scene were Reina plays a solo piece on the top of a hill. The music shows the sadness that is engraved deep in her heart. By remembering the scene before she plays that piece and by the conversation Natsuki and Kumiko have during Reina playing that piece, it's shown in a great way how Reina is feeling in that moment. This scene is one of my top favorite from both the series and the movie. There also other scenes were emotion are shown through music. This is another reason why I think they did good work with the sound beside having the band playing amazing in the last scene.Characters: 7/10As you maybe understand after watching this movie (or series for that matter) the whole anime is seen from Kumiko's eyes. So we get to know the characters mostly throughout her point of view. That's why most of us love either Reina or Asuka best. I agree they are both great characters, but personally I love Reina best. Reading others reviews I see they aren't so happy that Asuka didn't get so much screen time, but personally I don't care so much for that. Since this is all from Kumiko's point of view it's pretty obvious that Reina is the one that should get most screen time. So for me it makes sense. I think the other characters got enough screen time. Maybe Natsuki is the only one that should have got a bit more screen time, so I am maybe a bit sad about that. Otherwise the characters were good represented comparing it to the first season.Enjoyment: 9/10: I think I enjoyed this movie more than I should, but I guess that's because I am also a big fan of Hibike! Euphonium. :D I agree that the series have a lot of more details, but if you want to watch the greatness of season 1, I recommend to rewatch this movie instead of rewatching season 1 once more. A lot of unnecessary moments are avoided in my opinion.Overall 8/10: I think it deserve the same rating I gave to the series. Overall I think they have done a good job. I agree with people that the producers have skipped an important part of the season 1 (hint: the events that happened with Kaori and the rest of the second-year band members), even though it were mentioned a bit about it. I would be glad if they also made a recap movie of the second season and maybe add more details about this event.Anyway, overall I think they did an awesome work with this movie and they have done a great job with recap the first season.(Sorry if I made a too long review to give you all headache. :P I am not the type of guy who write reviews so it's really not my specialty. I usually only do it for some of the series I love most that I think deserve a review from me). watch this.

Wishes don\'t come true unless you mean it when you make them.""I think many of us face this dilemma: to try our best with the possibility of failure or put in some effort and do average. At least I do. I am afraid of putting in all my effort and not achieve results which in a way...also proves my limit. I know it is stupid, but I still feel the way I do.What I really like about this movie is that it tackles this (cliche) problem and motivates me in the process. The characters were enjoyable as well. My favourite one being Taki-sensei. His method of teaching his students and the respect and trust he gives them is admirable. He is strict but not demoralisingly rude. He thinks through and plans for how the students can improve instead of simply expecting them to practice more (because sometimes students don\'t know what to work on to be better and it makes them frustrated). I want teachers like that in my school.As a person who didn\'t watch the first season of this anime, I thought everything was done pretty well except for the pacing. It moved very quickly that at some points, I couldn\'t relate and didn\'t feel for the characters. Otherwise, it is worth the watch.

It felt like I was in the cinema for hours, stuck in a time chamber that slowed downtime were a 1 minute felt like 10. The animation, story, characters, voice acting, and pacing were all average or below. It's just odd because the last movie suffered from none of those problems.I think there were times when the animation did something unique with extremely long shot animation but even then half the time it didn't feel like polished animation.

It felt kind of James Bond-like somehow. The fight scenes looked great and kept me hooked throughout. The story was solid and didn't feel like any parts were pointless. The addition of the rest of the class in some parts of the film seemed forced. I liked the villain and his motives made a good reason for their actions, but there could have been more focus on their backstory in...some way. It didn't get boring at all, I was enjoying it that much that I waited until I was literally about to wet myself to go to the toilet. There were no parts in the film that dragged on. The art was definitely move quality and looked great in my opinion. The sound was as good as you can get with anime to be honest, same quality as the rest of the My Hero Academia series. The costumes were very cool but got at most a minute of screen time which I thought was stupid. Why were they wearing them in the first place if they were going to stop using them 5 minutes into the film?Anyway, I enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend watching it to anyone who likes the series as a whole. some way.

After such a slow season I expected a little bit more from the movie, but it seemed to have dragged out just as slowly. The plot became predictable right from the start, the score was incredibly underwhelming, the fight scenes felt long and visually dull. The last few fights were the only entertaining parts of the movie which was incredibly disappointing since they only lasted a few minutes towards the end. The lack of detail in each scene just created such a lazy tone to the movie.I still...have high hopes for the upcoming season but the movie just wasn’t worth the watch and contributed nothing to the series. have high hopes for the upcoming season but the movie just wasn’t worth the watch and contributed nothing to the series.', '*Some spoilers*I usually have pretty low expectations and am easily pleased. I find true delight in the very act of seeing a piece of art *try*, but boy howdy did this movie mess up my very simple starbucks order. Do or do not, there was no “try”.Preface of things I actually enjoyed:- Slapstick chase sequence at the beginning was cute & funny & props for the very dope shot of fixed-point parkour sakuga. One nice little creative sprinkle on top of this plain bagel.- Good Guy Deku™️ paying criminal bus fare with OFA. Deku is a caricature of himself at this point...but they at least got some comedy out of his dying husk.- Fugitive road trip bonding montage- Just 2 dudes covered in blood crying and laughing hysterically (you will ALWAYS get me with this). At least *some* fun tropes could be salvaged from the wreckage.- Rody in general ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Probably because he was the only person in the movie who was given any character whatsoever. The movie had a strange way of Stockholming me into liking him—confined within the lifeless walls of this movie, I became forced to find comfort in the little trappings of humanity he offered.Moving on:This thing was just not animated with movie quality at all. It seemed very unpolished, and there was perhaps 30 minutes total that outclassed TV(generous). I should not look at a *movie* and be not only unimpressed but actively noticing errors. The number of off-model faces FRONT AND CENTER was astounding. It was the sort of stuff that would catch my eye in a season and I would give it a pass, but I sat in a damn theater to watch this, so I’m giving it the full extent of my judgement. Gallows for the wonky boys.Never in my life have I seen eugenics, doomsday cults, and bio-terrorism so phenomenally wasted as plot points. How do you make some of the scariest ideologies known to man so BORING and hollow. I don’t need my shounen to have a nuanced political message or anything of the sort, but they couldn’t even play up these aspects for the sake of spectacle. I had the hype of seeing some shady religious imagery and thinking, “Oh hell yes, My Hero is about to get stupid-edgy”, only for it to fall flat entirely.Speaking of flat, we know Deku is simply not a character anymore, but you could’ve held up a stick figure with “Hero-kun” written on the face for the majority of this movie and gotten the same effect.If your movie has me leaving with like 15 wasted concepts that I want to see expanded upon in fanfic, then you done wrote a pretty bad movie.Zero, I mean ZERO, thought directed towards the doomsday cult that incites the movie. Exactly one of their members is given a motive, and it is ridiculous. There’s a recurring, seemingly intriguing quirked assassin trying to eliminate her own kind, and I’m not even sure she spoke. Once again, movie could’ve just subbed in a piece of paper that said “evil” on it and gotten just as far.Also, beyond being paper-thin and boring, the villain is just ugly design-wise. The animation of his quirk was at least inspired, but the man himself is laughable to look at. Don’t make your holy genocidal maniac a goofy lookin’ dork-ass if you won’t even Betelguese him.The amount of characters used in this movie for NO REASON. Every time I was shown a character besides todo/baku/deku and Rody legitimately felt like time-filler. In fact, a LOT of this movie felt like filler. So many useless pieces thrown together for the sake of cash content! Quick, get a cutaway of every student in 1A, we need more run-time!There’s a scene of tdbkdk looking at files on a computer like it’s hacking that’s so emblematic of this. It’s got Bakugou shoving people out of the way to make a discovery TWICE in the same scene just to fill air time. It is not funny, the repetition is not purposeful, it’s just messy and says “Idk what to write here.”Almost everything that happened moment to moment in this movie was a plothole; the plot itself became a reason-sucking void. 4% of decisions made sense with even a second of scrutiny. Deku struggles to pull a car up a hill with black whip instead of lifting the thing, and that stupidity is a symbol for every other action taken. Were my cringe-counter converted into shots, I would be dead.Also, in case you were wondering, not a single song slapped. Not even the montage song. Tragic. There was also a dramatic moment where Deku clenched his fist and it made a sound like my bare foot on a wood floor. He was wearing gloves. Nice foley.In conclusion: season 5 was beyond bad, but if you hoped it was at least a worthy sacrifice for the movie, think again.I know it’s fun shounen and my standards can only be so high, but this movie was buried 6 feet below an already low bar.The end credits deserved a GTA death screen for criminally WASTED potential. but they at least got some comedy out of his dying husk.- Fugitive road trip bonding montage- Just 2 dudes covered in blood crying and laughing hysterically (you will ALWAYS get me with this).

Depending on what year you asked someone you\'d get varying answers of how good this show is. If you asked someone in 2017 about MHA, they would tell you it\'s one of the best shows out. If you ask in 2021, they will tell you it\'s mid garbage. Why is this? Well, many theories come to my mind. The first one is pretty simple, it got popular. People don\'t like it when a show becomes more popular than their favorite show or a show they prefer over it. So what do they do? Shit on it till it becomes ""mid."" Every...anime that shoots up in popularity eventually has a ""mid"" phase to cancel out it\'s success because we all know success is something no one can have anymore in 2021. So now MHA is in a much more sorry state than it was in 2017-2018 when it was booming. Now with the question, is it because My Hero actually got worse or are people just sheep and like to have the mainstream opinions just to fit in? That\'s an answer for you to decide. People only started hating My Hero when it became a trend to. And now any content the show pulls out is neglected as a cash grab and pointless. It\'s quite pathetic tbh. Because imo, My Hero is and has been the best new gen show since 2017 and nothing as come close to it. Now in 2021, that kind of opinion would send you to the looney house and it\'s difficult to express it. My Hero has constantly pumped out quality content and has flowed its story for over 100 episodes without many hiccups. Bone\'s adaptation of the manga is amazing and one of the few shows where you can say both the manga and anime are high quality. And the movies they put out have god tier animation which can entertain anyone. It\'s just hard to ignore My Hero\'s success and it\'s almost objectively the best new gen simply from sales. World Heroes\' Mission doesn\'t take the back seat either and delivers eye candy that will have you on the edge of your seat for hours. The story was fine but it\'s a filler movie so I didn\'t expect it to be a Steven King novel anyways. The other reviews here are stabbing its story and idk what they expected from a filler movie. The cast is the same as they\'ve always been and the villain has a super cool power. Overall, this movie did what it was supposed to do, entertain. As to why people expected the next Dune level of writing I\'ll never understand but hey, sheep will be sheep eh? I hope to see My Hero gain back the respect it deserves but as of now, its bound to the fate of being a successful show, a mass of haters. anime that shoots up in popularity eventually has a ""mid"" phase to cancel out it\'s success because we all know success is something no one can have anymore in 2021.

Characters bleed more than in Saint Seiya, get impaled and choked like no tomorrow, and can still walk away just fine. Villains have powers or appearances unlike anything we see in the manga. Hyped moments from the main series get their themes reused...shamelessly.If you have the time to spare, watching it is fine, but don't expect anything besides a silly What-If. shamelessly.If you have the time to spare, watching it is fine, but don't expect anything besides a silly What-If."", ""As someone who experienced an anime on the big screen in the form of this film, for the first time ever, I absolutely enjoyed this ride. Lots of action, well-written characters and a captivating backdrop aside from the usual brilliant animation are among the key offerings of this superhero flick.There was enough heroism, drama and tension to back the story and there was also more humor than the first two movies. I must say this third film did well the usual job of showcasing a new character who ends up memorable. With Two Heroes, it was Melissa. With Heroes Rising, it was Katsuma and with...World Heroes' Mission, it's Rody: a cool, hilarious but also very well-written character memorable enough to be remembered even as the credits finish rolling. His friendly, brotherly bonding with Deku makes for an interesting watch throughout. Audience cheered at the heroic moments and laughed at the funny ones, implying the final product came out well with a proper mixture of serious and funny tones. There are times you'll get Spider-Man vibes, and in a good way.This is mostly a lighthearted film and hence has a feel-good vibe to it. Starting on an intense note, continuing to go that way and delivering a grand, epic battle like most anime action films is a job WHM does without trying too hard. I was also wowed by how beautiful the backgrounds looked, an absolute treat to eyes on the big screen! And, the villain seemed interestingly written as well. The music and background score were both pleasing to the ears, and became a reason enough for me to sit through the end credits. All in all, this is a fun action movie to be enjoyed best with a helping of popcorn and some beverages. If you love MHA, especially its inspiring heroes, you will enjoy this ride throughout. So book your tickets and fasten your seatbelts for an endless, fun-filled, action-packed ride.

And I\'m not even surprised with that. Although this movie takes a concept of Quirk\'s Doomsday Theory mentioned in the original manga, it doesn\'t really present or elaborate on it in any interesting way and uses it...as a plot device for our heroes to scatter around the world and fight. So if you were expecting this movie to actually be story relevant then well.. it\'s not, did you really expect it to be? Besides that it\'s all pretty generic stuff - villain wants to change the world, because he was wronged blah blah blah he gets beaten up by our greatest hero that pulls of his trump card of an absurdal, silly power-up at the end, no surprises there. That said - if you don\'t mind a generic story, then hear me out on the good part of this movie which is the animation.Art : 8/10Here we come to the star of the show and by that I mean the only star of the show really.. The animation is great, it\'s fluid and really makes the characters and the world feel alive and for me that\'s the main selling point of this movie. There are many cases of media that solely rely on attracting the viewer by outstanding visuals, but for more demanding viewers that\'s not gonna cut it. That being said, if you\'d like to enjoy some \'epicly\' animated fights then go ahead and give it a go.Sound : 6/10The sound design and voice-acting is alright, nothing much to write about. Soundtrack-wise there\'s a lot of music tracks previously used in the earlier BNHA seasons, but I don\'t really mind it. I\'m also pretty sure there were few new variants of already existing ost\'s in this movie, so that is welcome. And let\'s not forget this movies\' insert song (?) ""Empathy"" by Asian Kung-fu Generation, it\'s pretty neat.Character : 5/10From character stand-point I have few things to say :First : most of the characters are reccuring and if I remember correctly, this movie was marketed as ""all the heroes get together and save the world together"" or smth in those lines? Well they did gather and fought a bit, but as you might have guessed, our main trio had most of the spotlight once again, leaving most of the other character serving a purpose of filling the movie run-time and I\'m going to say it once more : no surprises there. If you\'re looking for your fave side characters to shine, then go watch Heroes Rising, it does a better job at that. So what about the new characters? Well Rody is alright, he has a cool design, but overall he isn\'t a really complicated character, but I don\'t think he really has to be. Him and Deku becoming buddies felt light-hearted and cheerful which I really liked and his role in the movie was alright. Then we have main antagonist and his goons. So yeah the antagonist is basically a Megamind-looking dude that wants to eradicate quirks, he\'s pretty one-dimensional and his backstory is boring. Then we have his goons : The bow-lady, the twins with extending sword arms quirk and others. Well all these characters are movie-only so don\'t expect them to show up again. The best character from this movie was the egyptian guy called Salaam.Enjoyment : 5/10I sat through this entire movie, but wasn\'t too engaged either so I think 5/10 is a fair score. I did enjoy few bits of animation and interaction between characters, but that\'s all. The final fight between Deku and Flect Turn was just silly and it made me laugh.Overall : 6/10If you\'re looking for more elaboration on this series\' characters or world then this movie is not for you, but if you\'d like some anime fights with your favorite character trio of Deku, Bakugo and Shoto and you\'re alright with a story of a simpler premise, then go ahead.

Rody is likable enough and managed to carry a decent portion of the film.

First things first, I loved the fight scenes in the third act of the movie. Todoroki, Bakugo and Midoriya each have their own fight at the end of the film and I found watching those to be extremely entertaining and well choreographed. However, this alone was not enough to save the movie in my eyes.The biggest problem I have is with the story. It is generic, bland, and uninteresting with a premise that COULD have...been very interesting. As I watched this movie I felt like I had already seen this movie before. Also, the movie was marketed as taking place all over the world. However, the only place that matters is the country where Deku, Bakugo, and Shoto are. Everyone else is kinda pointless in this film. Sure they have some stuff to do at the end of the film but its ultimately the main 3 at the end of the film working together to Phantom Menace the whole situation. I think the story fails most largely in not really incorporating the other members of class 1-A at other locations across the world. Wouldn\'t it have been awesome and intense if each location had a specific job to do, and the heroes could only win if everyone successfully completed their task? I believe that would have been way more interesting than what we got.Another thing that I found disappointing was how they dealt with Midoriya being falsely accused as a mass murderer. HE ONLY ENCOUNTERS THE LAW ONCE IN THE MOVIE. Yes, he is on the run for most of the film but it doesn\'t feel like it since he never encounters any authority figures. Also, the writing was lazy with the whole framing. There was never even any evidence that was used against Midoriya. The only reason why it happened was because ""oh, bad guys infiltrated the police so we don\'t need to write in any evidence against Deku"". To me, that is bull shit and lazy writing. If they wanted to make the film more compelling, lean into that more and make us truly feel like Deku was actually in trouble.Also, those badass suits they used in the marketing were only in the first minute of the film. WTF is with that???Summary: Fighting was good and well choreographed. Story was a mess. 5/10. been very interesting. As I watched this movie I felt like I had already seen this movie before.

I've heard more emotions coming from these characters in the regular seasons that in this movie.Story and characters:1) the biggest flaw for me was pacing. We're talking about a movie that lasts almost 2 hours and 45 minutes in, I almost fell alseep. We are introduced very early on to a new character that will occupy the screentime for ages throughout the movie but there's no charisma to him. His screentime could've been cut short (and it should!) and the story would still be the same.2) Not only that, but I get the most joy out of this franchise when I get to watch a bunch of heroes showing off their quirks and developing themselves as indivuals and unfortunately this movie in my opinion focuses way too much on Deku. This is what made me fall in love with the franchise, how every character is very important and doesn't exist just to feed the main character.3) Bakugou, Deku and Shoto don't act like they normally would. Deku becomes dumber for whatever reason, Shoto forgets that ice is frozen water and Bakugou had no intensity to his attitude.Watch this is if you're a BnHA super fan of course but prepare to be disappointed or watch this in 2x speed or something so it's less painful.

Hero's rising was a fantastic movie, containing fantastic art, fights, b plots, and an overall decent story arc. Hero's mission though falls short in all of these categories. The art was good, bones have shown they can do much, much better, but it was good. There were several fights where the animation quality took SUCH A DIP mid fight for no reason, I couldn't tell you where the budget truly went on this film, considering its my hero, and demon slayer just grossed...so much, you think they would pour loads into the budget and try make something fantastic, but even the big final fight had stupid choreography and animation. The story was just uninteresting, generic main villain AND side , who was under developed so i grew no feelings towards, which is a shame because even the side villains/henchmen had decent potential. I didn't think any character introduced was particularly interesting, just a very bland safe characters, the main one i felt was very Hawks inspired, so its probably just for overall fan appeal. Every B plot was bad or under developed, as in the last 2 films, Todoroki and bakugo have a separate big fight from Midoria, they were just not good, and there was even clips of every other classmate in some sort of battle, but all under developed, all with lack lustier choreography.and a little side note, the music was so good in Hero's rising, I'd even say amazing, you say run is literally the motivational music meme in the anime community right now, and it did not hit home anywhere near as much as before, i didn't even take notice of it to be honest, maybe i need a second watch, but i guess its hard to strike gold twice, would of just been nice for this to be an OVERALL improvement to the second filmGive it a watch if you want, its got zero story relevance, the fights aren't all that crazy (Although a bit darker for MHA, which is a nice change), and you'd probably find more enjoyment out of just watching a whole other anime tbh, I find it worse to watch something mediocre more than anything. so much, you think they would pour loads into the budget and try make something fantastic, but even the big final fight had stupid choreography and animation.

There are some scene that really feels like Bones, but, it just feels like not being utilized to the fullest.Sound, and char development, standard i guess.

Movie 1 with how much/far can tools enhance their users quirks beyond what they can do, even if they\'ve already mastered their quirk. Movie 2 with multiple quirks or sharing quirks is like and also another explanation of how grass head\'s quirk work that we didn\'t get in main story. But this movie\'s sole important factor, besides marketing figures. is some piece...of info the main story eventually covers and in a more flushed out way making this movie by definition literally pointless[my hate rant for this dumpster fire of a movie]-big plot hole at (or end of) the climax-extremely boring-literal waste of time-generic American film plot of terrorist having bombs all over the world-massive plot hole at the end-only good thing is the animations-literal deceptive marketing all to sell figures of grass head, icy-hot, and Bakugo in cool looking outfits-they tried making the plot device movie character interesting by making him feel like a swindler/cocky but it falls flat-the villain had better treatment than Naruto when he was a kid but villain decided to become a cult terrorist-the movie ends on something that was suppose to be like an important foreshadowing to the overarching plot of my hero but felt like a poorly executed foreshadowing that was too stretched out which can just be summarized into a short paragraph but had a generic American film slapped on top of it-the poor street guy is the definition of cliché guy the American film where protagonist meets and saves/helps and they\'re actually important to the plot and they help the protagonist back (and tbh, they\'re so boringly cliché you don\'t even care about them)-only good thing about this is the animations and the final fight, everything else is terrible-the big bad guy\'s literal reason to make a cult and be a terrorist because he got the Naruto treatment of ""oh I was treated different because i was different in a certain way"" which the way the movie did it was literally only for a few seconds nearing the end of the final fight and it just made the big bad guy

in the trailers was literal deceptive marketing for the movie as they promoted the hell out of the black raid outfits, even in the figures, but the screen time the black raid outfits got was literally less than 5 minutes only to never be seen again besides trying to sell figures-one of the biggest plot holes to this disappointment of a movie is how when when grass head, cliché plot boy. icy-hot,

bombs are connected to a super computer that\'s down like a few miles worth of just spiral stairs with no other possible entry\'s. the stupidest thing is cliché plot boy got shot and was heavily injured to the point they did a fake-out death for him while he was a few meters away from the super computer when it had a few seconds left until the bombs do off, but he somehow made it down those miles of stairs while bleeding out in just a minute at most because the directors wanted to build tension of ""oh the protagonist is staling the big bad guy and cliché plot boy while seemingly dying only has a few minutes at most to reach the bottom of miles of stairs"" which he slowly dragged his ass on the side of the walls-even after grass head defeated the big bad guy he was able to get down those miles in just a few seconds because he had super speed, unlike cliché plot boy of info the main story eventually covers and in a more flushed out way making this movie by definition literally pointless[my hate rant for this dumpster fire of a movie]-big plot hole at (or end of) the climax-extremely boring-literal waste of time-generic American film plot of terrorist having bombs all over the world-massive plot hole at the end-only good thing is the animations-literal deceptive marketing all to sell figures of grass head, icy-hot, and Bakugo in cool looking outfits-they tried making the plot device movie character interesting by making him feel like a swindler/cocky but it falls flat-the villain had better treatment than Naruto when he was a kid but villain decided to become a cult terrorist-the movie ends on something that was suppose to be like an important foreshadowing to the overarching plot of my hero but felt like a poorly executed foreshadowing that was too stretched out which can just be summarized into a short paragraph but had a generic American film slapped on top of it-the poor street guy is the definition of cliché guy the American film where protagonist meets and saves/helps and they\'re actually important to the plot and they help the protagonist back (and tbh, they\'re so boringly cliché you don\'t even care about them)-only good thing about this is the animations and the final fight, everything else is terrible-the big bad guy\'s literal reason to make a cult and be a terrorist because he got the Naruto treatment of ""oh I was treated different because i was different in a certain way"" which the way the movie did it was literally only for a few seconds nearing the end of the final fight and it just made the big bad guy

I thought it would be detective style like the first movie or even more thrilling but no, i'm disappointed a lot. It focused too much in action and overused drama/sad history of a side/new introduced character/s.Story 3Character 4The flow was too blunt, predictable and too much unnecessary moments. Lack of story writing and obviously rushed. It could give us more screening to the other characters/heroes which I expected from the beginning, even Class 1 B is there.

As well as in its soundtrack which gave us more spirit to feel the action and some overused drama. Especially the last fight! damn that is GREAT Bones studio.Enjoyment 6In conclusion, its great for Deku, Shoto and Todoroki's big fans to see this movie which focuses to them only. If you like a full action anime/movie this is kinda good to recommend(but needs to watch season 1 to 5 first of course).

However, this climax didn’t feel stupidly over-the-top enough to offset the rest of the movie, so I think it’s better than Two Heroes. HOWEVER, it still really focuses hard on The Main Three (Midoriya, Bakugo, and Todoroki). I like how Hero Academia at least tries to make all of Class A relevant and you can tell they tried a little here, but the effort falls completely flat and puts it behind Heroes Rising personally.But most...importantly: Do you need to watch Season 5 to watch this? I don’t think so. If you’re planning on watching it already then obviously do that first, but it follows the movies’ trend on being non-canon more than enough. Midoriya has a new One For All move that’s introduced in the first half of Season 5, but the movie doesn’t necessarily highlight it in a way that would leave you confused. Todoroki also has some new moves, but I doubt you’d even notice.I’m torn on the movie’s antagonist group: Humarise. On one hand, their scariness is shown off very well right off the bat thanks to a pretty gruesome scene. Their belief that quirks will become so convoluted that they’ll become a real problem is in-line with how the series looks at the nature of heroes from alternate perspectives — which you may or may not like. In this case, I think the base idea is worth looking into…but the movie instead focuses more on the very extreme “genocide” part of their plan.The weirdest part about Humarise is how their influence is never properly explained. Normally this isn’t a problem, but the majority of the movie’s plot — Deku and Rody being on the run — relies on it to be convincing. At the same time, it’s not that hard to put aside. Even if the reason for Deku and Rody bonding is flimsy, I found that chunk of the movie to be pleasant. I like Rody as a character since he clashes with Deku’s personality and ideals enough to make their relationship interesting without clashing so much that it’s overbearing. His bird, Pino, was an entirely unnecessary annoyance though.The namesake of the movie — all of the heroes we met so far splitting up to oversee the safety of multiple regions of the world — was extremely underplayed for being the namesake of the movie. As mentioned, this movie is a Midoriya, Bakugo, and Todoroki movie. It’s actually mostly about Midoriya which is fine (this series IS his story after all), but when the other two prominently show up I can’t help but roll my eyes. To be fair, the teams worldwide weren’t up to much anyways so giving them more screentime would’ve worked against the movie. It only existed to present Humarise as a worldwide threat. So ultimately, its execution felt half-baked and unnecessary.The climax of the movie is thankfully pretty tame this time. There’s no big CG monster or anything. Heck, the fight with the Big Bad is actually pretty interesting with its pacing and theming. But it does suffer from the Musou game problem: the protagonists just mowing down a bunch of mooks without taking damage themselves. This is all while the “camera” swings around so you can’t actually see anything. It also throws Bakugo and Todoroki to the side, which had me wondering why they were even injected there in the first place.World Heroes’ Mission is a pretty tame, enjoyable movie. Its plot doesn’t reach the heights of intrigue that the anime has and it might not entirely fit together at times, but it doesn’t do anything too stupid or annoying that took me out of it. importantly: Do you need to watch Season 5 to watch this?

Especially looking back at Heroes Rising, which I believe is the best of the 3 current movies (Not saying too much though, as all the movies are kind of forgettable. Though I cried to the second movie lol). A movie that was started by a misunderstanding and a backstory that was ""whatever"" so to say. This was another case of a villain whose backstory...and cause for starting this whole thing was really average and ""mediocre"". I didn\'t care enough for why he started this, as he was so bland of a villain, that it didn\'t matter. (That\'s to be expected though, can\'t develop a villain in an 1 hour and 44 minutes unless done correctly). There is also the appearance and backstory of Rory Soul, the deuteragonist of this movie. While Rory is a decent character, his personality and backstory are nothing special even with his relevancy to the plot. He\'s just your normal, everyday, movie original character.What ""carried"" this movie to me was the art and sound, as the action scenes were very (and I mean VERY) well animated. Though just like the plot, they were kind of underwhelming as I personally didn\'t get goosebumps, pumped up, or immersed because of them at all. They were just really ""flashy"" and ""shiny"" (Not a bad thing at all though. As I said, they were animated extremely well, probably the best I\'ve seen of all MHA action scenes). This obviously showed where the budget for season 5 could\'ve potentially been placed if the movie wasn\'t made.(Though the animation for season 5 wasn\'t even that bad, I believe people were nitpicking too much about it.)Another thing to watch out for is, if you\'re a fan of most (if not all) of Class-1A, be prepared to be ""disappointed"". Most of the focus this time around was on Rory Soul (Movie original), and the big three of Deku , Todoroki , and Bakugo with occasional appearances from other members of Class-1A plus pro heroes. Some of Class-1A actually appear just once or twice, with some not even fighting at all.One thing I will say is that If there is a 4DX showing for you like there was for me, I believe the movie should be watched in 4DX, as it was actually kind of cool to experience with the fight scenes with my chair moving around, mist and wind being shot in my face, etc. Something that was really unique and different.Besides that, the movie wasn\'t personally my cup of tea. As said, the 4DX and action scenes were the only thing that carried it for me due and prevent me from rating the movie 3 or 4 due to a very ""mid"" plot and forgettable villain. As I sit here typing this review, honestly I\'ve already forgotten most things about the movie (that I just finished seeing 2 hours ago at the time of typing this up lol) since it wasn\'t that great in my book. I still recommend going out and seeing it if you\'re a fan of the series. Just be warned, it won\'t bring too much to you if you\'re a seasoned veteran of the series like me.Also, for those who ended up enjoying the movie, I\'m really glad you did!! :) (As I\'m just one person, so take my ""review"" with a grain of salt.

The animation quality is amazing in certain fights. Other than that, it\'s like they completely whiffed at everything else-The story has a nice hook and some really good ideas but the way it\'s delivered leaves much to be desired. The movie leaves you feeling ""Damn, this could\'ve been really great, but ended up mediocre""-Everyone gets a...bit of screen time, but most of it is focused on the Jonas Brothers trio (Bakugo, Deku, Shoto)NEGATIVE POINTS: oh boy, here we go - everything else is so mediocre-Despite having a good hook, the entire plot feels completely surreal. It\'s as if every character started making dumb choices just to make the plot move forward (specially the MC, Deku turns into a complete dunce in this movie, despite usually being a pretty bright kid). One section of the movie has deku chasing this quirkless dude throughout the city and our main character, despite having one of the most broken physical enhancement powers in the show, can\'t catch up to a normal malnourished dude whose greatest strength is parkour-The characters, holy moly, are so god damn dumb. All of them added together don\'t have more than a single brain cell. Deku\'s naivete and lack of a brain make lower the overall score of the movie by themselves. The movie keeps switching between moments where he shines followed right after by moments of utter incompetence.And the stupid bird was so unnecessary. It\'s explained in the story, but it was kinda forced. The idea was good, the execution was badThe villains, dayum, they are so generic and forgettable. The fights are amazing but these villains are so lameThe main antagonist is such an absolute joke with daddy issues - everything from looks to backstory is laughable. The fight had good choreography and amazing animation, but there was no strategy or thought put into it - just deku powering through with pepega monke power and friendship. Also, considering the villain\'s backstory, how is he even supposed to be able to fight at the same level as a hero student with lots of training? It makes 0 sense, but that\'s just how most of the plot of this movie is anyway-The comedy is very hit or miss. Sometimes, it\'s as if they were targeting 5 year olds, so you\'re just left staring at the screen with no reaction whatsoever. There are a few good jokes here and there, more on the second half of the movie - in the midst of all the garbage you can find a few golden coins-Since the MC and good guys are heroes, plot-wise they can\'t kill villains. The thing is, they use such incredible violence and power (specially bakugo) that you can\'t help but laugh when they tell you ""Oh, and the villains definitely didn\'t die after being hit point blank with a tornado of TNT, flames, being smashed by a huge boulder and explosions/super kick that made a hole in a wall of steel and destroyed the whole building but somehow left the villain alive"".OVERALL: 6/10. A movie you can watch if you enjoy seeing some very high quality animation and incredible fights + mindless fun, because everything else is pretty much mediocre/bad, leaving a lot to be desired.

The thing is, they use such incredible violence and power (specially bakugo) that you can\'t help but laugh when they tell you ""Oh, and the villains definitely didn\'t die after being hit point blank with a tornado of TNT, flames, being smashed by a huge boulder and explosions/super kick that made a hole in a wall of steel and destroyed the whole building but somehow left the villain alive"".OVERALL: 6/10. A movie you can watch if you enjoy seeing some very high quality animation and incredible fights + mindless fun, because everything else is pretty much mediocre/bad, leaving a lot to be desired. The movie mostly follows the law of cool and really doesn\'t care much about making sense. If you\'re a fan of the series and just want to watch Jonas Brothers doing cool things though, you\'ll love the movie. Sadly, it could\'ve been a lot better, specially in comparison to the second movie', 'I went into this movie with high expectations considering how much I liked the last two movies. And honestly felt let down. I don\'t think it\'s bad, but it feels a bit basic. Like a by-the-numbers anime spin-off movie.I did really like Rory as a character, and his little arc was satisfying.I think the villain being the head of an anti-quirk cult had the potential to be very interesting. But not a ton of focus was put onto it.Despite being called ""world heroes mission"", we don\'t get to see what\'s going on much apart from a bit of the country it takes place in. I...was thinking this was going to be some sort of globe-trotting mission, or that we were going to get more focus on the other groups acting around the world. But it is very Deku-centric. Even Bakugou and Todoroki get sidelined, apart from getting one fight each.The animation also feels sub-par for a film budget. Not bad or hard to look at, but some of the action scenes just look unfinished.

In this case the animation and character designed looked similar to a season budget and not a movie budget. The characters them sleves were boring and any comedy were mostly childish skits like farting or someone face planting. The stroy was honestly worse than average it waa just really bad. Tbe definition of plot armor/the power of freindship. I was really disappointed in all honesty and for the first time in my life I actually fell asleep during the middle of...the movie. Ive never written a review but the disappointment in this movie was simple to much.  I do not recommend to watch the movie.

I do not recommend to watch', ""This movie hits a lot of right spots and a lot of bad spots.First off, with everyone saying the animation was bad; it was a single action scene that maybe went on for too long and wasn't even that bad. I found it interesting to look at and enjoyed seeing something new. I will not deny that it looks a tad unpolished though.I think what this movie really hinged on was its characters. It very successfully established one of the main protagonists of this movie, Rody, in a concise yet efficient manner. I can understand his motivations and sympathize with him. I can even excuse...some of his more questionable actions due to it fitting his character very well. He was easily the best character in the entire movie and maybe even the whole franchise.I wish I could say the same for the main antagonist... I won't reveal much for the sake of spoilers, but he needed WAY more fleshing out than he got. He shows up for 10 seconds in the first half of the movie, and while his goals are made clear, his actual motivation and backstory is just randomly dropped in a couple lines of dialogue during the final battle in the latter half of the movie. It was so weak. This was the problem I also had with the second MHA movie.I found it very hard to care for the villain of this movie, and I really wanted to. He could've been so much greater than he was, and all we really needed was just a few minutes in the first act dedicated to some exposition the same done with Rody.Everything else was great, however. Especially the animation and payoff for the fight scenes. If you're a Hero Academia fan, you probably already know that it likes to have a lot of down time in between fights just to flesh out the characters a bit (which is fine by me). Some people don't enjoy that, which is why they may find many scenes boring.Overall the movie is a 7/10. some of his more questionable actions due to it fitting his character very well.

This is the worst thing I watched in 2022.

But I feel like it’s always about a villain that wants to take control of the world or purify people and in the end they don’t. With that being said I didn’t feel bored watching this,  it was just basic in a sense.The introduction to the new character was sweet and his backstory made it better. Honestly if your caught up to my hero you don’t really have to watch this movie to be caught up, I felt like this was filler. I...watched it at home so ofc I didn’t get the cinema experience which would make it better but yea.But with all that being said I have high hopes for this season 6 that’s about to come out.

Compared to the other Bnha movies, this one is pretty solid.I am only writing this review because I read the others prior to watching the movie last night, and the movie turned out completely different from what I was expecting.People saying the fights are not that great, it didn\'t strike me as lacking; they actually delivered. I really dont know what you were expecting lmao. And there is this fight that gave me Naruto vibes which I liked.People saying it is predictable, well bnha as a whole has a decent percentage of predictability, but it still managed to keep me interested...in the plot throughout. You might know that ""oh yeah they will defeat the bad guy and have a happy ending, prolly with a lil drama"", but no one could have guessed the journey, which was really enjoyable. The plot gives strong vibes of American live-action movies.People complaining about seeing other students.. bruh they are plot of the anime, and from the way the reviews are written I thought I was gonna get bored by the extras, when their screen time was well dosed, just the necessary, and contributed to the movie.The main thing I liked, is that Deku is the least mid version of himself in this movie.The main thing I disliked, is the new character\'s quirk. He told Deku not to laugh.. bro I\'m crying over how useless and cringe this is like bruh why.Also the bad guy had stupid reasons please find better and come back. Compared to the hero killer\'s book this felt so shallow, personal, and just weird.

As the title said, now they decide to include all the nation around the world as their stage.Story, pretty much like the other shonen hero movie.. Where the MC Get powered up when they remember their friends. I was expecting something flashy and I get something flashy.. Unfortunately, something's a bit off with this movie.. I felt bland, just plain straight. No hype or up and down while watching the film. The only twist that I got or I felt that they show the civilians get killed in this movie not just knocked out. The villain's group has an interesting motive...why they become the bad guy.So I'll rate it 6/10Art, much better than the last movie. Not just the flashy fight but they improve all the environment the side characters and even the unimportant one.. The small-fry like Bakugo said. As much as my eyes can see, there are no bad animation in this movie or no bad CGI was used in this film. I'll rate 8/10.Sound, pretty okay I guess.. Good but not extraordinary. 7/10Character, pretty much the same like other BNHA movies or the series. I like a bit of the villains group but I really hate the villain's boss.. It's really bad, cliche backstory, bad design (I'm not an expert but I was expecting something dazzling or something evil design since it's the villain like AFO or Shiragaki.) Ngl, the villain has unique quirk and definitely has potential to be fancy looking quirk but they failed to reach that potential. Just a normal use quirk basically. (I won't spoil anything about the villain, so if you're curious. Watch the film.) I'll rate it 6/10.N.P : I really really disappointed with the villain of this film. Really bad.Summarize : This film has potential, and they definitely improve at some aspect but they failed to reach that potential..

The movies always feature awesome animation of action scenes. It was a treat to enjoy the character fighting and pulled out incredible moves. The biggest problem with the movies is that they are basically filled with no consequences to the main series. Because of this, the story usually had little significance and not worth investing, except maybe the second movie.The third installment was...almost no different. The fight animation was still fun, although not as awesome as the second. Shoto, Bakugo, and Deku all had their own scenes where they showed their ultimate moves, and I enjoyed the movie mostly for that.However, the story was again not memorable. It moves very quickly without any deep exploration into the villains or why the Humarise organization rose. This time Deku made another companion, who had a pretty lame quirk that wasn’t worth all the wait. The quirk didn’t have as much significance as it was intended to when it was revealed.Also, near the end Deku again pulled out a new move, which I had a problem with. It would be spoiler to talk about it, but basically it should have had more consequences. Of course, the movie just didn’t even bother justify it. At least the second movie tried to for Deku’s ridiculous move.Overall, it should not be a surprise that the actions were fun, but the movie was still forgettable. 7/10 almost no different.

I find it a fun experience to see these well-known characters in new and different situations. At the end of the day, I watch anime to have fun! I watch anime to laugh, to cry, to see all kinds of unique characters interact with just as unique stories. However, I understand that as non-cannon movies hold no weight within the main story, they are very limited in what kind of impact that it is able to produce on not just the story\'s characters, settings, and themes, but also the story\'s audience. What immediately went askew was the writers...deciding to make this a ""World” Mission. In the previous MHA movies, the stories took place both on isolated islands with characters that were not to be seen again, as Movie 1 took place on I-Island featuring David and Melissa Shields, while Movie 2 was set within Nabu Island staring the Shimano family. Due to this, anything can happen to the I-Island or Nabu Island inhabitants, which creates tangible steaks. Going into this movie, we know that Class 1A will be fine in the end – as this is a non-cannon filler movie – but that also means that anything can happen to these new characters and settings, with interesting things actually happening to them: homes are destroyed, powers are lost, and we see these new characters reflect, introduce and develop on certain themes and ideas from the original show.However, by attempting to \'raise the steaks\' (now putting the whole world in danger instead of just a small island) the writers have ironically lowered the steaks, as we all know the whole world will ultimately be unaffected whatsoever. Even as a shocking false news story is spread about one of the Class 1A members, we know nothing will ever come of it. The movie\'s new main character who goes on an adventure alongside Izuku Midoriya is also set up in a way where we know that he will be okay in the end. With that being said, it could be debated and rebutted that \'it\'s not about the destination, it\'s about the journey\', meaning that even if we know everything will 100% be okay at the end, what about the story that takes place on the way there?I have been watching MHA since it first aired, and I felt like every story beat or character decision in World Mission was one we have already seen in MHA. Now, don\'t get me wrong, I still thoroughly enjoy MHA as a whole, including its highs, lows, and everything in between. However, during Movie 1 we had that moment of Katsuki Bakugo thanking Eirijo Kirishima for saving him, or Shoto Todoroki catching Kastuki smiling at both All Might and Izuku Midoriya. In Movie 2, we have those small moments such as Todoroki creatively and yet still spitefully adding a freezing twist onto his father\'s ultimate move. I felt like we never had a moment like that in World Mission. Everything was up to the same storytelling standard as the main series but did not take the opportunity to do anything with it. Midoriya does his thing and his friends back him up: nothing really more to say.I felt like the animation was also a bit hit or miss - it was either great or not the best, just depending on which scene you were watching – but regardless looked better on the big screen, so I understand why many people watching it at home on laptops, phones or tablets may have not had the best visual experience. The score was pretty good and engaging, although I will admit I have a bit of a bias and soft spot for the MHA score.Did I have fun watching it? Yes, of course I did.Will I watch it again?

The fact that it revolved around quirkless people was intriguing because they were kind of forgotten in the main series. What doesn't really make sense is why almost only Japanese heroes and hero students are handling an international crisis. (Well... I guess they can't really introduce us to a handful...of new heroes but it still felt kind of odd to me...)Most of the movie is spent with the new character Rody Soul and Deku and this part is surprisingly enjoyable (even the calmer moments).The last part is standard MHA stuff (the hero/villain stand-off). Here, the MHA movies have a common theme of unbelievable fight scenes where the kids get so hurt that they should have been dead minutes ago. I guess you get used to it considering it's the same in the series with Deku breaking his arms three times in a row.ANIMATION [6/10]:The animation was fine but a lot of fight scenes overwhelmed me. So many things happened that I straight up didn't know what was going on. Nevertheless, the choreography was very good (especially in the chase scene). But in those scenes, the background suffers and loses its details which really threw me off.SOUND [6/10]:Not really anything to say about the music and sounds.CHARACTER [9/10]:In every MHA movie, there is a new character introduced: in the first movie it's Melissa, in the second it's that little boy and now it's Rody Soul. Honestly, it’s a shame he’s not in the main series. His character was well-written, likeable and hilarious. The friendship he develops with Deku throughout the movie was awesome and you actually get to know him.The only negative aspects are the stupid decisions or actions some characters make. For example, the chase scene. I understand that Rody knows the city better than a newcomer like Deku, but come on! He's a hero student!ENJOYMENT [8/10]:I actually think that this was the best MHA movie (mainly because of Rody) and I watched it two times (once a few months ago and now when it hit the cinemas in my country).

This movie more or less uses it as window dressing and is at times too busy being something else entirely.Based on the big Shonen Jump series, My Hero Academia, comes its third theatrical outing. And from the title, World Heroes Mission, one would assume it should be more global in scale... thats not really the case for the most part.The main plot is set around a mysterious terrorist organization named ""Humarise"" with plans to rid the world of the series staple ability ""Quirks"" and their users...with the use of bombs set up around the world. The main trio from the series, Izuku Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo, and Shoto Todoroki come along with their classmates, divided into teams with other professional heroes from both their home in Japan and around the globe to stop Humarise. However, Midoriya and the movies original main character, Rody Soul, get caught up into an incident that the police of the country of Otheon declare Midoriya a criminal!Said incident, where briefcases get swapped, where I believe even the script of the movie gets swapped, as instead of a world sprawling action rescue mission, we mostly get a second act that goes about as a buddy roadtrip with Midoriya and Rody. And there\'s nothing wrong with that, I personally find it does the original character alot of service. Roy is a very entertaining character and even endearing, a very expressive person with a cute little bird mascot like being called Pino. But it does come at a cost of anything substantial for the ""world"" part of the movie.Every once in a while we get to see the other heroes in action, including alot of the cast from the series, Ochaco, Froppy, Fatgum, Endeavor, Hawks, etc and they and their scenes are entirely just for action set pieces, not even anything for the movie exclusive heroes (Including a paper thin Pharoah looking guy, I really wanted to know more about him, but got nothing).Same can be said about the villains too. I don\'t if I just didn\'t pay attention enough or something, but if it wasn\'t for this nice little booklet I got at the theater, I wouldn\'t even have known any names whatsoever expect for the main villain, but honestly most of the villains might have been left entirely nameless cause there\'s no development for them at all, Rody got all of that, even Bakugo and Todoroki get get nothing except fights.At the very least the movie treats you to very spectacular action scenes, not too many down time moments for the first and third acts of the film. Personally I found that Bakugos fight in the third was pretty brutal, I halfway expected him to get help midway through, while Todoroki doesn\'t really have anything different to display from what has been shown in the anime and manga. And Midoriyas fight was, to put it as basic as I can, rubber banding himself at the main villain. But yeah, the animation was pretty top notch for the majority of the film, with a very fun and entertaining chase scene at the beginning.But I really have to put more into how disappointed I was with the set up. There was so much with Rody and the fictional city of Otheon and despite how much I liked Rody, there was nothing substantial from the rest of the world or other original heroes and villains that I have to wonder why was the movie even called ""World Heroes Mission?""Even Midoriya was pretty flat and bland in this movie.At least to go alot with the animation, the music was pretty good, though mostly slight remixes of themes from the anime (Yes, You Say Run is played in the final fight too), and I personally saw the English dub, for anyone like myself that enjoys the dub, its well done here too.Overall:+ Good Animation+ Good action scenes, especially Bakugos fight and the first acts chase scene.+ Rody Soul is very enjoyable character that\'s easy to care about.- Doesn\'t live up to the title, almost feels misleading.- Villains are basically nameless nobodies to get beaten up.- Original world heroes get nothing in this movie.- Everyone that wasn\'t Rody was either just there for action scenes or don\'t get any development. with the use of bombs set up around the world.

There was so much with Rody and the fictional city of Otheon and despite how much I liked Rody, there was nothing substantial from the rest of the world or other original heroes and villains that I have to wonder why was the movie even called ""World Heroes Mission?""Even Midoriya was pretty flat and bland in this movie.At least to go alot with the animation, the music was pretty good, though mostly slight remixes of themes from the anime (Yes, You Say Run is played in the final fight too), and I personally saw the English dub, for anyone like myself that enjoys the dub, its well done here too.Overall:+ Good Animation+ Good action scenes, especially Bakugos fight and the first acts chase scene.+ Rody Soul is very enjoyable character that\'s easy to care about.- Doesn\'t live up to the title, almost feels misleading.- Villains are basically nameless nobodies to get beaten up.- Original world heroes get nothing in this movie.- Everyone that wasn\'t Rody was either just there for action scenes or don\'t get any development.', ""I won't lie, this movie was the weakest of the three My Hero Academia movies.Honestly, the plot had such a great premise, but they dropped the ball.One of the things I felt while watching the movie was that it was so long! So much 'filler' and not enough plot. I liked the montage of Deku and Rody on the road trip, that was nice, but it felt flat. The art was cool the montage and the music was well done(like a bnha music video), but that's about it. Everything else was just talked to death.When it finally came to the fights at the...end, it was just disappointing. Watching Bakugo's fight was just off. Like, it didn't seem like Bakugo. It felt like the movie 'knew' Bakugo's personality, but didn't quite get it. Just missed the mark. Not in a way that was over the top, but just enough to make you wonder if that was Bakugo. Todoroki's fight, was, well.... I almost forgot he was there tbh. If it wasn't for the art style of his fight scene, I might have completely forgotten he contributed anything to the movie.Writing this review, I'm starting to second guess my score and wonder if I should have gone for a 5 instead of a 6. Overall, the art was good, and there was a very nice roadtrip/tourbus type scene, but that was it. The plot was so bad, I'm almost embarrassed to call it a plot. Too much time was spent on building the backstories and pointless monologues of other characters. Not enough time was spent on the actual meat of the plot, or the villain for that matter. Instead, it was like you were secretly checking the time, wondering how much longer until the movie was over.Ultimately, the best way I can think of to describe this movie is it's like drinking your favorite juice/milk, and not being sure if it's starting to spoil, so you keep sipping, but in the end, you're never quite sure. You want to like the movie, and you like certain parts of it, but overall, it's so long and tedious, that the parts you do like just aren't worth it, and eventually by the end, you can't even remember the parts you did like. end, it was just disappointing.

This movie has been getting hyped up since the end of season 5 and honestly, I was excited about this movie. In the trailer, we were introduced to new outfits, A new villain that has a cult, and of course this new exciting adventure. The first 10 min of the movie introduces you to the villain and his cult organization and you see the heroes split into multiple groups and are assigned different countries to look for the cults ""trigger bombs"". We get to see the new outfits introduced in the trailer and are overall excited about what...comes next. But no for the next 30-50 minutes of the movie we get to see Deku and Rody meet, become friends, Fall into danger, then go on a road trip. During this 30-50 minutes there\'s very little action happening and more chatting about Rody\'s extremely boring and somewhat unimportant backstory. I almost fell asleep during his backstory because of how boring it was. Really wished they could have shortened the whole on the run to a max of 20 minutes. After that boring road trip, Deku finally meets up with Bakugo and Todoroki and they go to kick the villain\'s ass. Todoroki and Bakugo fight some mediocre villains and Deku moves on to the main villain. The villain\'s backstory is mediocre at best. The backstory wasn\'t sad and the villain wasn\'t even that evil. The fight scenes animation was great, I thought it looked really cool and made the fight a lot more interesting. After the defeat of the villain, the movie ends with the world being saved from the trigger bombs.Overall this movie wasn\'t very action-packed and the outfits they introduced in the trailer were worn for a max of 10 minutes which was disappointing.

We do get a few of them on screen, but we learn next to nothing about them.  Most of the film is following Deku around, which is fair, given he's the main character and whatnot, but it would have been refreshing to have some new foreign...heroes showcased in the series.  Kind of a wasted opportunity, but that's not too bad.The story is mediocre at it's best, but thankfully it never really drops below poor.  Of course, there's only so much you can do with about 100 minutes of run time, but I felt that instead of wasting time showing token shots of the other members of Class 1-A (and a handful of 1-B), they could have done a bit more.The selling point of this is the animation, in my mind.

They say that they don\'t like quirks and will kill everyone with quirks, yet they themselves have quirks. I understand the gist of the main villain\'s motive, albeit it wasn\'t that great, they didn\'t really touch that subject with the other villains. They just say that they will rid the world with people with quirks and that they might survive as the only people with them. They weren\'t really clear with that and just left me confused. So they\'ll make the world so that there will be no...one with quirks except for them. I feel that they should have been more clear and touched this subject more instead of just ""kill everyone with quirks just cuz."" The villains were extremely one-dimensional and weren\'t written that well. Most of their actions you will just seem to question as you continue to watch.There were also moments in the movie where the animation was so good but so unnecessarily good. For example, there are chase scenes and mini-scuffles where the animation is outstanding since this is Studio Bones we are talking about. The final climax/battle, the animation was still great but those mini-scuffles and chases just stood out more to me in terms of animation for some reason.Since this is a My Hero Academia movie, of course the ending is going to be predictable.

Most of the movie just had explosions and barely any combat visible. The opening of the heroes was really nice but other than that, the animation went downhill as there were some parts where the characters were intentionally partially animated or poorly animated.I can't speak for the subbed version but holy crap I was so taken...aback from Todoroki's english VA and not in a good way.There was some music in which I absolutely enjoyed and will be adding to my playlist.To sum up about the storyline:The only good thing about the movie's was Deku and Rody's relationship although I disliked Rody initially.This cult thing really could've had potential with the villain but he was just so overpowered and creepy to begin with. In beginning you have people screaming, and more screaming, Bakugo and Todoroki didn't do anything until the very end of the movie to help Deku out.

Aside from its lacking story and pacing, one area of contention was the dedication of resources by Studio Bones. To make the story short, two of the arcs in the show’s positions were swapped for no explained reason, leaving the fans to speculate instead. The most common theory was that, as the arc moved earlier tied directly into the upcoming film My Hero Academia: World Heroes Mission, the show too was adjusted to make the movie sell better in the process. Whether this theory holds...any weight or not is up to personal belief, but it meant that World Heroes Mission had some less than great reception going into its opening. But how did this third romp through the theater go for My Hero Academia? Overall, there are issues, but I would say it was fantastic.The first notable high point is one true across the series, that being the characters. As always, even with many of them having limited screen time in the movie, they are a central aspect that makes us care even when the story doesn’t do as much. With a firmly established cast from the series, we’re able to simply sit back and enjoy their personalities that we all know and love in these new situations, and, as always, it’s a good time.Of course, the other consistently strong point of the series is present too, and better than ever; the extremely fantastic and beautiful animation, courtesy of Studio Bones. Season 5 already blew me away in several scenes, but this film took those great moments and blew them up over an entire movie’s worth of insane and exciting animation. It’s quite honestly up there with some of the best-animated content I’ve seen in years, each fight being breathtaking in just how excellently it’s done.As I have briefly mentioned, the story is not one of this film’s strongest aspects. A rather by the basics narrative that, while suitable for a plot hook, does little in the way of innovation or intrigue. The ultimate threat is really just “bad guy that heroes beat” with not much else to it. The pacing too is an issue, with the story moving rather slowly and without much purpose up until the end, where everything suddenly kicks into overdrive and moves at a breakneck speed. Again, not the end of the world, but a notable issue while watching.When regarding any media that exists as a counterpart for another, there always lies value in contrasting it to the original source, and this film is no exception. I believe that the most relevant aspect to my enjoyment of the film is expectations. I went in expecting a fun, action-packed romp full of heart and character, and that was exactly what I got. While there was no amazing growth or in-depth plot or relatable villains as in the series proper, I felt as though that wasn’t what the film was trying to be. It knew what it was, and that was a movie to have fun watching and make a good experience.In summation, while World Heroes Mission doesn’t do much exceptional, especially compared to the main series, it is a fun, action-heavy romp through a simple story, designed for us to have a good time seeing our favorite characters go at it with cool bad guys. And, I think it’s largely a story that knows that about itself and chooses to prioritize those great aspects rather than trying its effort in areas that could end up subpar at best. If you’re searching for a deep story or compelling development, I’d hardly recommend it, but if you just want some good My Hero Academia action and heart, it’s absolutely a great treat to put on.Grade - B+ any weight or not is up to personal belief, but it meant that World Heroes Mission had some less than great reception going into its opening.

The story was pretty basic with all your shounen troupes in it so the criticism toward that was fair and justified. But the animation and sound design were actually amazing. This was by far some of the best animation i've seen in the last decade and in my opinion was even better then Demon Slayer, One aspect I think Demon slayer has over My hero in terms of animation was the Moving background did look kinda awkward and outta place then Demon Slayer's art did but nonetheless My...Hero was still overall had more impressive animation.

I have a great time with the school arcs, and many of the characters and their arcs (Endeavor, Overhaul, etc.) leave great impressions on me for the series as a consistently developing narrative.World’s Mission fell short of my expectations, and it is important to label it as exactly that—expectations. Between the three Hero Academia movies, it falls by far as the weakest of the three, having side characters that seem uninvolved, a relatively linear plot and predictable developments, and recognizable characters that are present, but again, not involved. I’ll break it down into more detail...going forward.The first couple of minutes in the movie were absolutely fantastic. I love the chaos and dark tones involved in the Trigger Bomb, and it establishes a lot for the story’s potential. The threat is immediately present, and stakes are clearly defined and ready to be explored, but then...We get Rory’s arc. And this isn’t to say Rory was a terrible character (in fact, he is by far the most dynamic and developed character in the entire movie). But I think Rory’s arc was a problem, because in the face of the dark and threatening plot of the Trigger Bombs, his arc seemed like a coming-of-age Disney get along narrative. It completely conflicts with the tone of the movie, and we lose sight of the danger that these bombs actually present. Maybe it was better for the kids that were sitting in front of me in the theatre, but I wanted to see some dark shit and emotional stakes go down. If they can offscreen my boy Blue Jeanist in a couple minutes, I expect more from them in a full length movie feature.And hence the problem, the last action segment doesn’t have the momentum needed to feel the fights of these characters. The villains are more or less faceless, and the heroes fighting them have no reason to be there, because the story is all about Rory and his delicate, innocent character arc. I was sitting there, admiring the sound design and the art, but I didn’t really care about the situation nor feel that anxiety or power that we got in the other two movies. I found that the villains were set up for failure.Maybe take your kids to watch it, but it’s honestly so disconnected from The BNHA storyline that if you aren’t a diehard fan, I’d say it’s just worth the skip. going forward.The first couple of minutes in the movie were absolutely fantastic.

Nothing too deep or groundbreaking.The art especially n the earlier part of the movie was a bit crude and even more cartoonish that usual. mostly for comedic effect but didn't feel right. however there were a few fast paced chase and combat scenes...that were animated, especially saving it for the last assault, where they pulled amazing animation and beautiful art .Characters were focusing on the 3 promoted Deku, Bakugo and Todoroki but that was clear, but with plenty of other heroes shown. Introduced a new character that would be with Deku through the movie, which was found to redeem himself throughout. The characters that stood out most to me however were the sub-villains. Very impressive quirks, character design and really boosted the movie in my opinion.Overall it felt like a side story but was generally just good. Not amazing, not too exciting or a must-see just a good side story event with good evil organisation enemies. that were animated, especially saving it for the last assault, where they pulled amazing animation and beautiful art .Characters were focusing on the 3 promoted Deku, Bakugo and Todoroki but that was clear, but with plenty of other heroes shown.

The OST of this movie is the OST for the anime."", 'Even though My Hero Academia is kind of just your average Shonen, this series takes some elements from some older anime and modernizes it into a fairly good movie. Just all I want to know is how can this series have a pretty bad anime that is several seasons long yet this one hour movie is infinitely times better than the actual movie. As a shonen, I expected most of this movie to just be fighting in other countries but this was taken to the next level than what I expected. You can watch the whole series without this movie and it would be fine...but this is definitely a cherry on top for the series if you really arent liking it. but this is definitely a cherry on top for the series if you really arent liking it.', 'This is the worst Hero Aca movie. That\'s not much of a bold statement since there are only three, and if I claimed it was the worst movie of the year, it wouldn\'t do much causes this year has been pretty good for movies.to preface this, I\'m not a fan of the series anymore. I had dropped off after season 4 for a variety of reasons. The reason I actually came to this movie was I was doing one of my mates a solid and going with them.I actually was hoping I might enjoy this film in the same way I enjoyed the second. I\'d...even consider the second film better than the franchise it\'s a part of.this will have some spoilers later on, but let\'s be honest, most people are coming for the action scenes and animation. So we\'ll cover that first.Outside of fights, the animation is fine, it has it\'s moments. Meanwhile the fights are really fluid, which sounds great, and it should be, but it\'s so focused on fluidity that scenes start to lose impact. There are several moments where it can be difficult to tell what\'s going on, because everything is going so fast, and focused on individual actions rather than show the battles in a way that let\'s you follow them(sometimes it does, but it does have this issue a LOT of the time)Another problem is the lack of tension. These fights have plenty of moments where you think ""yep, they\'re dead,"", which honestly feels like the studio is compensating for the fact that the fights have no buildup. Fights just happen with random antagonists that show up, get defeated and disappear.This is an obvious issue. Most shonen movies, even the bad ones, have set antagonists, rivals for the characters, so in the final act when these rivals are fought and beaten, there\'s hype behind the battles, even when the rivalries are bad, at least there\'s something. There are no rivals, and then I just don\'t care.This creates another problem as well, as spoilers, but the villains are supposed to be an anti-quirk cult, yet so many of their members have quirks. if there were only a few, then it would be fine, I can suspend my disbelief for 2 or 3, but not 10+ to the point where several  handfuls are just faceless goons.They could\'ve given the villains advanced technology and just 2 or 3 quirk characters instead of so many quirk users. It would make sense for them to have technology since they\'ve been preparing this plan for such a long time.It\'s even worse when, and the film doesn\'t even hide this(though you might think it did), but the leader of this world wide, anti-quirk cult has a quirk! It\'s like if in Korra Book one, Amon was completely open about being a water bender. I thought blue guy had face paint, but no, he just has a quirk, and it shatters any sense of immersion.To be fair, the plot doesn\'t have much immersion anyway. A cult this powerful should\'ve been mentioned in the series beforehand. Both the other movies had excuses for why their plots were separate, placing themselves on islands, but this is a cult on par with the catholic church.The villains plan also makes no sense. They want to more or less genocide quirk users to prevent the apocalypse, even if their bombs basically cause apocalyptic destruction, even if bombs wouldn\'t be effective in their goals, bombs are more often than not used for assassinations or intimidation, even if parents that have quirk could give birth to someone without a quirk and vice versa, and so many more issues that would require more spoilers.Honestly, with their resources, they could build bunkers to wade out the apocalypse rather than pick a fight that really won\'t be as effective as they think. the morons.Though I guess the villains are side note, since the film lacks a rising action. It just kinda meanders around until SUDDENLY, we\'re in the final act.The film doesn\'t use it\'s time well. At one point there\'s a montage of the characters driving across a European country that\'s basically Greece. you can walk across most European countries in a day. you\'re not going to to be driving across one for a couple days.Cut this segmentAlso cut all the cutaways to characters that mean nothing, like the other hero teams, who feel so redundant. cutting to them for a few milliseconds would be fine, but seeing their reactions, making sure they get that lines and have things to do feels like a waste of time.The first movie picked a select characters to use, and gave the others frames of time on screen. cameos basically. The second film made use of everyone in team battles, strategy, etc. This film wants to give these characters a purpose, but since they\'re off to the side, the time is wasted.of course they\'d have to have something to do, because the stakes are so high, it decreases the tension even more. it\'d help if the characters had some focus that added more impact, but the only character who gets any focus is Rody, the film exclusive character, and even his development feels undercut due to all the wasted time.He is a good character, I\'d say better than most of the wastes of space Horikoshi writes. He makes decisions based on his character, ones that don\'t necessarily seem like the good guy thing(he doesn\'t do it that much tho). He\'s not just a generic good guy, and he has plenty of time to express his personality. As opposed to a lot of Hero Aca characters whose decisions are all....basically the same with a different skin/design/single personality trait.At the end of the day, this film was made for profit. I don\'t think anyone really cared outside of the animators. The film was marketed as being about Deku, Bakugo, and Todoroki, but realistically, Bakugo and Todoroki are just there for the poster. it\'s not like the second film where Bakugo actually felt important, as did his relationship with Deku.The film almost has something at one point, a villain who sees quirk as evil, and a hero(Deku), who sees them as something for good. they don\'t have a lot of time to develop this conflict, and they ruin it by...implicating Deku as ablest.The villain\'s quirk has made it difficult for him to interact with other people. He can\'t touch them, in short. Then we have Deku, who, while quirkless at one point, could still live a completely normal life. Most people in Hero Aca do that outside of heroes and villains. This isn\'t counting the fact that Deku has had everything handed to him by All Might, more or lessSo when Deku tells the villain that he ""wasn\'t trying hard enough,"". it just comes off as a privileged rich kid telling a guy in a wheel chair the same thing. This wasn\'t the intention, I think the writers just weren\'t thinking, but it\'s a big issue, and makes me hate Deku in a way, even if the real thing I hate is this film.This film is awful, it\'s boring, it\'s stupid, and it\'s even good for a few laughs at points(tho not enough to make it so bad it\'s good).

Deku's dynamic with Rody is my favourite. Rody Soul is a refreshing character to see in the series. He has an origin story that is similar to most [I]My Hero Academia[/I] characters, but what surprises me the most is his Quirk: Pino!Rody's Quirk is a separate entity from him, and Pino is such an adorable bird / side character. Even though his Quirk may seem useless when fighting, Rody showing his true intentions through Pino is a very rare Quirk.About the storyline, I give it...a fair rating. I like how the focus is on Deku and Rody. Sure, we have to put 1-A (and Katsuki and Shōtō) on the backburner. But so what? Let the focus be on Deku this time interacting with a character (who might be relevant in the franchise this one time only).The animation and soundtrack are spectacular (especially on the fight scenes). I can't take my eyes off the killer animation! Wow! I mean, wow!!! 🤩 I also love the music by King Gnu... So relaxing.... 😌🎧 a fair rating. I like how the focus is on Deku and Rody.

Hearing the same 5 OSTs in boku no hero is the norm but I like the new rendition...of one of them. They\'re all probably new renditions but Endeavor\'s theme was the only one I noticed.Characters: Meh, no new developments of any sort for the heroes we know of.

I wonder what they can think of next. Film 1 was metal monster, film 2 was the air density, & film 3 was your absorption reflection technique. Each one blocking, stopping, and defying brute power. Pretty much any mc counter is some sort of clone of themselves and that's super lame, so I hope it doesn't come to that point. Or even a setback of power and somehow wins with skill. Or someone who is legit strong. Or just a whole nother ability for hearty combat. Overall, this villain is so typical that it just comes down to...Deku's Rocky tenacity to take his own smashes somehow. The last bit of fighting was enjoyable when Flect actually swung his fist back.

Like the first two movies, this is a non-canon filler movie that anyone can watch on their own decision.Story - 7/10The story is a clear step forward from the second movie. Here, they actually came up wit a fairly interesting plot about terrorism. It also has elements of a heist-movie in it. The setting is a complete departure from everything we´ve seen so far in the series. Instead of only japan, the movie expands the world of ""My Hero Academia"" by focussing on countries like Singapur, France, Egypt, the...United States as well as the fictional european country Otheon. This was a nice idea, because we get to see how the superhero society works all around the globe, and seeing Deku swinging all around the Golden Gate bridge in highspeed tempo was supercool to watch. This movie also expands the idea of the Quirk Doomsday Theory that was already brought up in the show before. With all that said, i can´t score this any higher than 7 because it is still a really simple, shounen storyline and a lot of things it does with it´s writing have already been done better in other movies. There are also a few plot conveniences that didn´t made sense,but those are minor and don´t affect the enjoyment of the movie.The writing is as campy and cheesy as you would expect from ""My Hero Academia"" and i am all here for it.Art - 10/10This is a movie that can truly be described as action-packed. Studio Bones is known for their insane 2D fightscenes, so i was really surprised about the amount of 3D environments used. The mix worked perfectly without a single odd moment. The fights are LONG and perfectly animated. This movie also includes a chase scene in the first half that puts even Attack on Titan´s 3D-maneuvers to shame with how perfectly the camera is handled. The final fight was crazy .Maybe i am just to used to ufotables fluid, wide-angled, well-drawn longshots because watching it in the cinema almost gave me visual whiplash because of the incredibly stylized animation.Easily one of the best shounen-fight scenes. The constant switch between 2D and 3D might get confusing for some, but i didn´t have a problem with it.The quality of the animation surpassed my wildest expectations. I would even go as far as saying that this movie can easily keep up with Demon Slayer Season 2 and Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in terms of animation.The race for animation of the year is not over!Sound - 8/10I have been following the series since it´s original run in 2016 so of course i recognize tracks like ""You say run"". That song will never not be hype, and it is played in the best scene of the movie so of course the whole packed cinema exploded. But the film also contains some slower, more relaxing vocal tracks during some montages in the middle ,following the tradition that the series has had since the second movie. My cinema showed the movie in german and the voice-actors definitely brought their A-game to the table.Character - 8/10This movie features a giant roster of characters. I really think they tried to get every single character in the show to make an appearance and if only for one single line. Of course the main focus lies on Deku, Bakugou and Todoroki, as well as a completely new character, Rowdy. He was a pleasant surpise inside of the movie, because he has a unique personality, fitting backstory and serves as a great addition in the overall story of the movie. His quirk is also remarkably interesting, but getting into that would spoil the movie :D. Our main trio is exactly like they have ever been. Deku, the rightful hero, Todoroki, the edgy and cool one and Bakugou, the angry guy. Seeing them on the big screen was fantastic.Enjoyment - 9/10This movie was paced so well that not a single moment was boring. If you are a fan of ""My Hero Academia"" , this movie, although not being canon, is a must-watch. If you haven´t seen the show you can still enjoy it as a standalone.It is pure shounen fun for 104 minutes straight and i am so incredibly thankful that ""My Hero Academia"" still delivers hype and enjoyment to me after almost 6 years.- Marco_YoooFINAL SCORE - 9/10 United States as well as the fictional european country Otheon.

I think the animation quality is very satisfying. Honestly I wish that Deku, Bakugo, and Totoroki were wearing the same costumes like in the key visual, but its fine because it doesn't affect the storyline. For the story itself I like it because it is very light but still fun to watch. For the fighting scene in this anime i'm gonna give it 10/10 because it's sooooo epic and make me super hype. Besides the story and animation, what I like about this anime is the ending song. After I...went home, I immediately listened to this song. Overall this movie is worth to watch. went home, I immediately listened to this song. Overall this movie is worth to watch."", ""I think this is the first BNHA related movie that is actually worth going to a cinema for.Don't get me wrong, I like the first two movie alot. However, that's because they're pure fanservice.High quality action scenes, good animation in general, cute moments and interaction between the main cast that doesn't happen in the manga or in the anime original scenes. It's all very much made for people who are fans of the show and just want to see something bombastic on the big screen related to it.World Heroes Mission is the only one I would actually regard as a worthwhile movie however. Wheter...or not it's canon, it was a interesting self contained story. The movie original character, Rody, especially made me enjoy my time watching it.Melissa and her dad from the first movie were alright, but I just couldn't find myself caring about them. Mahoro and Katsuma were adorable, but they didn't do all that much. Rody is like, an actual interesting character, one that I would expect to see in the manga in fact.I was expecting to hate him since most of the spoilers I knew beforehand made him seem like a Hawks rip off, but honestly he's just plain fun and manages to stand on his own. Which is a good thing since the first half of the movie entirely revolve around him and Deku bonding.I'd say give it a watch, it's neat. or not it's canon, it was a interesting self contained story.

I enjoy the series, but have never considered it a masterpiece. That being said, World Heroes' Mission is my favorite piece of MHA media and my favorite anime tie-in movie of all time.The main plot of the movie centers around a far more extremist and damaging terrorist organizationthan anything these kids have faced before. Seeing the more serious tone from the opening scene kept the stakes high. The fact that this organization is for the quirkless also offers a new perspective on the politics of this world.Deku has always been my favorite part...of MHA, so l don't mind that this movie centers him and the new character rather than the rest of the main cast. I enjoyed seeing Deku confront the flaws of hero society, as well as the general law enforcement system, by being on the opposite side of it. The movie original character Rody has lived most of his life this way just to take care of his loved ones, forcing Deku to think about 'villains' from a new perspective. Although the audience of MHA was previously able to experience this kind of sympathy by watching the League of Villains, Deku as a character finally has the opportunity to grow his empathy through Rody and the quirkless terrorist group.Rody is a compelling character, both in how he expands upon an average citizen's relationship with hero society and in his own view on quirks as a whole. The quirk reveal for Rody was very creative and offers the movie great rewatch value. His attempts to climb out of poverty and his deep family bond allow the audience to root for him as much as Deku despite the lack of previous screen time. The bonding conversations between Rody and Deku are some of the most heartfelt of MHA and I wish we could see more of them.I think my one real problem with movie is the same with most anime tie-in films; retconning. I know I'll never see Rody again and what Deku learned in this movie will not effect the plot of the show. It's really a shame because this is easily the best arc MHA has introduced thus far and I wish the show writers could expand upon its ideas. of MHA, so l don't mind that this movie centers him and the new character rather than the rest of the main cast.

Although the audience of MHA was previously able to experience this kind of sympathy by watching the League of Villains, Deku as a character finally has the opportunity to grow his empathy through Rody and the quirkless terrorist group.Rody is a compelling character, both in how he expands upon an average citizen's relationship with hero society and in his own view on quirks as a whole. The quirk reveal for Rody was very creative and offers the movie great rewatch value. His attempts to climb out of poverty and his deep family bond allow the audience to root for him as much as Deku despite the lack of previous screen time. The bonding conversations between Rody and Deku are some of the most heartfelt of MHA and I wish we could see more of them.I think my one real problem with movie is the same with most anime tie-in films; retconning. I know I'll never see Rody again and what Deku learned in this movie will not effect the plot of the show. It's really a shame because this is easily the best arc MHA has introduced thus far and I wish the show writers could expand upon its ideas."", ""I really looked forward to the movie as not many anime movies are screened in  India, and boy was I happy, after Weathering with You back in 2019 in Nov, this is the only movie screened here.The animation was topnotch as usual, the story was great too, no character development or such things as story had its plot laid bare in beginning, within 5-10 minutes, my experience was unique as i watched the movie along with a friend who hasn't seen the previous 5 seasons but she didn't need that to enjoy the plot as such as this movie isn't canon. The plot does...seem a bit predictable but we are in it for the action, so that was enough to keep us engaged and interested through out. seem a bit predictable but we are in it for the action, so that was enough to keep us engaged and interested through out."", ""This is definitely my favorite of the MHA movies. The characters introduced are some of the best (Rody is so good they better bring him back I swear) and lots of new heroes across the globe. Some of the action and battle seasons are fantastic. I got to watch the movie in theaters opening night and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I think when Deku yelled Plus Ultra at the climax the whole audience cheered. I've never felt such a connection with everyone more than in that moment.However my favorite part is this movie is an action packed...adventure while also being a hilarious rom-com between Rody and Deku. I will give no more context for this but trust me I am right.If you wanna watch this movie at the right moment in the timeline, I'd watch it at some point in the second half of season 5 (Any point during My Hero Academia). In my opinion this is when it makes the most sense. adventure while also being a hilarious rom-com between Rody and Deku.

Initial D Battle Stage,https://myanimelist.net/anime/821/Initial_D_Battle_Stage,"['Does exactly what is says on the tin, a compilation of all the races during the first 3 seasons of Initial D.The earlier races in the season have benefitted from advances made in CGI and have been rerendered and look better then ever.Theres also a nice (albeit short) race that was not featured in the anime but was in the manga,  Keisuke vs Seiji.Theres no story to speak off, basically it announces the 2 drivers and then shows the battle, then onto the next battle and so on. ', ""If you want to watch only the action packed part of Initial D and refresh your memory this is what you need to watch.Basically there is no story. The whole 40 minutes is a simple copy and paste of all the races from the first three stages. Some of them seem to be out of order however which is kinda bothersome to say the least.When it comes to art. The races have been remastered a bit to look better, but still the character animation, especially that of the first season looks pretty bad. I was acutally hoping that they would make the effort to remaster...it to the Third Stage level, but unfortunately that did not happen.The sound has been directly taken out from the earlier episode. So there nothing to it. Personally, the only new thing about the sound, which would be the annoucer, sounds below average, and the OVA would do equally good without him.Since it is only a recap of the races there is not too much to enjoy, but still if you want to refresh your memory about Initial D, this is the first thing I'd watch if I were you. it to the Third Stage level, but unfortunately that did not happen.The sound has been directly taken out from the earlier episode.

Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34973/Love_Live_Sunshine_2nd_Season,"['*DISCLAIMER: A very unorganized and SOMEWHAT SPOILERY ""review"" of Sunshine s2 which might ruin your viewing experience, so I\'ll just say ""you\'re welcome"" in advance for saving your time.The Love Live franchise has a knack for being the defier of expectations. Those who go into the series expecting nothing but cancer usually end up taking something positive from the experience. Those who go in expecting happy rainbows and sunshine only get slapped in the face with the cold reality that is School Idol Hell. Love Live Sunshine s2 is no exception to this rule, for what was set up to be potentially the greatest installment...in the Love Live anime series ended up being one of the greatest disappointments I\'ve yet to come across.If Love Live Sunshine had one major step up from its predecessor, it would be how it utilizes subtlety. Very rarely does the show tell you how the characters have developed, and if it does, it gives a great presentation to back it up. Love Live Sunshine actually uses the performances of the girls as ways to show you how much the characters have improved: how the choreography slowly improves from performance to performance, how the amount of band aids Chika has increases from scene to scene. There was no need to state the obvious, or to show Chika getting injured: all of that was inferred through some great shots of Chika just trying her best.Did I just give Love Live subtlety points? SORRY GOTTA TAKE THOSE RIGHT BACK because at the same time, Love Live falls back into its old habit of friendship speeches, slow motion eureka jumping moments, repeating the same cheesy lines over and over again, and other tactics to not so subtly remind you that this is a show about friendship!Love live teaches you that you can\'t solve your problems by shouting into the distance or giving your computer screen your patented GLARE OF DETERMINATION! Instead, shit goes south. Chika goes through a massive identity crisis, hinted through her subtle mannerisms and facial expressions. How is it fixed?By having the entire school yell at her! Through sentimental speeches thrown from floor to rooftop!Do you see the problem? Love Live always sets up these plot points with so much potential: the subtle build up, psychological conflict, and with minimal exposition and drag. Only for it all to be resolved with the usual cheesy sentimental monologues or speeches that make you cringe. There are so many opportunities for these resolutions to occur through the same methods as the build up, but noooooo let\'s have people yelling their solutions while jumping in slow motion, or have the entire fucking school somehow spit out the entire solution to the problem! These cheap resolutions are buzzkills and lazy lazy lazy ways of resolving drama.Oh course, I won\'t pretend that Love Live Sunshine s2 is the only installment in this series that has this problem: season 1 had plenty of it, and the OG series too. However, what the OG series did was leave room for potential and improvement, and it actually took the opportunity to improve on a lot of the flaws that it had. This was why season 2 of the original was a drastic improvement, and I can even full heartedly call it good. Love Live Sunshine set up the same opportunity for its sequel to do the same, if not even more. With the way it builds up, it seemed promising at first, but it just devolves back into the same exact thing that made people so critical of the series in the first place.Changes in directorial styles are nice, but there needs to be some consistency. Love Live Sunshine was commonly criticized for being too similar to its predecessor, and while I agree to some extent, my greatest praise for Sunshine was always how Sunshine felt like a sequel to School Idol Project as much as School Idol Project felt like a prequel to Sunshine. To me, there is no one over the other, there is no battle between Aqours and Muse. They exist together under the Love Live banner, as they should. This was due to how the recycled plot points are used as ways to develop Aqours differently than Muse, and how even though both anime series tackle the same themes, each series usually prioritizes one over the other, or they tackle the theme a different way. For example, Sunshine has more emphasis on the girls actually trying to improve as idols, and this is actually expressed fairly well through the slow improvement of choreography presented in the concert scenes. This contrasts School Idol Project\'s emphasis on the girls bracing for when they have to disband, something that Sunshine still touches on but not as heavily as School Idol Project. While School Idol Project dedicated more episodes to the fate of Muse, Sunshine spent less time on that theme but featured more dynamic and hardcore methods of exploring that theme, featuring a FUCKING FLYING VAN, lots of cheesy group cheering and crying. Whilst School Idol Project took the more subtle approach on the passage of time by showing the girls doing slice of life shenanigans through timed events, Sunshine brought out the big guns immediately by making the girls taste failure and fly vehicles into the moon. Unfortunately, Sunshine s2 did this pretty poorly as flying vans and having the entire school chant Aqours over and over again isn\'t a very effective way to convey this message. When the hard hitting, tear inducing, heart pounding, and hope brimmed scenes actually make you laugh your ass off, you know that something is wrong.The characters of Love Live are the defining factor and also hold the most potential for growth and change. And yet, some things never change. Yoshiko\'s comedic antics now are about as funny as they were back then (in other words, not at all.) Yoshiko also still had pitiful development. As you can probably tell, one of my biggest hopes for this season was for Yoshiko to finally get some satisfying development. Needless to say, I ain\'t satisfied. But some things do change, and they are pretty nice. Dia\'s arc about wanting to be called ""Dia-chan"" was light hearted and fun, no unneeded sappiness, just satisfying fluff. Hanamaru turned her sass level all the way up, she ain\'t holding back anymore. Ruby had an entire arc dedicated to her growing independence in a way that also contributed to the whole ""Aqours probs gonna disband"" plot point. Did this save her from being worst girl? Nah, but it was still a nice touch. Meanwhile, Kanan actually had some screen time this time around. Riko too gained a decent amount of screen time and her personality was more fleshed out. Chika changed from a happy go lucky ""I can do anything"" character to one with genuine psychological conflicts, similar to the change granted to Honoka.But in order to grant these characters some quality of life buffs, some other characters gotta be gutted into the ground. Take Watanabe You for example. Formerly an irreplaceable asset and fan favorite of the Love Live Sunshine story line, she was demoted into legitimately the most useless character ever conceived. Even Umi, the sociopathic queen of underdevelopment can\'t hold a finger to just how absolutely useless You was during this season. If you took her out of the show, nothing would change. This just proves that Sunrise just has no respect for the best girl. An instant flunk! Love Live Sunshine s2, you get a 1/10 for FAILURE!Is what I would say if they didn\'t give Sakurauchi Riko, the next best thing, a lot of fluff. The dog episode featuring our homie Sakurauchi Riko is not only the best episode of the season, but one of the best episodes of the entire franchise, rivaling the legendary episode 5 of Love Live School Idol Project s2. But one good episode isn\'t going to sway my consensus that is Love Live Sunshine s2 may be the worst season of love live to date, if not at least comparable to the mess that is season 1 of the original.So how does Love Live\'s sound quality fair for this new installment? Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo is, in my opinion of course, the best OP that Love Live has to offer, not only on a song quality basis but on a directorial basis as well. It perfectly encapsulates the energetic yet melancholic strive to shine that defines Love Live Sunshine. The sparkling light in the beginning that shines down on the members of Aqours also fits the shooting star motif that\'s commonly brought up throughout the show. Similarly, the ED is definitely a top tier ED, but that is to be expected from Love Live EDs. The seiyuus are splendid as always: I\'m a pretty big fan of the Love Live seiyuu scene, especially the Aqours members. I probably like them more than the series itself. When it comes to OST and insert songs, it\'s a pretty hit or miss experience. There is one piece in the soundtrack (you know the one) that is constantly played during the melodramatic scenes. While the piece by itself is pretty nice I guess, combined with the already over the top scenes in slow motion and tears that probably took half of the animation budget, it\'s safe to say that the OST played a big role as to why Sunshine is way too sappy. The insert songs hold a similar problem. Whether or not you like them is down to preference, but as I stated before: I liked how Sunshine used the concert scenes to show the improvement of Aqours when it came to choreography. What I didn\'t mention is how weirdly weaved in one particular piece of choreography was, that being the Chika cart wheel flip move. A whole episode of build up was dedicated to that one move, yet it was transitioned in so badly during the concert scene, it felt more anticlimactic than anything else, oddly placed with no satisfying transition into and out of the concert scene. Another prime example of decent build up with pitiful pay off. Yes, Chika is finally able to do the move, but her ability to do it was triggered by more friendship speeches and an unsatisfying transition. What does this have to do with the insert song? There was no good timing to insert the transition, and the song they used is somewhat at fault for that too.You may be saying: Yuni, why are you subjecting this random idol anime to unnecessarily high standards and potential that you probably just made up on your own? No one told you to expect a masterpiece, and you shouldn\'t anally shreck an anime for not being what you expected!I\'m just sad that what could have been done right HAS been done right before in the past, so why not now when the possibilities are greater than ever?Love Live is all about change and growth. Love Live Sunshine s2 achieves this change and growth but through the worst ways possible. There\'s literally an entire episode of build up where the 9 girls inner monologue how they have changed throughout the series. There\'s no implications, no subtlety, just the girls directly stating ""oh becoming an idol did this to me."" Similarly, the interactions between the girls evolved only very slightly, not at all, or only evolved heavily after major events and get reset somehow. The slight changes in character interactions where a measure to the development of the characters during the original series, and it\'s missing or played badly in Sunshine, which is a darn shame. Only a select few characters had a little bit of spice added to their interactions, like Zuramaru and Riko. Sure, this season may have delivered the growth that everyone wanted, but it was done in the least satisfying way possible, a sure cause for disappointment to me, the only one around who actually had such high hopes for a lowly idol anime called Love Live! Sunshine!!Ah yes, and my updated order of Aqours members is:*sigh* It\'s Pronounced ""Yoh"" > Rick > Hannah Mahroo > I wanna Dia > Yohane Sebastian Bach > Kanan you not? > Mary > Kan Kan Mikan’t > Gangstarooby in the Love Live anime series ended up being one of the greatest disappointments I\'ve yet to come across.If Love Live Sunshine had one major step up from its predecessor, it would be how it utilizes subtlety.

It’s difficult to imagine now, but when the first season of School Idol Project started back in 2013, idol anime as we know it today didn’t really exist. Just as µ's was the guiding light for the world of school idols, the franchise led the way for the genre, and by the time of the School Idol Movie, it really had become a global phenomenon. So when µ's retired and Aqours stepped forward to take its place, fans were understandably upset and worried that this new iteration would tarnish or override the franchise’s legacy. But it was never...the goal for Aqours to replace its predecessor, and instead it told its own story about trying to live up to that legacy, and instead accomplishing far more.While the first season of Sunshine adhered closely to the formula set by School Idol Project, the second season focused on the ways that Aqours was different. The new generation was never going to measure up against the audience’s nostalgia for µ's, and that was reflected in the story. Aqours struggles with challenges that µ's overcame easily, and there are times when they actually fail. These aren’t just failure by circumstance; they will have tried their best and it still wasn’t enough to succeed. We see these characters when they’re at their lowest points, and when they get back up and try again, it makes their victories all the sweeter. The writing is about as subtle as a brick, but it gets the emotions across.Although, those feelings wouldn’t resonate so strongly if we weren’t so deeply invested the cast and their success. Sunshine relies more heavily on personal drama than its predecessor, and it works because their problems aren’t abstract and artificial walls, but genuine fears and worries to which we can relate. And instead of having to overcome these problems on their own, the other members of the group will reach out to provide support, which sells you on the idea that these characters are actually friends who care about each other’s well-being. It’s true that some members of the ensemble get better treatment than others, with one or two being reduced mainly to one-note gags, but overall the cast is so earnest that you can’t help but root for them.The growth of the characters is also reflected in the performance scenes, which see the characters becoming gradually more comfortable with complex choreography and each other. For better or worse, CGI has always been a staple of the Love Live franchise, and it’s been getting better with every entry. Early performances looked garish and were plagued by unimaginative camerawork, but both technology and direction have improved vastly, and it’s finally reaching the point that CGI can compete with traditional animation. Performances now come alive with dancing in 3D spaces, and varied shot composition and camera effects make for a real spectacle. It also helps that the songs being performed are really good. Aqours has a diverse discography, ranging from traditional Japanese odori to Broadway show tunes. The soundtrack outside of the performances is excellent as well, effectively matching the tonal shifts over the course of the season. On its technical merits, Sunshine soars.If I were to look at the anime alone, Sunshine is far from perfect. There’s a lot of valid criticisms that can and should be made, but since that’s not my focus, I’d recommend checking out Yuni’s review, which addresses a lot of them. But for this, rather than just looking at the show itself, I’m also including my own experience watching it, and I find that my enjoyment greatly outweighs any criticisms. For the past 13 weeks, it hasn’t just been the show that I’ve enjoyed, but also being a part of the community that surrounds it. That’s just my personal experience, so it will differ from person to person, but all I can say is that all of the tweets, fanart, and fanfiction that I saw definitely added to my enjoyment.I’m going to miss this generation. It’s not quite over yet – there’s still the movie – but the end is rapidly approaching. I’ve always appreciated that the Love Live franchise ends stories conclusively; the dream of being a school idol is fleeting, but the lessons learned will last forever. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to love the next generation the same way I loved this one, but the future looks bright, and I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings. the goal for Aqours to replace its predecessor, and instead it told its own story about trying to live up to that legacy, and instead accomplishing far more.While the first season of Sunshine adhered closely to the formula set by School Idol Project, the second season focused on the ways that Aqours was different.

On its technical merits, Sunshine soars.If I were to look at the anime alone, Sunshine is far from perfect. There’s a lot of valid criticisms that can and should be made, but since that’s not my focus, I’d recommend checking out Yuni’s review, which addresses a lot of them. But for this, rather than just looking at the show itself, I’m also including my own experience watching it, and I find that my enjoyment greatly outweighs any criticisms. For the past 13 weeks, it hasn’t just been the show that I’ve enjoyed, but also being a part of the community that surrounds it. That’s just my personal experience, so it will differ from person to person, but all I can say is that all of the tweets, fanart, and fanfiction that I saw definitely added to my enjoyment.I’m going to miss this generation. It’s not quite over yet – there’s still the movie – but the end is rapidly approaching. I’ve always appreciated that the Love Live franchise ends stories conclusively; the dream of being a school idol is fleeting, but the lessons learned will last forever. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to love the next generation the same way I loved this one, but the future looks bright, and I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings."", 'Ok, Let\'s talk real now.I didn\'t come to watch Love Live Sunshine because I looked for some intense and deep story that involves time traveling or... something like that.I came here looking for cute idols singing, dancing, aiming high and getting there.And I got exactly what I was looking for.In Season 2 we didn\'t really have a ""special"" story. It\'s pretty similar to School Idol Project, with the school being at risk, 3rd years leaving and such. But, it felt like it fit to give some background story so I liked it in the end. (7/10 for Story)The animation and art was outstanding. The CGI...dances were executed super well and I have enjoyed every moment watching it.Of course there were points where the art dropped off, but it was mostly consistent. (9/10 for Art)Sound- Which includes Soundtrack/OP/ED/Insert songs. That was the real strength of Love Live Sunshine. These were amazing songs and I\'ve enjoyed every single one of them, I listen to them every day because they were so good.The soundtrack, too, fit quite well and was nice. (10/10 for Sound)Well, we have 9 characters, which is a pretty nice amount. So it\'ll be hard not finding a girl to your liking. They were pretty diverse in their personalities yet so close (as they\'re all idols), the development between the cast as Aqours, or as one grade (Ex: Chemistry between 3rd years) and all the ""ships"" were quite outstanding. I found myself really bonding with the characters, and by the end of the anime there are no girls I hate. (10/10 for Character).So in conclusion, this anime got a 10/10 from me. And I RECOMMEND IT. Even if you don\'t feel like going through the ""comedy to drama"" story, just listen and watch to the CGI Dances and songs, as they were too good. dances were executed super well and I have enjoyed every moment watching it.Of course there were points where the art dropped off, but it was mostly consistent.

Sunshine is here, and with it a new whole goal.First of, the visual part was absolutely beautiful, word´s can´t describe how gorgeous the animation is, there´s no doubt that this is the peak of Love Live! animation, the opening sequence goes through various settings which all are detailed perfectly, accompanied by the new opening theme ""Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo"", which set the stage for a memorable season.As for the story goes, you can see the development that the characters had in season one, but maintaining that ambitious nature of...them that lets them keep moving forward.Now there´s a new goal for the group, it isn´t just saving the school or winning Love Live! anymore, now they´re aiming to make an impact around the world, and do whatever it´s necessary to let a miracle happen.Also, during the first episode of this season there are a lot of references from the first episode of the first season, but now changing Riko´s and Chika´s role for a moment.The ending sequence was the most memorable thing to me, sharing a lot of similarities with the first Love Live! endings sequences, the song isn´t only amazing, but it´s also a nostalgia trip through all the franchise in less than 2 minutes.The wait is over and it was worth it, this season will definitively teach us the meaning of hard work and believing in miracles, and the trip to reach to that point will be a total thrillride, let´s enjoy this moment together!------------------------------------------------Now after 13 episodes has passed, I can safely say that this was the best written season of all Love Live!, they didn´t abused the drama but at the same time you can feel connected to the characters, their growth and personal goals, as well as the collective goals for Aqours, having their own unique approach, both as a group and individuals.As for the insert songs, they can only be described as legendary, they will be remembered for years to come for the ones that got to enjoy this anime.By the end of the season you can feel how everything from season 1 and this season was connected to give a satisfying conclusion for the ones that payed close attention to the development of each character.Personally, I will cherish this season forever. them that lets them keep moving forward.Now there´s a new goal for the group, it isn´t just saving the school or winning Love Live! anymore, now they´re aiming to make an impact around the world, and do whatever it´s necessary to let a miracle happen.Also, during the first episode of this season there are a lot of references from the first episode of the first season, but now changing Riko´s and Chika´s role for a moment.The ending sequence was the most memorable thing to me, sharing a lot of similarities with the first Love Live! endings sequences, the song isn´t only amazing, but it´s also a nostalgia trip through all the franchise in less than 2 minutes.The wait is over and it was worth it, this season will definitively teach us the meaning of hard work and believing in miracles, and the trip to reach to that point will be a total thrillride, let´s enjoy this moment together!------------------------------------------------Now after 13 episodes has passed, I can safely say that this was the best written season of all Love Live!, they didn´t abused the drama but at the same time you can feel connected to the characters, their growth and personal goals, as well as the collective goals for Aqours, having their own unique approach, both as a group and individuals.As for the insert songs, they can only be described as legendary, they will be remembered for years to come for the ones that got to enjoy this anime.By the end of the season you can feel how everything from season 1 and this season was connected to give a satisfying conclusion for the ones that payed close attention to the development of each character.Personally, I will cherish this season forever.', 'My original review was already really long. And I still stand by all of it. So, I\'m just gonna link a pic of that here (https://imgur.com/a/4Bfs5) so that I have more space to talk about a revelation that dawned on me recently. I swear I\'m not going to do this often.So, I\'m now 6 episodes in. And I\'ve bumped up my scores for:Story: From 3 to 6Art: Remaining at 9Sound: From 7 to 8Characters: From 5 to 7Overall: From 7 to 8Enjoyment: From 7 to 8So, you may wonder be wondering. What could have possibly happened to change all of these scores? Basically, the performances...are even better than I thought they were. So the thought came to me when I saw the main character Chika do this absurdly complex move on stage. The first thought that came to mind was, ""Okay, I don\'t care how many days she trained, she did not just pull that off flawlessly""But then I looked back at the dancing there, and some from previous episodes, and some from last season, and it hit me. The reason why I didn\'t like the last season as much as this one was because the dancing was INTENTIONALLY bad. The choreography was INTENTIONALLY boring.Seriously, go back and watch Mijuku Dreamer and Yume de Yozora wo Terashitai. Watch how basic the moves are. They aren\'t even really working as a team yet, they just need to have enough unity to synchronize actions. And they are often just standing in rows and walking back and forth. Really boring stuff. But that\'s the thing, they\'re a brand new group. Of course, they can\'t pull off cool stuff yet.I genuinely think this was all planned because even watching Omoi yo Hitotsu ni Nare from episode 11 of season 1, nearing the end of the season, it\'s clear that the choreography is already a huge improvement over where it started. They\'re interacting with each other much more. And are playing around with weird positioning and aesthetics.But it only gets better as season 2 goes on. Every live is stronger in some aspect to the last and they are growing in a way that we can track. Rather than that asinine ranking system from the original Love Live outright telling us, through a number, how much they\'ve improved.This gives credibility to the narrative that Chika could actually do what she does in episode 6. And it gives the entire series a new layer of depth and complexity that I never considered up until this point. Character growth is clearly presented through their craft so they feel so much more real. The plot points assist in that growth, so the story (even if it\'s still kinda boring) feels more impactful.That kind of storytelling through what I thought was already fantastic visuals is what has now made an anime that I reluctantly watched, to now being something I can confidently say is very good. are even better than I thought they were.

Sorry.Love Love has done so much for so many people, despite what you might think of the franchise.The story isn\'t something out of a masterpiece. It is bland and simplistic and the characters have one dimensional personalities. Too bland. Too simple. Sometimes a little too simple.We were thought to believe that compelling stories have to be meaningful, cathartic. Just like life itself. But we sometimes forget that life does not have to be cathartic. It can be simple. It does not have to be convoluted or complicated in order for it to work. Sometimes it clicks. Just like...that.Some things do not have to be complicated for them to work out just fine.Chika Takami knew that. Her friends knew that.She wanted to find something that made her life shine bright.That is something very simplistic in the journey of self discovery.It does not matter where you come from. What you do. What you believe in and who you find along the way. Sometimes things just click and nobody can take those experiences away from you. This is what the meaning of self discovery truly is. It is purely subjective. If you have learned from them it does not matter what other people think.Love Live is just that. It clicks. In its simplicity it clicks and brings you along the way.(And it might not, but it\'s still your own personal experience)I met a twelve year old girl this past summer that got into Love Live thanks to a friend. We are fifteen years apart and we spent a whole afternoon talking about the story and characters.I could have never been able to enjoy a conversation with this young girl if it was any other anime. It was an easy going conversation that to this day I cherish deeply, because it made me see something that I had not seen in myself. In order for things to work, I don\'t have to think too hard about them.It does not matter if the story is not as perfect as you might think.It is so important to remember that things don\'t always have to be difficult. They can be easy. As adults we constantly say ""It\'s difficult"". Sure, it is difficult, but it does not always have to be that way.Love Live is a beautiful story about accepting the simple things about life, because way too often we don\'t. We just forget them somewhere in the back of our brains, until we go insane.In my opinion, this is why Love Live is cherished and relatable amongst so many people, because it\'s about a simple group of teenagers with simple goals, looking to follow a common dream. Whether if it happens it does not matter. It is still the journey of self discovery.It was the same for me. I started Love Live not knowing what it was and hearing so much hate about it. I almost thought I was going to hate it as well, yet I found myself compelled into an unexpected world that made me laugh and cry and that made me realize, things don\'t have to drive you mad in order to work. They just do. Go with the flow. If you can\'t control it don\'t control it.I finally got myself to watch the last episode of this anime after a year of putting it off, knowing full-heartedly that there might not be another anime in this franchise. And I was not let down.Love Live has made an impact on so many people. For bad or for good it doesn\'t really matter.I am just so happy that I was there to see it happen.(Now please don\'t kill me for writing this) -Peace that.Some things do not have to be complicated for them to work out just fine.Chika Takami knew that.

Okay....Love Live Sunshine S2 is shit.After S1 set the bar for what was, most likely, to be the best season of Love Live ever, maybe even surpassing the masterful S2, ended up being the corniest, most obnoxious, most mind-numbingly boring, most underwhelming experience I\'ve ever had with a piece of entertainment. Yup, this thing is down there with Terminator Salvation and Bioshock 2. But, to be fair, it\'s not exactly Final Fantasy X-2. How do I say this? It\'s a piece of shit but not entirely.Unlike the older seasons, it looks prettier. The soundtrack is nice. And the 3D animation is nice to look at, not like the awkward CG models they used in the original. The 2D animation is a lot slicker and more animated, allowing for a range of expressions in body language (which they didn\'t do at all). As for the girls themselves, DO YOU SEE THAT DETAIL? The amount of work they put into making the girls a lot prettier and flashier is impressive. As a training animator myself, I can just imagine the sweat and tears put into the lineart per frame.Hm, what else... Yup, that\'s it for the positives, I think. Now let\'s tear this thing apart.One of the key things that made Love Live so good was how they utilized drama. Whenever there was a situation the characters couldn\'t handle, it was always given due care, embracing an amount of subtlety or loudness that always fit the situation. Yes, even the massive outbreak scene in the original S1. The way they build up scenes with music, voice acting, blocking and camera angles manage to convey the emotions the characters are feeling. The other key thing was silence. The characters would only talk when they needed to, and convey what they needed to. This is true for the original and Sunshine S1. The scene where Chika expressed her disappointment and sadness over getting zero votes was masterful. It is a very good example of saying what you need to say: ""I\'m disappointed, I\'m disappointed"". Just from these lines alone, you could feel all the emotions pouring out from her, and the strength she lacks trying to cope with the situation. This is a scene I remember to this day, and I\'ve only seen the whole season once, last year. It\'s masterful, and embraces what Love Live stands for - following your dreams and growing to become better.See all those great thing I said about Love Live? THIS SEASON HAS NONE OF THAT.The way drama is handled here is exactly what I expected of Love Live before I watched the original; corny, loud and meaningless. The school is shutting down, they failed to save the school but they have to get up and do Love Live anyway! How do they convey these set of events? In the laziest way possible. Chika is on the brink of losing hope, the group of schoolgirls can\'t convince her out of it. What saves the day? AN EVEN BIGGER GROUP OF SCHOOLGIRLS. Even at the ending, when they\'re closing up the school. This is the perfect moment for silence, letting the feeling sink in that \'this is the end and we need to move forward\'. But NOPE! Gotta keep telling each other and letting the audience know that ""we\'ll be together foreeeveerrr *heart* *heart*"". The way they resolve every instance of drama is just plain lazy. I don\'t know, but they always feels set up, like it\'s just there just so something can happen or they say things just to consume empty space when there\'s no need to. The biggest thing I want to address is the Saint Snow arc. This could\'ve been an amazing arc, rivaling the original S2\'s Rin and Nozomi episode. But nope, it was a rushed and inconsequential set of episodes about characters that had 0 to no buildup. Ruby is such a disappointing character. She was at least fun and felt involved around S1, but the way they utilized her for this arc, getting involved with Leah because she also had a sister and she was seemingly concerned, doesn\'t work for me AT ALL. As for Leah, her problem just felt plain shallow to me. Not that it wasn\'t. Losing the whole competition is something very demoralizing for the two of them. ... So why didn\'t they show that it was? This is another problem with the show: not putting in good buildup or drama when there was a dire need for it. This arc was in DIRE need for some good scenes, showing the tension between the two sisters, building up Ruby and Leah\'s friendship while developing the two in some way that it shows us who they are. The series tries, but it falls flat on its face because the scenes really just don\'t work for me and just feel empty without the proper backing. Ruby building up the confidence to make her own decisions? Great! Where\'s the part where you established that?? It really just doesn\'t work for me.And while we\'re at the topic, let\'s talk about the characters. S1 built up these characters to have possibly amazing arcs because of how well established they were, and how their unity felt organic and something that could potentially create amazing and fun mini arcs for the group. But here we are with S2, where the main dilemma is the group\'s refusal to put -chan at the end of Dia\'s name. What happened to all the dynamic characterization in S1? You can\'t possibly tell me that all the things that made each character interesting somehow disappeared after S1? Where did You\'s confidence issues go? Dia\'s love for idols? Kanan\'s love for the sea? When did Aquors\' determination to follow their dreams, be free to be themselves and shine yet keep asking themselves what it means to shine?? And turned the girls into uninteresting one-note characters that say the same things over and over (""Buu Buu desu wa"" is the most ear grating thing I\'ve ever heard in my life)?Well, not entirely.I missed one positive thing about this season - the dog episode. The way they gave Yoshiko and Riko this fun and unlikely friendship over a dog and make them realize things about themselves and each other.To make things better, both subtlety and silence were present. How Yoshiko expressed how she didn\'t really believe in the occult but did it anyway because she felt something special from it and Riko receiving those words from her reminded me why I loved Love Live so much. And it gave me hope that maybe the series would go back to being good again, but nope it became boring the following episode. I honestly don\'t even remember what happened. What happened again? And what sucks is that they tossed away this relationship almost entirely after, turning Yoshiko back into a dry joke instead of bringing out her internal dilemma.I feel a need to address the songs, because really, none of them were memorable for me. They sounded like the filler songs you\'d play in SIF. None of them stuck with me at all. They felt cheesy, boring to listen to and I\'d occasionally pause in the middle of them to get a drink.It\'s relatively easy to get away with the phrase ""It\'s just an idol anime. What did you expect?"". It\'s hard to explain to people that the Love Live is a great series and could be a very meaningful experience. What this season is is precisely what people who haven\'t seen the show think the show is - just another cute girl anime. Just another corny, boring slice of life show with some music.This show is an utter disappointment. And I seriously hope future installations strive to do better. But, to Sunrise, this season is probably a smash hit so I\'ll hope instead that a more competent director or writer comes around. Love Live set the bar high, and I seriously hope someone steps in and meets the quota next time around.

So if you want an introduction story watch the first anime.Story 10/10Even though this is a music anime, it give you more than music. It will give you a heartwarming story and how all the character bond with each other. The story is so simple, about a school idol group that want to shine. They want to win. All the problem here is just a simple thing, but the pace is something. This...anime will take us through the journey of how beautiful a friendship is. I just can't describe how wonderful it is. Beside from the story, they also got the comedy too. Usually first half of the episode is filled with a little bit of story and full of comedy. And the second half is vice versa.Art 10/10The art here is normal for an anime. Not the worst nor the best, just average. Its colorful and bright, which is good because this anime is mostly positive and happy. Also we can feel that they lived in seashore, because the atmosphere is really good. The background also give the same thing, its really beautiful and fit with the story. What i really love from this anime art is the fact that every characters design fit their personality really well.Sound 10/10All the VA here is doing a really great jobs, especially the 9 main characters VA. They are not only doing the VA, but the OP and ED song too. Heck, they even have an idol group in real life which we can see them live singing on stage. They also release a lot of song, you can listen to them in your favourite music platform. Me too sometimes enjoy their song while doing homework or when playing some games. VA talk aside, we also have the great BGM. The BGM is not always there. But when it come, you can clearly hear them and enjoy them. Fit really well with the situation.Character 10/10The fact that they can made 9 MC and make their personality different is already a big thumbs up. Like i said above. This anime is an in-depth story about the girls here. The only one that changing here is that they are more mature than before, i guess. They all have their own special episode and i really like it. Because we know more about their personality and all. They solve their problem more seriously as we progress through the anime. We can see all the girls here grew up. While yes they are now more mature and serious, they still have the silly side on them.  Every episode start with a quick summary of the last episode. And the one that narrator it is the MC. Really, just watch the anime and you can see why i give their characters a 10 out of 10.Enjoyment 10/10I really really love this series. Its not only give me a show to watch but they also motivate me. I'm also enjoying all of their content from the anime, game, song, even the seiyuu livestream. I wish that someday i can see their live show. This series is so special for me, i'll definitely rewatch this in near future with dub. If you like the kind of anime that gives you a spirit to continue your life, feel free to watch this. It is helped me a lot during this hard time.Thats all i can say about the anime. I really don't have a word to describe how amazing this anime is. You should really watch it yourself. They also have a game called LLSIFAS, in there you can read more of their stories if the anime doesn't enough for you to consume. The last thing i wanna say is thank you for reading my review. anime will take us through the journey of how beautiful a friendship is. I just can't describe how wonderful it is.

Let\'s...start off with Dia essentially getting way more screentime and meme worthy scenes than ever before making her LA\'s second favorite character by the end of it. Riko and Yohane got a joint character development together and though LA liked Riko and Yohane\'s friendship and everything, their development was slightly off executed in terms of themes, but nonetheless Yohane continued to be LA\'s favorite character even through it all. Now the more interesting character developments came from RUBY of all people as well as their rival Saint Snow\'s Ria Kazuno. This is one of the first things LA noticed Sunshine\'s second season did better than the original series, that of showing that even rival idols have their own problems of their own in comparison to aRISE who were already famous and popular and knows how to solve everything. Together with Ruby, we get some great double sister sibling character development from Dia, Ruby, Ria and her older sister Seira at the same time. Lastly would be Chika herself and how she develops as both a leader and how she handles everything and trying to be the best to save her school.-sigh- and even the second season won\'t give You a PROPER CHARACTER FOCUSED EPISODE...Sunshine\'s 2nd season for LA at least showed that it wasn\'t trying to be a pale imitation of the original, this time, it was gonna fix the mistakes of the original.From the aforementioned rivals being looked at a different light to the finale and eventual change of goal that Aqours goes through was a welcoming change even if this second season by in large was going at a slightly slower pace but the same flavour and personality it always had in the first season.The animation done once again by Sunrise was typically of great quality, from the shiny character designs and beautiful backgrounds. The concert scenes by in large though it has Love lIve\'s typical CGI, like in the first season, it looked polished for the most part in terms of CGI, but the choreography and backgroundings for some of the concerts were GORGEOUS to look at some times. Seriously this might have been Sunrise trying to outdo themselves in the animation department.In terms of voice acting, it was pretty much the same from the first season, with some highlights of Ai Furihata getting some limelight as Ruby to Aika Kobayashi doing her chunni thing as Yohane. However for LA, the best voice actor goes to Dia\'s voice actor, Arisa Komiya. Nonetheless the same old voice cast, but for LA, they honed in their character even more this season.Sunshine\'s second season because of how it dealt with Aqours\' problem head on with a few hijinks here and there, it was serious for the most part as to what kinds of leaps and bounds, constant trials and tribulations Aqours went through to the point, you can\'t help but root for these underdogs and maybe even make them want to win Love Live! after everything they have been through.If Love Live Sunshine\'s 2nd Season did anything for it\'s finale was give a fulfilling conclusion that we all wanted and Sunshine gave it to us in spades. Yes something this second season outdid or something the original series never did give us was ""closure"". From giving us what the 9 members of Aqours is gonna do in the future to resolving all plot threads, making us root for these character and maybe Aqours might win and giving us actual closure on what happens to Aqours and the school, something not even the Love Live Movie or the original\'s second season never did.From pale imitation of the original, to fixing the mistakes and improving of the original series\' formula, Sunshine\'s Second Season was a great sendoff to the series with no loose plot threads, giving us characters to root for, character development *cough* cept You, seriously no You episode C\'MON *cough* that help flesh out the majority of Aqours all under the typical Love Live personality and spunk it had in the original series.Aqours really did shine by the end of it all... start off with Dia essentially getting way more screentime and meme worthy scenes than ever before making her LA\'s second favorite character by the end of it.

In one way, it's absurd, because it just isn't real to have students be, for example, so loving and passionate for their school.. all the time. In another way, absolutely fantastic. Sunrise have done it again with a charming second season that I think gave me even more than expected, warmer & lingering feelings for Aqours. This might be my favorite LL entry.There's not much to the plot-line in this season, very similar to the first series. Second Love Live is coming around, there are concerns about the 3rd years' graduation and what Aqours should do after,...some more funny sequences and drama, though what Sunshine excels in is portraying the connection between Aqours better, gracing the fans with a rewarding experience and all the more feelings towards Aqours this time around and the whole series and the amount of drama is being kept at bay, not bland & not exaggerated at times at any point.The artstyle is much better this time around, even the CGI. It didn't feel like a distraction and if you're particularly into idol stuff and cute girls singing and dancing you'll find this to be pretty fun to see actually.The main girls and also Saint Snow have also gotten their well-deserved development and even though there isn't widely much of it, it's still a lot better and satisfying compared to what felt like a rush and rocky start in the first season. There's all the more reason to like & care for the girls.The soundtrack of Love Live never decreases in quality. The music is awesome to listen to and the better CGI comes off as an enhancement to the experience. I find myself listening to MY Mai☆TONIGHT and Awaken the power often though since those tracks in particular are some that are of more appeal to my taste.I don't know what to expect from the movie or even the future series, if there ever ends up being one again. Overall, Love Live is an entertaining franchise that's surely to get you in your feelings which depends on whether you enjoy a show like this or not in the first place. It has been an amazing run and i'm sure the movie's gonna be too. some more funny sequences and drama, though what Sunshine excels in is portraying the connection between Aqours better, gracing the fans with a rewarding experience and all the more feelings towards Aqours this time around and the whole series and the amount of drama is being kept at bay, not bland & not exaggerated at times at any point.The artstyle is much better this time around, even the CGI.

Story looks like not how the member reach their dream but only they activity to spent a time every day before they school shut down. But, thats the point how i love this series.

(ラブライブ！) is an absolute masterpiece of a series. The masters of otaku anime, Sunrise, makers of Gintama and this very series Love Live!, have truly perfected the formula of making an anime that fits the needs of an otaku, perfectly, to every last inch with no pieces missing. The characters, the things that are said (I know Japanese and watched this series without subtitles), the OST, the art, everything combines to together to make one solid anime. For the uninitiated, Love Live! is made as a 完全男性向けアニメ (Anime made entirely for males). There is no ecchi but there is also 0 male characters....Even though I say all this, and even though Love Live! is OBVIOUSLY in a league of its own, haters are gonna hate, though.""What about the story bro?!""""Love Live! ain\'t got story!""Who cares.

Because that\'s where you\'ll find the things more important than what you want.”-Yoshihiro Togashi, Hunter x Hunter, Vol. 32To bear dignity in defeat is a common mark of maturity, of respect. But to wholeheartedly accept that defeat, internalizing all of the lessons and experiencing of it, using it as a catalyst for a leap forward into your prospective future?That\'s an entire level entirely, and that theme is heavily explored throughout every episode of Sunshine\'s 2nd season run.As opposed to the first season, I felt that this season was less about Aqours finding themselves or...working to become their very best, the entire season instead felt much more introspective, like a rebuild of efforts lost.More importantly, the season really focused on how Chika and crew took every loss along the way, and turned it into a positive force.Just like in season 1, it\'s heartbreaking to see their efforts go completely to waste. They completely failed to even come close to winning Love Live in the last season, and in this season, it\'s revealed from the first few episodes that their main goal in becoming idols in the first place isn\'t going to become a reality.To put it simply, Aqours lost.In contrast to Muse, I\'ve commented that the starkest difference is that a big focus is put on how much Aqours grinds out of the ditch with their efforts. They struggle, they suffer, they grind harder than any of the girls in Muse do in those first two seasons.So to see all of those efforts flushed down the toilet should be completely devastating, reflecting the first time they encounter defeat in the first season.But that\'s where the season won for me. Despite some imbalance of its characterizations, its over the top humor (it goes full slapstick at some points, much worse than any of the previous seasons), and its heavier moments, this second season absolutely triumphs in its manifestation of its themes.Of moving forward, no matter what, of lifting your head up no matter how much life just takes a FAT shit on you, of fighting towards your ""shine"" after you\'re crushed by darkness, after realizing you don\'t even KNOW what your ""shine"" is.Despite its flaws, the season won me over with just how earnest it is in its delivery of its broad, larger than life strokes. It\'s not an approach that many can appreciate, and I can see why.Characterization at some points is less refined and comparatively dull to the first season, and yes, pales in comparison to the seasons of the original seasons. But to that I counter that the growth and characterization of the group as a WHOLE is unrivaled. I did not expect things to turn out this way, for all of Aqours efforts to have been for nothing.But as Chika realizes in the end of the show, was it all for nothing? Or were the experiences and relationships she forged along the way the true ""shine"" she set forward to find in the first place?It\'s a very basic theme, sure, but Love Live has a surefire way of encapsulating larger than life themes, and injecting pure wholesome passion into my veins like nothing else, and for that, Sunshine triumphs. working to become their very best, the entire season instead felt much more introspective, like a rebuild of efforts lost.More importantly, the season really focused on how Chika and crew took every loss along the way, and turned it into a positive force.Just like in season 1, it\'s heartbreaking to see their efforts go completely to waste.

Beautiful music2. CG way better than 1st season3. Individual character developments4. Went to a separate route different from the original series5. A collaboration with another idol groupCons:...1. First 3 episodes were a sore to get through, so many meme materials.<LONG REVIEW>I hated the second season at first. There were just too many meme materials. It\'s seriously annoying to watch. I struggled through the first 3 episodes and after the first song came out, this series became more and more better, until the point that I rated it an 8/10.If you don\'t know, I started watching more anime because of Love Live. I love J-Pop music before that and Love Live fulfilled all my desires by mixing music and tournament together. It\'s sad to see that series end. After a year, I heard that Love Live was getting a sequel featuring different characters. I was overjoyed by that. Then, I started following Aqours. I love the first season, although there are a lot of points taken from the original series, nevertheless I still enjoyed watching it. Now I will review these 2 seasons together.A lot of complaints I saw with this series is that it copies the original series very much making a lot of Love Live fans hating this sequel. But this season manages to fix a lot of them. It went down its original path, parting ways with μ\'s and I like that. The path they took was also very interesting. I won\'t spoil you but the development the plot decided to take really did shock me. It\'s way more different than the original Love Live series.Speaking of Love Live, of course we are going to talk about the music. It\'s outstanding. Now I won\'t compare this to those of μ\'s because they are 2 complete different groups with different singing styles. The songs in this series really stood out to me. I enjoyed listening to each and every track. The dance sequences were also properly choreographed and the CG was much better compared to previous seasons. Personally my favorite song this season were ""My Mai Tonight"" and ""Awaken the Power"", especially ""Awaken the Power"" where I got to see a collaboration with other group, made me like this season even more.The characters that Sunrise decided to focus a lot of time on this season, were annoying at first, but slowly after each of their own arcs I started to care more about the and to like them more.  It\'s a surprise to me too because I never thought I would like the characters of Sunshine!! this much. A lot of characters got development throughout this season and that\'s what made me appreciate this season a lot more.The art and animation was pretty consistent. Nothing to praise and nothing to complain about.Overall, I love ""Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season"" a lot. It disappointed me at first but managed to grab my attention back. Great job! 8/10 That\'s it for my review. Thanks for reading. 1. First 3 episodes were a sore to get through, so many meme materials.<LONG REVIEW>I hated the second season at first.

Great job! 8/10 That\'s it for my review. Thanks for reading.', ""Robert's Too Late Reviews back in action! Today's pertinent information includes the fact I'm working the dubbed version, and that I'm going on the premise that you are familiar with season one of Love Live! Sunshine!! I mean, if you're not, why start in the middle of the second season right? The short of it is that I found that this season the Aqours girls find their legs and really pull off a great tale. There is tension and drama and not everything goes the way one would expect, so I wholeheartedly recommend watching if you liked Sunshine!! season 1 or even if you were...a little iffy on it. This season makes the girls shine. Let's break it down like a backup dancer on stage.Of note, there will be some spoilers in this review, especially relating to the content of the previous season. I will try to keep it at a minimum but some things have to be covered to make sense.Story: 9In the opening we find out that not only did the girls NOT win Love Live! but they didn't even make the regional qualifiers. Not only that, but they were only able to drum up about 10 prospective students. This point is kind of a victory for them, as they wanted to change the zero into a one, and they did so, but it was nowhere near enough to save the school from the impending closing. So the small goal was met, though it didn't affect the overall dire situation, and of course the girls didn't just blast through Love Live! like it was nothing. There's a strong hint of grounding for most of this season. This is much less about winning the moon and stars, and much more about doing their personal best (rebwestey as Ruby might say).So the issues they are facing are the same as season 1, firstly that they need to get more prospective students, and secondly that they want to achieve their dream of playing at, and winning, the Love Live! competition. Toss in the mix the antagonists from the previous season and the sudden twist their relationship with Aqours takes, and there's some compelling viewing. I felt like we really got to know the girls better this time around as their personalities shined through. Dia is still bitchy, but a softness is brought out in her. Mari is still overly optimistic but finds herself forced to face reality and come down out of the clouds. Each of the girls seemed to have moments like this.I know in the season 1 review I declared my love for the girls of Muse, but this second season of Sunshine!! really ranks up there with the original set. In fact I think the cast is better presented and explored than in the Muse seasons. I don't remember knowing much about the shy girl in Muse, but I do feel like I know Ruby or You, or even Hanamaru whereas in Muse there was shy girl, cat girl, so forth. The interaction and chemistry in the show seems to be at a peak in this season. For this reason alone, I feel the show is worth viewing.The original questions remain: will Aqours save their school? Will they win the Love Live! competition? Some of the answers might just surprise you. I was somewhat shocked to learn that not everything turns up roses for these girls, but that's okay, because by going against the expectations of the genre and its ubiquitous 'happy endings' they really caught my attention, and I was in a position of not being sure on what would and what wouldn't happen. This gives the show an edge to it, one that heightens the drama somewhat.Art: 9The girls still look good. I really adore the artwork on all of the Love Live! series. The distractions from last season about comparing Aqours to Muse have been obliterated as the girls' personalities helps keep everyone's appearances from being cookie cutters of Muse's girls, as I first had trouble with last season. The detail is superb, the girls are recognizable whether their in their school uniforms, workout clothes, or idol costumes. The idol costumes themselves are interesting and varied, and not overly busy. The art is very cutesy and colorful, befitting the tone and theme of the series. Love it!Sound: 9The opening and closing themes are as 'pop music' as they come, but they work and are a lot of fun. I didn't like the themes as well as I did Muse's, but they stand strong on their own. The voice acting is varied and interesting, ranging from a high pitched younger girl to a deep, mature sounding senior. The 'leader' of the group has a bright and bubbly voice, and the oddball comedic relief retains her dramatic flair. All the things I wrote in the review of season 1 of Sunshine!! apply. No changes in voice actors that I heard, and they all performed very well. I do believe Mari uses more Italian in this season than the last but the story explains that by pointing out she is moving to Italy for college after graduation. Helps to practice the language I guess.If I had to give a few complaints, it would be Ruby the high pitched first year's voice, as it strayed near annoying at times, and her occasional flinging around of the term 'rubwestey' or whatever. She doesn't do this often, so it's not a huge thing. The other complaint would be that Mari is a little too bright and cheery sounding sometimes, which I could see getting on people's nerves. I didn't even mind Hanamaru and her continuing to say 'zura' after nearly every line.There's a fair bit of songs performed and while they all kind of mesh into one if you're not huge on that music scene, they all sounded really good and had a toe tapping beat. They might not have been memorable by themselves, but they also weren't 'oh dear god make it stop' bad either.Character: 8The show shines in the characters as they are more fleshed out through this season. We see less 'movement' or growth, such as Mari's slapping Kanan in season 1, or Dia's whole overall attitude. But what we do see is that the girls hold very firm to the personas they presented in the first season. As I said there is a little growth, such as Dia softening a little, but for the most part we get the girls as they are, and their character traits seem to be far more solid than last season. They've all found their place and niche, and work all the better for it.Each girl seems to get a good deal of screen time, and I didn't ever feel like they were leaving a girl out in the cold. Muse sometimes made me think the freshmen (shy girl and cat girl) were kind of skipped over, but Sunshine!! doesn't feature that. Every girl has their own well defined motivation, their defined personalities, and a stable overall interaction between all of them.Enjoyment: 8I found that I liked season 2 better than season one, even though there are some somber moments to be had, especially towards the end of the series. Because of the results of season 1's actions, I felt there was no guarantee on exactly what the girls were going to achieve, which helped pique my interest instead of just watching the girls sit back and basically conquer the world. The tension that maybe, just maybe, they wouldn't make all their goals held my attention.The ending episode is pretty grand, and I really enjoyed it. It did well in wrapping up everyone's storyline in relation to the events of the show, and gives the emotional release that I enjoy. And I'm hard to please with endings!Best Girl: Yoshiko a.k.a 'Yohane' once again. She's still up to her antics and silliness, though there are moments even she is scared, frustrated or upset. She's still hilarious though, and I love her for it.I had a great time with the entire Love Live! series, so if you are into idol anime at all, then I think not only is Sunshine!! season 2 great, but the entire series is worth watching. Love Live! outclasses in many ways other shows such as the Idolmaster series, and comes close to standing equal to K-On, though I'd say K-On is less idol, more slice of life. Either way, Love Live! Sunshine!! is a great idol anime, and a lot of fun. Come, descend with me my little demons and watch this series! a little iffy on it. This season makes the girls shine. Let's break it down like a backup dancer on stage.Of note, there will be some spoilers in this review, especially relating to the content of the previous season. I will try to keep it at a minimum but some things have to be covered to make sense.Story: 9In the opening we find out that not only did the girls NOT win Love Live! but they didn't even make the regional qualifiers. Not only that, but they were only able to drum up about 10 prospective students. This point is kind of a victory for them, as they wanted to change the zero into a one, and they did so, but it was nowhere near enough to save the school from the impending closing. So the small goal was met, though it didn't affect the overall dire situation, and of course the girls didn't just blast through Love Live! like it was nothing. There's a strong hint of grounding for most of this season. This is much less about winning the moon and stars, and much more about doing their personal best (rebwestey as Ruby might say).So the issues they are facing are the same as season 1, firstly that they need to get more prospective students, and secondly that they want to achieve their dream of playing at, and winning, the Love Live! competition. Toss in the mix the antagonists from the previous season and the sudden twist their relationship with Aqours takes, and there's some compelling viewing. I felt like we really got to know the girls better this time around as their personalities shined through. Dia is still bitchy, but a softness is brought out in her. Mari is still overly optimistic but finds herself forced to face reality and come down out of the clouds. Each of the girls seemed to have moments like this.I know in the season 1 review I declared my love for the girls of Muse, but this second season of Sunshine!! really ranks up there with the original set. In fact I think the cast is better presented and explored than in the Muse seasons. I don't remember knowing much about the shy girl in Muse, but I do feel like I know Ruby or You, or even Hanamaru whereas in Muse there was shy girl, cat girl, so forth.

If you are annoyed by cheesy moments, lots of emotional and melodramatic moments, your probably not gonna like the show. But for me, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Sure it\'s cheesy, but it\'s overflowing with charm.Story: Story is pretty ok. I really didn\'t like the ""saving the school"" plot of the last season but this season actually made it me care more about it without having the plot take up almost every episode. A step in the right direction but I still would\'ve preferred it not be so plot-heavyArt: The normal 2D art is acceptable but the CG has really made...steps forward. The performances look great and a lot less distractingly cheap compared to LL: SIFSound: This is completely subjective but I really love Aqours\' music. Like last time, every couple of episodes has an insert song and I really liked all of them. I definitely recommend the show to people who like their music if you haven\'t seen it already. The actual OST in the background is ok too.Character: Characters get more moments and when they do, the show really shines. The best episodes in my opinion is when they focus on one or two characters with little plot, just letting them all do their thing. Though one issue I have that might annoy people is that sometimes when characters aren\'t in the spotlight they kind of resort to using their catchphrases a lot. It\'s like the writers wanted to recreate the success of nico nico nii but overdid it by a longshot. Also, some characters don\'t get as much screentime as others like You and Kanan.Overall, this show is really flawed but something about it is really charming and light-hearted. I feel like the people I\'d most recommend this to are people who like Slice of Life, definitely people who like idol and musical shows, and people who liked the original Love Live! (though which one they like better is up to the individual, I personally enjoyed this more despite the flaws). Watch Season 1 before this, its pretty good and it, and the show in general seemed to get better as it went on. This show is still going in my favs because, I\'m biased to liking the music, and it definitely made me feel something in the end and get me really attached to the characters despite the flaws. Hoping the movie delivers.TL;DR Yoshiko is best girl, puppet show is best episode in the whole franchise, Love Live memes are top tier, and enjoy idol hell! steps forward.

Sunshine!! Stands out among them.The story although follows roughly along the same line as LLSIP but I think it benefits it rather than ruins it. Since the stories paralell each other for most of the show but Aqours not seeing the support that µ's got. It talk chika and the others to, be themselves and that is the message that this anime conveys and it does it extremely well.The art is good, and the CGI looked way better than past installments, however, nothing to brag...aboutThe music has increased significantly with more consistent library of songs making me want to dive into every song the group has put out.Characters who didn't get their deserved development, definitly got it this time around, Ria from saint snow has a character I didn't like in the first season as she came off cold and ignorant. However I completely went 180 on my opinion when I watch her character develop. It may not be perfect but it was definitly an improvement from the first seasonOverall Love Live! does it again, Giving us an amazing group to watch the journey of! aboutThe music has increased significantly with more consistent library of songs making me want to dive into every song the group has put out.Characters who didn't get their deserved development, definitly got it this time around, Ria from saint snow has a character I didn't like in the first season as she came off cold and ignorant.

I\'ll be the first to say that the original grasped me more (as I\'m a HUGE fan), but this was still amazing nonetheless! Love Live Sunshine has been a treat, full of smiles, songs as good as the original and improved CGI.If you\'re a Love Live fan watch this season for sure, if you haven\'t seen it before, be sure to watch the original first i\'d say (but this isn\'t a bad start either).Won\'t bore you anymore with my fan-girling, now for the more analytic stuff;...Story: 8Originally this score was lower because it seemed as though the plot was a carbon copy of the original. Then the added a slight twist (that I won\'t reveal to keep it spoiler free) that still had the similarities in the plots being more than the differences. But what won me over wasn\'t these little differences, it was the more meaningful interactions (such as with other idol groups) in the story that built on the plot.Sure the plot is similar to the first series, but that\'s hard to avoid when the whole basis is of ""school girls becoming idols and trying to win love live"". Slightly repetitive at this but a fun, and surprisingly emotional, story, that improved a lot from season 1 to season 2.Art: 9THE CGI LOOKS GREAT! Really happy to see these improvements as it now makes the performance scenes tonnes more enjoyable. Nice and easy on the eye, can\'t complain really.Sound: 9I\'ll be the first to say that some of the songs in season 2 have topped those of the previous season and the original. Aqours have great voices and the songs they sing all come together really well. Not quite Snow Halation good, but great in there own right.Characters: 8So the approach taken was, of course, to make characters that somewhat resemble someone from the original Love Live series. This approach was pretty weak in the first season as it felt like redoing what had been done. However this season, during the character development episodes we see our characters grow to be unique. These episodes really saved the day for these characters, making them more lovable and personal.What really won me over however is the interactions between characters. The clear bond between the girls in each year. It really was pleasant seeing Kanan treat Mari like a princess, or Hanamaru and Ruby bonding (or just seeing Hanamaru is general).Enjoyment: 9When watching this season, I didn\'t sit and binge like I do many other anime series. Instead I\'d watch a couple at a time, saving the smiles and purity of Love Live for when I needed it. This season will make you laugh, smile and maybe even cry ( I know I did once). Could, and will, happily watch this season again in the future.Only reason it isn\'t a 10 is because it didn\'t have that wow factor that glues your eyes to the screen.Overall: 8.5How sad that I can\'t give this a higher score.. but it\'s just not the same. That said Love Live Sunshine! season 2 is another great season, with really pleasant episodes for the individual characters. The characters\' growth as individuals, and as a group, sure makes it things enjoyable and helps make the plot shine.Love Live Sunshine! found it\'s radiance from my perspective and I would recommend watching this season to the end.

This season address that concern and actualizes many of the characters that felt too gimmicky, especially Ruby and Dia whose relationship is focused on in a later episode. Basically the gimmicks are already established, and still used, but this season spends more time making each girl feel like a real...person, which is nice.There was a great improvement in the musical performances in this season compared to the first with very good looking cg dances that were choreographed quite well. I particularly liked Miracle Wave which is performed at the end of episode 6. I don't know if they are using completely different software or if they just got better at the technique but all of the cg in the dances looks noticeably better.The overall positive, emotional and passionate feel of Love Live Sunshine!! driven by Chika's desire to shine is carried by the entire cast of girls in this season so it feels motivating to watch. This season feels like the goal is for Aqours to make their mark on the world and to share their community, who throughout the seasons supports them in their performances for the Love Love. It's actually really endearing to se all fo the Uranohoshi girls supporting Aqours along with the girl's families.Lastly, setting aside the seriousness this season continues to deliver on what I believe Sunshine season one did even better than the original Love Live, and that is having the girls engage in cute meaningless nonsense with all of their silly personalities. I think that is what Love Live as a series does best and it's always enjoyable to watch.If you liked any of Love Live I would highly recommend going ahead and watching this season as it may be my favorite of all of them. person, which is nice.There was a great improvement in the musical performances in this season compared to the first with very good looking cg dances that were choreographed quite well.

It had potential to be better, I liked the first season of Aqours, but I think I\'m through with Love Live anime now. I had trouble finishing this season because it was so cringy and cheesy. At times I wanted to choke Chika because she was so irritating. Her constant babbling about mysterious shine of school idols was just bullsh*t to be honest. You love school idols, I get it, you want to shine like them ""kira kira blah blah blah"". Why that stuff was almost in every episode, I\'ve had...enough. Things like this and absurd overdone symbolic scenes like Flying van were so cringe-worthy, yes it\'s shiny, it\'s a joke and friendship is magic I get it. Ok that last one was from different franchise... my mistake.Sure Love Live has always been about cute girls doing cute things with unnecessary drama. Maybe it was just that my personal quota of shiny school idols was filled and there was nothing wrong with this season of Love Live. But I think that style was also changed a bit. It was too damn serious at times, somehow slow and  boring and jokes were not that great either. Stories were boring but overly dramatic making them extremely cheesy and awkward. Many times they also lacked common sense making plot holes shine brighter than school idols.Sure there were good things as well. Loved the episode with the dog, sure it was a filler but it actually developed relationship of Yoshiko and Riko, or Yohane and Riri. Saint Snow episodes also developed Ruby a bit and I like her a bit more now, same with Saint Snow that actually developed far more than Aqours did during the entirety of two seasons.  I didn\'t care about them in the first season but now they were more interesting than the main idol group for me. Something actually happened for them and they got over it.Dia, my favorite, was also developed a bit, but in direction that I didn\'t like that much, she is now some sort of meme factory like Mari or Yoshiko/Yohane- Bzzzt- that\'s not the way to go.I honestly didn\'t like this ""bzzzt""- thing, it was not needed, it reduced Dia to one meme-character. She was actually a good character, responsible, proud and bit of a perfectionist type, loving but strict big sister, president of student council, traditional but little too uptight. Sure she was a sort of the joke in the first season too, her secret love for school idols was not the thing in the game etc., but this ""Bzzzt""- thing feels like she was replaced with a meme button this season.Aqours had so much potential, but I feel like this season failed to use it to make characters more interesting. I play Love Live SIF game and I feel like most characters are much better in the game- they are deeper and more interesting than their anime versions that tells a lot since they mainly just say same things when you tap them.  And you still learn to love them more.Story 5: Very poor continuation for Aqours. Spoiler: they win Love Live.... which happens offscreen (because they think you are more interested in Chika\'s thoughts obviously, too bad they are boring) Spoiler 2: Their school is still not going to be saved. This was actually a good thing, it would\'ve been useless repetition of the same plot if the school would\'ve been saved by school idols again. But the way this plot point is done is not really good. Resolution takes so long and all that angst for the loss of Uranohoshi school is taken so far I don\'t care anymore. Yeah it\'s sad. Let\'s mourn it a few episodes more it\'s not boring at all. Bzzzt wrong answer it IS boring.Art 8: This anime sure looks good, visuals for the songs and all, that is not an issue.Sound 8: This is not an issue either. Songs and voice acting are strong points. Some VA:s in Aqours are very talented. I especially want to praise Aika Kobayashi, for her voice work as Yoshiko and Yohane. She has these two different voices and she uses them so well. No problems with singing or acting, not complaining about that. This is still good and some songs are my favorites like My Mai Tonight.Characters 5 : Aqours cast is perhaps even better than Muse in some ways, but this season didn\'t use it well. We mostly focus on Chika (sighs), a bit on Kurosawa sisters, some Riko and some Yoshiko. Mari does some things as well as Kanan but I don\'t remember anything special about them- they just are there. Same with Hanamaru, she is there and her home at the temple is shown, but I don\'t remember any focus being on her. I think that most seriously neglected character is You who is on the background but completely forgotten. Her jealousy of Chika and Riko was the source of drama in the first season but now that is dropped and instead there is useless drama between Chika and school, Chika and School idols, Chika and shining, Chika and mikan oranges. Yuri-baiting has been the best things in this show to be honest so this lack of it this season is very disappointing. We have that one dog episode that makes Yohariko (or Yohariri?) partially canon though. I am not expecting official material to go far with yuri-aspect in show like this, it is left for fans to speculate and find their own shippings (if that is your thing), but I feel like this season was especially boring for those expecting even some girly bonding as there was a lot of that during the first season.We get to see some (pure) sisterly love with Ruby and Leah/Ria of Saint Snow wanting to show to their big sisters that they manage alone as well. That was actually quite touching and those episodes along with the Yohariri dog-episode were only ones that were somewhat entertaining for me.Character development is minimal and mostly non-existent. Chika has to accept that school is going to be closed and that is so very very hard- so hard that she seriously expects people to enlist to their school in the middle of the night minutes before deadline. Hope is good thing to have for sure, but seriously that is pathetic lack of rationality even from this human-shaped mikan orange. Similar plot-holes are numerous this season. Like the episode in which they have to use mikan orange picking monorail (yay- mikan oranges- that is what Chika-chan has instead of personality or brain) to get in to their live show. And we have seen Chika\'s family has a van and yet no one even considers the possibility of using it.... no we have use unconventional method of transportation because mikan oranges in everyone\'s mouth make better memes.Enjoyment 3: This anime was agony to watch at times. Constant face palms made my face (and palms) hurt.Overall 5: Mediocre continuation for pretty promising first season. Mikan oranges were bitter and all that Chika\'s constant shining was so radioactive I fear I got the cancer. Not even Yohane could save me from this School Idol Hell. enough. Things like this and absurd overdone symbolic scenes like Flying van were so cringe-worthy, yes it\'s shiny, it\'s a joke and friendship is magic I get it. Ok that last one was from different franchise... my mistake.Sure Love Live has always been about cute girls doing cute things with unnecessary drama. Maybe it was just that my personal quota of shiny school idols was filled and there was nothing wrong with this season of Love Live. But I think that style was also changed a bit. It was too damn serious at times, somehow slow and  boring and jokes were not that great either. Stories were boring but overly dramatic making them extremely cheesy and awkward. Many times they also lacked common sense making plot holes shine brighter than school idols.Sure there were good things as well. Loved the episode with the dog, sure it was a filler but it actually developed relationship of Yoshiko and Riko, or Yohane and Riri. Saint Snow episodes also developed Ruby a bit and I like her a bit more now, same with Saint Snow that actually developed far more than Aqours did during the entirety of two seasons.  I didn\'t care about them in the first season but now they were more interesting than the main idol group for me. Something actually happened for them and they got over it.Dia, my favorite, was also developed a bit, but in direction that I didn\'t like that much, she is now some sort of meme factory like Mari or Yoshiko/Yohane- Bzzzt- that\'s not the way to go.I honestly didn\'t like this ""bzzzt""- thing, it was not needed, it reduced Dia to one meme-character. She was actually a good character, responsible, proud and bit of a perfectionist type, loving but strict big sister, president of student council, traditional but little too uptight. Sure she was a sort of the joke in the first season too, her secret love for school idols was not the thing in the game etc., but this ""Bzzzt""- thing feels like she was replaced with a meme button this season.Aqours had so much potential, but I feel like this season failed to use it to make characters more interesting. I play Love Live SIF game and I feel like most characters are much better in the game- they are deeper and more interesting than their anime versions that tells a lot since they mainly just say same things when you tap them.  And you still learn to love them more.Story 5: Very poor continuation for Aqours. Spoiler: they win Love Live.... which happens offscreen (because they think you are more interested in Chika\'s thoughts obviously, too bad they are boring) Spoiler 2: Their school is still not going to be saved. This was actually a good thing, it would\'ve been useless repetition of the same plot if the school would\'ve been saved by school idols again. But the way this plot point is done is not really good. Resolution takes so long and all that angst for the loss of Uranohoshi school is taken so far I don\'t care anymore. Yeah it\'s sad. Let\'s mourn it a few episodes more it\'s not boring at all. Bzzzt wrong answer it IS boring.Art 8: This anime sure looks good, visuals for the songs and all, that is not an issue.Sound 8: This is not an issue either. Songs and voice acting are strong points. Some VA:s in Aqours are very talented. I especially want to praise Aika Kobayashi, for her voice work as Yoshiko and Yohane. She has these two different voices and she uses them so well. No problems with singing or acting, not complaining about that. This is still good and some songs are my favorites like My Mai Tonight.Characters 5 : Aqours cast is perhaps even better than Muse in some ways, but this season didn\'t use it well. We mostly focus on Chika (sighs), a bit on Kurosawa sisters, some Riko and some Yoshiko. Mari does some things as well as Kanan but I don\'t remember anything special about them- they just are there. Same with Hanamaru, she is there and her home at the temple is shown, but I don\'t remember any focus being on her. I think that most seriously neglected character is You who is on the background but completely forgotten. Her jealousy of Chika and Riko was the source of drama in the first season but now that is dropped and instead there is useless drama between Chika and school, Chika and School idols, Chika and shining, Chika and mikan oranges. Yuri-baiting has been the best things in this show to be honest so this lack of it this season is very disappointing. We have that one dog episode that makes Yohariko (or Yohariri?) partially canon though. I am not expecting official material to go far with yuri-aspect in show like this, it is left for fans to speculate and find their own shippings (if that is your thing), but I feel like this season was especially boring for those expecting even some girly bonding as there was a lot of that during the first season.We get to see some (pure) sisterly love with Ruby and Leah/Ria of Saint Snow wanting to show to their big sisters that they manage alone as well. That was actually quite touching and those episodes along with the Yohariri dog-episode were only ones that were somewhat entertaining for me.Character development is minimal and mostly non-existent. Chika has to accept that school is going to be closed and that is so very very hard- so hard that she seriously expects people to enlist to their school in the middle of the night minutes before deadline. Hope is good thing to have for sure, but seriously that is pathetic lack of rationality even from this human-shaped mikan orange. Similar plot-holes are numerous this season. Like the episode in which they have to use mikan orange picking monorail (yay- mikan oranges- that is what Chika-chan has instead of personality or brain) to get in to their live show. And we have seen Chika\'s family has a van and yet no one even considers the possibility of using it.... no we have use unconventional method of transportation because mikan oranges in everyone\'s mouth make better memes.Enjoyment 3: This anime was agony to watch at times. Constant face palms made my face (and palms) hurt.Overall 5: Mediocre continuation for pretty promising first season. Mikan oranges were bitter and all that Chika\'s constant shining was so radioactive I fear I got the cancer. Not even Yohane could save me from this School Idol Hell.', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)Each sunrise brings sunshine. But, eventually, that sunshine must give way to a sunset.The same similarly goes for Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season, a metaphorical sunset for the school-idol group Aquors and their hard-fought journey. While it does not sing nearly as loudly or as proudly as its prequel, a few rays of hope sneak in nonetheless.STORYSunshine 2 (as it will be nicknamed from here on out) picks up almost right after Sunshine 1. The group still has its sights set on saving their school, banding together anew to tackle the Love Live gauntlet again....Not as separate ladies but as a unified unit with a more-than-zero mentality.Having addressed its predecessor and its influence – in a thematic sense no less – within the prior season, this season attempts to carve a name out for itself and nobody else. Indeed, mentions, references, or allusions to the famous Greek-lettered group are practically non-existent (if not missing entirely). In doing so, the show breaks away from that looming glare of “they aren’t like them” and moves towards a proper stance of “they aren’t like them.”This subtle difference appears as Sunshine 2 basks in slice-of-life goodness. Several episodes aim to highlight the quirks and the challenges of the girls in a less dramatic manner, such as episode four with Dia wanting to grow closer with the younger members or episode five with the doggy dispute between Yoshino and Riko.Not that the series has never had its fair share of this type of content. However, these events align much more with exploring these characters and their situations rather than going for introductions or resemblances (which its first season already did).Key to the Love-Live formula, Sunshine 2 also incorporates those team-related aspects. They collaborate to write songs. They stick with each other during melancholic happenings. They go on a road trip that solidifies their fortitude (and defies the laws of physics). Chika, Riko, You, Yoshiko, Hanamaru, Ruby, Kanan, Dia, and Mari may be a bunch of individuals, but, when together as one, this season proves they are Aquors first and foremost.This last season also champions the same atmosphere, making sure not to lose sight of its Love Live origins outright. The mood of the anime maintains that comedic angle as always, and the ultra-optimism in-between, while maybe overbearing at times, continues to lend itself well to an uplifting experience.But the narrative overall is a downgrade. Where their beginning is mired with loss and difficulty, their ending here stands in stark contrast as a meteoric rise to the top ensues. Granted, the Love Live spectacle itself isn’t really the point of the story being told, especially in this instance where it represents a spiritual win for all involved. Still, a weakened thematic presence and this missing drama reduces impact in the story.Sunshine 2 tries to make up for that easier rise with its increased focus on the threat of the school closing, but it doesn’t always come through. This dilemma can sometimes get lost amidst its other interpersonal scenes, and their vehement need to keep it around isn’t exactly quantified or justified besides the notion of memories and attachment. Traits the audience do not see much of let alone can relate to.To its credit, though, the bittersweet direction is interesting, both because of this franchise’s inherent optimism and because it once again chooses to move away from those that came before it. Thus, despite those narrative troubles, Aquors’s journey concludes in solid-enough fashion.ART & ANIMATIONThe interim between this season and the previous season is negligible, so the artistic vision for this next iteration remains practically the same. So, to keep it short and sweet, this sameness is a welcome return to likable form.The proof is in the performance. For instance, the character designs remain collectively cute yet individually distinct among the lot. Their musical attire takes on a colorful and charismatic look per usual. Choreography for their dances is still easy to follow (CG or otherwise). Increased actual animation highlight the fun in their actions. Expressions contort into hilarious responses.Sunshine 2 fails to have its settings and backgrounds reach the same level as these other visual elements, but that’s perhaps expected since (to reiterate) the artistic direction has been carried over into this sequel season. That also means that it reaches the same level of strength as before, so it’s certainly not a major problem.CHARACTERSIn Sunshine 1, establishing the characters meant exploring their reasons and their struggles before joining on as an official member. Here in Sunshine 2, the anime explores other conflicts surrounding the ladies, but it also has a much tougher time juggling them in conjunction with the plot.A few characters certainly have their moments. Ruby receives a large amount of attention as her relationship with Dia, her older sister, becomes a point of contention regarding maturity and “moving on” later in the season. The anime steps it up another level when it draws parallels between them and the sister duo of Saint Snow. And Chika herself earns some time as the prospect of failure challenges her determination and her resolve (in flip-like motion) not only for the sake of the rest of Aquors but also for her own sake, too.Yet some characters seem woefully left out: Hanamaru, You, and Mari come to mind first. Phrasing it obtusely, they’re there but not there. Hanamaru seems reserved for comedic relief only. You sticks with mostly a supportive role. And Mari exists as the arbiter of the closing school and not much else. Arguably speaking, these characters had their problems already taken care of in Sunshine 1, but so did everyone, so it feels odd to leave a sizable chunk of the cast on the sidelines.Sunshine 2 gets back on track when it enlarges the scope from their singular characters to the intrateam dynamic. For example, third-years Mari, Kanan, and Dia (Dia, as can be gleaned from this analysis, appears to be around the most) acknowledge their separation after graduation but likewise know that, at least in their hearts, they’ll be together forever.More generally, they rally around each other as a group, solidifying their camaraderie as their shared reams become a reality. It happens a lot. Back in episode three, they initially split up to take care of two back-to-back events but eventually realize that their strength derives from their collective. Even the smaller pillow-fight scene before the big night in episode twelve helps to highlight the friendships they have fostered over the course of their whole adventure.Yet other dynamics hit speedbumps as well. Chika and Riko’s relationship, despite being so vital in the first season, fizzles out to some extent. And, despite being around one another for so long now, the ladies rarely cross party lines, sticking with their year’s internal group for the most part rather than crossing over, missing out on jokes and possible bonds as a result.In the end, Sunshine 2 simply doesn’t have as much to say about Aquors. Be it because of the strife they already went through last season or this season’s failure to really include everyone in the festivities, it leaves the nine girls in a precarious position.MUSIC & SOUNDPer usual, the various parts of the audio within a music-centric anime like Sunshine 2 are held to a slightly higher standard. Unfortunately, this season succumbs to a middling rendition once again.The opening track, “Mirai no Bokura wa Shitteru yo”, has a similarly grand feel as last time, using bells, drums, pianos, and other brass instruments. But the first half or so of the song misses out on catchiness and intrigue as the buildup meanders. However, the second half swoops in with tons of passion as the vocals soar with that mandatory optimism.As for “Yuuki wa Doko ni? Kimi no Mune ni!”, this new ending track follows suit as well in a negative fashion. It’s an okay track with more of a fantastical feel, a neat little lyrical “reverb” part near the end, and many different takes done by different members of the cast. Sadly, though, okay just doesn’t cut it.Especially so when the insert songs of Sunshine 2, at least a couple of them, demonstrate maturity and prowess in both the song writing and the musicality. A special shout-out goes to one such song: “Awaken the power”. While ironically not an exclusively Aquors song, it stands as one of the best the whole franchise has put together thanks to its changes in pacing, instrumentation, and vocal delivery.Moving on, the original soundtrack also starts to grow on the listener. It was already pretty swell, but its main motif and poignant arrangement, found throughout several tracks, elicits even more emotion, either because the series is coming to a close itself or it has been lightly patting the audience on the back for the past twelve (twenty-four in total) episodes now.And the voice-acting performances remain passable in execution. The women behind Aquors sound more comfortable in their roles when compared to the first season, and their experience in talking and singing moves ahead a bit. Again, while nothing special, their relative newbie status and their commitment to these quirky personalities deserves some props within Sunshine 2 for sure.ENJOYMENTI greatly liked the first season, so I selfishly expected the same here. It didn’t quite reach that same level of entertainment, but I can’t lie and say I didn’t find myself laughing or smiling or cheering during its run.My favorite characters Yoshiko and Hanamaru were in full force with their silliness and their reactions. Sometimes they would team up for duo hilarity, and I liked them all the better for it. Kanan, one of my other favorites, wasn’t as prominent, but her “hug” line as she got scared of the dark was too cute to forget.Of course, I still liked the rest of the cast as well. Riko dealing with her fears. Ruby and her “Rubesty!” catchphrase. Mari’s frequent English usage. You with her saluting as always. And Chika leading with happiness aplenty. Maybe oversaturation occurs with their signature jokes, such as Dia’s “wrong-answer” buzzing and definitely Yoshiko’s “It’s Yohane!” response. Nonetheless, they were all once again a likable troupe of idols who not only tried to the best of their ability but also created a heartwarming environment whatever they happened to be doing.Lastly, the performances were often a spectacle as always. The meanings behind them and the concert-esque structure. So many colors and formations. So much winking and hand flourishing. Emotions for days. I’m a huge metalhead (e.g., black metal, death metal, and each subgenre therein), but I found myself grabbed by their setpieces for the last time.And so, this chapter of the franchise concludes (save for whatever other films and song-releases they have on the horizon; announced or otherwise). It hasn’t been the most perfect or sensational follow-up to a beloved series, but this second season – and indeed this entire second iteration – has been a respectable outing regardless. I look forward to seeing where the (inevitable?) third iteration goes next.Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season waves goodbye to Aquors but gives them a solid farewell tribute in the process. While most aspects of this season do not live up to the previous prequel, its unconventional plot direction, its nice production values, and its strong sense of entertainment make up for some of the woes in its character writing. But no worries. There’s always another sunrise right around the corner.SUMMARYStory: Fine, a bittersweet ending, slice-of-life segments, and the focus on group activities compete against missing narrative nuance and weak dramaArt & Animation: Good, following the footsteps of its immediate ancestor, the visuals alight with cool choreography for the dances, noticeable movement, and cute designsCharacters: Bad, while specific characters and dynamics vouch for some of the ladies, the cast members have a hard time either being relevant or establishing relationships for most of this finaleMusic & Sound: Fine, the OP and the ED are another step down when compared to before, but the insert songs, the OST, and the VA performances do not go the same way without a fightEnjoyment: Good, hilarious still, engaging in its routines, and a respectable sendoff of this second taleFinal Score: 5/10 Not as separate ladies but as a unified unit with a more-than-zero mentality.Having addressed its predecessor and its influence – in a thematic sense no less – within the prior season, this season attempts to carve a name out for itself and nobody else.

Sunshine season one was a MASTERPIECE, I felt like that\'s how you should end a first season. I was so excited I binged the second season, but around the halfway point, the whole the school is closing down plot didn\'t really phase me anymore.What I loved about the original series was I got a sense of WHY the girls loved their school to death and what saving it meant to them. However with the second season of sunshine, the only reason...I could see everyone wanting to save the school was because they all met there. Now that\'s not a bad reason why, but since the girls always hanged out together and had a good amount of chances to save the school, I didn\'t get why they were so upset like they didn\'t make any progress or do anything at all. With mari, dia and kanan, I totally get why they felt so bad they couldn\'t save the school, they had the authority and some influence in the school, but for the first and second years, they could still ALL go to school together.I love yohane and riko the most but what uspet me was instead of yohane actually improving as a character she remained the same. I expected once she talked to riko about why she had her complex and continues to use it, she\'d either stop doing it as much or find some compromise with it but instead she just embraced it more for some odd reason. It felt like some characters had some development while others remained the same, it only bugged me because we had literally a whole segment where everyone said how being an idol changed them.Ever since I finished sunshine season two, I\'ve been hooked on the mobile game. Aquors has such good music, it always brightens my mood, my favorite song have to be zero to one, it really hits home. I really enjoyed season two of my new favorite franchise, but every time I think of the ending, I don\'t feel anything. I wanted to feel sad and excited for the movie based on the final episode but I had more of an ""oh, it\'s over now? mkay"" moment instead. Sunshine was a bright and sunny day then all of a sudden it became party cloudy with a high chance of rain for me, season one was everything I wanted. Season two felt like it pulled on my heartstrings a little too much for my taste. I could see everyone wanting to save the school was because they all met there.

It only took some reflection a few months later to realize how biased i am towards the LL franchise just because I adore the music. This show, especially this season, is bad. Just bad. It tries to be something it's not just because it feels as if it must live up to the original LLSIP. The original truly acts like a shackle to this new installment. In many ways, Sunshine trying to go out of its way to feel different from the original comes off as a reskinned idea, or simply...uninspired. But enough about the first series, this show is bad on its own. It hits some fine emotional points in the first half, but my god that second half. I am truly convinced, the writers came up with the plot as they went on. It had no direction. Nothing served as thematic presence on its own, nor did it work to build up anything by itself. Most of the time, it felt like it was being emotional, just for the sake of being emotional. Love live sunshine season 2, is just kinda shit and I'll probably watch it again someday OMEGALUL uninspired. But enough about the first series, this show is bad on its own.

Love live sunshine season 2, is just kinda shit and I'll probably watch it again someday OMEGALUL"", ""This is my first review so a few notes:•\tWill contain LIGHT SPOILERS (unrelated to the main plot or indirect as much as possible)•\tI don’t know much shit about analytically reviewing a show so if it’s a BUU BUU DESU WA feel free to tell me.•\tNot every point I made came from me. I didn’t have a SHINY revalation to suddenly think of such ideas. This is a disclaimer, so to speak.Got through the cringe? Well there’s more:Love Live is [the only] one of those shows for me to have such mixed opinions of. Basically it is a regular cute-girls-doing-cute-things show but *WITH DRAMA*. Now explaining...how I am attached to this franchise would be too long and too hard, so to summarize: It started as a somewhat guilty pleasure which then developed into something I unironically adore. So it wouldn’t be a surprise that when this season came out I stayed until midnight just to see the latest episode. It was a fun ride, but personal enjoyment alone doesn't make a series great.STORY:From the beginning of ‘Love Live! Sunshine!!’ , Aqours had a goal –“ to shine”. With how the story plays out, I can say they did. They even shined brighter than their predecessor, μ's. The way the series was handled is an improvement over the original. How they did it is through focusing and expanding on plot points that were pretty much ‘extras’ in the original School Idol Project. That’s not the only thing though. The most notable improvement you can see in the story is the change in one major aspect of the show. This change is mostly the reason that differentiates it from the original. But for something that is the defining aspect of the show, it had dragged on for too long. It is special, just not when its repeatedly shoved into your face until the end.Now I did say Aqours achieved their goal to shine, but not actually entirely. Aqours’s main goal is really to “find their OWN radiance.” This is the series’ biggest flaw. It stops at improvement. It doesn’t go for anything new. I can understand that it wouldn’t be Love Live if did do so, but the premise, setting and charcters were already enough for that. Yet they just had to copy the plot and only decided change some aspects to make it seem new. Let me tell you, being new and being different are two separate things. LLS just settled on being a twist from the original. Aqours may have shined brighter, but the radiance didn’t start from them.ART:Being a popular franchise in Japan, you can expect this to be high-budget. So with the privilege of having high production value, does the art really deliver? Yes and No. It was used where it mattered, and it really shows in the final product – from the CG, backgrounds(which perfectly resemble their real-life counterparts) and even the characters themselves. Where it does fail though is when the scenes don’t “matter” enough—the comedy and slice of life moments. Basically, if the scene is meaningful or dramatic, it is a pleasure for the eyes. If not, its crappy to the point that even memes were made out of it.SOUND:Probably the best thing about to come out of LLS 2 are the songs. It’s amazing when an OP and ED can add so much to the story itself. The OP, with a more serious tone, prepares you for what’s going to happen and the ED gives you the theme of the show with the feelings of the characters themselves. As for the insert songs, they are the culmination of the growth of Love Live as a franchise. Ever since SIP the songs were already diverging from the normal idol-type songs. It is only in this season of Love Live that the songs are so diverse while also, again, meaningful and adding to the narrative.But if the OP, ED or insert songs are not your thing, there is always the soundtrack for the shows. This includes, but is not limited to: melodramatic piano, “ZURAAAAA”, and “Dakara, Yohane yo!” There is, sadly,  a decrease in “Shiny!” and “Buu Buu Desu Wa!” however that is made up for by lots and lots of “PIGIII!1!!1!” and “Kagayaiteru” to ensure there is never a dull moment throughout the show.CHARACTERS:It wouldn’t be Aqours without its members, and it wouldn’t be Love Live without character-specific episodes. Yes, the franchise still suffers from giving a certain character a certain episode in order to highlight her charm and to create “character development”. But how do they showcase a character exactly? It’s really simple, honestly. First, you got to think of a catchphrase or a pose for her. Second, you basically turn her into a living meme. And when its finally her time to take the spotlight; you create a new problem totally unrelated to her character, make a whole episode revolving around it to show ‘development’ , then not actually fixing it by the end…ok, maybe that last part was pointed towards a specific character [ I can’t help it if it’s one of my best girls , can I? ]For a serious answer though, Aqours both as a group and each individual member(for better or worse) have come far since the first season. Of course, the character-specific episode remains, but some of it did help to advance the plot. The main problem is actually how the characters’ screentimes were balanced. For a show which aimed to promote each and every single girl, it failed to do so. Some were given too much screentime while others were barely noticeable throughout the season. I mean, a scene where the main character is chasing a non-existent gift could better be used for her best friend who was only showing up when giving a salute.THEME:This is something I personally want to add since it is also what gives Love Live! Sunshine!! its identity. This is something SIP lacked, or atleast didn’t give focus to. THIS is what allowed everything—story, music, character— to connect to the viewer. At least for me it did. Its best to watch and interpret yourself, but if I had to put it in a few words:Step! ZERO to ONEENJOYMENT & VERDICT:As a fan, there is no way I wouldn’t enjoy it. Nothing else to say there. I love it regardless of my viewing experience and my opinions on it. It was a fun, Thrilling One Way ride from start until the end. A solid 98/100 for me.As for my verdict on the series, all I can say is that it is an improvement. If you look at it as the successor to μ's, it would be an 8/10. If you look at it as a series in general, it is a 7/10. Why? The reason why LLS is good is because it gets compared to SIP. If you look at it as just Love Live! In general, flaws will definitely be seen.So is it worth a watch? Despite me shitting on it, YES. It is a show full of WONDERFUL STORIES and wonderful characters. It has beautiful character design with a story that is actually given an ending within only 2 seasons. But most of all, its a fucking lovable cancer show. If you appreciate the show for what even if at times it is devoid of logic, you’re gonna have an enjoyable experience.What are you waiting for?

Hop on this HAPPY PARTY TRAIN of hype and enter Idol Hell."", 'Love Live: Sunshine is an okay series but a disappointing follow-up, and its main issue is that it\'s much too derivative of the original series. While watching, I couldn\'t help but think about all the things that could have been done to make this a much more interesting sequel.There are many good things about this series, of course. Visually, it looks much better than the original. I also enjoyed the character moments very much, my favorite being those focused on Ruby and Dia. During the first season I was worried that the characters might be too gimmicky and shallow, but most of them developed pretty...nicely in the second season. I even ended up having some empathy for Yoshiko, who started off as my least favorite.The main problem with Sunshine, as stated before, is that it follows the formula set by the first series too closely, which results in a story that\'s much weaker than the original series. I would have enjoyed Sunshine much more if it focused more on the struggle of being recognized after the success of μ\'s instead of retreading the same ground for most of the series. Sunshine ends up feeling like a story with a beginning and end but not much of a middle, which deflates a lot of the impact at the end of the series. Once I got to the end, I wasn\'t really emotionally invested as much as I was wondering, ""Is this really it?"". It felt as if I had skipped over the entire process of getting there.I\'m also disappointed because this sets a precedent for future installments in this franchise. I would like to see Love Live become a more varied and interesting franchise, but Sunshine shows me that the show\'s creators are very hesitant to deviate from the formula set by the first series.tl;dr: If you liked Love Live for the story, you won\'t like Sunshine very much.

Majo Minarai wo Sagashite,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39585/Majo_Minarai_wo_Sagashite,"['For the 20th anniversary of the release of the original TV series, this movie was made. It is not part of the series, but it is somewhat related. The three protagonists of the movie watched the Doremi franchise when they were kids, but even after becoming adults the TV show still holds a special place in their hearts.If you want to watch this movie or are curious about it, there is a chance you have seen the TV series. To those, I warn: this story is not about the magical girls. It is about being inspired by the Doremi series. The movie is through and...through about the three protagonists: Mire, Reika, and Sora. The trio is very well fleshed out and developed in the movie. They are completely different young women who by coincidence meet and bond once they discover they are all big fans of Ojamajo Doremi.Initially I was a bit disappointed with the movie since the movie occasionally hints that the magical girls might appear, but we must realize that it has been 15 years since the ending of the last season of the TV series. This movie was made for everyone. For those who have never seen the show and maybe make them curious about it. And for the ones who did watch it a long time ago (or maybe recently), it is easy to connect to the trio of protagonists since you can easily see the philosophy of the show incorporated into them. We see how much they still love the show despite so many years have gone by.Overall, it is a decent movie that can be seen by anyone. Despite the absence of a magical setting, the movie really captures the incantation and the storytelling of such a remarkable TV show for kids. through about the three protagonists: Mire, Reika, and Sora.

Despite the absence of a magical setting, the movie really captures the incantation and the storytelling of such a remarkable TV show for kids.', 'Whoa. No, seriously, whoa. Based on what I read about this movie, I had a feeling it would be good on its own merits, but after finally seeing it...damn. This movie seriously blew my mind in all the best ways possible. I admit, my history with Ojamajo Doremi is rather spotty. I remember seeing pictures of the characters and fansites way back when I was a kid, and later, I saw the 4Kids dub of the first 26 episodes when it first aired, and then it got cancelled. I heard the rest of it was dubbed and streamed on 4Kids\' website, but I never sought...it out. I\'ve only seen two episodes of the first season in Japanese, and one of the movies, and that\'s it. I know, I really need to watch the whole series one of these days, as I hear nothing but good things about it. So when I heard a new movie celebrating Doremi\'s 20th anniversary was coming out, and supposedly not based on any of the shows, I decided to check it out thanks to this review of it. Considering all the good things I heard about the original show, I thought I\'d at least give this movie a try, since it\'s both filled with references to the show and newbie-friendly for anyone who hasn\'t seen it. What I honestly did not expect was for it to be absolutely one of the sweetest, most wholesome, most heartwarming, and most heartwrenching movies I\'ve ever seen. In fact, I\'m declaring this the best movie that ever came out in 2020!Now, for any Doremi fans expecting this to be a new movie about the girls, you\'re out of luck. It\'s not about fighting an evil queen, there\'s literally no magic at all, and the girls we\'ve come to know and love aren\'t the focus of the movie. This is because Ojamajo Doremi, in this movie, is a show that the three main characters watched and are fans of. Kind of like how Digimon Tamers made the first and second seasons into a show the main kids in that show watch. Anyway, the story centers on three very different women, living very different lives, and having to deal with various problems. Reika is a young woman trying to make ends meet and get into college, but is stuck in part-time jobs, her lazy boyfriend is constantly stealing her hard-earned money, and she herself is reeling from her family\'s divorce. Sora, a college student, is struggling with training to become a teacher, as she got too caught up in trying to help a special needs child, and begins to question whether she\'s fit to be a teacher. Mire works at a trade company, but is constantly belittled and degraded by her bosses for being a woman and for speaking her mind, and they waste no time taking all the credit for her achievements. The three find themselves meeting at a real life location used in their favorite show, and after finding out they\'re all fans of the Doremi anime, they decide to indulge in some anime tourism in order to find reprieve from their troubled lives and find solace in each other\'s company. It becomes an experience that the three of them will never forget.For anyone wondering, although the movie is filled to the brim with references to the show and its characters, you don\'t need to have seen the show in order to enjoy this movie, thankfully. The movie tells its own original story about three completely new characters, all adults, and how they become friends through their shared love of their favorite children\'s show, and the hardships they face and overcome along the way. Basically, it\'s a low-key, slice-of-life road trip anime movie...and honestly, I really like this approach, as not only does it allow the movie to stand as its own entity without relying too much on the Doremi brand, so that it doesn\'t alienate newcomers, it also presents relatable conflicts and storylines that people in positions similar to the main trio can sympathize with. Even without the Doremi connection, this is a movie about the friendships you forge through shared passions and helping each other. The same story can be told using nearly any other anime one can find, but it\'s often more poignant when children\'s shows are involved. I mean, who hasn\'t befriended someone because they liked the same TV show? That\'s basically how I tried forging friendships as a kid, and I still do to this day! It really hits home whether you\'re into Ojamajo Doremi or not, and that kind of universal appeal is just amazing to me.A lot of animation staff from the original series returned to make this movie, and although I haven\'t seen much of the series, I can recognize it\'s animation style from miles away, and based on stuff the staff worked on after this, such as Heartcatch Pretty Cure, it\'s very easy to recognize. Large, sparkly eyes, exaggerated cartoony expressions and movements for comedic scenes, zany animation, fluid and smooth movement, thick linework, all of it is on display here, and it surprisingly fits the movie\'s overall tone quite well. Animation isn\'t always about having great artwork or having the biggest budget, but being able to bring the characters to life, and I think the animators who worked on this pulled that off wonderfully. It helps that the background art is very pleasing to the eyes, filled to the brim with color and detail, and consistently excellent all around. The soundtrack is no slouch either, with no shortage of great tunes and a whole variety of instruments like saxophones, oboes, full on-orchestras, and every single piece of background music absolutely rocked. Also, the movie contains a much slower, more melancholy version of the first TV anime\'s opening theme, ""Ojamajo Carnival!!"" and the TV version is much more peppy, fast paced, squeaky, and akin to stuff you\'d see on a Saturday morning cartoon. Honestly, I\'m probably going to commit blasphemy for saying this, but...I actually like the movie\'s version of it better than the original, because I found the original to be way too obnoxious for my liking. The movie\'s slower, low-key version with its acoustic guitar, lovely piano tunes, and softer vocals is more my jam. Sorry!!Of course, the heart and soul of this movie comes from the characters, especially the main trio. Not gonna lie, I love all these precious beans. Every single one of them is perfectly likeable and three-dimensional even with the movie\'s short run time, all displaying their strengths, flaws, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and the things that make them who they are. They\'re a fun bunch with their own eclectic personalities and different approaches to life, making them the kind of people you know you want to root for. Even the minor characters they run into have more to them than just one character trait, with plenty of subtle nuances to their characters that make them stand out from the usual archetypes associated with them. The fun in the movie comes from seeing how these characters deal with and overcome the various adversaries that make up the roadblocks in their lives, and seeing them help each other through their hard times. Also, seeing Mire judo-throw Reika\'s awful boyfriend and tell him off was satisfying as hell. Best girl right there. Everything from the way these girls carry themselves to how they connect over their shared love of Ojamajo Doremi makes them all feel like people, their actions throughout the story are realistic, and the movie really wastes no time in showing what these girls are like, actually giving you good reasons to care about them. I can wholeheartedly say that Looking For Magical Doremi did a bang-up job in making me care about this loveable trio, and I want all three of them to be happy!With all the praises I\'m singing for this movie though, as far as flaws go, I can really only find two, and IMHO, they\'re pretty inconsequential. One is that Mire and Reika get into an argument about how the latter dealt with a recent event, and while I can understand where the other girls were coming from, I don\'t think they should have tried to paint Mire as completely in the wrong about what she said to Reika, because she\'s actually right. Could she have said what she said more delicately? Sure, but Mire is technically right about Reika\'s inaction during said event, and in some way, Reika did have a right to be told the truth. The second one is the scene at the very very end, just before the credits, as it comes across as a little too magical for an otherwise grounded story. But that\'s really it in terms of drawbacks, and even then, they didn\'t kill my enjoyment of the movie one bit. Actual hardcore fans of the Doremi franchise are bound to take issue with how different this movie is compared to the other ones, especially with it not being about the Doremi girls at all, and I can understand where they\'d be coming from. I did read that the creators did originally want the movie to be about the 20-year-old versions of the Doremi girls finding a time capsule that they buried during their graduation, but had concerns that doing that would alienate viewers who weren\'t in that generation and figured the best way to go would be to appeal to a more general audience than just Doremi fans, so that newcomers could have an easier time watching the movie without feeling lost, if they hadn\'t watched the show. I personally think this was a good decision on their part, because it helps the movie stand on its own without relying too much on simply cashing in on the nostalgia, something other movies have a hard time doing. Plus, the story of the original Doremi girls is over, and they don\'t really need to overstay their welcome. Who says you can\'t try something new once in a while?Whether you\'re a fan of Ojamajo Doremi or not, this is an absolutely amazing and wonderful movie that really deserves more love. Please watch it!! it out. I\'ve only seen two episodes of the first season in Japanese, and one of the movies, and that\'s it. I know, I really need to watch the whole series one of these days, as I hear nothing but good things about it.

Sorry!!Of course, the heart and soul of this movie comes from the characters, especially the main trio. Not gonna lie, I love all these precious beans. Every single one of them is perfectly likeable and three-dimensional even with the movie\'s short run time, all displaying their strengths, flaws, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and the things that make them who they are. They\'re a fun bunch with their own eclectic personalities and different approaches to life, making them the kind of people you know you want to root for. Even the minor characters they run into have more to them than just one character trait, with plenty of subtle nuances to their characters that make them stand out from the usual archetypes associated with them. The fun in the movie comes from seeing how these characters deal with and overcome the various adversaries that make up the roadblocks in their lives, and seeing them help each other through their hard times. Also, seeing Mire judo-throw Reika\'s awful boyfriend and tell him off was satisfying as hell. Best girl right there. Everything from the way these girls carry themselves to how they connect over their shared love of Ojamajo Doremi makes them all feel like people, their actions throughout the story are realistic, and the movie really wastes no time in showing what these girls are like, actually giving you good reasons to care about them. I can wholeheartedly say that Looking For Magical Doremi did a bang-up job in making me care about this loveable trio, and I want all three of them to be happy!With all the praises I\'m singing for this movie though, as far as flaws go, I can really only find two, and IMHO, they\'re pretty inconsequential. One is that Mire and Reika get into an argument about how the latter dealt with a recent event, and while I can understand where the other girls were coming from, I don\'t think they should have tried to paint Mire as completely in the wrong about what she said to Reika, because she\'s actually right. Could she have said what she said more delicately? Sure, but Mire is technically right about Reika\'s inaction during said event, and in some way, Reika did have a right to be told the truth. The second one is the scene at the very very end, just before the credits, as it comes across as a little too magical for an otherwise grounded story. But that\'s really it in terms of drawbacks, and even then, they didn\'t kill my enjoyment of the movie one bit. Actual hardcore fans of the Doremi franchise are bound to take issue with how different this movie is compared to the other ones, especially with it not being about the Doremi girls at all, and I can understand where they\'d be coming from. I did read that the creators did originally want the movie to be about the 20-year-old versions of the Doremi girls finding a time capsule that they buried during their graduation, but had concerns that doing that would alienate viewers who weren\'t in that generation and figured the best way to go would be to appeal to a more general audience than just Doremi fans, so that newcomers could have an easier time watching the movie without feeling lost, if they hadn\'t watched the show. I personally think this was a good decision on their part, because it helps the movie stand on its own without relying too much on simply cashing in on the nostalgia, something other movies have a hard time doing. Plus, the story of the original Doremi girls is over, and they don\'t really need to overstay their welcome. Who says you can\'t try something new once in a while?Whether you\'re a fan of Ojamajo Doremi or not, this is an absolutely amazing and wonderful movie that really deserves more love. Please watch it!!', ""All the best elements of doremi are here, the creators recognised what was good and executed it perfectly. Best anime movie of the decade. Go get drunk and be a magical girl with your friends. If you have seen doremi, you must watch this. If you thought any elements from doremi were good watch this. Am I padding this out because mal requires my review to be longer? Yes, but really all you need are the first 3 sentences here.The music is back, the visual style is back, the writing is back, the themes are back, even the situations with magical stage are back and...for adults who like to get drunk with friends (which was already in the original doremi anyway) but now there's more.

I watched the original first season when it was out on 4Kids.TV and I fell in love with the show. I always dreamed of having a magic wand like them and meet amazing friends. Of course, when you grow up, that magic disappears and you become too caught up in the adult world.This wholesome movie is about three characters who are fans of the original show just like any one of us who watches it when we were young. When those 3 girls met, they instantly became...best friends and decided to go traveling together visiting all of the locations where the anime were featured.

One thing I like about the show is that it reminds you of what its like to be a child, to keep that inner hope and happiness you once had when you were young in order to survive the cold, hard realistic world. Cling onto hope, keep fighting because even though magic may not exist, you can make your own magic. It is a super wholesome anime.

It hit especially hard for me given I had just completed the entirety of Ojamajo Doremi prior to watching this, and the last episode of Dokkaan! is still fresh in my mind.While I do like this film, I don't love it. Visually, I find it's a bit lacklustre for a theatrical film, especially when looking at characters in the backgrounds. That said, I do appreciate the use of music from the show.

Except...not really. The movie has its own benefits and flaws which I attribute mainly to the narrative, which is all over the place, for better or for worse. The first defining feature of the movie is that the OD cast is not the prominent cast, as you\'d expect; instead, we centralize on three Japanese girls, all fans of the eponymous series and from different walks of life, perhaps drawn together by fate or some other mystifying force. The way their stories are set up does leave something to be desired: whenever one girl becomes the focus of the...movie, the other two noticeably melt into the background almost completely, to the point where Nagase is missing for at least one third of the movie. We only see brief glimpses into these girls lives and who they are, and aside from Reika, their lives are largely unknown. The series plays out similar to how you\'d expect an episode of Lucky Star, which is unfortunate: the movie constantly feels the need to assert that it\'s Doremi-related, inserting forced gestures (""Hey, remember when Doremi tripped on these stairs and got bad luck for three years?""). This wouldn\'t be too bad, if it weren\'t for the fact that it was like the show was desperately trying to prove that it belonged to the same franchise as the rest of the series. Having a movie based in this context means a couple things. First of all, it means you not only need to draw the audience to them and become invested, but you need to keep their attention as well. This means you need to have interesting things happen, which the movie unfortunately does not do. Instead, the film plays out like a jumbled-up road trip, the girls stumbling across various sites that appeared in the plot with...not much happening, honestly. The most excitement that really happens is with Yoshizuki, or the girls getting drunk, which oddly happens remarkably often considering it\'s based from a children\'s show.The movie also mentions quite a number of new characters who have very small roles or aren\'t even important to the overall plot whatsoever, some not even appearing on-screen. The core concept of the movie seems to be that the girls\' friendship was drawn together by magic, though as adults it seems to be a combination of both childhood innocence and a sense of immaturity. The movie tries too hard to push the similarities that Reika is similar to Aiko and Nagase to Hadzuki, though they interestingly mix this up by having her use Doremi\'s spell. It\'s a bit difficult to consider this movie as canon and it somewhat feels like the movie just exists in its own canon only using Doremi\'s name to drive its success. Yes, the recipe that friendship is magical and will help you out is very much there. However, there\'s little else related to the series besides the girls, to an extent, being stand-ins for Hadzuki, Aiko, and Doremi.

This review is 100% SPOILER FREE!Wherever Kaguya-sama: Love is War goes, hilarity and havoc ensure. Life is mostly mundane and humdrum; it lies within us to make the most of what we have. Love is War is not an anime about dying (in most cases by Truck-kun) and being reincarnated in a fantasy world of your dreams, or gaining some OP power to whoop that ass of the evil dude. It takes into account the very prosaic lives we live in and turns it into something truly entertaining. Love is War...tries to convey something along the lines “You thought normal life was boring? O KAWAII KOTO”. This OVA, just like the main series, encapsulates that thought and presents it before you in the form of three episodes.This OVA lunges fan-service, bundled with hysterics right onto you, creating the perfect recipe for uproarious humour. Boisterous events and riotous remarks are sprinkled throughout the episodes, leading to a smooth flow of story progression and comedy. The way each scene transitions into the next is well connected.The jocular narrator with a serious voice, like always, is perfectly embroidered into the story, similar to how silk is sewn into the spine of the book, and guides us along with the characters of the story in this OVA.It poses a real challenge to get people interested in ordinary characters, but A-1 Pictures does a brilliant job of bringing out the extraordinary in an otherwise customary school set-up and daily lives. The characters maintain their individual charm in the OVA, Shirogane-his cocky yet amusing behaviour, Kaguya-her inner devilish scheming behind that kawaii face, Chika- her unwitting and innocent view on everything, and Ishigami-his hilarious mood swings from nonchalant to hyper in a few seconds.I’ve seen a few people say they went overboard with the fanservice and all, and even though that's kinda true (I felt a bit that way too), that’s the whole point to an OVA. It’s a place to let free what the producers intended us to see without any restrictions or main plot. It’s there as not a part of the main series, but as a few chill (but extremely hilarious) episodes for us to enjoy.  If you haven’t watched it yet, my personal recommendation is; if you took a shine to Love is War S1 and S2, you’ll get a bang out of the OVA too. Provided you liked the narrating style of the series, and don't have a major problem with fanservice, I’d say go for it and watch this OVA, you won’t be disappointed.V4Watcher out.

The last two seasons are considered to be one of the best rom-coms out there. But in today's OVA you will witness the new side of Love is war....What's new?Love is war OVA is mainly made up of some unpublished stories in manga. So we can expect there will be some new content here. But Folks, you are wrong... let me tell you clearlyIn the volume 1, For the first time, I got to know what's the meaning of ecchi....This first volume delivers a lot of Ecchi moments or else Fan service moments. It's like far more of ecchi and less than hentai. But guys... The comedy never dies in the episode. Ishigami and Our President Shirogane funny comments will bring the funny moments In the episode.This time we got Ai Hayasaka in glasses, A superb fan service scene between Fujiwara and Kaguya.In volume 2 it's about a Ero-book, I like the narration given by President. But still I can say that Ishigami is highlight or MVP. His comedy timing will be amazing....And there's volume three.... kinda parody like Food wars but minimum lewdness or less. It's just a cooking competition between our people.Finally, there's very little plot except in volume 3 but the art is good and the sound and enjoyment are the best where you'll still dream about it (if you are a fan of fujiwara or kaguya)I think if the three volumes are the three episodes, then I completed watching the OVA, it's fun....

It's so not an ecchi show that both seasons had a gag involving Ishigami getting beaten up for sexualizing Chika. So, what are we doing here, with voyeuristic shots of things like Chika's breasts bouncing around as she and Kaguya look for some dropped soap in the girl's locker room showers? Well, we're here because fanservice sells and fans don't care.If you're a fan of this not-ecchi series, then presumably, you like the characters for reasons besides their masturbatory utility. You like them because they're good characters, or in other...words, because they make convincing imitations of real people. Characterization is, after all, the process by which a person is created inside of a narrative context. They might not actually be real, but they're real inside of the fantasyland the show exists in. The 2D Realm. You might not be able to touch them, but they sure~ can~ touch~ you~, or something like that. Anyways you wouldn't want to see Chika get Robert Sylvester Kelly'd by Papa Shirogane, a gross violation of her autonomy like that would make you upset. So why wouldn't you get upset when the show's creators force you to be the one doing the violating, with intrusive camera angles that place you right up in there between Chika's thighs? There's two answers here. The first, more rebellious one, is that you would be upset, and that I'm dumb for assuming that you wouldn't. Ass out of you and me, and all that. In that case, good on you, you make a good Kaguya fan. The other answer is that you don't care about Chika, and that I'm dumb for assuming that you do. You know fully well that Chika would have no issues bringing out the fan for some higher-dimensional ghosts spying on her in the shower, but you don't care. You're fine with being that ghost. If you don't like the characters that much to begin with, then whatever, it's just some ecchi, uhh, I feel bad calling it fanservice since you're not a fan, but you get the idea. If you ARE a fan, but don't care about Chika, well then you're pretty spooky.But here is where I have to give credit where credit is due, and let the fans that don't care off the hook just a little bit for being horny. This is a review for a 5, after all, I'm not gonna browbeat the entire time. Anime titties are pretty cool, and how often do you see them animated at such a high quality? You don't. I mean, Chika's boobs alone had more keyframes than the latest episode of The Seven Deadly Sins. This is some seriously impressive ecchi content. So impressive, that it can apparently make fans forget all the characterization that they had subscribed to going into it.

A lesson of life that is going to get you going for your whole life.The first sketches were the best.

There is no comment further here, the only thing is that the punchline was really predictable, but the execution before that was magnificient. I had the urge to go to my Fakku account and read some quality mangas.Finally the last sketch was fine, maybe an average Kaguya sketch. That doesnt really matter at this point because the first two were peak entertainment and featuring best girl Miko is always a pleasure to watch. The production point were also average or even below average Kaguya, but that doesnt matter eitherIn conclussion, if you like big tits, big asses and some quality art that makes your dick go crazy, watch this.

Volume 3 (Rice bit) was hilarious and found myself laughing (like I did with S1 and S2), but volumes 1-2 are just blatant fan service. Yes, they are making fun of animes/mangas with ecchi/softcore hentai fan service, but I just couldn't find it entertaining, because I was watching this hoping for comedy. Especially when knowing ages of these characters.Voice acting was topnotch as usual though and I liked short Hayasaka cameo we had. Also was great to hear DADDY! DADDY! DO! again.

Well let me start by saying the first half of this OVA is practically hentai. Not to get too specific, but you don\'t want to have this on at a family gathering. Then to make matters worse, the second half is utterly boring and uninteresting.Story:There are two stories in the episode that each take up roughly half the runtime. We begin with the plot of Ishigami and Shirogane looking at explicit magazines and imagining their female friends in lewd scenarios. A good portion...of this plot was really uncomfortable to watch. It was actually shocking to see how far they took this premise and Shirogane really appeared to be out of character. That all being said, comedy-wise, this is the better half of the episode. Both guys have some funny jokes here and there, but you\'ll probably be too busy cringing at the overbearing fan service to appreciate any of it. The second half of the episode is a cooking competition which Kaguya and Shirogane take too far so that they can win each other over with their cooking skills. This plot wound up being rather boring and not very much better than the first half.3/10Sound:Everything in this department is solid. There\'s a section in the cooking portion where Chika has this euphoric awakening- or something, and the sound-work used to convey that was great. And I\'d be remiss not to mention the sounds used to convey... ""breast movement"" are all there and intact. I need to dock one point from the score though, as a certain part that I won\'t spoil used sounds that were kind of disgusting.9/10Animation:Love Is War\'s regular animation quality is all there and looking as great as ever, and just because it made me uncomfortable doesn\'t mean that it wasn\'t well done.9/10Characters:As mentioned prior, Shirogane is strangely out of character for the first plot, and doesn\'t really do enough in the second plot to save himself. As not the biggest Chika or Miko fan, their focus in the second half wasn\'t really my cup of tea. All other characters featured in the OVA act as expected, but Ishigami is really the only one to get any laughs out of me, but as previously stated, that was only during the first half.5/10Overall:Unlike what many other reviews say, I don\'t think it\'s a COMPLETE waste of time to watch this OVA. It isn\'t good by any means and it doesn\'t add anything new to the story, but if you\'re horny, this OVA is for you!

But this, this was just normal fanservice and they exaggerated everything. Completely annoying.Second Part (Darkness 2): 6/10Meh. Nothing much notable about it, I'd say they followed the manga properly in this one, and I don't want to rant about how much I liked the voice acting because it will take forever.Third Part (Cooking Contest): 8/10Yes. This. This is what I've been waiting for. It was the Love is War I was waiting for. And it was fucking beautiful. I have no comments other than the art was a bit off, but that's probably because I was watching low-quality raws, so no complaints from me.I'd say the only good things that came from this adaptation:1) I got to hear the lines in the voice actors/actressess' voice, I live for this.2) Daddy Daddy Do and Kaze ni Fukarete nostalgia.3) Hayasaka in glasses.

I read a salty review on here that was mad about this, but do they understand that ova's are specifically for the fan-service scenes? They're delusional.Moving on to the actual review. This ova was great. Just like the main series, the voice actors went above and beyond, especially the narrator. Furthermore the quality of animation was great. Normally ova's lack the budget and are just still, coloured, manga panels that you could create with PowerPoint. But they genuinely put effort into this anime.What really made it shine was how it called out...the typical fan-service tropes before recreating them.

I can get behind an inside joke.As-long as you have some sense of humour and don't get offended by pictures and boobs, it's a blast.How did Chika get so stacked?"", 'Kaguya-sama: Love is War is an anime and manga series I thoroughly enjoy. I watched the first season at random since it was on Netflix, and watched the second season when it was over so I could binge it, leading to me liking it so much that I read the manga. The manga quickly became one of my favorites, me even giving it a 10/10 score, so I also read all of the spinoffs like We Want to Talk About Kaguya, Doujin-ban, and Shuuchiin Gakuen Nanafushigi. So, when I heard A-1 Pictures was to adapt more of this series into an OVA, I assumed it...would be one of these series, but instead, they decided to adapt the two Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai Darkness chapters. That, and chapter 96 of the manga which is just a fried rice contest.Now, what is Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai Darkness? Well, they are chapters 63.5 and 83.5 of the manga which are just straight up ecchi. They were included in Volume 22 of the manga aside from their original publication, so the people who got the OVA normally will also have access to the original chapters.A-1 Productions is back at it again with their surprisingly top-notch visual style with Kaguya-sama. The motions are fluid and full of personality, and there are animations that you wouldn’t really expect a studio like this to do. An example of this would be in the adaptation of chapter 96, where Miko Iino asks for more rice from Chika and then they have this short little scene of Chika putting more rice on her plate. It’s not a scene that’s really at all important to animate that well, but they still decided to do it. If you liked the direction and visual flair that the previous two anime seasons had, then this one will probably be no different, save for the bountiful ecchi aspects that the original didn’t really have.If there’s anything I love Kaguya-sama for, it’s the comedy, and said comedy all comes from one aspect—the characters. I may be biased because I know what happens in the future and I’ve already read what this OVA covers, but it’s still just as good. All the main cast shine in their own way bringing good jokes to the scene mostly every time, and the comedic effect is enhanced by both the visuals and the sound. From Ishigami and Shirogane in the first two parts, and then the rest of the cast in the last part, they get their own jokes and punchlines that don’t feel out of place. I once read a comment for this series on MyAnimeList that describes this series as “low-brow, high art,” and for this OVA, I can definitely say the same. Comedy is a subjective criteria, so in my subjective opinion, I say it’s good.I’ll keep this review short, so I’ll go through the OVA’s plot quickly. The first part of the OVA has the girls taking a shower after swimming, and Ishigami complains about fanservice in seinen manga. The second part of the OVA has Shirogane and Ishigami reading a stray doujin they found in a parking lot. And finally, the third part of the OVA is the longest, and has the gang do a fried rice contest judged by Chika and Miko Iino. These little skits fit together like a normal episode of Kaguya-sama, though it adds way more ecchi to the mix.Overall, the Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen OVA is a good time for people who’ve already seen the first and second seasons or read the manga. Even if they cram more fanservice in there, they don’t sacrifice the overall quality and quantity of the jokes they throw at you.

Your friends. And it's not just them being compared, girls are intentionally drawn to look like them. Unfortunately this was also done in the manga chapters from which this scene was adapted, but do you know what wasn't done in the manga chapters? The whole 7 minute hentai scene (yes, it's practically hentai at this point) dragged on forever. This OVA contained none of the charm of the original show.I...understand that OVAs were supposed to be different, but this was not a good difference.The first 8 minutes are glorified with the fetishization and sexualization of the two main female characters, basically porn.Acting completely out of character for each person.The animation is so bad.Em portugues:Que porra é essa?Foi realmente nojento quando eles compararam as garotas da revista em quadrinhos pornô com suas amigas.

There seems to be a lot of hate going around this OVA and talk of the ""perverted portrayal"" of the female characters. I don\'t understand the hate now. Even before in the series, there have been scenes, such as the beach scene with Fujiwara and her family on vacation, there has been fan service. While some may argue that it is on a different level of severity than previously seen, I don\'t see that much of an issue. The only way I could see someone being ""appalled"" by this is by justifying it by saying they...are friends and that they shouldn\'t sexualize each other. Firstly, Kaguya and Shirogane are in love and that shouldn\'t come as a surprise to anyone that he reacted the way he did. If you actually look at the panel where Shirogane had that hilarious reaction, it wasn\'t even bad. It just showed that character\'s face and said it looked like Kaguya. Secondly, the first scene in the shower was not Shirogane and Ishigami actually looking at the events of the shower. I would think it doesn\'t take that much mental process to realize that it was just meant to be a demonstration of the events happening in the magazine that Ishigami was reading. The people in the magazine were not literally Kaguya and Fujiwara. With all this being clear, the last thing I could imagine people having issues with is seeing that stuff animated and shown to them. I mean...if you\'re mad at that then I don\'t know what to tell you. You should probably just not watch anime. It\'s literally fan service non more special than any other just like there\'s been before. Nothing new, nothing to be in awe at, nothing to be surprised about.With that all out of the way I can get onto everything else. I think that this OVA was hilarious and held all the things that we really love about Kaguya-sama as a series. Let\'s get on the specifics.Story - 9: I think that the story is superb. It was hilarious with all the right elements in it to just perfectly give enough clues to allow readers to figure out the humor embedded while at the same time not having super 1-dimensional humor that is so mind-numbingly clear and unfunny it puts you to sleep. This is what I would consider very skilled writing. The pacing of the episode was done very well as well. It was able to fit in many different stories into a 20 minute OVA with nothing feeling like it was underdeveloped or left hanging.Art - 9: I would say that the art is very good but not the best I\'ve seen. There is nothing wrong with the art. It\'s the same as the previous animation and style. The only reason why I would not be able to give it a 10 is that there are just some crazy animations out there such as Violet Evergarden, Demon Slayer, Fate Series, etc. Those being the level of animation I would feel is deserving of a perfect 10. But the reason why it is not an 8 is that this series has an amazing way of pulling the art and animation together with the moment in the story to make some truly hilarious scenes. The cook-off and basically every part of this OVA had some part where the camera angle, lighting, change in style killed me.Sound - 9: I can\'t say there was anything wrong with the sound. I really like the music and the sound effects along with the voice acting in this series. It really gives each character and scene a really multi-dimensional feeling it. There\'s nothing to it that I would say makes it the greatest sounding anime of all time but I would say it is done very well. Again, the reason why I wouldn\'t give this an 8 is that the sounds are placed so well that it makes some scenes that are truly comedic gold.Character - 9: I would say out of all the anime I watched, it\'s so easy to make a one-dimensional character. It is so easy to go into a specific mold that allows for writers to be lazy and give the audience something generic. In this show, the characters all have the depth to them, and if you can\'t see that then I\'m sorry but you likely need to use your brain a little harder to see. This OVA had all the hilarious and unique parts of the cast involved. For example, we all Kaguya\'s quick switch of thoughts on someone, Fujiwara getting caught red-handed, etc. I think that this is made so smoothy with everything else in the story and anime that it deserves a solid 9. I don\'t think that the show hasn\'t had enough time to develop into a truly perfect 10.Enjoyment - 10: This is subjective and I think that it doesn\'t require any explination. are friends and that they shouldn\'t sexualize each other.

It does so by grabbing the essence of these topics, and waving it in the face of the viewer, utilising Love Is War's blunt form of comedy and the quirky personalities of its cast to highlight how ridiculous these things are.In the 1st segment, Ishigami is used to critique manga readers who post on the internet or write in with complaints about how the fanservice...wasn't explicit enough. Even the ecchi scenes themselves were making fun of other manga which repeatedly put their characters into similarly raunchy situations, just for the sake of fanservice.The 2nd segment pokes fun at fans of more >hrmm< CULTURED works, who can sometimes be found squabbling on the internet over how best to enjoy doujins and the like. It also makes a point of mocking how these men of culture may react differently to doujins if they contain characters that resemble characters from their favourite manga and anime, with Shirogane's interest only being truly peaked when Ishigami points out one's similarities to Kaguya.The 3rd segment contrasts greatly with the first 2 segments due to its lack of fanservice, as it parodies another show I am very fond of. It takes the premise of this show, Shokugeki no Souma, and inverts everything iconic about the show, making for some brilliant comedy. Where Food Wars gives fanservice-filled visualisations during tastings, this OVA leaves Chika fully clothed; where the tasters in Food Wars showcase masterful insight by identifying specific uncommon ingredients, Chika tries to show off and gets every single statement wrong. It even parodies the backstories behind the cooks' inspirations for dishes that Food Wars often provide and the emotional high viewers get when they triumph. Instead, this OVA shows the audience that the reason Shirogane knows how to make this basic recipe so well, is because he is poor, and he is granted the win because of his sad financial state, not because he cooked the best dish.These 3 stories are fantastic examples of parody, that I have already seen being misunderstood as just regular fanservice segments and a regular cooking segment, which is a shame, and does a huge disservice to the writer's storytelling skills. wasn't explicit enough.

The preceding two seasons of Kaguya were a 10/10 for me (I\'ve not gotten to the third season yet), but this OVA was a disaster.The OVA consists of two disjointed stories, both of which were awful.The first story was excessively lewd, featuring bouncing breasts and almost-naked characters in extremely compromising positions. It\'s extremely hard to believe that this is the same anime as the regular Kaguya episodes - cutely romantic, with a slight hint of sexual reference. This, on the other hand, was explicitly dirty, and made for...a tough watch. The creators attempted to use tongue-in-cheek references to hentai and other fanservice OVAs to justify the wild departure from regular Kaguya episodes (like, ""oh, we\'re self aware that this is ridiculous and over the top""), but ultimately it\'s just a feeble excuse to draw Kaguya and Chika nude. I hate it.The second story was fine. Like, meh, not exciting but whatever. It\'s more filler than anything and could have been left out of the anime, but at least it was more in line with the regular season episodes. a tough watch.

As a fan of the series and a constant reader of the manga they adapted the chapter where Aka made that chapter to make fun of the fan service in animes and the adaptation turned out to be the opposite. It was pure an extremely ecchi fanservice and if you care about the characters you will find this enormously wrong. For example, the steams in the manga where enormous clouds and in the adaptacion was near to leftover foam that barely hide anything.

They mentioned how porn objectifies and devalues women, AND THEN DID IT. It shows how they value their characters. It really is disgusting. Titties are great and all, but don\'t do it for your characters if you want them to hold any value other than being sexualized.

It's all about fun and they...achieved their goal. achieved their goal."", 'Due to that first review which gave it a 1 out a 10, as well as my own feelings regarding things like that, I feel inclined to write a review for this OVA. I wasn’t going to, but I felt that a couple of other people who gave it an eight, made very good points in this regard. But I will get into more of that after the review itself. Now since this is just a one episode OVA, I’m not gonna take too much time into making a long, detailed review of it. So it seems like I’m generalizing a lot this, that’s the...reason why. I love this series and all, however, I just can’t bring myself to give it to much detail. And that’s a bit unusual for me. LOL.Warning, some spoilers ahead:Story: yes, the first part of this episode was way too fan servicey, and quite trashy to be quite honest. But then I so what some other people were saying on here who gave it an egg, about the fact that it was a parody of shonen Fanservice scenes, or whatever. And I’m not exactly an expert in that regard, well whatever, but either way, it was just a little excessive for those types of blatant fanservice scenes, in the abstract at least.  However if it was mere commentary on a trend going on in a certain artform, and for that, it’s actually not too trashy in that context.The second part of this episode, is where I believe the real comedy kicks in. Because you have Shirogane at first act all morally righteous when he comes across a porn mag in a parking lot with Ishigami. But then, as he talks about it further with Ishigami, his curiosity takes over, and he comes up with that BS excuse that he’s just reading the story. Sure Shirogane, SURE your were. 😂And the third part to the episode, involved no fan service at all. Just a cooking contest with fried rice as the dish. And I especially loved that old cliché line, “the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach”. And as a man myself, let me tell you that there’s a lot of truth to that! lol And Fujisawa’s faux analyses wow taste testing the fried rice dishes, was another bit of comedy gold! so yeah, all in all, the episode got better as it went further along.Art: I’m not sure if anyone else noticed, but I know that there was a little bit of a drop off in our quality in this episode. I mean I guess since it’s an OVA that’s not cannon, it’s not too big of a deal, but it is something that I didn’t notice. Nothing too serious, but still.Music: The same very good, in fact outstanding music. No significant drop offs there.Characters: other than the fact that Shirogane and Ishigami got a lot more perverted than usual during this OVA, no serious changes there. I was a bit disappointed in Iino eating most of the fried rice that Kaguya especially made for Shirogane, and for someone who describes to morally upright behavior, that certainly wasn’t a good example of that. But all in all, still quite good.Now lastly, as promised, I will get into more of what I was talking about in the intro. To quote one of the people who gave it an eight out of 10, “i’ve noticed quite a bit of sensitivity regarding this ecchi”. It’s not just with this episode, I’ve noticed it with quite a lot of Anime as of late. And to be quite honest, it’s really starting to get tiresome. I won’t get too much into it, but I think you all understand what I’m talking about right? Even if you don’t agree, you know what I’m talking about. Anime by its very nature has quite a bit more sexuality in it, than any other western media really. So I’m a bit surprised to see said sensitivity regarding Ecchi because of that also.Now I’ve been a fan of anime for like 21 years as of this writing, and I’ve seen it all throughout the years. If you’re new to it, then fine I understand having a really bad reaction to it. But if you’re a seasoned anime watcher, and you’re still reacting to it like it’s a big shock, then that’s what I don’t understand.

I know, I know. There are going to be some that criticize my opinion because of how seriously I take it. It has nothing to do with me being a woman and everything to do with the amount of love I have for this series. I\'ve watched ecchi before (including Highschool DxD), so it also has nothing to do with a dislike towards that...genre.This OVA wasn\'t adapted well, in my opinion. The first and second seasons of Kaguya-sama are adapted beautifully, and very faithfully to the manga. The anime becomes even more enjoyable because they can adapt funny animations and antics that you simply can\'t experience in the manga. The whole vibe of the show felt very similar to the manga. That does not apply in this OVA.The first half didn\'t come off as very humorous. Like I said, I\'ve read the manga, so I knew what to expect as I began watching. Aka (the Author) does fanservice very tastefully, and minimally at that. He often goes out of this way to rag on cliché stereotypes and tropes. So, any fanservice that you see in the manga, doesn\'t come off in an ""ecchi"" way. It doesn\'t feel gross towards the characters you have come to love. This OVA had me feeling that way. I had to take a double take when watching the soapy shower scene because it felt like a different show. There was no humor and the characters felt lacking, as if it was just shoved in there to appease a certain audience.The second part of this episode, the fried rice competition, was classic Kaguya-sama. That part of the episode is certainly worth a watch.If you aren\'t an ecchi fan and/or you happen to be a fan of the manga, this may not be an OVA you\'ll enjoy.

However, the beginning of this OVA scared me, full of forced ecchi, with a speech that was made to mock scenes like this. Just weird.I will divide a review into 3 parts as well as the OVA, because it makes my job easier.1) Bath sceneBizarre. The scene in fact has a good idea, it puts those thoughts that...every young man had while reading an eromanga in Ishigami; as for example: ""why is the door there? where did this shadow come from?"", but the anime sins when applying these ""jokes"" with female characters from the anime being clearly eroticized, thus nullifying all the author\'s criticism of scenes like this. The way this scene unfolds only goes from bad to worse, everything decays a lot, the reason for the scene ceases to exist with time. There is no direction and production that would hold this scene.2) Scene from the magazine on the floor.I would say that it is not the worst part of the OVA, in fact, it is ""meh"", but it has some nice dialogues next to depressing ones. As I said before, one of the strengths of Love is War is to put young people\'s thoughts perfectly in characters, this part ironic the ""pure young saints"" you know very well what they are. Despite this, OVA again gets lost in making imaginary characters its friends like characters from porn magazines, which is a horrorible. Scenes like that put a very sexualized look to all the characters, draining the meaning of the work.3) Culinary battleThe best part of the OVA. Miko is exactly the type of person I would love to cook for. I especially like how this part gets to bring the group more together, showing signs of development. If you take that away, I don\'t have much to say, this scene deserves the ""Love is War seal of quality"".Finally, despite the scary and pointless start, Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Tensai-tachi no Renai Zunousen OVA is not exactly the OVA we all wanted, but it is what it has for today. Counting with the genius direction and wonderful production, the episode is sustained in the beginning only in that, but managing to recover the mood that we love from Love is War more towards the end. every young man had while reading an eromanga in Ishigami; as for example: ""why is the door there? where did this shadow come from?"", but the anime sins when applying these ""jokes"" with female characters from the anime being clearly eroticized, thus nullifying all the author\'s criticism of scenes like this.

It wasn't bad just a bit disappointing because now I know there's going to be more fanservice in season 3 which I'm not looking forward too. It's like damn, does every anime have to have fanservice?Overall, this didn't really add anything to the plot and is just here for ecchi and fanservice which I...didn't need.

However, I understand there are 3 parts to the episode and I watched the first two.All I can say is that this episode has really had a negative effect on me thus far. So much so to the point that I might find it difficult to approach this show and its characters the same way. Listen, there are plenty of ecchi shows, I have even seen a good number and can tolerate them even though I do not really like them and try...to avoid the genre. However, I felt like this crossed the line that even many other shows knew not to cross. I know people are praising this episode's first part because of the fantastic animation, but it probably would have been better appreciated elsewhere. I read some reviews say they were insulted and disgusted, and I am beginning to think I feel the same way. Hear me out.Some shows are already ecchi and the OVA episodes do not stray too far from the main series. In this case though I feel like they just objectified the two main female characters (that I love) using them to elude a sexual act and have them basically bare naked for the entire duration with almost nothing left to the imagination. It goes so far that it just seemed like a scene from a hentai. The problem for me with this is the show is rather about understanding and relating to teenagers dealing with feelings of budding romance in school and just growing up in high school in general. This part of the show degrades the naitivity and innocense of youth. Sure, even kids are not innocent, which is why I think part 2 is still a somewhat good part even if it might still seem insulting to some. But there is something more significant to scenes like in the second part in my opinion. This first part has no reason to exist outside fanservice. It prides itself in being a parody of ecchi (which it nearly does), but then undoes everything by going full porno.I was so shocked I had to look up the chapter that it was based off. To my surprise, the scene barely existed. Or rather, the original manga seemed to understand that it was a parody and thus kept the scene very brief with innuendos but rather tame. I understand that animes need to expand on the source material since we are not watching still panels. However, I have a feeling the parody the manga created was lost in this adaptation. It is strange because up until a certain point it seems like a parody, albeit lewd, but then it does not even embody ecchi shows but rather surpases most. It actually frightens me to imagine what might be in the next 2 OVAs or S3. I watched S1 and S2, then rewatched it with my siblings. I would have liked to watch this with them too; not gonna happen. I can only hope this does not represent the future of the show. People generally do no think much of OVAs and scenes like this but I think the issue in this anime's case is it opened up pandora's box. And I am afraid that means it cannot be closed. Now we have to live with the fact that people will circulate legitimate images and videos of our favourite characters nude around the internet.I kinda glossed the second part but I actually thought it was alright. The prez and Ishigami act indecent in this part but it feels more grounded and realistic at least. I might not be remembering everything about it because it is less impactful than the first part obviously. As for the 3rd part, I have not seen it but I heard good things. I felt so overwhelmed I felt I needed to stop the episode half way. I'll probably watch it once I douse my brain with soap. to avoid the genre.

It captures all of the normal tropes each character has and flows really nicely. You get some great changes in the animation for comedy purposes too.You get an anime shower manga section, an eromanga section, and a good old cook-off which gives us a...brilliant OVA which I would recommend to everyone who loves the show.10/10.

Being an anime only, i hadn't any clue that something like this is there to be animated.I read reviews and many were comparing it to the manga stating that they even surpassed manga in terms of ecchi on this OVA. Guess I'd have to see it for myself.It's not that I've not watched echhi stuff, but the the 2 seasons didn't had anything like that, so totally unexpected for me.Still I'd watch the OVA, because why not?

It's nearly a hentai OVA, and definitely NSFW. Some might say that the film criticises the ecchi/hentai industry, but if you take an honest look, it doesn't really go beyond just lampshading. If it's really trying to critique the industry, how does putting the characters into ridiculous sexual scenarios do anything meaningful criticism? It's basically just fanservice trying to pretend that it's not.The second half feels a lot more like a normal Kaguya-sama episode. There's a cookoff competition, and the usual antics occur. I'll admit that I found it quite funny, and I actually laughed several times. That said,...the main joke does start getting a bit repetitive after the first time, and it becomes pretty predictable.Honestly, it's hard for me to rate this OVA as a whole, because the two halves are so much different from each other. I've decided to give it a 5, since I guess the fun of the second half more or less makes up for the first. the main joke does start getting a bit repetitive after the first time, and it becomes pretty predictable.Honestly, it's hard for me to rate this OVA as a whole, because the two halves are so much different from each other.

Meaning not only excessive but even bad looking (the anime aesthetics and animation style are objectively not really fit for that kind of visuals in my opinion).I was flabbergasted and I\'m really thankful this is separate from the series I know and love, which does feature spicy innuendos...but in a tasteful and funny way.The only thing I personally enjoyed about this episode was Shirogane desperately trying to remain virtuous and not admit his lowly desires like Ishigami lol.The second part with the ""Masterchef challenge"" was ok but I never really laughed, probably also bc I was still jaded about  the previous part.Altogether a small, weird treat for the fans, but not worth watching. but in a tasteful and funny way.The only thing I personally enjoyed about this episode was Shirogane desperately trying to remain virtuous and not admit his lowly desires like Ishigami lol.The second part with the ""Masterchef challenge"" was ok but I never really laughed, probably also bc I was still jaded about  the previous part.Altogether a small, weird treat for the fans, but not worth watching.', ""Although I love the Love is War franchise, this OVA was insulting.The first part of the ova was too awkward to watch and to some extent I found it very insulting, not nnly because I hated seeing Chika and Kaguya naked, but because the way they expressed it is no longer ecchi but directly porn. Besides that, in the manga Aka Akasaka draws them with respect and knowing how to balance with the fan service, but in this ova that respect was passed completely gone. The bathroom part made me sick and I skipped it.The second part was more enjoyable, they didn't put...Chika or Kaguya in a disgusting situation.And the third part, the ricewar one, was naturally the best part of the ova. It actually felt like it wasn't ova and was instead a normal anime episode.It is also important to mention the incredible work of the seiyuus, especially Koga Aoi.So yeah, tjhis ova was disapointing, and the mos insultant part is that AI Pictures put a lot of  work in that creepy bathroom scene.

Momo e no Tegami,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10389/Momo_e_no_Tegami,"['""A Letter to Momo"" had reportedly taken the director Okiura Hiroyuki 7 years to produce. Allow me to be the first to say, the time and effort spent on perfecting this film have not gone to waste. I was fortunate enough to watch this latest masterpiece at the 2011 TIFF screening.The art/animation in this movie is top-notch. Production I.G. with assistance from P.A. Works, Studio Pierrot, and CG by Dandelion resulted in stunning visual quality down to the tiniest details. What I especially liked, was the amount of attention paid to body language and gestures. There\'s so much information to be gleaned from visuals alone,...and that\'s what I find most interesting about Japanese films. There was also this action sequence near the end that just blew me away. I don\'t want to spoil, but I have not seen such breathtaking hand-drawn animation since watching ""Tonari no Totoro"" in the late \'80s.The story begins with the protagonist, Momo, moving to a small fictional island named Shiojima with her mother. Their new house appears to be haunted, and she feels absolutely miserable about moving out of Tokyo. Being a city girl that she is, Momo struggles to adjust to the country life. Instead of playing with the local kids, she eventually befriends three Youkai in her house - Iwa, Kawa, and Mame. Momo begins to appreciate the life on the island, and come to realize the meaning of his late father\'s unfinished letter to her.The character development in this movie is absolutely phenomenal. It begins with a light comedy, but through numerous adventures and mishaps on the island, we slowly learn about her past. The transition from comedy to drama is seamless, and it really makes you to care about the protagonist by the end... This film has what I call magic, something Ghibli films of late desperately lack. Although the local kids were severely underused in this movie, I think the three Youkai were the true supporting cast. Their chemistry with the protagonist was excellent, and the humor just comes naturally. Mame\'s character was especially funny in a quirky way. One can easily tell how much thought and  planning has been put into this film just by watching the impeccable timing at which Mame\'s character was used as comedic relief every single time.Every piece of music appears to be fully orchestrated, especially the violins stood out to build tension in action scenes. Momo\'s voice acting by child actress and seiyuu Miyama Karen was a perfect fit, as well as the three Youkai.""A Letter to Momo"" is almost like a homage to Studio Ghibli\'s kids movies - ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Spirited Away"", and ""Ponyo"". It sticks to the tried and tested formula of supernatural spirits that only interacts with kids, and somewhat predictable plot development. However, the producers have managed to merge various elements from all those films into an exciting original story. ""A Letter to Momo"" is a magical crowd- pleaser with great pacing and a heartwarming story. It\'s a solid movie that anime and movie fans should not miss.Possibly the best all-ages anime movie since ""Spirited Away"" (2001). and that\'s what I find most interesting about Japanese films.

I'm disappointed that i've left this little masterpiece alone for such a long time, however, glad it has since migrated to my completed list. In my eyes, this film could truly hold it's own against some of the most recognized Ghibli films.This film, in short, is about a young protagonist named Momo who moves towns with her mother after the death of her father. It's not long until she discovers that the new house she has moved into includes three Youkai that for some...reason are only visible to her. Learning that these three characters aren't leaving any time soon, she befriends them, making life in this new town bearable.Although not entirely necessary, the character development for the protagonist was extremely refreshing.

A letter to Momo could have been a silent film and it still would have succeeded due to the amount of body language and emotional features that was included. You are able to tell exactly what each character are thinking at all times, simply from looking at them.There really isn't a lot to say about the sound aspect of this film. The sountrack was wonderful and enhanced the overall feel of the film in every scene. A lot of the music was instrumental and every piece was performed well. Every main and supporting voice actors suited their roles perfectly.A letter to Momo is simple, but done exceptionally well.

Sounds promising, yet I was disappointed.The basic trouble with _Momo_ is that it executes well on *none* of these aspects. Momo herself is an ultra-bland character who cannot stand any comparison with Ghibli heroines like Sen or Shizuku. The island setting is woefully underused throughout the movie (except for...the pig-chasing scene). The architecture and backgrounds are accurate but again, bland. The music is unmemorable and cannot be commented on. The trio of supernatural characters are more irritating than they are ever interesting or endearing and I wished that almost all of their scenes didn\'t exist as the humor is nonexistent. The animation is adequate but again bland, except for whoever worked on the pig-chasing scene and the pulsating spirits at the shrine (who stand out as the most visually interesting aspect of the movie, and give the later bridge scene its interest). And the plot...The plot has a truly outrageous reliance on cliches - from the guilt of Momo telling her father to leave right before his accidental death to her mother conveniently developing Anime Coughing Sickness (yes, really! they really had the chutzpah to use that cliche!) to endlessly predictable scenes (serious question: in the mirror-breaking scene, is there anyone who from the first cut didn\'t know that that mirror was going to break?) to scenes so illogical that the movie can\'t even depict the events (why on earth would a doctor agree to cross the bridge at the end in the middle of a typhoon...? don\'t ask _Momo_, it just cuts straight from getting across to the happily-ever-after). It compounds these scenes with a lack of imagination (no use of the ""Night Parade of One Hundred Demons"" is just criminal) and in the ending where it commits the greatest of sins for this kind of movie by forcing a heavy-handed conclusion and collapsing the border of reality/imagination. It has the bad taste of, like pornography, insisting on showing you everything. I could have maybe tolerated all the rest of it and considered it mediocre but still watchable far down the list after the Ghibli movies, _Wolf Children_, etc, but that choice of ending is a final kick in the nuts and insult to everyone who watches it. the pig-chasing scene).

It has a brilliant story and I actually thought it was a Studio Ghibli movie.The movie basically had everything: a great stroy, great characters and a drawing style (?!)

Otherwise everything was pretty perfect.A total 9 for me, I'd recommend Momo e no Tegami to everyone who likes Studio Ghibli movies and movies that have a really nice and touching storyline without being too deep.A movie that...I would rewatch! I would rewatch!"", 'This film has all the pomp of Ghibli but none of the substance.My biggest complaint personally was the three goblins. They were pretty much your run-of-the-mill Disney-style comic-relief caricatures, and I honestly just found them annoying to no end. Even aside from that they were kind of just bland and unfunny.There\'s also the climax. It\'s rather shoe-horned in, and comes mostly out of nowhere. It also is essentially just one massive plot-hole. Without giving to much away, it\'s immediately immediately clear to anyone with half brain cell that the plan the characters are attempting, has a huge flaw. I was interested to see how they...would overcome this flaw, and well basically they just sweep it under the rug. Half way through the climax, the screen fades to black, and the film cuts to the next day, and everything is resolved somehow.Other than than that, the film is honestly just kind of bland and unremarkable. The beginning and the end and a few moments here and there feel a little heartfelt, but even they are pretty cliche and unmoving. The shinto stuff was also kind of cool, but you can find that anywhere. I probably could have gotten over my first two complaints if there was really anything to like about the film, but there isn\'t.  It\'s just a mediocre film, with a few flaws that gently push it down into ""bad"" territory.Honestly, you\'re better off just rewatching your favorite Ghibli film. would overcome this flaw, and well basically they just sweep it under the rug.

It\'s even harder to watch a child loose a parent at such a young age and the spouse, even though they must move on. Knows now that the person they married, they dedicated their love to is gone. This painful reminder sets up our story for the young Momo and her mother. Leaving Tokyo after the sudden death of her father, Momo and mom move out to a big island where the grandparents live. Now they must adjust to a new life, as Momo has difficulties with this, her mother fits in...pretty quick, looking for job and even meeting an old friend. But it\'s harder for Momo. Losing her father so suddenly and him leaving a mysterious letter that only reads: ""Dear Momo"" she is trying to find her place in this new home. But things suddenly change drastically when she believes her new home is haunted. After hearing strange noises, food mysteriously disappearing and voices coming from the attic. Momo ventures up there to find three goblins have made it their home. There names are Mama, Iwa and Kawa and they have no intentions of leaving.Much like the environmental, action packed films of studio Ghibli, this film is more family based and has a slice of life feeling to it. From the opening credits of the ship sailing a beautiful crested blue sea to large fielded mountains surrounded by the ocean I knew I was in love right away. For I love Japanese culture and their agricultural ways of living. I am just a snobby American, living in my four sided box which I leave in my box on wheels to my job and then come home and eat TV dinners. I would love to live on an island, grow my own fruits and vegetables, walk every where and swim in the ocean. So whenever I watch anime that deals with this kind of setting, it puts me in a nostalgic mood to just get up and leave. But of course there are other reasons to like A LETTER TO MOMO. Being an anime of course it has spiritual elements to it and the goblins come into play here. I liked them a lot and their character designs, especially Mame who looks like a naked green gremlin. They have all their own unique characteristics and its fun to watch them interact with Momo, as she gradually gets more use to them. Even when she teaches them things like not to steal, they pay her back with teaching her how to overcome fears and open up and ultimately that develops Momo into a fully fleshed out character. As she learns more about the goblins, we learn more about Momo and even her last days with her father.I\'ve always liked Production I.G. and they do a good job with the characters here. Making the humans look very realistic (no big boobs here) and the goblins all stand out as their own. The film was written and directed by Hiroyuki Okiura who does a great job with telling his story and pacing it. Hardly dwendling, except for maybe the beginning of act 3 where things kind of slow down and become slightly tedious. But he, like a lot of Japanese filmmakers can make the simplest things special.  Where else would you find people talking about a clock or being chased by wild boars entertaining in the same aspects. Because the dialog is good and the story is fun. It\'s one of the kidder anime out there, but A LETTER TO MOMO is a beautiful little film and might even be a hidden gem. If you love anime see it for sure. pretty quick, looking for job and even meeting an old friend. But it\'s harder for Momo.

I would love to live on an island, grow my own fruits and vegetables, walk every where and swim in the ocean. So whenever I watch anime that deals with this kind of setting, it puts me in a nostalgic mood to just get up and leave. But of course there are other reasons to like A LETTER TO MOMO. Being an anime of course it has spiritual elements to it and the goblins come into play here. I liked them a lot and their character designs, especially Mame who looks like a naked green gremlin. They have all their own unique characteristics and its fun to watch them interact with Momo, as she gradually gets more use to them. Even when she teaches them things like not to steal, they pay her back with teaching her how to overcome fears and open up and ultimately that develops Momo into a fully fleshed out character. As she learns more about the goblins, we learn more about Momo and even her last days with her father.I\'ve always liked Production I.G. and they do a good job with the characters here. Making the humans look very realistic (no big boobs here) and the goblins all stand out as their own. The film was written and directed by Hiroyuki Okiura who does a great job with telling his story and pacing it. Hardly dwendling, except for maybe the beginning of act 3 where things kind of slow down and become slightly tedious. But he, like a lot of Japanese filmmakers can make the simplest things special.  Where else would you find people talking about a clock or being chased by wild boars entertaining in the same aspects. Because the dialog is good and the story is fun. It\'s one of the kidder anime out there, but A LETTER TO MOMO is a beautiful little film and might even be a hidden gem. If you love anime see it for sure.', ""Story 6/10: The story was okay. It dragged in bits and sometimes felt rushed, especially at the scene were Momo is trying to save her mom. Did they explain how the Dad die? I think I missed that part. A few tear-jerking moments and funny bits.Art 7/10: The animation was nice. It looked realistic and the facial movements were so life like.Sound 6/10: I liked the ending theme.Character 6/10: Momo was THE blandest character every. I know she was coming to terms with her Dad's death, but she had no likable qualities, maybe up until the end. She just went along her day with...mostly a monotonous posture. Her development happened at the very end when she finally found her peace. Not much is known about the other characters. I did like the three Goblins, especially the forgetful on. He was very cute. They didn't really dwell on their backgrounds and how they become to be. Just that they were guardians to come to protect the loved ones of those who had died.Enjoyment 4/10: I didn't really like it as much. But it did come with a nice underlying message about over coming heartbreak and finding forgiveness.Overall 6/10: It's a good time waster if you want background noise. Some funny moments, some sad moments and some sweet ones. I guess it's a nice film to watch with the family, just wasn't up to my speed. mostly a monotonous posture.

The anime was very lengthy. The story was filled with unnecessary details. The three demons were extremely ugly. But that is not even the point. The point is that they were extremely annoying. The animation was average. I have seen way better way many times.The playing was so slow the 2-hour duration was very hard to pass, at least the first 1.5 hours. I definitely got some 'Spirited Away' vibes from the film. But in quality, it wasn't even close.I won't recommend this anime. "", 'ももへのてがみ is follows a girl who moves to the seaside with her mother after the death of her father.Shortly after her arrival, she meets 3 strange gods that were sent as guardians to watch over her & her mother.[STORY]: 7It\'s an lively story with an interesting take on gods & spirits.My problem with this story is that the comedic take on it is a little TOO comedic. There are ways to make a story lighthearted & funny without making is outrageous & I just think it was a little too much.I\'ll explain more in the characters section.The story is WAY too predictable & it\'s a...little annoying how I was able to predict everything.It\'s cliche & overall, the story just does TOO much in a bad way in many areas.[ART]: 8I quite enjoyed the art.

She had good character development, I guess.At least she didn\'t just stay the same.Side-characters:Could\'ve done more with them. They lacked purpose.

I have been lucky enough to find one more anime I like!""A Letter to Momo"" - 2011, 2-Hrs.This is a 2-hour movie of very high quality. For those of you who enjoy anime movies, you\'re in for a treat!But first I want to talk about the production as a whole, and mention the production company. I\'m amazed how many anime I\'ve watched from this talented company.\'Production I.G.\' has made dozens of high quality stories and has contributed to the production of other peoples\' works as well. Just a few of the 297 Movies and Series they\'ve been involved with:Attack on Titan,...Psycho-Pass, Ghost in the Shell, Usagi Drop, xxxHOLiC, Blood: The Last Vampire; and many others.The artwork is very flat, with sometimes a slightly enhanced parallax for a great 2.5d effect, the colors are soft, without being muted. Artwork reminds one of Studio Ghibli artwork. The characters seem a bit strange at first, but once you settle in to the style, it begins to become something very special.The music is not something that stands out, which in this case, is exactly what the company intended. All the music works just fine, seemingly very simple and understated, but at the end of this story, it is the normalcy that stands out and comes through with the heart and and strong feelings that everything else brings to bear.Dialog, is very strong. The Japanese is excellent, and the Dub-English is also excellent.---------------------------------The primary characters are dealt with deftly with nuance and sensitivity. A mother has lost her husband in a ship-sinking. So she sells her condo in Tokyo, and returns with her young daughter, back to the place of her own birth. To find peace, and maybe some healing of wounds. Her old stomping ground is an island just off the coast. The terrain so rugged that the place has been built as a set of huge terraces, to do farming. Still being done since ancient times.At first, the move is very \'rocky\', because our young daughter was used-to Tokyo, and its hustle and bustle. Things get much worse over time, before they get better. Things are just too quiet, where the only fun thing for the daughter to do, is jump off the newly constructed bridge (to the mainland), with the rest of the kids; into shallow water. Most people are elderly, so the kids are few, and some are kinda out-there, as it were. At least as our young lady Momo sees it.But at some point after settling into the patterns of a slower way of life, things get positively unusual for Momo. Fantasy beings become common place, only to cause nothing but consternation for Momo, and disbelief for her mother. Everything from \'Guardian Oni\' to \'Kodoma\' (words I normally don\'t use, but I have to here, since it\'s a Japanese Anime, with Japanese References everywhere). By the end of the story, they become not only not dangerous, but most of them become her friends so important, that they assist Momo in saving her mothers\' Life.----------------------------------This is a story of Life, death, rebirth, and renewal of spirit. Of finding our way, and finding sometimes; simplicity is better than complexity. That faith in ourselves, and in our friends, is more important than what \'s watchable on television. And sometimes, the courage to be what we have be, to things that saves loved ones, reassure our friends; and make a statement about how the future should end, is the meaning behind the meaning.\'A Letter for Momo\' is at first slow, and seems like it goes no-where for the first 30-minutes. But those of you who have the courage to see what is meant, and the tolerance to see a mini-script for real Life, might see what I see, and truly enjoy an outtake for the future of the Human Race.I give \'A Letter to Momo\' a solid 9.

Heartwarming family story, reminded me of Ghibli movies and Wolf Children2. Great ED themeCons:1. Plot may be quite cliche2. Need time to get used to the art and animation...<LONG REVIEW>A Letter to Momo is a movie I stumbled upon coincidence. I never heard anything about it. After reading some reviews on MAL, I decided to check it out and surprisingly I do like it.Now if you also haven't heard of this movie before, it's one of your typical family drama movies but mixed with Youkai or spirits in English. Now is this movie worth watching, I'd say yes, but it definitely isn't the best movie out there, or even near that, but it's still a good movie with a satisfying conclusion.The main thing that stood out the most in this movie is the characters. Each character is enjoyable to follow with. Our main character, Momo, although isn't the most original character out there, is still pretty likable and relatable. The 3 Youkais that follows Momo everywhere are also pretty fun to watch. Their relationship developed throughout the movie. You can see Momo hating these Youkai at first but in the end came to accept them. The whole climax of the movie is also thanks to the help of the Youkai.The art and animation needs time to get used to because it's pretty different from what we get nowadays. It's very simplistic and if you can get used to it, then there's nothing more to say on this part. It's decent, nothing breathtaking.Overall, this is a solid family drama movie. It isn't anything breathtaking, but if you are finding a movie similar to Wolf Children and Spirited Away, then be sure to check out this one. You will like it. That's it.

She is visited by 3 spirits to overcome this pain, become social again, and move on in her life.This feels like a long lost Studio Ghibli film, as it has a similar to vibe to their chill films like Whisper of the Heart, Only Yesterday, Totoro, etc. The animation is also a similar style to Ghibli in that it has great detail on the facial expressions of the characters and the backgrounds. The story is like a fairy tale...that kids could enjoy and get attached to, even if the subject matter can be emotional at times.You do care for the main character as everyone around her attempts to help her recover. She is also adjusting socially to a new environment that all audiences can connect to.I'm only docking points because it is still a standard story that has been told many times both in anime and live action. Also, if you are not into films geared towards general audiences and only like mature shows, you can skip this one as well.I'm glad I checked it out, and its merits a watch if you are a fan of these types of Ghibli-esque dramas. that kids could enjoy and get attached to, even if the subject matter can be emotional at times.You do care for the main character as everyone around her attempts to help her recover.

Those who had a recent death i would suggest watching this. Or even those afraid of dying."", 'A Letter to Momo is a surprisingly quiet and humane movie. You look at the box and its got these three obnoxious monsters in this weird fun pose and then you watch it and a generational divide is immediately established in the film, as Momo is brought to a part of Japan where kids her own age appear exceptionally rare, and this isolation is farther reinforced by her first encounter with any inhabitants of the island. Her grandparents, while no doubt beloved, could never take the place of any friends she might have once had before she came here. This is something that her mother...is no doubt aware of, as once they find somebody the same age as Momo, she immediately forces them together, much to the disgust of Momo. Her mother’s actions, while well intended, only lead to Momo feeling even more isolated.Momo’s reaction to the other children could only be described as fear. With so few surrounding allies for her to have, the few people in this new life that she could possibly relate to means that much more to her, so the idea of not befriending them seems that much more terrible. There is no backup option. This is probably why she didn’t jump off the bridge. The film never explicitly says so, but it’s readily apparent that she doesn’t want to be seen as a coward, so she acts as if the jump is beneath her and moves on.This is why the yokai are such an important thing for Momo’s growth. I don’t particularly like the term “coming of age” film as what defines “coming of age” seems fairly arbitrary, but considering how much focus is put on her maturing as a character, it seems to be the only fitting term here, and the yokai definitely help her grow. These creatures are nothing more than rowdy troublemakers, but for somebody whose life is as mundane as Momo’s, she needs the thrill that these guys force on her. (Also, the small one is a real cutie in a kind of repulsing way.)The inclusion of the supernatural in an otherwise slice of life setting does lead to several fairly obvious comparisons that one could make but I find that Wolf Children just makes the most sense, partly because it came out a few months after this film, but for the most part I feel the thematic contrast leads to an interesting comparison. Sure, in both films a single mother and her children move to bumbfuck nowhere with supernatural events occurring in an otherwise mundane story, but that’s really where the comparison ends.For instance, while Momo is initially terrified of the yokai, Hana immediately accepts the potentially terrifying because she knows that it will lead her to a better life. And while sure, you could look at the supernatural elements literally, I much prefer viewing them as metaphors. In Wolf Children’s case they represent the anxiety one might have in the unknown world of parenthood, while in A Letter to Momo they represent the unknown world of adolescence. In both scenarios, my interpretation of what the supernatural’s presence means revolves around the age of the characters, which is why I find the character’s reactions to the supernatural so interesting. Hana, as a grown woman has matured enough to accept the unknown as a part of life. Momo, still a child, needs somebody to give her a helpful nudge, whether it’s her mother forcing her to talk with a complete stranger or the yokai forcing her into the water when she’s too scared to take the dive.Immaturity is also essential to understanding the final conflict of the film, which, without spoiling too much, revolves around Momo childishly clinging to the past, while her mother races towards the future. Both parties have a lot more in common with each other than either of them is aware of, but they never revealed anything to the other party. This is what led to the emotional climax of the film, regardless of what the yokai did leading up to the event. They just triggered the inevitable in order to help both Momo and her mother grow as people and deepen their relationship with one another. The end result of this maturation is summed up simply, and effectively in the final shots of the film. Momo is finally, without anyone else to guide her in any way, able to jump into the water and deal with the uneasiness of her adolescence.8/10This Review is actually the script to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y338TjBCqrUCheck that out and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more reviews like it. is no doubt aware of, as once they find somebody the same age as Momo, she immediately forces them together, much to the disgust of Momo.

After the unexpected death of her father, Momo and her mother look for a new start on an island with fresh air and sea for days. Although it as supposed to be relaxing, Momo's mom has to over work herself and their accommodations seem to be haunted by three creepy Guardians. You get to watch this young girls summer pass by in the flash, get closer to...the island dwellers and learn that adults also have emotions. Art; Stunning. The sea, lights, the captivating mountain top and the spirits of the land. Absolutely beautiful. Sound; Suited the film, but nothing caught my ear. Character; My favourite character was the adorable little sister Umi. Passing the days by on the island, seeing the unexplained and one of the sweets kids towards Momo.Overall, I'm happy I didn't drop the film. I was about to at first since it was a. bit slow at the beginning, and maybe I just don't have a heart for this movie but Momo at the start (along with mom over working herself and hiding her emotions away from her daughter) annoyed me. New island, family member passing, not knowing a single person and feeling alone... I know what's she's going through, but with her attitude I couldn't help but not care.I highly suggest you watch this movie at least once.

Although A Letter to Momo doesn’t center more on that aspect, just seeing those three troublesome youkai is enough to pique my attention, *wink.A Letter to MomoWhen this movie started, the first thing I noticed was the animation. I love that it instantly reminds me of my fun childhood memories in the countryside. You could say that the animation alone already gave that fun rural vibe which fits perfectly in this movie’s setting. Definitely a big plus for me!As I mentioned above, A Letter to Momo isn’t more...on the youkai aspect but they played a big role in this story. As per synopsis, Momo and her mother moved to the countryside (more accurately to be called an island) after her father’s death. In there we get to see her struggle to adapt in her new environment plus her heart’s unrest because of her father’s unfinished letter.Her quiet and lonely life in that unfamiliar town took quite a turn by the arrival of three troublesome youkai. These three youkai have peculiar appearance and personalities. Although they can be annoying sometimes, I have to say that they are mostly fun to watch. Their shenanigans were usually hilarious with some of them leaving you face palming, lol. It was also interesting to know more about them, especially on their “secret mission”. I think it was pretty fascinating.After giving me a laugh, this movie also left me in tears. A Letter to Momo delves more on the struggle of the remaining family members after the death of their loved one. Here we see how Momo and her mother deal with their own grief differently, which also resulted in conflict later on in the movie. During that time, there’s also an incident regarding her mother’s asthma that made the three youkai act. Watching that scene on the bridge with the youkai never gets old to me. You really have to look forward on that when you decided to watch this movie, *wink.A Letter to Momo is definitely one of those few anime films that I believe could hold its own against some of the most loved Ghibli films. Highly recommended! on the youkai aspect but they played a big role in this story.

I think it was pretty fascinating.After giving me a laugh, this movie also left me in tears. A Letter to Momo delves more on the struggle of the remaining family members after the death of their loved one. Here we see how Momo and her mother deal with their own grief differently, which also resulted in conflict later on in the movie. During that time, there’s also an incident regarding her mother’s asthma that made the three youkai act. Watching that scene on the bridge with the youkai never gets old to me. You really have to look forward on that when you decided to watch this movie, *wink.A Letter to Momo is definitely one of those few anime films that I believe could hold its own against some of the most loved Ghibli films. Highly recommended!', ""Think My Neighbor Totoro meets When Marnie Was There but just not as captivating as the aforementioned films and a bit too by the book for its own good. There are several elements about A Letter to Momo that feels clichéd and familiar which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the problem is that the film doesn't do anything to add to these particular tropes that hasn't already been done before. That being said I can't really find anything about it that I really dislike either though the pacing can be really slow especially at the start. Though I have to be honest, I didn't...care about the three Yōkai who are essentially the Totoro-esque mascot characters. I did not find them all that funny or endearing whatsoever. In fact, after a while they just got really annoying to watch. In the end, A Letter to Momo feels like a desparate Ghibli wannabe that does kind of work though without ever reaching the stellar heights of many of it's precursors. care about the three Yōkai who are essentially the Totoro-esque mascot characters.

Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2985/Majin_Tantei_Nougami_Neuro,"[""Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro... perhaps one of the weirder animes I've seen. However, this anime hit my taste buds right on! Honestly, I'm a big fan of detective fictions, main characters that are seen as intelligent, and overall weird motifs and this anime is PERFECT for you if you agree with any of the above.Story:Overall, the story is enjoyable, and not one second was disappointing. The plot was nothing too intense, so those of you looking for drama might think this is faulty. The plot definitely pretty mild compared to other animes such as Death Note, or Code Geass, but the main idea for...each episode really, was to show us one mystery per episode and let us wait for that kick-ass catch phrase &quot;The culprit is... YOU!&quot; Anyways, i find it very hard to be disappointed after each episode because each episode was vacuum packed with great comedy, and  mystery. One flaw I would have to critique on is Neuro's deduction and concluding was extremely unnatural... Personally I try to solve these mysteries too as i watch along, and you could probably pick out the culprit pretty accurately, but to determine the tricks behind the murders is quite the challenge because the show tends to pass over evidence a bit too fast due to its time limit of 20min per episode.Art:I'm usually not too critical when it comes to the art of some anime, but for sure this one stood out. You really don't appreciate the details of how well this anime was drawn until you go on and move to another anime to watch.. Many of the characters are drawn with a high degree of detail from eyes, hair, and to clothes. Specifically using Neuro as an example, you can see the streaks in his hair, the patterns in his eyes, tiny details like those triangle stuff that are attatched to the ends of his hair :S, and a unique blue suit that pretty much stands out from the typical crowd throughout the show. Another thing that caught my attention was Sasazuka, or Godai's  eyes, because they were heavily outlined. It pretty much is used for characters to emphasize the &quot;toughness&quot; in their personality.Sound:I don't remember any great insert songs in the series really... But notably the opening theme was what caught my attention. They used the song Dirty - Nightmare to open up their series, and the lyrics match quite well to the story. Not to mention it sounds pretty dark, which undoubtedly matches that dark, demonic atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the ending song was not something worth remembering. They used the ending song as an insert for one of the episodes that had to do with one of the characters singing it. Not my taste in music X_X kind of a bad singer too.Character:Most UNIQUE characters made in combination to create the comedic, yet mysterious  mood throughout the story. Neuro is quite the sadist at times, though you would see this from a very comical perspective rather than a cruel one. Though, from time to time you do see him look pretty creepy with his claws and fangs, or his gigantic bird head &gt;.&gt;... Actually, his comical face creeped me out in the first episode too... But you would notice the irony of it all as you progress through. Yako on the other hand, was kind of boring =/. Well she was average on most parts, but her interesting points were that she was a total pig when it came to food X), and i guess her its also her ability to understand humans and psychology so well. These 2 characters create a great team together, as one person goes and catches the baddies, while one lures them renderless purging full of guilt. I can really go on talking forever about the characters in this anime, but these 2 guys were the key magics.Enjoyment:Definitely enjoyable throughout every episode. Whether it be the really funny episodes, or the really serious episodes. Once again, there was the occasional flaw in logic and deduction you might catch on to if you tried to pay attention and solve the mystery yourself, but most of the time the mysteries were pretty creative and many times made you say &quot;wow! what a crazy method!&quot; For the times where the mysteries kinda sucked, the comedy part suffices.Overall:Overall was worth watching from start to finish. Many of you may question the weirdness while watching first episode, but thats actually the best part about this whole series. The weirdness eventually catches on to you, and when you finish the series it really does make you leave a part of yourself in the anime. The ending suggests possibilities for a sequel, since Neuro has yet to eaten the &quot;ultimate mystery,&quot; and i absolutely cannot wait for season 2 :D each episode really, was to show us one mystery per episode and let us wait for that kick-ass catch phrase &quot;The culprit is...

Basically the story is then done is a mostly episodic manner, that is every episodes, sometimes every 2-3 episodes, are a new case. But as you progress through the cases and the episodes, you witness a lot of growth with Yako and in the end the mystery of her father's death is obviously resolved. The cases aren't really always that great and are usually pretty easy in terms of solving and predicting, but there's some nice ones, and either way, the cases...are still enjoyable. The whole supernatural aspect of it makes it take a different approach than most detective and mystery shows, which I think is good.Art:The artwork and animation was very nice. The close-ups on Neuro's eyes  and face were always spectacular because they displayed so much detail, but then there would be other scenes where his face would then have a really simple and comedic look at the right situations, which was good. There's also some pretty good angles and visual effects to accompany it all.Sound:The OP is a cool song by Nightmare (same band that did 1st Death Note OP,) which I think a lot of people, including myself, enjoyed. The ED was a nice soft song that always ended the episode nicely. The sound effects and background aren't anything special really, but by no means bad. That goes for the voice acting as well.Character:Neuro is an awesome character...just had to say that first. Anyway, yeah, I think the cast is pretty good. You got this demon detective straight out of hell that uses these cool techniques (777 tools of the underworld) and is pretty damn strong, and a school girl whose greatest love is eating and food and isn't really a good detective at all, yet gains fame as a detective, however she understands human ways very well, which makes her a good asset to Neuro. Then there's the other characters like Godai, Sasazuka, Ishigaki, who all are pretty likable. And then the line-up of criminals and murderers, particularly Sai, who I won't mention much on because I don't wanna spoil anything.Enjoyment:Well, like I said, the murder cases aren't that great, but the supernatural element of it makes the cases still pretty enjoyable. There's some good action here and there, mostly fighting between Neuro and Sai. There's plenty of blood to go around, so if you particularly like that, this won't let you down. And lastly, it is also quite humorous at times, especially when Neuro purposely degenerates Yako and Godai. are still enjoyable.

Now I'm watching Ainex's releases and they...do a really good job, like they do with Persona -Trinity Soul- and how they did with Night Wizard. They are usually the first one out and have good visual quality and subbing accuracy.I would recommend anybody who likes Anime to at least try this series, I know I usually overrate what I watch, but this series definitely deserves a 9. do a really good job, like they do with Persona -Trinity Soul- and how they did with Night Wizard.

That premise sounded interesting to me so I went in...with some interest.The show starts off with my expectations being filled. There is a demon, there is some comedy and there is some mysteries to solve. However the quality of all this is very mediocre. First the detective act feels like its for the younger crowd. They serve the mystery up for you within the first few minutes. Even a 5 year old would be able to tell you who the murderer is. You then spend the rest of the show watching as Neuro looks cool and finds proof to wrap up the case and then listen to some lame morale speech from Yako before finding out it indeed was the person they told you it would be. This continues through the entire series only being interrupted by a real mystery in the form of a serial killer named Sai. I had hoped Sai would bring around a change in pace to the show but it did not and honestly felt like wasted potential. That being said it wasn\'t terrible but if your looking for something like Death Note or Code Geass you will be very disappointed.The demon who cant show himself to humans sounded like an interesting premise, however it seems like they eventually stop caring about that angle. I guess they rely on a few scenes to show that what the viewer sees nobody else in the room can see. The comedy was also limited. It mostly revolved around Neuro picking on Yako and Godai and making a strange face of some kind. I laughed a few times but mostly it only got a smile or two out of me. This all of course wouldn\'t really matter if the show did something well but it seems to stretch itself too far and comes up short everywhere. The characters could have turned this around as they constantly interact with one another and also all seem to have their own backstory which would lead to some interesting interpersonal issues and conversation. However they do not go into much detail with the characters either. Yako who is the main character has probably the most depth out of everyone and all the viewer knows about her is that she is in school, her father was murdered and that she eats a lot. This isn\'t a terrible thing though, shallow characters have their own charm and allow this show not to be too serious and feel more like a slice of life story.Overall the show is just average in every aspect. The art is dated, not bad, but dated. The music was alright but nothing I need to listen to again. You wont be solving mysteries or even laughing though hopefully you will be able to smile and enjoy the guessing game. The characters have their own charms but lack depth which just makes the show feel more relaxed but they interrupt this several times with more serious issues. There is much that could have been done to turn this show from just an ok experience to a great one and that truly makes me sad, but I did enjoy the show and am glad to have finished it, wish it wasn\'t 25 episodes though.

It's original run lasted between October 2nd, 2007 and the 25th of March, 2008 (on Japanese television, of course).The genres include: shounen, supernatural, comedy, drama and mystery.Let's get started then.Story: 10The story of Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is very original. A demon from hell (Nougami Neuro) who feeds on riddles and mysteries has run out of food, since he ate all the mysteries in hell. Therefore, he decides to leave hell and travels to the human world. There he finds Katsuragi Yako, who is deeply saddened by her...father's death. Neuro forces the poor girl to become a detective, then he disguises himself as her assistant, so that he can get easy access to his food. Through the series,we follow Neuro and Yako as they solve various cases, sometimes with the help of Godai, who has underground connections. Most of these are pretty random, but there are some very nice plot-twists too.Animation: 9Madhouse (who also made Death Note and Black Lagoon) simply never fails to deliver. I have never seen a series done by Madhouse lacking in the animation department. Neuro will not make you disappointed, either. It has a very unique style of animation and the character designs are awesome.Sound: 8The OP of Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is &quot;DIRTY&quot; by Nightmare. It's a, to say the least, special song which actually fits very nice with the feeling of the anime. The ED is &quot;Kodoku no Hikari&quot; by Kagami Seira. It's not a bad song, but it doesn't catch my attention like the OP does. The BGM is good and well-executed to fi with the series, which it does.Character: 10This is where this series truly stands out. Almost all characters are very thought out and interesting. Of course, it's the main character that will get most of the praise here. Nougami Neuro, a demon from the underworld, is one of the best protagonists i have ever come across. He is fun to watch with his superior intellect and inhuman powers. His &quot;777 tools of hell&quot; is probably the weirdest arsenal of weapons I've ever seen. Katsuragi Yako acts as a sort of cover for Neuro, as the detective, but she gets some great development throughout the series. Godai is the ex-mob with many useful connections. He is the jack of all trades for &quot;Katsuragi's detective office&quot;. There are of course more characters, but these three will be enough for this time.Enjoyment: 9As you might have understood from the score, I enjoyed this anime a lot. Even the random cases are very enjoyable. The main plot that gets thrown in later in the series is very exiting and interesting, although I have to say that the ending was pretty predictable.Overall: 9Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro is an easy series to overlook, but it is in my opinion one of the best series from the fall anime season of -07. This is definitely not a show to miss, although I can't promise you you'll like it as much as I did.I hope you found my review helpful, and if you didn't please tell me why, so I can improve myself until next time. father's death.

But now that I've finished it, I am SO happy that I decided to see it.  Frankly, this anime left me begging for more. My only complaint with it is that I wish it was a bit longer. Its totally unique and different from any anime that I have ever seen and is truly one of a kind. If you want an anime that is funny, mysterious, cunning and just a little weird all in one, then this is exactly what you are looking for.STORY:The plot isnt too intense, and does...allow for some comedy. The entire story is very episodic in nature, and develops very nicely before building pressure at the end. Most of the cases are, unrelated, but as the story progresses, everything starts to come together into one fantastic plot.ART:The art in this anime was rather colorful and detailed. Madhouse did a great job with this anime. it has a different structure when the air is funny and lighthearted and another type when the aura was more serious. I ESPECIALLY loved when they zone in on Neuro's demonic features.SOUND:Although I did like the opening and the way it was somewhat cynical and fit into the anime, I didn't find the OST's all that memorable. The ending was nice too, and served as a contrast to the opening.CHARACTER:These fantastic bunch of characters are what REALLY make you fall in love with this anime. Nougami Neuro, one of the the protagonists, is one of the most amazing characters I have seen, and also one of my favorite. He is just unique in every way, and he is a huge part of what makes this anime so good. Katsuragi Yako is what seems like your boring old highschool girl that is just there for lame comic relief or something, but as the anime progresses you can see that she is SO much more than that. Honestly she has some of the best character developments in the entire anime.A demon that came from hell to eat mysteries, and a highschool girl who wants to find her father's murderer. They make the perfect team to catch baddies.ENJOYMENT:I can tell you that there was not a single moment in this anime that made me feel bored or unsatisfied.

I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it before. Sure, there&rsquo;s lots of anime that have a demon and average human as the main characters, but in Neuro it&rsquo;s done in a unique way. Plus, the mysteries aren&rsquo;t just solved -- they&rsquo;re consumed. With each progressive episode, the mysteries get more complex and violent -- and so does the relationship between Neuro and Yako. There&rsquo;s a good balance of seriousness and comedy.Animation: It&rsquo;s nothing special, but not a totally horrible mess either. It may fluctuate from high quality to low quality a few times per episode, but it&rsquo;s not distracting.Sound: The opening and ending...are catchy and fitting.

Not all detective stories have an uberly powerful demon came from hell in search of mysteries because it has eaten all of the mysteries in hell. The story progresses in episodic nature, slowly developing in the way, and finally climaxing in the last few episodes. The ending wasn't the best i imagined (left many open doors,) but it allows a continuation for the series, so it's fine by me.10/10Art: Have you noticed how black, gray and white were the primary colors...in Death Note. Do you remember how well it went with the theme. Well, Neuro offers the exact opposite choice of coloring and still ends up being as wonderful as DN. It is colorful enough to slow down my computer on the &quot;eating&quot; scenes. Note that they are both made by Madhouse. Other than colors, the characters are well and uniquely (that a word?) drawn. What you would expect from Madhouse.10/10Sound: One sad thing about Neuro is that it's OST didn't really appeal me. Sure, it's not all bad, but I don't recall any piece of OST from the anime, which doesn't usually happen. Well, I also didn't notice any lack of music, so it's all well. Seiyuu cast is mid-strong, not the best, but good. Neuro's seiyuu (Takehito Koyasu) is also one of my favourite seiyuus. OP is good, but as usual, ED is definitely not good.7/10Characters: Neuro, Neuro, Neuro. He solely can be the reason to watch this anime. Only one word can describe him: unique. Matsuei Yuusei (the mangaka) really hit the jackpot with Neuro, he is simply awesome. On to the other &quot;sidekicks,&quot; your average &quot;living&quot; hair Akane-chan, the oh-so-badass Godai, and your &quot;typical&quot; high school girl whom father is dead and is allied with a mystery-eating demon from hell, Katsuragi Yoko. Oh, wait.10/10Enjoyment: Every once in a while, there comes an anime which leaves me in despair because it has finished and I can't see anymore of it. It continues until I sleep. Well, Neuro is one of them. My first reaction to the last episode was &quot;wow.&quot; But then, on a second thought, it became &quot;Wait a min. Did Neuro just end. Noooooooo! T_T Neuroooooo!&quot; Seriously, we need a second season. It managed to get me laugh quite a few of times, and it was able get serious when it needed to be. I don't usually watch episodic animes, but this exception proved to be fairly entertaining.10/10Overall: As a fan of detective stories and have seen/read many things about them, I can say that this is one of my favourites. Artisticly drawn with an interesting plot and unique characters, Neuro will never disappoint you. Go watch it, even if it's just to get a glimpse of Neuro's personality.10/10 in Death Note.

So far I completed only 16 episode from all 25, but I just have to write this review, 'cause:I just can't understand Why so great scores for that anime? I see here only 8, 8, 8 even 10? In mine opinion it not deserve even mere 6.well- The cases about that demon detective - Nougami Neuro sometimes are not too bad. This anime is pretty light also, but I find the humor in here just horrible and it ruin my mood (of course- that have a reflection of my scores for that anime). If this anime was made more serious or.. with other kind...of humour I think maybe it will be in my favourite... but that way.. just watching it- I'm feeling stupid.Everytime I start to watch new story (or new episode) of Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro and became curious of the end at that story Neuro do something stupid to Yako (For example: it is quite possible every human to die when his neck is twisted from Nero over  an angle of  360 degrees, but Nero do things like that to Yako in every single episode and she is always alive..Is that suppose to be a joke or something?).The Story (7?):The story is about some demon who live in human world as a detective for the sake of searcing misteries whom to eat ('cause that's what he eat). He made a detective teem with Yako (a human girl which father was murdered- case closed as suicide) and a former yakuza called Godai. Yako join the team for the sake of resolving her father mistery. Together with Neuro they search for misteries to resolve. They are also 2 police detectives in that story and one Phantom Thief Sai. From that of point of view the story is almost pretty good..BUT:If that story was made for kids I think- that will explain some of the reiterations (like- the same end to every story when Neuro always win and eat his new mistery), but again... what kind of humour is that? Is it good for kids to think that they can twist somebodyelse's neck without any consequence?If the story is made for someone more mature- what's with that so predictable ending?For whom actually was made this?Maybe only for people whom like the supernatural elements more than everything else.Art (6):The art was pretty normal. Nothing more, nothing less.Sound (8):I actually liked all songs in it.The sound was normal too.Character (6):The characters are unique for human-world, but.. for anime.. I really don't know.Enjoyment (1):If you have time to waste and nothing to do.. and if you like light stories- watch it! There is blood in these stories, but they are not hard to be watched.Like I said STUPID HUMOUR and stupid tools with whom the main hero operate, predictable end of every story. of humour I think maybe it will be in my favourite... but that way.. just watching it- I'm feeling stupid.Everytime I start to watch new story (or new episode) of Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro and became curious of the end at that story Neuro do something stupid to Yako (For example: it is quite possible every human to die when his neck is twisted from Nero over  an angle of  360 degrees, but Nero do things like that to Yako in every single episode and she is always alive..Is that suppose to be a joke or something?).The Story (7?):The story is about some demon who live in human world as a detective for the sake of searcing misteries whom to eat ('cause that's what he eat).

It is also not one of the best series out there either.In a lot of ways, I view this series on an equal footing with Jigoku Shoujo.  Some episodes are extraordinarily good while other episodes lack.Some of the mysteries in the series early on, much like Jigoku Shoujo's first cases, are very bland.  Once you dive into the main plot, the series does start to liven up.In all honesty, it is the characters that make this series and not the story so much.  The story comes as a sort of...context to show off Neuro and to engage in the very dark comedy that literally drowns this series.I feel too that this series deviates from the 'demon' norm in that Neuro doesn't suddenly become touchy feely, like so many of the demons seem to do in series.  Instead, Neuro is Neuro.  He seems to have a solid personality that doesn't shake at the whims of the storyteller and, thus, seems more like a true being than merely a puppet of the story.I think my favorite aspect is that the characters do grow and evolve as the series goes on.  There is a gradual building of layers that happens and, over time, begins to change the characters themselves.I won't go into details but, suffice to say, if you dropped this series early into it, pick it up and try again.  You might be pleasantly surprised by the changes in the characters themselves! context to show off Neuro and to engage in the very dark comedy that literally drowns this series.I feel too that this series deviates from the 'demon' norm in that Neuro doesn't suddenly become touchy feely, like so many of the demons seem to do in series.

The mystery solving and murder cases reminded me of the Detective Conan series- even the story structure! Maybe that's why I enjoyed watching it~Story: 9For me, the story was great! It wasn't the most original plot.. However, it was interesting and kept me on my toes the whole time. To be honest, the set up is quite similar to Detective Conan. Neuro is like Conan- the person who's actually solving all the cases. Then there's Yako who's like Mouri Kogoro- the person who's taking credit for the cases. Finally, there's Sai who's practically Kaitou Kid. However,...Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro takes on a more supernatural theme. Also, despite the similar roles, the characters have completely different personalities.*I only used Detective Conan to compare, because it's a more well-known anime. If you're worried it's too similar, don't be. They're completely different genres of anime! This anime won't disappoint!!P.S. I REALLY wish a season 2 is made! That last episode was such a cliffhanger. I want to know what happens next!!P.P.S. The fact that there was no romance disappointed me :( This is really just my personal opinion- I like a little bit of romance in all anime!Art: 8The art was pretty good. It wasn't overly pretty with massive eyes and such. The art style fits very well with the story and each character's personality. Personally, I really liked the comic-style drawings during the funny scenes!! Yako's expressions are hilarious~ALSO, is it just me or did Neuro seem kind of attractive at times HAHAHA (maybe it's just me sorry)Sound: 8Nothing really special to comment. The sound was good! The sound effects really added to the atmosphere, whether it be intensity, suspense or humour.Also, a round of applause for the voice actors~ Each voice really suited the character!Character: 7The characters were all really likeable- whether they were good or bad. The main characters did lack a bit of originality though. Yako somehow reminded me of Mako (Kill La Kill) and Sasazuka reminded me of Zero (Vampire Knight). Also, Neuro's personality (minus the demon and magic) is a typical sadistic personality that can be found from a lot of other anime. I'm not so sure if that all made sense.However, while watching the anime, I was continuously reminded of characters from other anime.Enjoyment: 8Each and every episode is worth watching.

To properly watch this anime and enjoy it, one needs to start at around episode 5 skip 6 then continue to episode 7 on, and probably skip episode 15 as well. Nothing will be missed since this anime has a different mystery every episode.The show is set up in a very Scooby-Doo mystery like fashion. You only meet around two or three characters per episode and the first person you meet is always the villain. However, the show is somewhat dark in the aspect that someone is always killed....Sometimes youcharacter Sai is involved. Who is also voiced by one of my favorite voice actors, Romi Park (voice of Edward Elric and Toushirou Hitsugaya). Sai is a very interesting character and fun one to watch. His ""mystery"" also one of the most interesting.Often times the show take its too far when Neuro abuses Yako, some of the jokes seem very forced, and at the end, you do feel a little unsatisfie. Sometimes you might find yourself not rooting for the main character( but above i have mentioned to skip those episodes above). But the ideas are fun and the animation is great. You leave with a better impression of the show than began.I would recommend watching this during a rainy day or when you run out of animes to watch.Overall 7 Sometimes youcharacter Sai is involved.

such as the beautiful idol who has managed to sell 3 billion records going further into the 'unconventional'; the two key mains in the series are; a very petite school girl with short hair and a well dressed, uncharming guy who litterally has two unpleasant faces.Story...A demon named Neuro has left Hell and came to Earth in order to seek out 'myseries' - to be more specific, the evil entent behind secretive offenders, as this 'negitive engergy' is his source of food.He selects a schoolgirl named Yako, who's dad as just died under mysterious circumstances to be his assistant, as he picks up on her drive to get to the bottom of her 'mystery' - he's basically just using her and her vunerable position.From then on, the series is a combination of comedy and seriousness; some horror and quirky comedy with character development and plot progression threwout (litterally, each episode); characters 'learning' new things and becomeing wise is a key component within this story - nothing is insignificant.Art...Very pleasant; nice and colourful, changing sceneries, abstract, darkness when needed and neon lighting at times.Characters...Not the usual type.We have a troll as the main who is known for obscure acts of sadism, though he's actually on the planet for selfish, his agenda isn't 'do as much harm as possible' and infact, his presence proves beneifical to the public.We have a teen girl who has been threw a recent tradgedy, yet is suprisingly optimistic; a possitive person with her head screwed on right; she's accepts her new lifestyle, she's egar to learn and can be quite fearless; her relationship with the above seems to be vary from; partner, to friend, to student to hostage.These two (above) are the basis on the series and what makes the 'character' aspect stand out.The two of them are accompanied by a irate yakuza guy who is pretty much, like the feamle lead, in a hostage situation.We also have a cool, calm police officer and his bubbeling, newbie young partner.Enjoyment...Very funny - Scooby Doo style mysteries; the best part is waiting to find out who the offender is and hearing the explianation - the offenders in this are truely bonkers.When serious - As stated, we find out that pretty much everything that happens is improtiant; from the comical tourture, to the 'horror' rich tourture dished out on the badies.Overall...Very balanced and possibly, one of the few anime's out there that could be ranked 'unique'.This is worth watching even if you have read the anime, if you have not read the anime, that's worth reading too, as the two actually complement eachother - though the anime has a 'Geko ending', the ending is still, on a whole, good, whereas there are enough slight (not drastic, but slight) changes to justify starting both from scratch - neither should appear boring. related missunderstanding, no romance in general actually and no drilling into the viewers heads that 'This character is attractive!' - characters are respected for their acheivements and actions;

From the author of Assassination Classroom, Neuro: Supernatural Detective follows the episodic lifestyle of Yako; a girl who is accompanied by a demon from hell, Neuro. Each episode deals with murder cases where Neuro solves the case in order to fulfill his hunger for mysteries. As an added bonus, most murderers transform into demons representing their ugly personality.Most of the anime is just this but manages to make some appeals. For instance, the anime took some liberties in rewriting...events of the manga to serve as a better conclusion. (from what I read the changes were better in the anime)This show is hit or miss in terms of adaptation as the manga later becomes more battle focused with the occasional mysteries, however what this series offers is surrealist horror & a unique lead. Nuero as a character is quite charming as he is selfish & vicious to the point where a friend of mine described Nuero as a ""Shonen Alucard"". His presence alone holds the show along with the various monstrous murders that occur.While it is a detective based show, the focus aren\'t the mysteries but the horror found within them.  Each case brings a creepy tone aided by the much later violent scenes in the series when the antagonist Sai is introduced. One of the downsides of this anime are its supporting cast as they can come off as rather bland. Thankfully the main duo of Yato & Neuro make the show work. Mr.FalconnPunch996 recommended me this series & I personally liked it as it presented a rather disturbing viewpoint of the world. I really wished the anime adapted more if its chapters. The show\'s repetitive but if you want to see something horror based give this series a try. Just be sure to jump to the manga afterwards. events of the manga to serve as a better conclusion.

Just be sure to jump to the manga afterwards.', ""Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro- A series about a girl who lost her father in a murder, or as the police report it, a suicide. This girl is Yako. She is one of the main characters in this series.Story- The story is very unique, though it gets a little repetitive. The story has it's twists and it's comedy moments, along with it's depressing moments. In the beginning, it's hard to keep up with because it starts further along in the series, and jumps back a few times to show the father's murder and to show where Yako met another main character. Besides a few flaws like...those, the series was interesting, it really makes you think in a few scenes. And it's touching.Art- The art isn't the best, but it's good. It would've been better if the art wasn't as 'pointy'; a little more curvy. Theres too many sharp corners in the art. It could've probably looked a little better if it was smoother, and a little rounder.Characters- I personally loved the characters. There's no special attributes to them, that's what makes them so special. They're like typical people, except Neuro, and the main antagonist.Enjoyment- I really enjoyed this series. Probably because I'm the kind of person who likes mystery/comedy/action animes, and this is one of them. It was a very good run.Overall- I give the show a 8.7/10 because of the small problems with the story and art, otherwise it would have been a 10. those, the series was interesting, it really makes you think in a few scenes.

In the episodic format, demon Neuro Nogami drags a highschool girl from murder mystery to murder mystery, solving it easily (often with a deus ex machina from the '777 Tools' - thankfully, there are not actually 777 mysteries in the series) and puppeting the girl to accuse the murderer, who supernaturally transforms into the symbol of their motive and attacks Neuro, who defeats them and 'consumes their mystery' by draining them of life force. The approach is similar to the earlier _Night Walker_ and the later _UN-GO_.The animation & art are unremarkable and somewhat offputting: very dull flat color palette, blurry washed out...animation (despite being from 2007, which is not *that* long ago).Worse, for a mystery anime, the mysteries are absolutely abysmal. The first episode sets the tone - the instant the assistant chef was pointed out masked by steam, I thought to myself, 'I hope that it's not as trivial as the assistant has been murdered already by the head chef and that's his body propped up to provide an alibi'. It was. The denouement of episode 1 was even more bizarre, as the motive was the head chef was selling drug-laced soup (‽) to perfect 'Doping Consomme Soup' which transforms him into a muscular red giant (‽‽‽). If you don't take it seriously, it was actually somewhat funny, so I wondered if MTNN was going to go for an over the top comedy, but no. The following episodes are the same. The mysteries tend to be rubbish, and to not play fair with the watcher, leading to episodes which are either trivial and can be guessed long before the resolution, or impossible and of little interest, either way, of zero rewatch value. (I don't know why people compare this to _Case Closed_ when all the CC episodes I happen to've watched on Cartoon Network occasionally struck me as much better mysteries than pretty much any MTNN mystery, who has an unfortunate fondness for ropes and frozen things as a mechanism.) Motivations are cursory and implausible, to say the least, and the examination of 'heart' is ill done - it is simply impossible to believe most of these mysteries rather than roll one's eyes.This might be OK if there was any real chemistry between the characters, but there isn't. Yako eats a lot and gets insulted by Neuro while Akane wiggles on her cellphone. Yeah, we get it.As dire as the first few episodes are, and I would not blame anyone who watched episode 1 and dropped the series like a hot potato, it does get *slightly* better. The deus ex machinas don't get used as much and Yako takes on more of a role. There are a few nice touches like Yako having nightmares (most detective series neglect that the protagonist is human and would be affected by their work). The mysteries improve slightly, and we see that some of the changes are deliberate and intended to show Neuro becoming weaker and more human, and even some of the weaknesses get attempts at justification - for example, the attempt to rescue all the mysteries' total motive implausibility by appeal to an 'electronic virus' as the first major arc. This first arc did not strike me as satisfactory as it turns into an action-adventure-SF anime but without enough time to develop it or work in any mysteries, and then right after that, the long awaited resolution of the Phantom Thief Sai arc turns out to be... a fight inside a pyramid. We have watched for 25 episodes expecting to find out the mystery of who killed Yako's father, how and why, and at the end we find out.. it was Sai somehow (lol) and it was because his house reminded Sai of his birthplace (‽), oh, and of course Sai escapes. That's it? That's our payoff after 25 episodes of foreshadowing? Talk about a total gyp.So overall, while it improves over its horrible first few episodes, MTNN never reaches the point where it's worth watching. animation (despite being from 2007, which is not *that* long ago).Worse, for a mystery anime, the mysteries are absolutely abysmal.

Most of the arcs (initially, at least) are episodic, wrap up quickly, and have a fun mini-mystery to solve. So if you're looking for something light, fairly humorous, and quirky, encased in a decent mystery, this is something you should watch.That being said, there are several points that led me to give this anime the rating that I did.First, the characters. Neuro (obviously) and Sai are, hands down, the best things about this show. I've only mentioned two. That's because these two are, sadly, the only two really memorable characters in this series. While Yako is...cute, and has a tiny bit of development, it's very clear that Neuro and his sadistically adorable quirks are carrying the show. The other characters desperately needed attention to gain some three-dimensionality, and they didn't really get any.As I've said, the plot tends to be episodic, except in the more serious and better-written Neuro vs. Sai arcs. However, the conclusion and final explanation of events were way too bizarre for me. In an anime about a parrot demon eating mysteries, this is really saying something. My main concern was that the conclusion felt like they picked the absolute craziest set of circumstances that they could imagine and used it to form the basis for the story, which gave prior events a far less awesome spin than I thought they could have done.Also, in everything but the Sai arcs, Neuro's fighting style consists of employing a tool of the demon underworld and completely curbstomping the outmatched criminals. It's very entertaining, but, until the Sai arcs, where these are used intelligently and to superb effect, it's also very repetitive.With all that said, I wanted to give this anime a solid 7 for the amazing Neuro and Sai. But there's one thing that I really, actively disliked about this show, and it's that the criminals are shown to be distorted animal-like monsters when their crimes are exposed. It's not just a stylistic thing, either - they actually acquire strange powers, and other characters comment on the change.This really didn't work for me, because it seemed to be dehumanizing those who commit crimes and saying that the distorted mental state of a criminal is something that is separate from the actual person. In other words, it's not really people committing crimes, because they turn into monsters by doing so. I disagree with this view fairly strongly - to me, the most terrifying and sobering things about criminals is that they *are* people, just like us, and we might conceivably do the same things at any time. The design choice was also pretty jarring. I respect their artistic vision, but for that, I had to give this anime a 6.In conclusion, if you're looking for an entertaining, light anime, with a quirky and unique demon character and fun mini-mysteries, definitely watch Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro. Just be warned - don't expect much at all from the other characters, and be prepared to really embrace the bizarre (*not* including the parrot demon!) where the plot is concerned. cute, and has a tiny bit of development, it's very clear that Neuro and his sadistically adorable quirks are carrying the show.

I was really thrilled when I read this, since I consider CC to be one of the best (if it isn\'t THE best) mystery anime out there. It\'s better than CC, they said. You\'ll love it, they said. Sadly this joke of a mystery anime failed to meet my expectations. Instead, it stumbled to it, all in its drunken glory, expecting me to accept and love this series.If you\'re a fan of mystery and you\'re planning to watch this, then don\'t. As a mystery lover myself, the biggest mistake the anime...made is that the clues and hints aren\'t always revealed to the audience before it is solved. Every time the method of killing and motive are revealed, there are always elements that weren\'t shown, making me feel like the author always pulled these murder stories from his behind.The following is a more in-depth review.*contains minor spoilers*Story: 2     As a ""mystery"" anime, MTNN is episodic, with three or four arcs that span two or more episodes. The episodic stories were absolutely terrible; like I mentioned above, sufficient clues aren\'t shown to the audience, making it impossible for them to immerse themselves into solving the mysteries. Also, only one or two possible suspects are shown each episode, and two minutes (or less) after they are introduced, the culprit is so glaringly obvious, I\'m wondering why the author even bothered putting up a pretense of investigation. If they\'d shown more possible suspects, perhaps the anime would\'ve improved. Furthermore, for adult people who were capable of comiting crimes that allow them to escape suspicion, they were irritatingly childish. Most of the culprits have Chuunibyou; their motives were selfish, irrational, and utterly stupid. Everytime, they are revealed for their crimes, their physical apperance hange to reflect their personalities. The ridiculous design of these changes only serve to reinforce that the character has Chuunibyou, and to make me cringe big time. The only exception to this is HAL, and even then his assigned motive is unoriginal. Another thing the author seems to enjoy using is the ""777 Tools of the Demon World."" Since the possibilities are pretty large, he can make one tool up on the spot to move the story along. What\'s even more pathetic is that most of the time, there isn\'t even any reason at all why a tool should be used, but in the end, it is used. Despite all these faults, the mystery behind the father\'s death, which was teased throughout the series, was one of the things that made me hope that this anime would eventually improve. Two words: It. Didn\'t.*Another thing that really got on my nerves was the animation when they\'re about to reveal the culprit. It would\'ve been amazing as something to increase the tension if there are lots of suspects and you don\'t know who the murderer is. In this anime, it just felt like a mockery of the mystery genre.*Art: 5     The animation was pretty bland; it was neither great nor was it bad. At first, I was amused by Neuro\'s derpface, which was one of the reason\'s I held any hope at all. It got old three episodes in. Action scenes were pretty decent though, as expected of Madhouse.Sound: 2     The OP and ED were surprisingly bland and average for an anime which Madhouse created. Even its OST was bland at best. At worst, the soundtrack feels like it came from a 90\'s cop drama, and I felt that it did not suit MTNN at all.Characters: 2    It wouldn\'t be a stretch to call all the characters in MTNN (except Neuro, surprisingly, and Sasazuki) cliched and oblivious. We have our cliched MC, the pure girl who wants to see good in others and likes to interrupt at crucial points of the story. We have our cliched, tough guy sidekick, who\'s actually really kind. And lastly we have our cliched assistant, who\'s airheaded, is an idiot, and despite all odds has a job as an inspector/police officer. Sasazuki, despite being an inspector, did not express any suspicions that Neuro was the true detective, since he explains all the methods of killing, even if Nougami and the MC had no chances to discuss. Sasazuki didn\'t even suspect him one bit when it was revealed (for an instant, which was then forgotten) that all the suspects said that Neuro was a demon. That\'s all you really need to know about these guys. They\'re very one dimensional, and they don\'t get any character development. Even the MC remained static throughout the show.Enjoyment: 1     From the beginning to the end of an episode, all I want to do is sleep.

Neuro is a demon who comes to the human world to solve mysteries and I would have liked it a lot more if he found a Light Yagami kind of main character.

It leaves you with a very niche group of...people who can watch this (it\'s not really appealing to viewers who are into shoujo anime, but it also wouldn\'t appeal to like, people who are looking for a serious kind of show).The whole ""You are the criminal"" part always makes me cringe - especially when it\'s not even her solving the goddamn case, it\'s the demon that you\'re leeching off of. people who can watch this (it\'s not really appealing to viewers who are into shoujo anime, but it also wouldn\'t appeal to like, people who are looking for a serious kind of show).The whole ""You are the criminal"" part always makes me cringe - especially when it\'s not even her solving the goddamn case, it\'s the demon that you\'re leeching off of.', 'NOTE: I have previously made a review for this series 10 years ago, but it was pretty poorly written and recently I have started reading the manga so I have decided to do a complete review redux. There are also some minor spoilers ahead.Demon Detective Neuro is the first series by Yusei Matsui, an author who later came to prominence with his smash hit comedy series Assassination Classroom. In comparison, Neuro, which is definitely darker in tone seems relatively forgotten. The anime never received an English dub and the manga was never officially released in English, though it was licensed in other languages such as...Spanish and French. So one might wonder, is Neuro a hidden gem which deserves its cult following or does it deserve to fade into obscurity? Frankly while the manga is great and still worth checking out, the anime is a faulty adaptation held back by several issues.First let’s talk about the presentation, the anime was made by studio Madhouse, so you can expect decent animation quality, but don’t expect to be blown away by epic fights and pretty colours. The character designs are also bold looking and easily recognizable with Neuro himself in his true form being the most striking. In terms of sound there are two things that stand out, the opening Theme DIRTY by the band Nightmare, (who have also done music for Death Note and Claymore) is a catchy and surprisingly heavy tune, in comparison the ending theme is a fairly typical sentimental ballad. The other notable thing is the voice of the main character Neuro, the legend Takehito Koyasu known for many roles such as Shinsuke from Gintama, Dio Brando and… Excalibur from Soul Eater. His performance truly steals the show and his manic laugh in one of the later episodes is unforgettable. We also have the main villain voiced by the CV of Edward Elric, Romi Park. The soundtrack composed by Tomoki Hasegawa is surprisingly decent and varied, containing dramatic orchestral tracks, some moody and goofy tunes.But obviously what really matters here are the characters and the story, which centers around the titular Nougami Neuro, a sadistic badass demon who comes to the human world to feed on people’s mysteries and possesses over 777 demonic tools.  As a cover up he sets up a detective agency with Yako Katsuragi, a high school student whose father recently got murdered. At first she seems useless and unremarkable, with her only noticable trait being her appetite for food which puts Luffy, Lina Inverse and Chouji Akimichi to shame. However as the story progresses her character and relationship with Neuro starts developing, though initially their interactions just involve Neuro bullying and torturing her, those slapstick comedy moments feel amusing at first, but they will start getting old and feel inappropriate. It’s definitely an unusual premise and not something typical you’d expect from a shounen Jump manga. Other significant characters include Shinobu Godai, a hotheaded office assistant and former member of Yakuza who likes drinking beer, Akane, a conscious ponytail of a girl buried in a wall, Eishi Sasazuka, a stoic smart detective with name and appearance similar to teacher Onizuka who always acts calm and collected and his assistant Jun Ishigaki, who in contrast acts dumb and childish and likes collecting toys, he’s similar to Matsuda from Death Note. The main cast is definitely memorable, but the villains are a mixed bag.The problems start arising with the story and its structure, if you are expecting something like Detective Conan with a supernatural twist you are going to be very disappointed. In fact the manga author Matsui said in an interview he was not fan of mysteries and wanted to create an unconventional detective manga. So what we get here is a collection of episodic cases where the culprit is nearly always obvious from the beginning and then Yako with help of Neuro reveals the culprit while he explains the convoluted elaborate scheme straight out of CSI which the suspect used to commit the crime. Then Neuro usually devours their mystery and the criminal is arrested. Nevertheless, it quickly becomes very formulaic, especially because almost all cases in the first 15 episodes are murders with the exception of one mad bomber. Other standout cases include two episodes involving an idol singer and a springs episode which contains one of the most hilariously bad national stereotypes in anime. Most villains are shallow and one dimensional and once the case ends they have no relevance to the story. The big exception is the main villain, ""Phantom Thief"" Sai, a murderer who puts people in red boxes and searches for his lost identity. The 3 episodes dedicated to him are by far the most interesting part of the series until we get to the first major arc involving evil artificial intelligence HAL (Where could author get that name from?), easily the highlight of the anime which breaks from the usual formula by introducing way more action and a genius hacker Higuchi, who plays a major part in the story. Then we get a few more cases before the main characters are once more confronted by Sai, the series ends with a decent but open conclusion. So in a nutshell this is basically a mystery series for people who hate mysteries.However, then we get to the manga and we quickly realise that the anime is just a really sloppy adaptation. Firstly the manga was far from complete and was running for just two years when the series started airing so it roughly adapts only the first half up to the HAL arc before the story diverges with an anime original ending. It’s worth noting that there is a dramatic tonal shift in the second half of the manga and the series transforms from a pseudo-mystery series into something quite different and much darker. Unlike many manga which have an interesting beginning  and later jump the shark, Neuro actually gets better over time.But even the material the studio could work with is adapted fairly poorly, while the first half of the manga was still not great, the cases there actually felt a bit connected to each other and there were bits of foreshadowing missing in the anime. There are also many other minor and major differences between manga and adapted material, for example in the manga father’s death is resolved almost instantly in second chapter while in the anime it’s revealed in the finale, still neither version handled such a major plot point particularly well. Many smaller subplots and chapters between cases which served as a break from the action are also missing. The Hayasaka brothers also got cut off from the anime completely.Generally, in the anime the episodes just seem lazily thrown together willy-nilly in random order from chapter to chapter without much regard for pacing and we also get a few anime original cases which are far less interesting, some details from the manga are also omitted so for example it’s not explained how guardians of one of the HAL computers acquired their guns. However, the biggest issue by far by far is in the characters themselves. The interactions between them are also worse and there is a massive lack of development. In the anime Yako is mostly treated as a joke, but in the manga she really grows into a competent detective and Neuro’s character also changes as he tries to understand humans. Godai’s role in the manga is also way more interesting as he leaves Yako’s agency fairly soon.One of the biggest problems is that Yusei Matsui\'s style doesn\'t translate well to visual media. His characters spend large chunks of time talking out loud or in their minds and the action gets disjointed when the dialogue in real-time. The anime also doesn\'t quite capture the series rough but unique artstyle.Ultimately, Neuro is a really botched adaptation of a much better manga, if you enjoyed the anime definitely give it a try. Let’s just hope that with the success of Matsui’s recent series there is a chance for a reboot. Spanish and French.

Saint Seiya: Meiou Hades Elysion-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3515/Saint_Seiya__Meiou_Hades_Elysion-hen,"[""Story and CharactersEven though it's six episodes, the pacing is very even and all the characters are present and united. And during the final battle, there are some cool things that do happen that you have to see to for yourself like with what also happens in the previous oavs. And the ending is also pretty amazing and it's very rare that Shounen uses the ending that it uses, but it is kind of ambiguous, but yet respectfully satisfying. But I feel if you have some familiarity with some of the prior works to Kurumada Masami, specifically Ring ni Kakero, I thought the ending was...very fitting to how he does things.The anime demonstrates excellent themes on what it means to be a God and what it truly means to be human thus emphasizing on the value of life. Granted this can be done in just about anything, but I like how it includes the use of Gods of all beings in conveying this, and that even Gods are capable of making errors and falling to the same mistakes of human nature. And overall, most of the Hades oavs have a theme of what defines human nature in relation to sin, and judging people based on them whether man or God.What I also like is how Athena is used in the end. This isn't really a spoiler considering that most of the time, the saints are trying to give her her cloth, meaning her armor. And of course she needs that for combative purposes, and it's nice to see that she has this role for once and has a different kind of use in comparison to how she was mostly used throughout the duration of the franchise. I feel her brief moment really outshines all of that. And I think throughout most of the franchise, her usage was also very faithful to the original mythology of Athena.Thanatos and Hypnos, though their presences iare brief, they did have quite an impact as well by what they had to offer as villains. Even though Thanatos is the weaker and more brash of the twin minions, he does some things that none other villain of Saint Seiya has done which you also have to see to find out.Art and AnimationWell, the quality of the animation still retains from the last oav, the explosiveness of the action is still fresh with the new two new villains and their moves are really cool. The designs of the villains are very intimidating with their pale skin tone, dark clothes, and non pupil eyes. The designs of the cloths are well detailed, very shiny, and still appropriately compliments the body frames of the characters and the execution of the action. The design of Hades' armor is excellently detailed with the joints, compliments his figure and gives room for his wild hair, and looks appropriately mobile. Try to combine the rough features of Guts' berserk armor and Griffin's dignified and shininess with his current armor in the Berserk series, but of course black and with some bigger wings, and that's the best way I can describe Hades' get up. And Athena's armor is also excellently animated and brightly colored, and the design accurately reflects the gimmick of the goddess she is inspired by.Another quality that I kept on pointing out is the lighting. In this series, it takes place in a more Heavenly utopia like environment, so the place is filled with flowers and clear skies. The flowers stick out and the lighting in contrast to this just really sticks out to me considering that the villains are the lords of darkness, so I found a very nice ironic twist to that along with what was mostly presented in the previous oavs. So for this nice twist along with another unpredictable twist I appreciated which you also have to see to find out.Music and Voice ActingThe new voice cast from the previous oav is also back. And I feel even though this series is shorter, I felt the newer voice actors for Shun, Hyoga and Athena were present enough to have me form my opinion on them. Hyouga's new voice actor is Miura Hiroaki. He actually does a good job of capturing the original performance of Hashimoto Kouichi, though I think his voice is deeper. I think the character lacked any significant dialog or soloquies that really defined the character to really make you evaluate him 100%, but I think he does a good job with what he has to offer. The only voice change that I could ever find justified is of course that of Shiryu since Suzuoki Hirotaka has passed on. His newer voice actor is Sakurai Takahiro, the voice of Cloud from Final Fantasy VII and Suzaku Kururugi from Code Geass. Suzuoki just has this really distinct voice that always brought a unique charisma and authority to his character. Sakurai really tries hard to emulate that performance but it will never compare to how Suzuoki did it. I think the new voice actors are good in their own ways, but they will never compare to the original performances whether they're 16 or 60.As for the music, the background music is still the same from the oavs and TV series so nothing left to comment on that, other than it's still a nice touch in still trying to maintain the overall spirit and identity of the franchise. Megami no Senshi is still the opening theme and I already talked about the awesome qualities that song has in my review of Inferno. But the ending theme, Kami no En, is very impressive. It is one of the few songs that captures the Greek mythology inspiration, as well as the Utopia environment and atmosphere it takes place in, and also does what the Saint Seiya soundtrack does best, talking about the themes of love, hope, and unity.OverallWell, all I can say is you're going to watch one helluva an ending, though it is kind of open ended. But not many authors today are too ballsy in my opinion and the way it ends, it's just awesome. Granted there are some loose ends, but it ends to a point where you know the characters have all developed. I know there is a new installment of Saint Seiya called Next Dimension which is Kurumada's official work. I can't comment much about it yet but I would love to see where Saint Seiya can go from how it ends. I heard Kurumada wanted to make one more story arc, but disputes with publishers and declining sales had to make him end it at this point which is why I think it felt a little open ended, but despite that, it's well concluded since they fought one of the baddest Gods of all time. very fitting to how he does things.The anime demonstrates excellent themes on what it means to be a God and what it truly means to be human thus emphasizing on the value of life.

It also doesn't help that it features other cheap plot contrivances such as Pandora's sudden change of heart or Seika suddenly getting over amnesia. One minor thing that disappointed me as well was the lack of the Athena Exclamation. It's introduction in...the first act of the arc seemed like it would be foreshadowing for a later use, plus Thanatos being unaffected by it would really push forward the idea of how strong he was. Instead, we get an anime-exclusive scene of the Gold Saints just using their signature attacks.That's not to say I dislike everything about the arc. The arc does a far better job at presenting the power of a God and the sense of tension as well as race against time are far better than in the Poseidon Arc. It was also good to see Athena be more than a damsel in distress and Seiya's fate at the end provided a pretty solid sense of repercussion to the climax (at least until both Next Dimension and Omega ruin this aspect).As for characters, art/animation and sound, there's not much to say. The latter two remain unchanged from Inferno, whilst the characters don't really offer much personal engagement beyond a few highlights such as the reveal of Seika pushing forth Seiya's character arc or the supporting cast such as Marin and Shaina having their moment to shine. The three main villains of Elysion are overall bland in personality and only memorable in design.As a whole, the Hades Arc started off good, but was ultimately disappointing by not being able to avoid some of the series pitfalls. It was definitely better than the Poseidon Arc due to a genuine sense of loss, establishing the power of a God far better and not sticking quite as heavily to the Sanctuary Arc structure, but was still nowhere near the peak of the series and remains average overall. The highlights and it's ending still allow it to be a better final arc than most Battle Shonen can hope to achieve, though that's really not saying much.Overall ranking for both Elysion and the Hades Arc as a whole - 5/10 the first act of the arc seemed like it would be foreshadowing for a later use, plus Thanatos being unaffected by it would really push forward the idea of how strong he was.

The clashes with the last specters quickly end, and there is a good flashback with Pandora (perhaps the only good thing about this final piece).The battle is in the Elysium, against the gods, Hades and two of his followers, Hypnos and Thanathos, obviously much stronger than the protagonists. Here we have gods, very powerful beings, who can\'t kill 5 kids (because the protagonists can\'t...die at any cost), and not even marginal characters left on Earth, ridiculous. We then have Poseidon who, after having sworn revenge before being sealed, suddenly becomes good and helps the protagonists, sending the golden armors. Gold armors that will be destroyed in 2 seconds by Thanathos, yeah. Then Seiya, and following his friends, make yet another senseless miracle, divine armors, and defeat the twin gods easily. Clash with Hades, the final boss, fast, fight dominated by him, until ""the power of love"" arrives. THE END.Besides being totally devoid of logic and disappointing as a final, it leaves the impression of a hasty closure.Without mentioning, Seiya\'s sister.

But no, Seiya\'s sister is found at random, and they don\'t even meet.

I am one of those who grew up watching this series on television until the ""Poseidon"" saga and then I had to lose track of it until now, but let\'s return to the present.Strictly speaking of these ""Elysion"" OVAs, they were very brief and with a forced history rhythm. I do not consider that the battles seen against Thanatos and Hypnos, including Hades himself represent their true powers, since it would...finally take at least 3 or 4 more chapters to develop good battles, but they cut everything due to the time that these 6 chapters gave. In the same way, the plot in general was felt, as in the case of Pandora\'s Death, which is quite questionable, being very superficial and transmitting nothing to the viewer. Also added the partition of Seiya\'s sister in all this, it seems that they put her only to be the focus Thanatos, since there were never any real clues of her and suddenly she appears with Marin as if nothing, only to give an excuse to the Power Up of our protagonist.Last but not least, the battle against Hades. Honestly it did not feel like such, it was just an average battle that they had to put in by obligation to end at once, and it did not really matter if this was able to reach some kind of empathy to the viewer, they just put it in and that\'s it. The ""death of Seiya"" is so fast that they don\'t give time to anything if he wants to say goodbye as he deserves. I clarify that I am aware that there is a film from ""Tenkai-hen"" that is later, but no matter how much they make up this does not remove the disappointment that it leaves.Version en Español:General: (6,5 / 10)La verdad es que para ser el arco ""final"" de toda una historia que perduro durante tanto tiempo y trascendió entre distintas generaciones tenia muchas mas expectativas al respecto. Soy de los que se crió viendo esta serie por televisión hasta la saga de ""Poseidon"" y luego me toco perderle el rastro hasta ahora, pero volvamos al presente.Hablando estrictamente de estas OVA ""Elysion"", se las vio muy resumidas y con ritmo de la historia forzoso. No considero que las batallas vistas contras Thanatos e Hypnos, inclusive el mismo Hades representen sus verdaderos poderes, ya finalmente llevaría al menos 3 o 4 capitulos mas desarrollar buenas batallas, pero recortaron todo debido al tiempo que daban estos 6 capítulos. De igual manero se sintió la trama en general, como en el caso de la Muerte de Pandora que es bastante cuestionable siendo muy superficial y no transmitiendo nada al espectador. También sumado la partición de la hermana de Seiya en todo esto, que pareciera que la pusieron solo para ser el foco Thanatos, ya que nunca hubo pistas verdaderas de ella y de repente aparece con Marin como si nada, solo para dar una excusa al Power Up de nuestro protagonista.Ya por último y no por ello menos importante, la batalla contra Hades. Sinceramente no se sintió como tal, solo fue una batalla promedio que debían meter por obligación para terminar de una vez, y no importo verdaderamente si esto era capaz de llegarle algún tipo empatía al espectador, solo lo metieron y listo. La ""muerte de Seiya"" es tan veloz que no dan tiempo a nada si quiera de darle una despedida como mereciera. Aclaro que estoy al tanto de que resta una película de ""Tenkai-hen"" que es posterior, pero por mas que maquillen esto no quita la desilusión que deja. finally take at least 3 or 4 more chapters to develop good battles, but they cut everything due to the time that these 6 chapters gave. In the same way, the plot in general was felt, as in the case of Pandora\'s Death, which is quite questionable, being very superficial and transmitting nothing to the viewer. Also added the partition of Seiya\'s sister in all this, it seems that they put her only to be the focus Thanatos, since there were never any real clues of her and suddenly she appears with Marin as if nothing, only to give an excuse to the Power Up of our protagonist.Last but not least, the battle against Hades. Honestly it did not feel like such, it was just an average battle that they had to put in by obligation to end at once, and it did not really matter if this was able to reach some kind of empathy to the viewer, they just put it in and that\'s it. The ""death of Seiya"" is so fast that they don\'t give time to anything if he wants to say goodbye as he deserves. I clarify that I am aware that there is a film from ""Tenkai-hen"" that is later, but no matter how much they make up this does not remove the disappointment that it leaves.Version en Español:General: (6,5 / 10)La verdad es que para ser el arco ""final"" de toda una historia que perduro durante tanto tiempo y trascendió entre distintas generaciones tenia muchas mas expectativas al respecto. Soy de los que se crió viendo esta serie por televisión hasta la saga de ""Poseidon"" y luego me toco perderle el rastro hasta ahora, pero volvamos al presente.Hablando estrictamente de estas OVA ""Elysion"", se las vio muy resumidas y con ritmo de la historia forzoso. No considero que las batallas vistas contras Thanatos e Hypnos, inclusive el mismo Hades representen sus verdaderos poderes, ya finalmente llevaría al menos 3 o 4 capitulos mas desarrollar buenas batallas, pero recortaron todo debido al tiempo que daban estos 6 capítulos. De igual manero se sintió la trama en general, como en el caso de la Muerte de Pandora que es bastante cuestionable siendo muy superficial y no transmitiendo nada al espectador.

I can\'t really put my finger around it, the fact that they spent multiple episodes fighting 2 gods when they already spent episodes fighting the Spectres, the ""God Clothes"" came out of nowhere, Hades gets beaten in a super anti climatic way with Saori beating him with the power of ""love"". Seiya\'s sister coming out of nowhere and despite Sanctuary attacking Marin for being Japanese, no one ever even spotted or even noticed that there was another Japanese woman in Sanctuary before she showed up, a...lot of the other characters mostly being sidelined and were just cheerleaders. The amount of times characters die, get brought back and then die again. The ending being super anti climatic.Honestly, by the time I was done this part of the arc, I was glad it was all over. Not because it\'s bad but it was really starting wear out it\'s welcome both the arc and the tropes the series loves to pull as a whole like characters dying but then coming back then dying again, Saori getting kidnapped or is a damsel in every arc(seriously the reincarnation of Athena in this series was basically a purple haired Princess Peach), and the fights being special move spamming and then the characters saying, ""the same move doesn\'t work twice"" just to spam the same attacks again, all of it was just starting to get tiresome. I did wish the ending was better so I could\'ve felt satisfied when I got to the end but I am left underwhelmed.I get a lot of the behind the scenes drama regarding the series, and the whole thing reminds me of something that would happen in Marvel and DC with editors disagreeing with what the creators want but all of it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.I wish I can say I got *something* from watching the Hades OVAs and the Overtrue movie, but all I get is just is ""why did I bother?""

I am sounding like a downer but that\'s how I felt.', 'In a race against time, the Saints must save Saori and keep Hades from plunging the universe into the Great Eclipse! This addition to story is less climactic than the explosive ""Inferno"" arc, but the narrative does its job and fills in all of the open plot holes, though it feels like it\'s dragged out a little bit too long. Pandora\'s past is finally revealed and her arc ends with the audience getting closure about the purpose of her existence in the series!⚠️ This review of Saint Seiya: Meiō Hades ～ Elysion will contain spoilers, this segment with be the third part out of the...three Hades anime adaptations ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis season starts off with a bang, with Hyōga facing off against a villain that rivals the intrigue of Pandora and Hades himself, Minos! And then, Pandora\'s past, which was teased in previous chapters is finally brought to light, we find out that Pandora has become so wicked because after the reincarnation of Hades appeared in the castle of the underworld, all of her attendants and family were slaughtered upon his arrival. This also explains her half lover, partial mother-type of fixation on Hades! The omen of Hades was originally bred when Pandora opened the seal that contained Thanatos and Hypnos, the gods of Death and Sleep. It\'s interesting because the two of them play a pivotal role in ""The Lost Canvas"" series as well.Thanatos then murders Pandora, after she betrays Hades to help Ikki. During the cast\'s rescue of Athena, Shaina, Jabu, and Marin (and many others) come to help out — seeing those two in the narrative again was a nice throwback to fans of the original series! Seiya ends up defeating Hades, saving Saori, to prevent the world from being purged into the Great Eclipse! It\'s a nice conclusion to the ""Meiō Hades"" continuum — though, wrapping the story up in ""Inferno"" wouldn\'t have hurt either! Truth be told, ""Elysion"" might have been slightly better if it had been a six-episode OVA, rather than a full-length, thirteen episode saga!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Tomoharu Katsumata (director of the ""Inferno"" and ""Elysion"" arcs), notable works:* Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime ✅* Captain Future* Cutey Honey ✅* Dai Yamato Zero-gō* Daikū Maryū Gaiking* Daisōgen to Hakuba (""The Princess and the White Horse"")* Devilman (1972)* Entaku no Kishi Monogatari: Moero Arthur* Ginga Nagareboshi Gin* Hashire Melos* Kagayake!

Like the colorful tragedies in ""Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime"" — Shun Andromeda descent into the shoes of Hades was done with style and a dense atmosphere! I appreciate the level of craftsmanship put into each subsequent scene, classic director! Impeccable work on the series, the last two chapters of ""Meiō Hades"" feel as though Mr. Katsumata was genuinely passionate about the Saint Seiya franchise!Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅✅✅Masakazu Morita as Seiya Pegasus, notable roles:* Ki-ja (""White Dragon""), Akatsuki no Tona* Claire Stanfield, Baccano* Kazuya Hiramaru, Bakuman.

Yes, Saint Seiya is a huge franchise, but it doesn\'t have the same kind of modern accreditation as something like Lupin III does, so to see such a famous and young actor filling the shoes of Shiryū shocked me! As you can tell by Takahiro Sakurai\'s filmography, he\'s a really talented seiyū, so it goes without saying that he was brilliant as Shiryū! I would compare the role to Kusuriuri (""Mononoke"") and Giyū Tomioka (""Kimetsu no Yaiba""), because his performance is very stoic and subdued. Amazing work, Mr. Sakurai is doing the late Hirotaka Suzuoka justice!Yūta Kasuya as Shun Andromeda, notable roles:* Oren and Kamioren, Super Dragon Ball Heroes* Gokotai, Tōken Ranbu ✅✅Commentary: Casting Mr. Kasuya as Shun Andromeda was a great choice for the character! I have only ever heard him in ""Tōken Ranbu"" — but the character is very youthful sounding and cute, and I think that translates well into Shun... even though this is the season where Shun transforms into the diabolical Hades, lord of the underworld!

I have echoed the same sentiment in my more recent ""Skip Beat!"" review, but Katsuyuki Konishi is very soothing to listen to. I should have mentioned him more when I wrote about ""Macross Frontier"" — his characterization of Ozma Lee made the character feel very congenial and helped create an attachment to the world (the voice acting in ""Macross F"" is SS+ tier). I also grew up loving Sōbi Agatsuma (""Loveless""), so there\'s that! Amazing work, as always!Takumi Yamazaki as Mū Aries, notable roles:* Yata, .hack//GU* Hans Kleif, A.D.

Some of my favorite performances from him were Yuji Naruo (""Burn Up""), his iterations in ""Burn Up W"" and ""Excess"" are similar to the Kintarō Ōe character in ""Golden Boy"" — and I really enjoy him as Fumimaro Ayanokōji (""Detective Conan""), because how can you not like an eccentric police inspector with a pet squirrel? Amazing job, as always!The ""Meiō Hades"" three-part series is worth checking out for any fan of the original series: ""Soul of Gold"", ""Saintia Shō"", and ""Omega"", on the other hand, are series that I would advise to watch at your own discretion! The highlight of the conclusion was a) cameos from characters like Shaina and Marin b) Pandora\'s past, her feelings towards Ikki were also pretty touching, too, and c) Seiya\'s devotion towards saving Saori, during the last few episodes! I rate ""Saint Seiya: Meiō Hades ～ Elysion"" a 5/10!Saint Seiya: Meiō Hades ～ Santuary  ★★☆☆☆Saint Seiya: Meiō Hades ～ Inferno ★★★☆☆Saint Seiya: Meiō Hades ～ Elysion ★★★☆☆ three Hades anime adaptations ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis season starts off with a bang, with Hyōga facing off against a villain that rivals the intrigue of Pandora and Hades himself, Minos! And then, Pandora\'s past, which was teased in previous chapters is finally brought to light, we find out that Pandora has become so wicked because after the reincarnation of Hades appeared in the castle of the underworld, all of her attendants and family were slaughtered upon his arrival. This also explains her half lover, partial mother-type of fixation on Hades! The omen of Hades was originally bred when Pandora opened the seal that contained Thanatos and Hypnos, the gods of Death and Sleep. It\'s interesting because the two of them play a pivotal role in ""The Lost Canvas"" series as well.Thanatos then murders Pandora, after she betrays Hades to help Ikki. During the cast\'s rescue of Athena, Shaina, Jabu, and Marin (and many others) come to help out — seeing those two in the narrative again was a nice throwback to fans of the original series! Seiya ends up defeating Hades, saving Saori, to prevent the world from being purged into the Great Eclipse! It\'s a nice conclusion to the ""Meiō Hades"" continuum — though, wrapping the story up in ""Inferno"" wouldn\'t have hurt either! Truth be told, ""Elysion"" might have been slightly better if it had been a six-episode OVA, rather than a full-length, thirteen episode saga!—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Tomoharu Katsumata (director of the ""Inferno"" and ""Elysion"" arcs), notable works:* Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime ✅* Captain Future* Cutey Honey ✅* Dai Yamato Zero-gō* Daikū Maryū Gaiking* Daisōgen to Hakuba (""The Princess and the White Horse"")* Devilman (1972)* Entaku no Kishi Monogatari: Moero Arthur* Ginga Nagareboshi Gin* Hashire Melos* Kagayake!

Like the colorful tragedies in ""Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime"" — Shun Andromeda descent into the shoes of Hades was done with style and a dense atmosphere! I appreciate the level of craftsmanship put into each subsequent scene, classic director! Impeccable work on the series, the last two chapters of ""Meiō Hades"" feel as though Mr. Katsumata was genuinely passionate about the Saint Seiya franchise!Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅✅✅Masakazu Morita as Seiya Pegasus, notable roles:* Ki-ja (""White Dragon""), Akatsuki no Tona* Claire Stanfield, Baccano* Kazuya Hiramaru, Bakuman.

Yes, Saint Seiya is a huge franchise, but it doesn\'t have the same kind of modern accreditation as something like Lupin III does, so to see such a famous and young actor filling the shoes of Shiryū shocked me! As you can tell by Takahiro Sakurai\'s filmography, he\'s a really talented seiyū, so it goes without saying that he was brilliant as Shiryū! I would compare the role to Kusuriuri (""Mononoke"") and Giyū Tomioka (""Kimetsu no Yaiba""), because his performance is very stoic and subdued. Amazing work, Mr. Sakurai is doing the late Hirotaka Suzuoka justice!Yūta Kasuya as Shun Andromeda, notable roles:* Oren and Kamioren, Super Dragon Ball Heroes* Gokotai, Tōken Ranbu ✅✅Commentary: Casting Mr. Kasuya as Shun Andromeda was a great choice for the character! I have only ever heard him in ""Tōken Ranbu"" — but the character is very youthful sounding and cute, and I think that translates well into Shun... even though this is the season where Shun transforms into the diabolical Hades, lord of the underworld! Powerful acting as the character!Hiroaki Miura as Hyōga Cygnus, notable roles:* Slade, Bōken Ō Beet* Zarbon and Ganos, Dragon Ball Kai and Super* Aikka, Oban Star-Racers* Matagu Shidō, Onegai☆Teacher and Onegai☆Twins ✅* Shūsuke Chitose, Oretachi ni Tsubasa wa Nai: Hadairo Ritsu Kyūwari Zō!?* Dione Whip Snake Plasma, Saint Seiya Omega ✅* Kōjirō Shindō, Seikaisuru Kado (series)* Wataru Minakami, Sister Princess: Re Pure* Shigure, Taishō Mebiusline: Chicchai-sanCommentary: I haven\'t heard many roles that Hiroaki Miura has performed in, but his work as Hyōga Cygnus is actually pretty dang good! I would say that I slightly prefer Hyōga\'s original voice, but Mr. Miura does well with the shoes that he has to fill.

I have echoed the same sentiment in my more recent ""Skip Beat!"" review, but Katsuyuki Konishi is very soothing to listen to. I should have mentioned him more when I wrote about ""Macross Frontier"" — his characterization of Ozma Lee made the character feel very congenial and helped create an attachment to the world (the voice acting in ""Macross F"" is SS+ tier). I also grew up loving Sōbi Agatsuma (""Loveless""), so there\'s that! Amazing work, as always!Takumi Yamazaki as Mū Aries, notable roles:* Yata, .hack//GU* Hans Kleif, A.D.

Who would have thought that they had the SAME seiyū! Despite Mr. Yamazaki not being as active in the voice acting industry, the few roles that he does pick up here and there are very striking! I remember thinking how good M\'Quve\'s voice sounded in ""Gundam: The Origin"" and now, I know why!

Romeo x Juliet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1699/Romeo_x_Juliet,"[""What can we expect from a title that says Romeo x Juliet? Probably a cheesy and draggy remade version of the original story that has no dept whatsoever.But I was utterly wrong. Simply bear in mind that this is the Anime Version of Romeo and Juliet, and expect what you'll expect from most anime for eg, fantasy. I'm no fan of Shakespear's work but I do know the general outline of the story and the important scenes such as the balcony which audience will get to enjoy during the course of the series (although I'm guilty of laughing at that part).Story wise -...Firstly, I'm very impressed by the various climax and exciting moments in this series. The first 10 episodes or so will keep you on your toes while tugging your emotions along with the sweet and tragic moments of our main characters. Following episodes then mellow down, and just when I thought it's gonna get boring here forth the story picks up again and you just have to keep watching. ie. damn high priority. However, you may find yourself with a big &quot;huh?!&quot; at the last few eps. Yes there's where the Fantasy kicks in although if you have watched enough anime, you'll know that this is a typical storyline and thus befitting for this series as well. In general, the story was well remade for an anime indeed.Art - The style may be a little hard to stomach for some but fret not, you'll get used to it in 1 or 2 episodes' time. The background was beautiful in some scenes especially the extensive flower beds. In fact, during the course of watching this series, I actually felt that it's well drawn because the characters doesn't have oversized eyes (or boobs) or overly skinny limbs, unlike some other animes.Sound - Needless to say, the opening is one where you'll keep listening to even after completing the series. Images from the anime will then naturally float into your mind. Yes that's how influential Lena Park's version of You Raise Me Up is.Character - For this portion, I'll really have to give the director a big hug. Setting the side characters aside, the mental development of both our hero and heroine was well-balanced and developed. The romance between the 2 was nicely presented while slowly telling the audience how they fell in love. This part was absolutely perfect because a plain love-at-first-sight thing would cause the story to lose its meaning and turn me off quickly.Despite it being a great anime, I've gotta admit the presence of my fan-girling moments during the exceptionally sweet and touching moments which were strewed here and there. So fellow babes, watch this to ignite the shoujo heart in you! Firstly, I'm very impressed by the various climax and exciting moments in this series.

So fellow babes, watch this to ignite the shoujo heart in you!"", ""Going into this series, I admit that I had braced myself for more of a tragedy than this.  Having acted in the original play, I know just how depressing and plain ol' emo it can be.  But this is truly something different.Story:  First off, the story is much more moving and uplifting than I was expecting.  There were times when I was actually moved to tears by the responses of characters to each other.  The story just barely follows Shakespeare's original story.  Basically put, if you're looking for an anime rendition of his story, you're looking in the wrong...place.  This is not to say that the story is bad in any sense of the word.  Rather, I think that Shakespeare would be proud of this expansion to his original story.Art:  I'd have to say that the art section is the most disappointing of all.  Thankfully, this isn't saying too much.  The art from front to back is very well done.  Some of the townsfolk felt a little bit cheapened but I would count this as making sure the story is focused on who it should be.Sound:  I have to admit, I'm extremely impressed with the sound from this anime.  From the musical compositions to the sound effects to the voice acting to one of the better renditions of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (performed by Lena Park).  As far as audio goes, darn impressive.Characters: Only a couple of characters weren't all that impressive.  However, all of the key players are very well developed.  All of the seiyuu who performed did an excellent job indeed.  This really helped to bring out the characters personalities and brought life. place.

It is still running at this point in time, and has yet to be licensed Stateside.Romeo x Juliet is a twenty-four episode anime that was produced by Gonzo (famous for their work on Gankutsuou and Saikano) and directed by Fumitoshi Oisaki (this was his first major work as a director).  It ran from April 4th to September 26th, 2007 on Japanese TV,...and, contrary to Funimation\'s giving subbers a cease and desist (which was on supposedly on behalf of Gonzo\'s requests for them to enforce Japanese copyright laws), the anime has NOT been licensed Stateside.Story: Fourteen years ago, on the floating continent of Neo-Verona, the Montagues led a coup against the Capulets, and slaughtered the entire family, except for a young girl and her servant.  The girl, in the meantime, has been bought up as a boy, Odin, and kept in hiding, occasionally going out as the masked vigilante the Red whirlwind.  On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the day when her true identity is to be revealed, she meets Romeo, the son of the Montagues...As you can tell, this is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the story.  And, honestly, it had the chance to be good.  However, the story has issues, and lots of them.  And to cover them requires some SPOILERS, so read ahead at your own riskFirst of all centers in the adaptation of the story.  It\'s absolutely bare-bones: two star-crossed lover from rival families who die. I\'m not a Shakespeare purist at all, but dear GOD, they fucked a lot up.  They can\'t decide when to use Shakespearean dialogue or when to adapt it, or when to keep scenes from the original play in just to remind people that yes, this is an adaptation.  And for the recored, they fucked up the balcony scene in the extreme.  I\'m sorry, but you have to be really trying with a vengance to mess it up.Another major problem in this is the characters.  Gonzo might have been able to pull this off if they\'d kept the original personalities from Shakespeare.  Instead, Romeo becomes a naive whiny little brat who waxes philosophically (and unconvincingly) about justice and freedom and peace once he is sent to work in the mines by his father (Maoist China, plz?), Juliet can\'t decide whether she wants to be a shoujo heroine destined to lead a revolution and avenge her parents or a whiny little Mary-Sue moping over her angsty past and her TRU WUV with Romeo, not to mention that she\'s supposedly uber-skilled with a sword, but makes incredibly stupid beginners mistakes at several critical times, and Tybalt, probably my favorite out of the whole lot, is dark and brooding and actually doesn\'t coddle Juliet, unlike most of the cast.  Other characters from other Shakespeare plays are thrown in haphazardly, but don\'t hold your breath waiting for them to be like in other plays; they\'re all butchered versions of their former selves (like most everyone else from the original Romeo and Juliet), most of whom are fawning over and coddling either Romeo or Juliet or both.  Background stories for some major characters (such as Tybalt and the generic evil tyrant Montague) don\'t come until later in the series, and when they do, it\'s just more WTF (Montague is a son of the Capulets and got adopted into the Montagues and backstabbed his way to the top in order to get his revenge on the Capulets for mistreating his mother, who was, in fact, a whore; and Tybalt is apparently the son of Montague and a Capulet woman - again, WTF?!)  The biggest issue with characters is the fact that NONE of them get any development; they\'re all one-note personalities running around in circles for most of the series.This, in turn, is compounded by the issue that, for most of the series, THERE IS NO PLOT.  It\'s either Juliet running around with Romeo in puppy love, angsting, or attempting to lead a revolution but failing at swordfighting when she\'s supposedly amazing at it, while Romeo either runs around with Juliet, tries to kindly let down his arranged fiancee, or starts to realize just what a douche his father is.  Gonzo tries to build the series on Romeo and Juliet\'s TRU WUV, but the most that it is is puppy love, as they never meet for anything more than six minutes, yet this is enough for them to decide to run away together about halfway through the series and marry each other and set up house in a pastoral village out in the middle of nowhere.  (...Then again, it was kind of like this in the original play, so they got that aspect down, to some degree.)  They get captured, though, and Romeo goes off to the mines to have a slight development arc that makes him even more annoying at the end of it, and Juliet goes off to finally lead that revolution (which is instigated by something so fucking EASY that it\'s a wonder they didn\'t try this years ago, let alone the other five times that the revolution failed in this series!).  And when the revolution comes about, it\'s glossed over to make room for the random tree that apparently keeps Neo Verona in the sky and that is dying because of the Montagues, and apparently Juliet is the next sacrifice to keep it alive.  This brings about the situation in the last two episodes that I bought up back in the third paragraph.  To say the least, this thing is a fucking MESS.In short, the whole story is made of FAIL.  There are bits of redemption that come through in Tybalt here and there, but all in all, this was just made of suck.  And you wonder where it comes from, because on the one hand, you\'ve got stuff like Saikano, and Bokurano, and Gankutsuou (which was an EXCELLENT adaptation), and then on the other, you\'ve got THIS.Art: Neo-Verona is absolutely beautiful.  Gonzo really tried to emulate classical Italian Renaissance architecture in its construction, and they did it well.  The winged horses that show up here and there in the series are pretty neatly designed and executed as well.The character designs could\'ve been done better, I think.  Most everyone in this show looks pretty generic -- well-animated, for the most part, but fairly generic.  And there are times when it was pretty obvious that they were trying to save budget with pan shots, still frames, and glossing over fight scenes.  The animation quality dropped every once in a while, too.Music: The background music for this was a study in extremes: it was either melodramatic or overdramatic string orchestra, to match the ""epic"" fight scenes and ""dramatic"" revelations, or soft and gentle string and piano numbers, to match the ""tender"" moments and the angst.  All in all, it took the suckiness to whole new places.The two versions of the OP and its instrumental, a cover of Josh Groban\'s ""You Raise Me Up"" by Lena Park, were used at several points in the series, and even if I didn\'t really like where it was used, I liked the songs themselves.  The first ED, ""Cyclone"" by 12012, was a pretty nice rock piece as well.  I didn\'t like the second ED all that much, as it was another female emo ballad, which we kind of already had in the OP.Seiyuu: Overall, the seiyuu for this did a good job in portraying their characters, even if I hated their characters\' guts.  Props especially to Tybalt and Montague\'s seiyuu, who pitched their voices so that they matched, something I didn\'t recognize till I saw them in scenes that happened one right after the other, which was a hint to a major (if slightly WTF-ish) plot point.Length: Honestly?  I think this series shouldn\'t have even been able to get off the ground -- whoever greenlighted this should probably get fired.But, in the long run, this was just way too long.  I was starting to get sick of this around episode 13.  If they went and retooled the whole damn thing (and maybe took care of the issues with the plot and the characters), they should\'ve been able to wrap this up in about sixteen to twenty episodes, and had a chance of it being decent, too.Overall: A pretty, well-acted series that, unfortunately, is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the original has nothing resembling a plot for most of its entirety, and when it does get a plot, it\'s quite WTF-ish, one-note characters that, for the most part, you will HATE with a passion by the third episode (except maybe for Tybalt) and music (save for the OP and the first ED) that doesn\'t help its case.Stay as far away from this series as possible.Story: 4/10Art: 6/10Music: 7/10Seiyuu: 8/10Length: 4/10Overall: 29/50; 58% (F) and, contrary to Funimation\'s giving subbers a cease and desist (which was on supposedly on behalf of Gonzo\'s requests for them to enforce Japanese copyright laws), the anime has NOT been licensed Stateside.Story: Fourteen years ago, on the floating continent of Neo-Verona, the Montagues led a coup against the Capulets, and slaughtered the entire family, except for a young girl and her servant.

As a lover of tragedies and angst, I've always liked the original Shakespearian play well enough, despite its many flaws. Unfortunately, if the original play had many flaws, then this incredibly loose adaptations has them tenfold.STORY - There's no hiding from it. This series is a horrible bastardization of Shakespeare's play and retains very few similarities beyond character names, references, and the fact that Romeo and Juliet have the purest and most cliche love for each other ever! That said, the changes made are interesting, if nothing else. The fantasy elements don't seem important at...first, but devour the series at the end, which I found very unpleasant and unnecessary. Indeed, the second half the series, because that's where most of the major divergence from the original play occurs, I found to be less entertaining than the first. Everything just got very repetitive after a while and I found myself not caring at all about the fate of the characters, which is never a good thing.But even the story for the first half of the series wasn't very impressive in general, and even now, I'm not sure why I even bothered to finish off the series. The pacing was haphazard and there were far, far too many redundant scenes involving Romeo and Juliet's apparent infatuation with each other, not to mention certain character repeating themselves a thousand times, as if you didn't already know what was going on. I'm all for the romantic fluff, but come on, this is stupid. In summary, there was nothing great about the story of Romeo x Juliet at all, and that's considering I did like the original well enough. I suppose then, if you really didn't even like the original, you wouldn't find anything of interest here at all.CHARACTER - I didn't really like any of the characters in RxJ. It was really kind of sad. I was especially disappointed that Mercutio's role was diminished greatly until near the end of the series and even then, he was not the character he was in the original -- upsetting because there, he was my favorite. Not to mention that he was incredibly out of character. Tybalt was similarly unrecognizable, but at least he remained Juliet's cousin, unlike Benvolio, who was no longer Romeo's cousin. Romeo and Juliet themselves were kind of... eh. Well, Romeo was a great, big pussy with that cliche sense of idealism and justice. This made him incredibly annoying for the entirety of the series, and I found it hard to sympathize with any pain and suffering he went through.Juliet was probably the most interesting character in the series, which really isn't saying much, but hey. Because she was forced to dress like a man all her life (to keep her identity a secret), she had a lot of boyish qualities about her and was therefore a little more badass than her original counterpart. This made it kind of interesting, but as the series progressed, she lost her male persona and her stereotypical girly qualities kind of took over, including lots of ridiculous heartbreak/lonely scenes that were full of ridiculous.I found the stark good guy/bad guy division in this series to be incredibly boring. There didn't seem to be very many shades of grey and it was basically CAPULETS GOOD, MONTAGUES BAD, or at least, Lord Montague was the definition of EVILLLLL. This was painfully obvious in all interactions between Romeo and Lord Montague (his father).  Cliche character personalities are cliche. They tried to rectify this a little at the end by giving Lord Montague some pathetic sobstory to explain why he was the way he was, but it wasn't very convincing at all, and I certainly wasn't impressed.ARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I really dislike the style RxJ is drawn in. The noses are just ginormous, and I don't like it. :( Other than that though, the animation in the opening is bloody gorgeous... too bad it doesn't carry into the series! Overall, I'd say the animation in the actual episodes was pretty average, maybe on the lower end of average though. I was especially not fond of how they treated equine anatomy, but that may just be me.MUSIC - The opening theme for RxJ is a Japanese cover of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (which has apparently been covered more than 125 times, according to Wiki). About half the music in the series was also this song, including an English cover by the same singer, and various instrumentals. Most of the other music was pretty negligible, probably because this theme is what stands out the most. It's a pretty song though and the artist, Lena Park, has a very nice voice. The end theme is okay, but nothing amazing.DUBBING/VOCALS - I saw this entire series subbed. Nothing stood out as good or bad, so I guess average all around.OVERALL - As you can see, this was a pretty mediocre series all around, and it's no wonder it wasn't very popular at all. Like I said, I still don't understand exactly why I got so hooked (I saw the entire series in about three days), especially since I'd recognize its sub par quality from the very beginning, but I did, so I guess there has to be some redeeming qualities about it... I just can't really think of any right now. But that might be because I really hated the ending, which I found incredibly lame!

Now, I for one find that there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but for those who are either expecting the famous classic or cannot bear to see an exploratory remake, this series is NOT for you.Okay, that out of the way...Romeo X Juliet is a fantasy spin on its namesake with adorable characters and a team of well placed seiyū- including my personal favorite Ryōtarō Okiayu (e.g: Byakuya from Bleach). Much like the play...it is based on, this series holds a combination of romance, drama, and conflict. However, unlike Shakespeare's original piece, the various plots and stories within (there are about 3) could actually stand on their own.Sticking true to its predecessor, Romeo and Juliet are nobles from opposing households who fall in love and as a result must embark on numerous obstacles in order to be together. The twist to this tale, aside from the fantasy element, is that the bloodline of one household has been almost completely eradicated by the other, and its sole survivor is pressed to take revenge not just in retaliation, but for the good of an entire country. Combine such a journey with the conflicting hearts of the story's protagonists, and those that support and are against them, and you come out with a potentially interesting tale. Unfortunately, the series was not able to follow through on such potential, and came up lacking.The romance aspect, which is the story's backbone, does not have the intense passion and heart throbbing intrigue as one would expect from anything associated with 'Romeo and Juliet'. Rather, it comes across as very forced, and until the story's end it may have been better for everyone involved had the two lovers stuck to simply being friends.Another of its plot - remember I said there are about three - seems not only heavily out of place, but down right ridiculous as its presence is what determines the fate of the anime's hero and heroine...nope, I will not say what it entails as that alone would be one major spoiler.Another reason why the story was unable to realize its full potential, lays with the horrendous character design of Juliet. It is obvious that the female protagonist was meant to be shown as a strong and capable female, but instead she comes across as flat, worthless, selfish, and highly annoying. This may be the reason that the romance between her and Romeo failed to come across with any sort of intensity, as her personal character was so lacking that she is the last person best suited for a someone like Romeo. Romeo, with his genuine heart, spontaneity and naivety, comes across as so real and immensely lovable, that to hand him off to one such as Juliet is a moral felony. Unlike Juliet's superficial emotions, Romeo's feelings come across with such immense depth that I can say he is the only one of the two who really knew how to love, and was in love.The other characters are very noteworthy. Once again, I must point out that since things have been changed from the original play, do not be surprised that it affects the characters as well. However, despite their change, the main elements that made them unique in Shakespeare's original, still holds very true to them in the series. It is easy to get caught up in how drastic the changes are, but if you take a breather and step back, you will see that it really works for them - the core is still the same.My personal favorites, aside from Romeo, are Francisco (the story's bijin because you know there just had to be at least one) and Curio - Juliet's bodyguards who do indeed lash out at the heroine when she is being fickle (much to my pleasure),  Willy - who is very noteworthy as you can say he depicts the role of Shakespeare and it is this experience that has caused the original tale to come about, and Antonio - Juliet's pint sized, side-kick with a heart of strength and gold.The Art in the series is nothing to rave about. It is simply Decent where the main characters are the only ones who get much artistic attention (which is far cry away from being detailed), and people in the background are portrayed with bland outlines and fillings. The backdrop - buildings, landscape and etc...range from Poor to Decent as one would expect much more from a fantasy setting. The color is not as bright and whimsical as it should have been, given its genre and setting, and things do appear painstakingly bland.The Music was a disappointment. There is barely, if anything, remarkable about the soundtrack. There is nothing that will captivate and reel you in. There are no tunes that will make you feel the anguish and beauty of love and the character's situation, and there is nothing riveting for moments of battle or dark scenes.All in all, it was quite a chore to sit through 24 episodes of this. Things did not start to get interesting (at least, as interesting as it could get for this series) until about the 10th episode and then it fell yet again. I was very happy when it ended.It's important to note that my dislike for the anime has nothing to do with the changes to the original piece - If anything I really enjoyed that much and I honestly think that Shakespeare himself would applaud it as well...this coming from a Shakespeare fanatic. It is poor because it had such great potential, such a talented staff, but it did not follow through. it is based on, this series holds a combination of romance, drama, and conflict. However, unlike Shakespeare's original piece, the various plots and stories within (there are about 3) could actually stand on their own.Sticking true to its predecessor, Romeo and Juliet are nobles from opposing households who fall in love and as a result must embark on numerous obstacles in order to be together. The twist to this tale, aside from the fantasy element, is that the bloodline of one household has been almost completely eradicated by the other, and its sole survivor is pressed to take revenge not just in retaliation, but for the good of an entire country. Combine such a journey with the conflicting hearts of the story's protagonists, and those that support and are against them, and you come out with a potentially interesting tale. Unfortunately, the series was not able to follow through on such potential, and came up lacking.The romance aspect, which is the story's backbone, does not have the intense passion and heart throbbing intrigue as one would expect from anything associated with 'Romeo and Juliet'. Rather, it comes across as very forced, and until the story's end it may have been better for everyone involved had the two lovers stuck to simply being friends.Another of its plot - remember I said there are about three - seems not only heavily out of place, but down right ridiculous as its presence is what determines the fate of the anime's hero and heroine...nope, I will not say what it entails as that alone would be one major spoiler.Another reason why the story was unable to realize its full potential, lays with the horrendous character design of Juliet. It is obvious that the female protagonist was meant to be shown as a strong and capable female, but instead she comes across as flat, worthless, selfish, and highly annoying. This may be the reason that the romance between her and Romeo failed to come across with any sort of intensity, as her personal character was so lacking that she is the last person best suited for a someone like Romeo. Romeo, with his genuine heart, spontaneity and naivety, comes across as so real and immensely lovable, that to hand him off to one such as Juliet is a moral felony. Unlike Juliet's superficial emotions, Romeo's feelings come across with such immense depth that I can say he is the only one of the two who really knew how to love, and was in love.The other characters are very noteworthy.

Don\'t expect Romeo X Juliet to be like the original Shakespeare play. This review, is written by a person who never read the play but has researched enough about it. Arguably, all the characters in this anime are made differently, unintentionally or not, from their counterparts. And from these traits we get an awfully plentiful disagreeing opinions.Now for a detailed review...Story: 6The discussion of this part is going to be longer than the others because its the core of the anime, being an ""adaptation."" Let us begin with the basics;...the original Romeo and Juliet is a very romantic tragedy with intense passion and drama of two very young lovers from enemy clans. And undeniably, it could be the most famous love story written, romanticizing love at a very high level. Also, the play has many social and societal issues that are heavy for younger people.But, Romeo X Juliet defied the themes of the original by setting a different, lighter mood through a fantasy world. It was not made to adapt the original at all. The given conflict of the Capulet and the Montagues\' dispute is briefly introduced to give way to additional plot lines such as oppression of the masses, heroism and coming of age. In context, this anime does not fall short of creativity in interpretation and twists in respect to the Shakespeare\'s play.And of course, the heart of the story is the love between Romeo and Juliet- romance. And I can say that made a good job in creating interesting sweet and innocent love story between the two characters through memorable cinematic scenes. It was further made good by many emotional lines and dialogues, both original and quoted from the play itself, that are appropriately romantic.Those wonderful aesthetic qualities combined with the challenges the two must face warms up the interesting and the well-paced story.However, though it has many notable rare qualities, its full of inconsistencies and wasted potential. I repeat, a lot of wasted potential; foreshadowing and the plot itself. Somehow, this anime introduces a lot of unconventional and promising conflicts, especially at the beginning, that disappointingly, unexplored further or left hanging. The Capulet and the Montagues\' dispute was rather shallow and offers cliched character involvement which will be elaborated later in the review. Other notable examples could be the new characters, duty and a possible forbidden love.The anime has a bad habit of introducing something big and exciting, and suddenly replacing it with in-character yet obvious internal conflicts, and gets resolved in a manner that\'s nothing brilliant. In par with this, many sub-plots have thin links with the main focus of the show. And most probably, the greatest weakness of the anime was the short climax build-up that lacks intensity. And the ""climax"" itself, a poor attempt to adapt the ending of the original, is totally unrelated to the path leading to it. Lastly, there are some important plot devices that makes very little sense at all.But one thing makes all of these work: Romeo and Juliet. Their fairy-tale like romance is just so addictive because of its innocent nature. Ideally, they\'re in love, but in a mature perspective, its an obvious infatuation and a very compatible friendship. Its not intense, passionate and dark but rather the opposite.  And of course, if they\'re together, they make it look that everything will work out. Well, the series did work out because of them, the anticipation of a different ending is a driving force to finish the series.Pure romance is excellent, everything else that complements it are mediocre.Art: 8Artistically, this anime has done very well in dramatizing the themes with an excellent opening. Not only that, as I mentioned, cinematography and the bright mood of lovely scenes made its romance element noteworthy. However, the setting, the clothes, the building designs, appropriate they be, are nothing exceptional or new for they are based of from real life designs, except the pegasus perhaps. Romeo and Juliet\'s color schemes work well andare memorable.Animation is another downer. It was inconsistent at most.Sound: 9The opening song itself ""Inori (You raise me up)"" by Lena Park raised the score of this anime. It was beautiful, intense and well performed and placed in appropriate scenes in different themes. Disappointingly, the endings songs are pale in comparison with it.Background music is as inconsistent with the story. It is very touching, light, mellow with Romeo and Juliet scenes and anything concerning romance. It adds up to the feeling of love in many scenes and makes them more memorable. So; the light romantic element itself is again portrayed exceptionally, everything else seems so bland and lacking.Character: 7A Code Geass Review has this line but I guess it will be very appropriate to put it here too:""All the world\'s a stage,And all the men and women merely players;They have their exits and their entrances;And one man in his time plays many parts..."" - ShakespeareWilliam itself is in the anime, a nice caricature. Though he has minimal involvement he his comments are a nice homage and perspective to what what happening.The characters in the anime are different and can be considered ""twisted"" versions of the original. Let us begin with the main protagonists; Romeo and Juliet:Juliet is probably the true heroine of the story and she is very tradition defying one. She\'s considerably lacks maturity, evident from her views, actions and emotional responses. Yet, her strength and capabilities in leadership and combat pushes a fairly well development on her side. And being torn between her duty and her feelings for Romeo, the way she overcomes the hurdles of of these internal struggles is something that only few female characters achieved. The used metaphor for actions, also for her love and determination she shared with Romeo, the ""wind"" suits her role in stirring a revolution and going against the odds. She\'s apparently more level-headed than the original Juliet.Romeo too, is a very unique prince, because his role of a child of an influencial/evil person, a kindhearted noble who advocates reform, well mannered, naive and innocent nature are the usual stereotypes for lead heroines: That\'s right, mainly princesses. But he fitted his role well and it\'s in tandem with his idealism and pure, young love for Juliet. And amazingly,none of these traits badly affect his male protagonist image, but rather it makes him more lovable and adorable. On the other hand, the real Romeo is impulsive, violent and too passionate according to some sources.Romance worked out very well between the two, but again, mostly everything else is utterly mediocre. One big flaw is the lack of intense reaction from the other characters regarding RXJ love. It should be outrageous, scandalous, disappointing, shocking- all kinds of emotions to further juxtapose love. But all the characters are lacking in that area so the challenges RxJ face aren\'t romantic in nature themselves but rather situational or societal. Personal issues are always defeated by love. And like what I explained earlier, those conflicts have wasted big potentials.The best example of poor character involvement is the repetitive ""Montagues are evil"" and ""The Capulets must be destroyed."" And the reason for that? Cliches...Through all those negative attributes, the side characters are not that bad at all. There is the presence of nice best friends like Benvolio and Cordelia. Loyal protector with interesting little secrets and personalities like Curio and Francisco are very likable. The cast from the original play is certainly ""animated"" here, as alternate persons. Although the background people are decent enough, some of them made no contribution to the overall drama; just creating additional insignificant situations.Enjoyment: 8This is very opinionated and based on my preference; I had high hopes for this series but I was very disappointed. But I can say that I did enjoy it, especially the lovely scenes between RxJ. It succeeds in making the audience experience the kind of love that is shared between the two. I makes people ""fall in love.""Overall: 7 the original Romeo and Juliet is a very romantic tragedy with intense passion and drama of two very young lovers from enemy clans.

As it turned out, I am, however, a fan of Romeo X Juliet.This is NOT your ordinary melodramatic love story.  This is an adventure.All of the characters are presented well and integrate with the story seamlessly, allowing this fictional world to brim with life, with living, breathing characters.  Romeo and Juliet are portrayed as strong and brave protagonists that dynamically grow through each episode.  The Capulets...quickly become likable comrades plotting against the Montagues through perfect camaraderie, and this coupled with Romeo and Juliet overcoming regular adversities kept me watching.  You can\'t help but care for them all.  And the romance isn\'t sappy, but captivating and without a single blemish in its execution.  Best of all, there are no fillers; each episode is dense with quality content.Yes, the anime might not adhere to Shakespeare\'s version to the T, but I loved the enhancements: Juliet as a cool Zorro-like figure, Neo Verona set in the skies, and especially the flying pegasus!   The visuals are fantastic, from character design to setting detail and imagination... everything!  Be sure to watch this one on a large screen.  And the opening, with Lena Park\'s rendition of ""You Raise Me Up""... a slice of heaven right there.  I wasn\'t a fan of the ending though, and the more magical aspects of this anime (e.g. the tree near the end) did not seem to fit very well.Please try it.

For example... flying horses?The story is extremely well played out. The only reason why I didnt rate the story any higher was that sometimes, the fantasy elements were too much, and didnt always fit in *spoiler* (Escalus). Only at the very end do all the elements fit together. Although almost everyone knows how a Romeo...and Juliet story should end, you cant help but anticipate what twist Gonzo will throw in. Most of the story's details are different from the original, but all the underlying themes are there.The art is beautiful. The character designs are different from commonplace anime designs, and the backgrounds are amazing.The music is amazing. The opening theme suits the anime very well. The insert song in episode 7 was AMAZINGLY placed and well done... brought me to tears. The ending songs are also good, but at first they dont seem to fit. But as you sit and listen to it and think about the episode.. it just feels right.I liked the characters the most in this series. One thing I didnt like about the original story was the love between Romeo and Juliet. It seemed more like infatuation, and there was no development of love between them. In this adaptation. there is actually love. You see the characters struggle and love each other so much. Actually, I havent seen such good relationship development in anime for a while (and this includes romance animes).

Thankfully the anime series is a whole lot better.Romeo X Juliet is a extraordinary anime series. There is the same story of two waring families, and the two children from the families falling in love. There are so many things that make this a great anime series. First the story, sure there's the same classic story, but GONZO...added much more and new twists to the story. The world the anime series takes place in is wonderful. A mysterious land floating in the sky, winged horese, and of course the Tree called Escalus. The mystery behind the floating land is the real story. The love story, between Romeo and Juliet is just a added benefit.The characters were also amazing. GONZO brought many changes to them, adding more life to them than in the classic play. Characters from Lady Portia(Romeo's Mother), William, Ophelia, and many more.Next is the music, which is excellent on par with Fullmetal Alchemist, but a notch below Cowboy Bebop.Finally the animation is done by GONZO.

But i must applaud the effort put in by the studio in adding a lot of extra detail while still being able to maintain the original storyline. Myself being a fantasy lover was immediately taken in by the flying horses and mythical tree. I think that they made the story more interesting and enhanced the mood,especially the drama in the show. So in terms of the story it was quite well done in my opinion and should not be taken lightly because...of its title.The artwork was fairly good, although i don't pay that much attention to the artwork,there were certainly no noticeable flaws in the animeand the characters were drawn quite well.The Songs in the show were quite an interesting selection. The opening was a surprise to me in that i never imagined there would be japanese version of the song &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, but it fitted well with the anime. The ending was more upbeat then the opening which i squite different from your usual anime but i guess i dont detest it since its something different fro a change. The inserts of the english version of the opening helps to enhance the mood in the story and her voice is amazing.The Characters is of course what makes the story so great.However, in this anime too much focus is on the main characters and the supporting characters do not get much showtime, so it is a bit onesided. But they still used the supporting character well to create the setting i shant spoil it.It is also interesting to see William in the anime acting as if the story actually originated from this anime and his presence is another interesting feature of this animeI thoroughly enjoyed this anime because i myself am a romance-drama anime fan. But i found it different from the original shakespeare version and it draws me in. The conflict and burden of the names that the two must carry draws in the audience and the ending is somewhat satisfying even though it is meant to be a tragedy, it was portrayed in a manner that seems like a happy ending which is good because i hate those open endings.Overall, it is a good anime worth watching and should not be judged based on its title, i hope this was helpful to whoever reads it, its only my first review though. of its title.The artwork was fairly good, although i don't pay that much attention to the artwork,there were certainly no noticeable flaws in the animeand the characters were drawn quite well.The Songs in the show were quite an interesting selection.

The early episodes showed the potential to be an exciting and imaginative spin on an old classic; but it wound up being dragged down by serious pacing problems and a plot that was all over the place. There were too many things that seemed to happen for no particular reason other than they needed a dramatic plot development at that moment.Sometimes a mediocre story can be saved by the characters.  The characters in this series are likeable enough and several have the potential to be interesting, but most of the time their development is too lacking or rushed...to be satisfying.  Particularly frustrating is Juliet herself, whom they try to present as a 'strong and spirited heroine' through the old shoujo shorthand of having her dress as a boy and swing a sword around; but she always seems to forget how to use it and trip over her own feet any time Romeo, Curio, Tybalt, or any other guy needs to dramatically come to her rescue.Even as simple eye candy, the show doesn't quite measure up.

One look at the opening credits of this anime suggested that I may have judged it too hastily, and 24 episodes later I knew I was definitely wrong.It\'s a difficult task to improve upon the original story of Romeo and Juliet, a tremendous tale full of romance and tragedy. This anime adaptation pays a lot of respect to Shakespeare\'s famous work, and yet also manages to throw in so much of it\'s own ideas. Unlike the...1996 American film adaptation which was set in modern-day Verona, the anime changes the setting to Neo Verona, an aerial continent. Incorporated into this new fantasy setting are elements such as dragon steeds and enchanted trees. Rather than having two warring families on equal grounds, the anime instead depicts the Montagues as the dominant family, who force the Capulets into hiding for several years. The main theme of the story remains the same, with an ill-fated love between Romeo and Juliet accompanied by a rebellion by the Capulets towards the Montagues. However, the anime also includes many action scenes which gives the series plenty of energy and excitement. No matter how much one wishes against it though, the anime stays true to its roots and provides a tearjerker of an ending.The animation in Romeo x Juliet is excellent during the first half of the series, but unfortunately there is a dip in quality during the second half. The character models are simple but effective, whereas the city of Neo Verona is shown in great detail and full of vibrant colours. The action sequences are also well animated.The musical score supports this anime very well, and most of the tracks are used at the most suitable moments to create uplifting, dramatic, or sad atmospheres. The narrative is also superb, keeping in tone with Shakespeare\'s original play by including lines which use an older style of English as well as many of his quotes. The opening song (Inori ~ You Raise Me Up) is extremely soothing and fits the overall theme of the story perfectly. However, the first ending song doesn\'t suit this anime at all, whereas the second ending is fairly average when compared to the opening.The characters in Romeo x Juliet don\'t disappoint either, and a lot of them feel like a breath of fresh air to the story. If you\'ve seen or read the original play, forget what you already know about Mercutio and Tybalt, because they (among a few others) have different backgrounds and personalities. There are quite a number of new characters introduced, including one who is basically Shakespeare himself! The side characters are interesting to a certain extent in their own little ways, and provide decent support to the main leads. Surprisingly, the background of Romeo’s father is explored in quite a bit of detail, which partly helps to explain why he acts like a tyrant. Then we come to Romeo and Juliet, who as expected get the most screentime and development out of the whole cast. The length of the series allows it to take the time to develop each of the two main leads individually and thoroughly; Romeo has a strong desire to help others despite a lack of affection from his tyrannical father, whereas Juliet masquerading as a hero of justice is a great idea and provides another dimension to her character (she can handle a sword just as well as anyone in this show). The chemistry between the two feels very realistic and heartwarming, and never too cheesy.Romeo x Juliet is a great series to watch, feeling familiar yet new at the same time. The main part of Shakespeare\'s play is still here, but there are so many other aspects to it too. The pacing of the story slows down a little during the middle section (due to the two leads embarking on their own separate adventures for a while), but any other flaws aren\'t noticeable enough to detract from the enjoyment too much. Definitely recommended. 1996 American film adaptation which was set in modern-day Verona, the anime changes the setting to Neo Verona, an aerial continent.

Definitely recommended.', 'I figured that I should write my first review with one of my favorite stories I\'ve ever seen/read. Romeo x Juliet is one of the most romantic and tragic anime ever because it\'s derived from Shakespeare\'s play, Romeo and Juliet, duh. But the anime\'s story is a little bit different than Shakespeare\'s, with the addition of mythical creatures and magic to add even more drama into an already dramatic story.Story: The love story between Romeo Candorebanto Montague and Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet. But instead of their parents being enemies and forbidding their love, the Montague family killed the entire Capulet family, except for...Juliet who grows up to be the people\'s hero of justice, ""Red Whirlwind"". Meanwhile, the Montague family is a tyranny, and cruel to the people, therefore making them Juliet\'s opponent. And in the midst of a rebellion, Romeo and Juliet\'s destinies cross, and the all so romantic and tragic love story between Romeo and Juliet begins. I loved the anime version as much as I did the original play, and I LOVED the original play! There were moments... No, the entire anime was tugging at my feelings, there were many scenes where I couldn\'t help but cry soo much!!Art: The art was the same as your typical anime made around 2007, not clear and beautiful, but a more realistic looking art. The characters were designed just the way I had imagined them when I read Romeo and Juliet. I loved the quiet symbolism of poison, roses and beautiful angelic wings.Sound: This was amazing! Romeo and Juliet had the perfect voice cast for them! The music certainly made all the sad moments in Romeo and Juliet even sadder! The song, ""You Raise Me Up"" was beautiful and tear-jerking! Oh my goodness when it played at the end of the anime, I cried soo much!!Character: A large variety of characters that could have been developed a bit more, or gotten a bit more screen time. But, there\'s my 2 favorites characters Romeo and Juliet, and that is enough for me. The romance and tragic level between Romeo and Juliet destroys my heart everytime I watch/read about them.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it so much, and I cried so much watching this anime. The anime isn\'t the same as the Shakespeare play. Romeo x Juliet has more mythical creatures and overdramatic sad scenes that grasps the attention of the audience more than Shakespeare\'s original play. Romeo x Juliet is definitely one of the greatest romance stories ever, and one of my favorite stories ever! Everyone must watch or read Romeo x Juliet!

Everyone must watch or read Romeo x Juliet!', ""SOUND/SONG/OP AND ED SONG...The OP song of this anime is very suitable for the theme of the love story of Romeo and Juliet. I don't think any other music would perfectly fit this very emotional and somehow classic anime.However, the ED song for the first half of the anime is a rock/loud music, contrasting to its OP song, and it's not that suitable. However, I cannot totally judge this song because I never tried to listen to it completely. The second ED song is, i think, more suitable, because it has a nice melody, and the meaning of the song fits the story.ART/ANIMATION:The flying horses...there are not consistent in terms of art and animation. However, the art/animation is not that bad and the characters were drawn well, and the conservativeness of the story is seen in the art of the characters.STORY:I haven't read Romeo and Juliet, so this review is not that dependable to those who read it. But the way the story was put in the anime is very nice because even my little sister, who doesn't love serious romance animes, watched it and was very touched and very affected by it. The end is unpredictable, but because this story is famous for its tragic end, you would really want it to end the other way. You would want to have something, a sort of a miracle, to twist its story, because you feel you're a part of it, you feel like you're going to be greatly affected if it would end tragically, if it would end the original way.Every end of an episode keeps you hanging and asking for more. However, on the 22nd/23rd episode, you would want to end it there.The original story is translated in a nice way, because I understood the gist of the story.CHARACTERS:I liked the the way they retained the names of the characters.As of their roles, I found Juliet strong, but becomes weak when it comes to love, and is very indecisive when her love for Romeo will be greatly affected with her decision.Romeo is the perfect guy a girl can have, as presented in this anime.The antagonists are effective antagonists because they can make you angry and pity the protagonists.About the supporting characters, I think they supported the main characters well.CONCLUSION/OVERALL:This is a very nice and classic romance anime, and it will keep you asking for more of it. You know, I didn't plan on writing a review for this, but after I finished watching it, I was greatly affected, even though 2 days passed by already. It's still fresh on my mind...You must watch this anime if you want simple and sweet romance love stories, without the Ecchiness, and with just pure feelings... ^_^ there are not consistent in terms of art and animation.

If that doesn\'t sound appealing or you were expecting Romeo & Juliet: the Noh Drama / [High School] Musical, you may leave.  The rest of you...have a seat.Story [6/10] - It should go without spoiling anything that the focus of the story is our hero Romeo and our heroine Juliet falling in love and the events that transpire before and as a result of this.  Towards...the beginning of the anime, the creative liberties taken and new characters introduced are refreshing, exciting, and it\'s great to see the lens focused with Juliet as the main character.  The fantasy-like setting is fun.  It starts out having a great mix of the romance, gripping backstory, action, and character development.  Some shows use that momentum and ultimately finish out strong...but Romeo X Juliet sadly is not one of them.  Had the second half been as good as the first half this score would be much higher.  But if you appreciate good plot with an equally strong resolution rather than anime cliches, you like me will have an imprint of your face on your palm by the end.Art & Animation [5/10] - Oh boy.  At TIMES the art an animation quality are outstanding.  R x J is sometimes here, sometimes there.  Sometimes there are beautiful backgrounds with well drawn characters (the very beginning and very end are good examples), and at other times characters proportions, ESPECIALLY faces get completely screwed up the moment the character simply turns their head to face a different direction.  In one episode, I thought to myself ""they must have spent all the money for this episode on animating Juliet in that scene, because in this next scene Francisco\'s nose isn\'t on right..."" I always try to look at animation in perspective of when it was made, and at times R x J has the animation production value of a show made in 2001.  Gonzo and GK are both at fault here, because Gonzo is guilty of this in the past, and we all know they could have been better than that comparing to some of their other titles (even ""moeblob"" titles).Sound (OST, OP/ED, Acting) [9/10] -The OST is the true gem of this title.  Whether or not you ever watch this show, you owe it to yourself to listen to if not OWN this soundtrack.  Sakimoto-sensei is a man of exceptional talent, compared often to Uematsu Nobuo even though their styles are pretty different (probably by association to Final Fantasy, as his other famous work is the OST to FFXII).  The often fully-orchestrated tracks bring an unbelievable amount of live into the characters, at times almost TOO much.  But in this case, can\'t have too much of a good thing.The OP is also fabulous, naturally pretty much a cover of ""You Raise Me Up"", but Korean-born Lena Park sings it with vigor and when she hits the high notes, the timbre and beauty of her voice really shine.  Excellent staffing choice there.  The EDs are enjoyable enough to listen to, the 2nd more than the 1st, but are overall pretty forgetable.Lastly, the voice acting.  Well I\'ll just say... Gonzo sure as heck saved money in this department.  They probably spent most of their budget on Sakimoto-sensei.  The female seiyuu are composed of a lot of unknown talents, and some of the best seiyuu in the production (Iwao Junko, Saito Chiwa) play very minor roles.  The male seiyuu do a little better save for one gripe.  Those who pay attention to the ""acting"" part of voice acting may agree with me, but it takes true grit to put up with Romeo\'s voice for 24 episodes (let alone Mizushima-san\'s voice in general but that is an opinionated digression not suited for this review).  That aside the award for best role in the show goes to Ishii Kouji for his roles as Montague.  Truly brings out, and makes you hate, the character which brings me to my next section...Character [6/10] - At the beginning of the show, this really is around an 8 or a 9.  The anime-original characters are very welcome, and whether or not you agree with the roles chosen for some similarly named characters from the play, the backstory of characters such as Tybalt are well written.  Montague especially seems to be the perfect villain in the beginning, and continues to be through the later half.  However...all semblance of character development seems to crumble in the last few episodes.  You feel as if you are watching one of Willy\'s plays, because if you, even based on the anime alone, sit and think ""what would the characters I have come to learn so much about over these past 20 episodes do in this kind of situation?"" you\'d be surprised at how contrary their actions seem, as if they are puppets in a play...or victims of poor writing on the staff\'s part.  Some characters are completely forgotten, whilst others are simply assigned stereotypical ""roles"" which completely overwrite their personalities.Enjoyment [7/10] - On the whole a fairly enjoyable title.  The ups generally outweigh the downs and if you\'re looking for fantasy-romance, you can do worse than R x J.  Some of the well written parts make the show worth seeing on the whole, and the incorporation of the OST as well as some of the ""new"" or ""refreshed"" characters give this title life differentiated from the Shakespeare play.Overall (not an average) [7/10] - Based on the ANN Rating System ""Good, worth seeing"" Naturally there are negatives, the art and animation being the primary factor, and the somewhat rushed writing towards the end of the anime. But on the positive, the refreshed setting, new characters, and most of the character development make it worth the ride and some scenes may even be worth a rewatch.  Like a good coaster, you will enjoy most of the ride, you just might get gas pains afterwards from that chili you ate before.Rewatch Value: Low the beginning of the anime, the creative liberties taken and new characters introduced are refreshing, exciting, and it\'s great to see the lens focused with Juliet as the main character.

Romeo and Juliet are nothing more than lovestruck teenagers, who cannot stop thinking about their libido long enough for the play not to end in tragedy. That being said, Romeo x Juliet is an inventive interpretation of one of the worlds most famously known plays.Story:The story of Romeo x Juliet, is thankfully, a pretty big departure from the original. Adding in a...flair of fantasy while keeping the true essence of what Shakespeare was supposedly trying to achieve in telling a tragic love story. What falls flat ultimately though is the pacing of the story and parts of its presentation. The introduction of Escalus and Juliet's true destiny should have been introduced much sooner, as well as a lot of the development that worked to make the love between them more realistic broke the pace of what could have been a true masterpiece. 6/10Art:I quite liked the art of this adaption, the contrasting images of Montague Blue and Capulet Red was nice along with the bright colours and flowers that populated Neo Verona. 8/10Sound:When I first heard the intro song I was off put by how familiar it was. It wasn't long until I realized it was a cover of You Raise Me Up,  and while at first I wasn't too fond of it, I'm not too fond with most versions of it to be fair, it grew on me and ultimately fit well with the story. 10/10Characters:The characters of Shakespeare's play are ultimately its downfall. Romeo and Juliet are basically moronic teenagers who get themselves killed, while it may be romantic, the pacing would show that it was nothing more than momentary lust and you lose a lot of the sense of tragedy or romance that would normally be perceived. Romeo x Juliet does a lot to alleviate this, however it still falls short. Romeo is honestly a bore and Juliet is the clichéd mold of a anime heroine, but both are huge steps in the right direction in comparison to Shakespeare's version. The twists that were added to such characters like Tybalt and Mercutio were wonderful delights and if only all were utilized in such a fashion this could have been so much more. 7/10Enjoyment:Like I stated before I am an English Major in University, so coming across Shakespeare's work is pretty much unavoidable. I've never been much of a fan, but do enjoy some of his plays, unfortunately Romeo and Juliet is not one of them. After having to recently right an essay on it, I remembered this adaptation and low and behold, honestly and truly loved it. 10/10Overall:Except for a few misteps, this is definitely an anime worth watching. If you know the original at all, it is almost a crime not to watch this just to see it in a different light. I give this anime 8/10. flair of fantasy while keeping the true essence of what Shakespeare was supposedly trying to achieve in telling a tragic love story.

Probably the most enduring love story of all time. The story of passionate young star crossed lovers, in passionate searing love, falling into the hands of an impossibly tragic fate in order to teach their quarreling families and the audience a lesson about innocence in the midst of violence and hatred. Lovely and stirring and compelling, right? I sure think so. So being the really really pathetic Shakespeare nerd that I am....and a huge fan of anime I thought to myself, ""ROMEO AND JULIET IN AN ANIME????"" *nerdgasm* ""I MUST SEE THIS"".butafter seeing it, all I could think was ""poo.""STORYThis anime,...despite it\'s lovely name and main characters named after the protagonists of Shakespeare\'s masterpiece, is absolutely NOT the classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" that I was expecting....and wished that the anime delivered. Don\'t get me wrong. The fact that they changed the story...or wrote an entirely different story stickered with the name of Romeo X Juliet...though unexpected, did not soil my opinion of the anime. In fact, the main premise of the story was very compelling and some aspects of it were good. Very good in fact. BUT OH. the tragedy of this take on Romeo and Juliet was not in the story. It was in the writing. So much potential to be a good series! So many ways that the story could have succeeded! Oh how I flinched while I watched this series as each and every good thing this series had going for it turned to dust with each completely unnecessary arc to enter into the story. Simplicity is beautiful. I wish the writers knew this. So instead of witnessing the achingly pure innocent love story that is at the very heart of Romeo and Juliet...and this series...the love story aspect gets bogged down and diminished by all of the extra unneeded overly angsty arcs that begin to clutter up the last 1/3 of the series. I\'m not saying that this series was not a ""romance"" series. It was very ""romantic"". It had all the cheesy lines and the cutesy couple scenes. But that isn\'t what Romeo and Juliet is all about! IT\'S ABOUT PASSION. But the romance in this series was...bland.  Romeo and Juliet, oh Romeo and Juliet where for art thou romantic beautiful version of Romeo and Juliet?? *cries*ArtI actually enjoyed the artistic aspect of this series quite a bit. Yes, the animation was not top-notch. at all. But the soft tones and muted pastelly well detailed backgrounds really were pretty. They almost made me feel as if I were watching a fairy tale. The character designs were nice too. I really loved the innocent boyishness of Romeo\'s appearance and Juliet was not the fickle little thing that she normally gets portrayed as. Overall, the art was not the most disappointing part of the series.SoundThe music for this series is lovely. It\'s frilly and fantastical and it matches the tone of the series perfectly. Not perfect, but nice. I really love the song ""you raise me up"" which the series adapted as its themesong. SO ROMANTIC. too bad it was probably the most romantic part of the series.CharacterThank goodness the characters in the series were awesome. Otherwise my score for it would\'ve ended up a lot lower. But the characters really make this series. I loved that Juliet was not portrayed as a weak fickle damsel. Not only is she super strong and courageous, she\'s a freaking super hero! That rocks. I also liked how Romeo was portrayed. He wasn\'t the little hormonal whiny sop that he normally is portrayed as...instead, he\'s level headed and rational and strong. I dig that. The supporting characters, although MUCH less developed, were likable and enjoyable to watch as well. Each one plays a role in the story and makes the viewer have a deeper interest in what was going in the series. Even if the story was not perfect, the characters carried it quite well.Enjoyment/OverallWas this series Romeo and Juliet, the masterpiece, the tragic tale of passion and love?? Definitely not. But this series was not terrible either. It was, for the most part intriguing and enjoyable. As long as you don\'t mind A LOT of revisions to the original story and messy somewhat disappointing writing, I don\'t see why you wouldn\'t enjoy it. despite it\'s lovely name and main characters named after the protagonists of Shakespeare\'s masterpiece, is absolutely NOT the classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" that I was expecting....and wished that the anime delivered. Don\'t get me wrong. The fact that they changed the story...or wrote an entirely different story stickered with the name of Romeo X Juliet...though unexpected, did not soil my opinion of the anime. In fact, the main premise of the story was very compelling and some aspects of it were good. Very good in fact. BUT OH. the tragedy of this take on Romeo and Juliet was not in the story. It was in the writing. So much potential to be a good series! So many ways that the story could have succeeded! Oh how I flinched while I watched this series as each and every good thing this series had going for it turned to dust with each completely unnecessary arc to enter into the story. Simplicity is beautiful. I wish the writers knew this. So instead of witnessing the achingly pure innocent love story that is at the very heart of Romeo and Juliet...and this series...the love story aspect gets bogged down and diminished by all of the extra unneeded overly angsty arcs that begin to clutter up the last 1/3 of the series. I\'m not saying that this series was not a ""romance"" series. It was very ""romantic"". It had all the cheesy lines and the cutesy couple scenes. But that isn\'t what Romeo and Juliet is all about! IT\'S ABOUT PASSION. But the romance in this series was...bland.  Romeo and Juliet, oh Romeo and Juliet where for art thou romantic beautiful version of Romeo and Juliet?? *cries*ArtI actually enjoyed the artistic aspect of this series quite a bit.

Seriously?"" But yes, believe it (no I\'m trying to be Naruto). I have to admit I was skeptical when I first saw it but I finally decided to watch a few months later after seeing the trailer (which is seriously epic. Probably the best trailer for anything I\'ve ever seen). That, was an excellent decision.STORY:Not the well known Shakespeare story. No useless battles, idiotic butlers and no hormonal teenagers (Well, actually, no. They\'re the main characters. But they\'re a lot less hormonal.) If you didn\'t take the time to read the summary above, I suggest you do. Both...happy and sad (Yeah, I cried), the story really is great. Rating: 9/10ART:The art is actually pretty good. Neo Verona is beautiful (I kinda want to move there) and the people are all animated quite well. If you\'re a fan of Gonzo\'s other work, you\'ll like this one. Rating: 9/10SOUND:The music isn\'t a masterpiece but it does just fine. The real ""WOW!"" comes from the voices. This is one of those rare occasions I actually like the English dub cast better than the original Japanese. Juliet is played amazingly by Brina Palencia (Hell Girl, One Piece, Evaneglion) and Romeo is played by the not very well known Chris Burnett (Bamboo Blade, Big Windup!, Itsudatte My Santa!) This was the first role I ever heard him in and I absolutely fell in love with his voice. It\'s amazing. The supporting roles are also played well. William (J. Micheal Tatum) and Benvolio (Sean Micheal Teague) are played perfectly. Also, the script was really good. They could be a little more creative than the Japanese version with fitting in Shakespeare quotes. Rating: 9/10CHARACTER:I really like the characters, especially Juliet. She\'s really strong and independent without coming off as a tsundere character. Romeo is equally good, being sensitive and naive but strong at the same time. The supporting characters are also really great and add a lot to the story. (I absolutely love the little Curio x Francisco x Juliet backstory!)

Overall Rating: 10/10', 'This was a struggle for me to plow through and definitely among one of Gonzo\'s weaker efforts. Romeo x Juliet attempts to go for a more fantasy-based approach to Shakespeare\'s tragic love story of feuding families and teens in love. Instead though, this series takes far too many liberties with the source material where it completely alters the basic concepts of the original play\'s storytelling. Rather than the Capulets and Montagues having a rivalry with one another and both sides shown to be in the wrong for their conflict, Romeo x Juliet depicts a black-and-white storyline with the Capulets being the ""good"" side and the...Montagues being the ""bad"" side (done enough times), with the former being mostly killed off and the latter ruling the kingdom of Neo Verona with an iron fist. Whatever remnants there are of the Capulet family are leading a resistance movement against the Montagues\' tyranny (name enough anime titles that pull this off) with Juliet unwillingly being the leader of said movement, especially as she comes to gain a love interest in Montague family heir Romeo.My snarking in the parenthesis of the previous paragraph should clue you in what makes this take on Shakespeare\'s classic a major issue for me. It relies so heavily on cliches for its plot and character developments, that it\'s laughable. Romeo\'s the idealistic and courageous young boy, Lord Montague the merciless and power-hungry ruler, Tybalt the revenge-seeking loner, Mercutio the opportunistic power-snagger, and so forth. Basically, mostly everyone in the series is tacked on with an archetype and they don\'t really develop very much out of it. In addition, the characters tend to make very illogical decisions in many instances that the series tries playing up as dramatic yet come across more ridiculous, especially in the finale of the series. Only character I really found myself caring for was ""Willy"", whose foppish and flamboyant take on William Shakespeare provided some humor and sanity for me in this mess of a series.Visuals were decent for the most part with vivid color and a good amount of visual detail applied for scenery and character designs. Action scenes were somewhat engaging with the implementation of Dragon Steeds used for travel and engaging into battles, though animation wasn\'t a major element in their use since many such scenes were flourishes and weren\'t relying on regular animation shortcuts. The dramatic musical score for the series is nice to listen to featuring orchestral pieces and a nice ballad from Korean singer Lena Park for an OP and insert song, though are quite overwhelming in their implementation at points during key scenes in the series.Overall, I found Romeo x Juliet to be quite underwhelming. The anime tries being dramatic in its take on Shakespeare\'s tragic work, but takes too many liberties with its source material and dabbles into too many cliches to be a unique work compared to Gonzo\'s earlier effort with Gankutsuou. Definitely don\'t waste any time with this one.

Definitely don\'t waste any time with this one.', ""Okay, lets start off with saying that everyone knows Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet. It's a well established play and movies have followed (with one coming soon). So when I came in to watch this anime I thought I knew what I was going into. The same old same old, right?Wrong.Romeo x Juliet tell the tale of two lovers named Romeo and Juliet but that's as far as the relevance to the play goes. In this version there's pegasi, evil Dukes, magic trees, long lost relatives and a rebel fighter. Sounds appetizing right? Wrong again. Romeo x Juliet has been one of the most...boring and agonizing anime adventures I have had.Story 7/10 - I have to say that Gonzo were creative with changing the story to a well known topic. They did it in such a way where even though you think you know the outcome, you second guess yourself and then third guess. I was surprised with the plot during most of the anime. Though, at times I was let down by the randomness and the loose wires left laying around. Sometimes I found myself thinking that some scenes were unnecessary to the plot.Art 6/10 - I wasn't a big fan of the character art but the scenery was spectacular. The buildings really were drawn in the style of Italy in the Middle Ages. The flowers were also well drawn and easily distinguishable. There isn't really much to talk about the art, it was good.Sound 8/10 - The best aspect of the anime by far. The OP (which is a Japanese version of You Raise Me Up) sounded so beautiful and I always looked forward to listening to it. The ED during the first half was also really good, it was more of an upbeat song which suited the anime. The ED during the second half wasn't as good but it suited the more serious phase the anime was entering. The background music was always well timed and set the mood.Characters 3/10 - BOOM and the anime just explodes at this point. The characters were terrible. If this was based off Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet, couldn't some characters at least remained the same? My favourite character, Mercutio, was crumbled and desrroyed. That aside, lets say for originality purposes. Then there's the way characters were made to seem unnecessarily evil. They had evil cackles, the eyes, the terrible lines and altogether seemed over the top and unnatural. Duke Montague was portrayed awfully and so was the Friar. Many characters from the play didn't even make an appearance, for originality again maybe? And don't even get me started on Romeo and Juliet. Romeo seemed so emotionless at so many scenes and too emotional at some. He was shown as an ignorant child (which I guess he was so they did something right). Juliet as the Red Whirlwind was one of the most kickass characters but as soon as she took off that mask, she became an underdeveloped and wimp-like character. The only decent characters which stopped me from giving this section a 0 was Tybalt (and his muscly arms), Antonio, Francisco and a bit of Benvolio.Overall,  I give this anime a 5/10. Through the first half of the anime I found myself completely dull with no emotions towards the anime. As the anime continued, I found myself wanting to hurry up and finish it so I could write this review. It wasn't a waste of time because I now appreciate Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet a lot more. The occasional quotes from the play were a treat and I do admit some scenes were cute. Yet, I wouldn't recommed this to many but if you wouldn't mind having the flower power 'peace man' quota being thrown around, go ahead and give this a shot.

Countless variations of the play have been adapted in different mediums. Movie, book, TV Series, Anime. You name it, they have it. It’s considered by many as probably the best romance story in all of literature. But does it live up to the hype? Is it really THAT good? Is it worth watching when I already know what will happen in the end? If this is a Q&A, I would’ve easily answered that, but this is a review so just find out as you read along. Romeo x Juliet:...a tragic tale of love and revenge. Is it truly love that can never be?Story:Romeo x Juliet like its origin, Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece. Not only that it tells the beautiful story of love and revenge, but there’s also a fantasy twist which will just make things much more interesting. Having seen Romeo and Juliet plays for about three times now, I always felt that there is something missing. The original story feels somewhat 1D in comparison to the “remake” though I will never say that one is better than the other. They’re both good in their own ways but it feels like adding something new to the story makes it standout even more. I don’t know. Maybe I was just tired of seeing the same old story over and over again so when a bit of a fantasy element was added, I enjoyed it a lot better. The title in it of itself is enough reason for you to watch this show.Characters:Though the series mainly focuses on Romeo and Juliet, it is not right to say that the supporting cast is not that good. You’ll either hate them (Lady Hermoine and King Montague) or love them (William Shakespeare appears in his own creation. lol.) but they are made for you to do so. You’ll hate a character because they were made to be hated. It like professional wrestling: Heels (Chris Jericho is the natural heel in my book) are made to be hated while Faces (Super John Cena) are made to be cheered for. Now, with the supporting cast out of the way, let’s talk about the 2 characters that gave the series its name: Romeo and Juliet.At first, we have Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet (No google. Fuck yes!) who is not your typical damsel in distress. Throughout the series, Juliet is always fighting. Not just for herself, but for everything as well. As Odin, her “superhero” alter ego, she fights the system for the right of every citizen of Neo Verona. While as Juliet, the rightful heir to the throne of de Capulete, she fights not only for her right for the throne, but for her love as well. In the course of 24 episodes, Romeo and Juliet had too little screen time together because they we’re always apart. This in turn made Juliet a little weaker but not helpless. She is a fighter down to her core. Shows a feminine side often but produces testosterone higher than even Simon, the personification of testosterone (in my book) himself. Okay, that’s enough. lol. What I’m trying to say is that, she may be a damsel in distress but she is definitely not that helpless. She’s just madly in love with Mr. Perfect, Curt Hennig, I mean Romeo.Then, we have Romeo Candorebanto Montague (I googled that! Fuck yes!), a noble gentleman (Like yours truly) who died a virgin (Like you. Haha, burn! Just kidding! lol. )… Or did he? I think. Probably. Lesson? Be a gentleman but never abandon your perverted side. Be like me, I mean like Sanji. He’s a good example. lol. Anyway, back on topic. He, like me (*grins*), treats women really good (right Hermoine? *winks*) and does anything for the one he loves (aka. Andres de Saya. It’s an expression in my country. Send me a PM or comment if you want to know what that means. lol.). The personification of chivalry and that’s about it. I have nothing much to say about his character other than that. He’s not a bad character but I didn’t give a shit about him that much. He’s just a bit perfect for my taste. I sometimes imagine him walking and the words noble, gentleman, handsome, and perfect will simultaneously pop on top of his head. You know, like that one in Seitokai Yakuindomo (Fun show. Go watch it.). lol. I’m getting a little sexist but that’s fine, right? I’m a man after all so I think it’s natural that I care about Juliet more than him. In all seriousness though, I feel like he’s a male nadeshiko, perfect, just too perfect for my taste.Animation:Romeo x Juliet was animated by Gonzo back in 2007. But if you’re familiar with Gonzo, you know that they are a bit hit and miss. Though they can make amazing stuffs like Full Metal Panic, they can also do things like Gantz. It’s as if they flip a coin and be like: “If its head then let’s put all our effort in it, but if its tails then let’s just fuck it”. Well, going back on topic. In Romeo x Juliet’s case, I think it’s safe to say that the coin landed on its head. The animation is nothing too fancy but definitely still worthy of praise. I don’t remember seeing any CG which is like Gonzo’s trademark. I just might not have noticed it but I’m pretty sure they didn’t wave their 3D cocks in this series. Not much bombastic scene other than the few battle scenes and the “thing” in the end so the animation was a little stale but I think it’s not enough to deter future viewers. Overall, the animation is pretty polished for a Gonzo show.Sound:If I can marry a voice actress, it would probably be Brina Palencia. She’s got the looks, the voice, and the wits (Go check out her con-session videos with J. Michael Tatum on Youtube, it’s really cute). So when I heard her dub for Juliet, I was seriously fangasming. Just like how Crispin Freeman is the embodiment of Alucard, Brina is the only one meant to play as Juliet. She nailed both her damsel in distress persona as well as her Odin alter ego. In regard to Chris Burnett who played Romeo, it’s a real good dub; however, I think there are other ones who are much more suited for the job. I can’t really think of a name, but I just felt that his dub was not as powerful as Brina’s. And because I have only seen the dub, I don’t really have anything to say about the sub. I’ve never seen the Japo dub line up as well, so I can’t predict if it’s a good dub on their part. So, if you plan on watching it for the first time, it’s only obvious that I suggest that you watch it dubbed. It’s a Funimation dub so it’s really good.The soundtrack is really good too, specially the different variations of the original “You Raise Me Up” by Josh Groban. Though repetitive, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy about it because it was always used at the right moment. One perfect time when it was used was at episode 7. Oh my god, I swear to God (even if I’m an atheist), my testosterone level have never been so low my entire life. I was about to squeal but I was watching it with my friends so I had to hold back a little. Anyway, yeah, at that time when a certain event happened at episode 7, the way they used You Raise Me Up was just godly. To this day, every time I watch it, I still get goosebumps. All I can say is, well done. There’s also this instrumental version of the song (I really suck at identifying sounds. It might be a guitar or a piano or neither) and when I hear that, I naturally sing along with it.Verdict:If there’s one “flaw” in this series, I would say it was its ending. Though technically not a flaw, I feel like as a human being, you have already been spoiled even before you  watch this show (If you don’t know how Romeo and Juliet ends then you, my friend, have been living under a rock your whole life. And since I’m a bit generous today, here’s a gift: Romeo and Juliet both die in the end. You’re welcome). Though the means differ in both mediums, the tragedy is still present and may deter some people because they know what will happen. No offense to those who have that mindset, but I personally thinks that’s a stupid reason for not even touching the show. Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece in any medium and we should all watch it at least once in our lifetime. Do not be deterred by the spoiler, even if they both die, their trials and hardships are what make the story incredible. “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey”.With all that said, after some random computations, I’d gladly give Romeo x Juliet an overall score of 9.06 out of 10. As a true masterpiece made by the one and only William Shakespeare, no human being have the acceptable excuse to not watch it. It is a beautiful story of love and revenge that I’m sure 95% of viewers will really like. The other 5% probably have poor taste or just men with really high testosterone level. If you have not seen it yet, you have my full pledged recommendation in doing so. If my reviews have somehow helped you in the past then this one will surely end up to your liking as well.Alternate Anime Recommendation:For alternate anime recommendation, why don’t you try Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo? Both series centers around love and revenge that somewhat led to a tragic end. Though do not be deterred as both series have an outstanding journey in between them. And funny enough, both series was made by Gonzo back in the day and both of them are adaptations from really popular stories; Romeo and Juliet for Romeo x Juliet and The Count of Monte Cristo for Gankutsuou.If you don’t like classic literature that much then we have… hmmm… *checks list* Ah! Got one! Nisekoi! I know what you’re thinking: “WHAT A SHITTY RECOMMENDATION FOR ROME X JULIET!” I know! I should probably punch myself. Though in defense, let me give some obvious comparisons. Both series have family feuds, romance (hahahaha!), and tragedy (because Nisekoi is a harem! Hahahahaha!). Though be warned that even if both series are somewhat comparable, they could never be much more different. I just couldn’t find another anime in my list that had the same premise so, yeah, fuck me! Hahaha!And that’s it for me! Thanks for reading! Bye! a tragic tale of love and revenge. Is it truly love that can never be?Story:Romeo x Juliet like its origin, Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece.

He’s not a bad character but I didn’t give a shit about him that much. He’s just a bit perfect for my taste. I sometimes imagine him walking and the words noble, gentleman, handsome, and perfect will simultaneously pop on top of his head. You know, like that one in Seitokai Yakuindomo (Fun show. Go watch it.). lol. I’m getting a little sexist but that’s fine, right? I’m a man after all so I think it’s natural that I care about Juliet more than him. In all seriousness though, I feel like he’s a male nadeshiko, perfect, just too perfect for my taste.Animation:Romeo x Juliet was animated by Gonzo back in 2007. But if you’re familiar with Gonzo, you know that they are a bit hit and miss. Though they can make amazing stuffs like Full Metal Panic, they can also do things like Gantz. It’s as if they flip a coin and be like: “If its head then let’s put all our effort in it, but if its tails then let’s just fuck it”. Well, going back on topic. In Romeo x Juliet’s case, I think it’s safe to say that the coin landed on its head. The animation is nothing too fancy but definitely still worthy of praise. I don’t remember seeing any CG which is like Gonzo’s trademark. I just might not have noticed it but I’m pretty sure they didn’t wave their 3D cocks in this series. Not much bombastic scene other than the few battle scenes and the “thing” in the end so the animation was a little stale but I think it’s not enough to deter future viewers. Overall, the animation is pretty polished for a Gonzo show.Sound:If I can marry a voice actress, it would probably be Brina Palencia. She’s got the looks, the voice, and the wits (Go check out her con-session videos with J. Michael Tatum on Youtube, it’s really cute). So when I heard her dub for Juliet, I was seriously fangasming. Just like how Crispin Freeman is the embodiment of Alucard, Brina is the only one meant to play as Juliet. She nailed both her damsel in distress persona as well as her Odin alter ego. In regard to Chris Burnett who played Romeo, it’s a real good dub; however, I think there are other ones who are much more suited for the job. I can’t really think of a name, but I just felt that his dub was not as powerful as Brina’s. And because I have only seen the dub, I don’t really have anything to say about the sub. I’ve never seen the Japo dub line up as well, so I can’t predict if it’s a good dub on their part. So, if you plan on watching it for the first time, it’s only obvious that I suggest that you watch it dubbed. It’s a Funimation dub so it’s really good.The soundtrack is really good too, specially the different variations of the original “You Raise Me Up” by Josh Groban. Though repetitive, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy about it because it was always used at the right moment. One perfect time when it was used was at episode 7. Oh my god, I swear to God (even if I’m an atheist), my testosterone level have never been so low my entire life. I was about to squeal but I was watching it with my friends so I had to hold back a little. Anyway, yeah, at that time when a certain event happened at episode 7, the way they used You Raise Me Up was just godly. To this day, every time I watch it, I still get goosebumps. All I can say is, well done. There’s also this instrumental version of the song (I really suck at identifying sounds. It might be a guitar or a piano or neither) and when I hear that, I naturally sing along with it.Verdict:If there’s one “flaw” in this series, I would say it was its ending. Though technically not a flaw, I feel like as a human being, you have already been spoiled even before you  watch this show (If you don’t know how Romeo and Juliet ends then you, my friend, have been living under a rock your whole life. And since I’m a bit generous today, here’s a gift: Romeo and Juliet both die in the end. You’re welcome). Though the means differ in both mediums, the tragedy is still present and may deter some people because they know what will happen. No offense to those who have that mindset, but I personally thinks that’s a stupid reason for not even touching the show. Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece in any medium and we should all watch it at least once in our lifetime. Do not be deterred by the spoiler, even if they both die, their trials and hardships are what make the story incredible. “It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey”.With all that said, after some random computations, I’d gladly give Romeo x Juliet an overall score of 9.06 out of 10. As a true masterpiece made by the one and only William Shakespeare, no human being have the acceptable excuse to not watch it. It is a beautiful story of love and revenge that I’m sure 95% of viewers will really like. The other 5% probably have poor taste or just men with really high testosterone level. If you have not seen it yet, you have my full pledged recommendation in doing so. If my reviews have somehow helped you in the past then this one will surely end up to your liking as well.Alternate Anime Recommendation:For alternate anime recommendation, why don’t you try Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo? Both series centers around love and revenge that somewhat led to a tragic end. Though do not be deterred as both series have an outstanding journey in between them. And funny enough, both series was made by Gonzo back in the day and both of them are adaptations from really popular stories; Romeo and Juliet for Romeo x Juliet and The Count of Monte Cristo for Gankutsuou.If you don’t like classic literature that much then we have… hmmm… *checks list* Ah! Got one! Nisekoi! I know what you’re thinking: “WHAT A SHITTY RECOMMENDATION FOR ROME X JULIET!” I know! I should probably punch myself. Though in defense, let me give some obvious comparisons. Both series have family feuds, romance (hahahaha!), and tragedy (because Nisekoi is a harem! Hahahahaha!). Though be warned that even if both series are somewhat comparable, they could never be much more different. I just couldn’t find another anime in my list that had the same premise so, yeah, fuck me! Hahaha!And that’s it for me! Thanks for reading! Bye!', 'ROMEO x JULIET. The name itself calls only one thing to mind: Shakespeare\'s most famous tragedy, the tale of the star-crossed lovers, Romeo & Juliet. However, if you want to see an anime adaptation, don\'t bother with this. After the first four minutes, you will see this has very little resemblance to Shakespeare  (in fact, one of the characters in the anime is named Willy Shakespeare).Story -- 6I hate hate hate how fangirls and fanboys are going crazy over this. This anime was heavily promoted at anime cons, online ads, previews, etc. However, when its name is literally ROMEO X JULIET, you expect...you...know...some resemblance to the play, at all? Within the first few minutes, they basically show you the only thing in common is that the characters are named after the ones in the play, and that, yes, it is about two noble children that fall in love and are separated. But here\'s the issue: it\'s not separation by the families -- no -- its separation due to the fact that the boy\'s father gruesomely murdered every other member of the girl\'s family. Talk about a lot to overcome.The story is meh at best. It is creative, to say the least. It\'s set in an island floating in the sky, in a place called Neo-Verona (go figure) where it\'s basically  Italy in the 1600s, except with pegasi. However, this anime is SET UP to be a tragedy -- the problem being that, by the end of the anime, you actually are way too attached to the characters to let them die. In fact, because it doesn\'t follow Romeo & Juliet by Shakespeare at all, you have NO idea IF they die or not. And you become so attached to the main characters that you\'re praying that it basically bastardizes the original work of Shakespeare and allows them to live. (Spoiler: Don\'t worry, they still die.)In addition to this, the story skips around a bit and adds in random crap that isn\'t exactly necessary. Although it makes for more time to show off the awesome amazingness that is the soundtrack and art, the story itself takes a hit to allow that to happen.Art -- 9SHINYYYYYYYYYY.That basically sums up the art. It\'s high quality. Really, really high quality. Some of the highest quality anime art available with the current technology, I\'d go as far as to say. It beats the crap out of any of the mainstream shojo or shonen anime art quality.Sound -- 10Warning: Rampant fanboyism aheadOh my god. The one thing -- one thing -- that makes this anime remember-able, other than being very, very shiny, is two (well, rather, one) songs that form the soundtrack. I don\'t even remember the rest of the soundtrack -- but the cover of Secret Garden\'s ""You Raise Me Up"" by Lena Park is jawdropping. She even had it transposed for a Japanese song, entitled Inori You Raise Me Up, which also happens to be the opening theme for the series. It does not follow the lyrics of You Raise Me Up at all, but flows very nicely and serenely -- if you had not known it were based off of the tune of You Raise Me Up, you would still love it. Between the sappy romance and the utter gore of Romeo X Juliet, hearing about star-crossed lovers and how one shall always support another in such an inspiring song in both English and Japanese says something. This has to be one of the best, if not the best, soundtracks of any anime. Ever.Character -- 6Fair would be, well, fair to describe what the characters are. They are loosely based off their namesakes in Shakespeare\'s play. There is only one very well done performance in the anime. The performance of Juliet, when she decides to be a rebel and crusade as the Red Zorro...er, rather, the Red Whirlwind* shows a compassionate level of caring not found in most characters, giving Juliet both a strength and a weakness to her character. The other characters are basically static throughout, but show enough emotion to give this a ""fair"" review. They act believable, which is enough for me.*No. Really. She is basically Zorro, but with a red hat. Don\'t believe me? Google it.Enjoyment -- 6Enjoyment during ""You Raise Me Up""  -- 9Otherwise -- 5.8Evens out to a 6. Ish. Honestly, the anime is ""cute"" to say the least, and is entertaining. The enjoyment value again varies on your taste; if you\'re looking for a refined anime, keep looking. Try Cowboy Bebop. But if you\'re looking for a very well made, artistically at least, anime with an amazing soundtrack, you will enjoy the anime very much. The characters are meh, as is the plot, but for me, the art and soundtrack make it a worthwhile investment to see.Overall - 7The 7 represents the culmination of an average or below average anime which has an amazing budget, aka, making it very very shiny with an awesome soundtrack. It would normally get a 5 or 6 -- not rememberable -- but due to its high budget, hype, well made art, and beautiful soundtrack, it is bumped up to a 7.

And I did - fo about half the show.The story is focusing on the classic romance between Romeo and Juliet, and mixes in fantasy elements.Juliet starts out as a vigilante-type character who opposes the oppressive rulers, the Montague family, and is in the beinning really cool and driven, who eventually finds out she is the last Capulet - the former rulers of the nation.Romeo is the heir of the Montague family and is a compassionate, kind young man who wants to grow up to do the best for the people.Now, this...sets up a very cool scenario about freedom-fighting and forbidden love, and it really works - in the beginning.When the characters inevitably fall for each other it feels like they just don't care about the fight for the people anymore and the plot feels a lot flatter after about the halfway mark...And I won't spoil anything, but what the heck was up with that ending?

They might as well have changed the character's names and not given any credit to Shakespeare- honestly that's as far as the similarities go.  Even if you haven't seen the play, or worked on it as I have, you'll know the basic outline of the play. Apparently those who created this didn't. Had this been an original anime I may have enjoyed it- perhaps watched the rest of the series, but simply because they killed a classic I can't bring myself to finish it. The animation and score are good,...perhaps the only redeeming qualities there.In short, if you're expecting an anime mirroring the play, as I was, you'll be disappointed. perhaps the only redeeming qualities there.In short, if you're expecting an anime mirroring the play, as I was, you'll be disappointed."", 'There are lot of ways to go wrong when you write an anime based on a famous work. Especially when that particular work is widely disliked by your target audience. Who wants to read a play about two young teens who kill themselves because they think the other is dead (practically right after they met)? It sounds silly. But Romeo X Juliet takes the brilliant parts of Shakespeare\'s play and turns them into a truly fantastic anime.Story: 10For a plot that was (loosely) based off of a previously written work, this was done remarkably well.

It\'s Shakespeare... as anime.This would either be the best thing ever, or the most painful.Story - to begin with, this isn\'t really Romeo and Juliet. The anime adds a lot of completely original elements, like (Neo-)Verona being a floating city in the sky, the existence of Dragonsteeds (which should be self-explanatory), people in oppression, a ""La Résistance""-esque group of vigilantes and most importantly changes the morality from grey-and-grey to black-and-white. And that\'s this anime\'s biggest flaw. Capulet and their allies are pure and good and Montague are...pure evil and rotten to the core, with the exception of Romeo who is almost ridiculously kind.There are also the problem that every major character seems obligated to, at one point or another through the story, act like a complete and utter moron! It\'s impossible to count how many things could have been avoided if the characters just stopped to think once in a while. Sure, it\'s a way to get them from point A to point B, but there were much better and smarter ways of doing so.Art - the art and animation are mostly good, especially in the first half of the show before getting sloppier for a while, most likely saving itself for the finale. Character designs are nice, body proportions in particular, and the backgrounds and colors are very nice to look at.

Romeo and Juliet\'s ""feminine boy, masculine girl"" dynamic are exaggerated into making him shy and sweet and her a hot-blooded Action Girl. Tybalt is angry and brooding, Benvolio is nothing but Romeo\'s voice of reason and the most similar to his original characterization. And then there\'s Mercutio.Oh god.

Romeo X Juliet was heavily divided by many Shakespearian fans with other fans saying that it\'s a solid adaptation to it\'s source material and the other fans saying that it\'s bombastic and nonsensical to it\'s original story. To be honest, I really liked this series and sure there are some crucial changes to the original Shakespeare story, but somehow it manages to stay true to the spirit...of the original story without being nonsensical.In the original story of Romeo and Juliet, it\'s was basically about two star crossed lovers in which their deaths unite their families, who are both rivals, but in the anime series of Romeo X Juliet is the exception of the plot: The members of House Capulet, including Juliet\'s parents, are murdered by Prince Leontes Montague and cut to years later in Neo Verona, Juliet is now sixteen and dresses herself as a boy with the name Odin and she is also known as ""The Red Whirlwind"" as she fights off Montagues forces to protect the innocent people that suffer through Leontes rule. During the annual Rose Ball, both Romeo and Juliet meet in the fountain and they fall in love very quick. As both Romeo and Juliet try to be together, Capulet royalists like Francisco and Curio are planning a rebellion against Leontes and in the couse of the series, Romeo and Juliet\'s love get stronger and a secret in Neo Verona is waiting to be revealed.Let\'s talk about the good things about Romeo X Juliet, cause, to be honest, there are tons of good things about the series. The animation by Gonzo is top-notch, with beautiful art and creative setting that stays close to the setting of the original story, but with fantasy elements mixed in (like the flying horses and the floating city of Neo Verona). The chemistry with Romeo and Juliet is great and while it does take a few moments for them to actually fall in love, it works and they share a pretty good chemistry like they fly on the horse together, they talk about their past lives, fight off a bunch of thugs together, they share food and even Romeo and Juliet make an oath on an abandoned sanctuary and that part did made me cry. The main villain Leontes Montegue is frightening, because deep down, the character has so much hatred and despair in his heart that you know why noblemen fear him in the first place.Juliet as a stronger and independent character is a welcome change, allowing the character to be more heroic and confident than the original story.. Side characters like Francisco, William De Franese, Curio, Cordelia, Conrad, and Antonio are fun to watch and they provide some decent moments that provide a nice change of tone. The music by Final Fantasy 12 composer Hitoshi Sakimoto is gorgeous. This is one of the most underrated soundtracks ever made and it a damn shame cause it really brings a sense of love, passion and tragedy that fits perfectly well to the series.The English dub in Romeo X Juliet by Funimation is perfect. It\'s better than the Japanese dub and it delivers top-notch Shakespearian dialogue and referencing some quotes in other Shakespeare plays like Hamlet and The Tempest. The cast did a great job with their performances with each giving character roles. Brina Palencia was perfect for the role as Juliet, capturing both the weak feminine and the strong willed side of the character, while Chris Burnett performance as Romeo is less impressive in the first half of the series but his performance improves later on in the second half of the series when things go chaotic.  Sean Hannigan\'s performance as the main villain Leontes is terrifying and every-time he speaks, it gives me chills through my spine.Now for the major flaws of Romeo X Juliet is that there\'s no rivalry between House Capulet and the Montague Nobles, cause they basically killed everyone from House Capulet and it\'s a shame too, since the family rivalry played a major role in the original Romeo and Juliet story and It also lead them to accept forgiveness and being united again cause of the tragic death of Romeo and Juliet. The side character villains are mediocre and there basically there to be evil bastards and side characters like Elizabeth and Emilia are completely forgettable and unneeded in the story. As for the ending of the series, I like it and felt like a nice closure to the series. However, if you\'re a fan of the original play, be aware that the ending of THIS adaptation is completely changed from the original and if you don\'t like that change, then you might be pissed at it.Romeo X Juliet is a great series that people can easily get into. Those who can accept the changes of the original play will find a series that adds new elements to make the story feel new again. If you\'re a fan of the original story then by all means, watch this series. It\'s a solid adaptation to the play and it\'s 10x better than the live action film Romeo + Juliet that came out in the 90\'s. of the original story without being nonsensical.In the original story of Romeo and Juliet, it\'s was basically about two star crossed lovers in which their deaths unite their families, who are both rivals, but in the anime series of Romeo X Juliet is the exception of the plot: The members of House Capulet, including Juliet\'s parents, are murdered by Prince Leontes Montague and cut to years later in Neo Verona, Juliet is now sixteen and dresses herself as a boy with the name Odin and she is also known as ""The Red Whirlwind"" as she fights off Montagues forces to protect the innocent people that suffer through Leontes rule.

Side characters like Francisco, William De Franese, Curio, Cordelia, Conrad, and Antonio are fun to watch and they provide some decent moments that provide a nice change of tone. The music by Final Fantasy 12 composer Hitoshi Sakimoto is gorgeous. This is one of the most underrated soundtracks ever made and it a damn shame cause it really brings a sense of love, passion and tragedy that fits perfectly well to the series.The English dub in Romeo X Juliet by Funimation is perfect. It\'s better than the Japanese dub and it delivers top-notch Shakespearian dialogue and referencing some quotes in other Shakespeare plays like Hamlet and The Tempest. The cast did a great job with their performances with each giving character roles. Brina Palencia was perfect for the role as Juliet, capturing both the weak feminine and the strong willed side of the character, while Chris Burnett performance as Romeo is less impressive in the first half of the series but his performance improves later on in the second half of the series when things go chaotic.  Sean Hannigan\'s performance as the main villain Leontes is terrifying and every-time he speaks, it gives me chills through my spine.Now for the major flaws of Romeo X Juliet is that there\'s no rivalry between House Capulet and the Montague Nobles, cause they basically killed everyone from House Capulet and it\'s a shame too, since the family rivalry played a major role in the original Romeo and Juliet story and It also lead them to accept forgiveness and being united again cause of the tragic death of Romeo and Juliet. The side character villains are mediocre and there basically there to be evil bastards and side characters like Elizabeth and Emilia are completely forgettable and unneeded in the story. As for the ending of the series, I like it and felt like a nice closure to the series. However, if you\'re a fan of the original play, be aware that the ending of THIS adaptation is completely changed from the original and if you don\'t like that change, then you might be pissed at it.Romeo X Juliet is a great series that people can easily get into. Those who can accept the changes of the original play will find a series that adds new elements to make the story feel new again. If you\'re a fan of the original story then by all means, watch this series. It\'s a solid adaptation to the play and it\'s 10x better than the live action film Romeo + Juliet that came out in the 90\'s.', ""Romeo x Juliet, is it Romeo and Juliet? no.This anime is based very loosely on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet so, if you happen to be familiar with the English classic (most of us are) prepare to be surprised.Story:If you've seen the 2004 film Troy (starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom) it may be easier for you to understand the premise of the story - how an inspiration becomes a legend.Romeo x Juliet follows two young nobles Romeo, the son of the despotic Montague Ruler and Juliet, the only surviving daughter of the slaughtered Capulet family, come to...grips with their identity, love and society around them and what the struggles that they take when trying to instigate change.While the setting is nice, those of you who are turned off by high fantasy be warned. Like the sword of akashe in Code Geass, there were some things that i just didn't get the first time through and if this is not your thing, know that it is present. I would've given the story an 8 if it weren't for this.Characters:Characters are what i feel really bring a story to life in anime and personally, the characters in romeo x Juliet really took a while to grow on me.A key element in the story of this anime is the growth of romeo and juliet from young naive youths into capable and responsible adults. While their development eventually fleshes out their characters, this did make the first few episodes really hard to press through for me.The side characters also fulfilled their roles capably, although i did wish for more fleshed out backstories, so don't expect Angel beats.Art:The art in Romeo x Juliet is very... clean. If you like anime in general, you should have nothing to complain about Romeo x Juliet. One thing that i did notice was that, the artwork did not have any of the hyper-sexualisation present in a lot of anime that I've seen lately. None of the characters are particularly 'hot' in my opinion, but all of them have a nice simple artwork that doesn't scream big-boobs or fan service but allows down-to-earth characters and human personalities to shine through.Sound:The voice actors all do a fairly good job and sound believable although the hyper 'Willy' William Shakespeare may be slightly annoying at times.Appropriate music highlights some of the more epic or moving moments in the show, building a nice environment that really had me immersed in some of the more touching moments of the show.Final verdict:My friend recommended this show to me and i was skeptical at first,  but give the show a go and you might be surprised. grips with their identity, love and society around them and what the struggles that they take when trying to instigate change.While the setting is nice, those of you who are turned off by high fantasy be warned.

The fact that it was hardly an adaptation at all of Romeo and Juliet is what really ruined the story. There were a lot of differences in Romeo x Juliet than the original with the setting being in Neo-Verona;  a floating island in the sky, creatures called dragonhorses...which is literally a pegasus with a dragon tail, Juliet and a few loyal members being the last of the Capulets and not to mention a few other smaller changes. I was deeply disappointed in the balcony scene in the anime as it is one of the most famous scenes of the story of Romeo and Juliet and they screwed up the other most famous scene; the deaths of Romeo and Juliet too. I felt like they couldn\'t adapt any of the true parts of Shakespeare\'s work into the anime at all turning this into a story of it\'s own. I enjoyed the first 22 episodes but the last 2 episodes I felt went away from the story a bit and became too magical for my liking, they were unnecessary to the anime as a whole making me put it down a point. I sort of wish they stuck to the original idea of Romeo and Juliet\'s demise than the ending they did which felt like too much.Art - 7The art was nice, it was pretty and simple and I liked the continuous use of flowers. I did like the look of the ruins of buildings covered in flowers, the church being my favorite. The dragonhorses were beautiful also. The settings were nice and pretty but the character designs could have been better.Sound - 8 (Japanese subbed)The music was lovely, it matched the tone of Romeo x Juliet very well. The opening song (""You Raise Me Up"" in japanese) was enjoyable and I felt it was a perfect start of each episode. The voice actors were great but I felt like Juliet could have had a better voice actor, after all she has been through in the anime I think I would have liked her to have a stronger, more determined voice but that was alright. I don\'t have anything to say about the english dub voice actors because I generally find them to sound cheesy so i didn\'t bother with that.Characters - 6In the beginning I did take a liking to Juliet but her character started to annoy me as I felt like she became two different people; the strong, righteous character we are first introduced to and admire and then the pathetic Juliet whom continuously cries due to love. I know that is the true essence of the story; the heartbreaks and pain of loving someone whom you can not be with but it annoyed me in how weak she was when concerning Romeo. She also was clumsy at times doing stupid mistakes, when we had seen her doing magnificent acrobatic work and fighting as the \'Red Whirlwind\' so that was a bit annoying. Romeo was alright, I didn\'t like him that much because he was so sensitive all the time and a little boring, he was a very typical princely love interest so I found him rather dull. I really didn\'t like how selfish Romeo and Juliet became in the last couple of episodes especially after being portrayed as selfless throughout most of the series, It annoyed me. I did get tired of Romeo and Juliet always uttering each other\'s names in a pathetic, whiny voice but maybe that\'s because I wasn\'t too enthusiastic with their love. The other characters were well done and some were developed nicely. We got to see the background of a few of them which was done well (except maybe Montague\'s background which wasn\'t really elaborated and was a bit far fetched), I wish we got to learn more about how Francisco and Curio came into service with the Capulets though. I also liked how Mercutio became in the end showing that there was more to him than I had thought and it made me pity him rather than hate. Putting William Shakespeare as a character was risky but they did a good job with him so I was pleased. The characters were realistic, as the anime went on I got a true feel of each character in the anime giving them their own individual identity. The only reason why I put a low score for the character\'s was due to the main two character\'s being quite frustrating.Enjoyment - 7Although I got tired of the romance between Romeo and Juliet, I did enjoy the anime a lot. There was some humour that made me laugh a couple of times and there was a good amount of tragedy   but also light heartedness. The fact that Romeo and Juliet were in love when they had hardly said anything to each other except each other\'s names and how hard it is to be together made me enjoy it less than I would have and  I felt like I was forcing myself to watch the scenes with the two of them together. I was hoping to hear Juliet yell ""O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo"" at some point but maybe that was hoping for too much considering how little they followed the actual story. By the end of the anime I felt happy and sweet although disappointed a little with the last two episodes.Overall - 7If it followed the original Romeo and Juliet at all I feel like this could\'ve been much better although saying this I did like how original it was and the new direction it went in (which mostly away from anything of the original). Overall I give Romeo x Juliet a 7 which would have been higher if they had cut the last two episodes and had more development of the revolution ending it a more traditional sense of Romeo and Juliet, and Juliet and Romeo had more depth to their relationship. If you\'re looking for an anime that stays true to Shakespeare\'s work, I would definitely not recommend this but if you don\'t mind at how loose this adaptation of Romeo and Juliet is then I say you may as well give it a try! which is literally a pegasus with a dragon tail, Juliet and a few loyal members being the last of the Capulets and not to mention a few other smaller changes.

A total twist of fate for me because I never thought I would love this version better...than the play.I enjoyed seeing sword fights,the romance Romeo and Juliet had for each other.The art made the love scenes so mesmerizing and not so cheesy.The story I somewhat different then the original Shakespeare version I mean she\'s the last Capulet hoping to change the way of Montague\'s reign of poverty and wealth.ofcourse you meet Romeo and how he met Juliet and how deeply he loves her and the emotion is shown throughout many of the episodes there love is shown,lots of drama,fear,sorrow and heartredfrom the both houses.The opening and ending songs are awesome the begining song is still stuck on my head the ending too Lena Park and 12012 steal the opening and ending!!The story is different in some ways how it ends is up to you,I for one the sub and dub both made me feel happy they met and up to the end was perfect sweet ending but a tragedy.Makes you think about your love...are you happy to have the joy to love someone?I hope you do because this touching story that makes you cry because it sure made me the final things they said to eachother T^TI just hope you enjoy 10/10 than the play.I enjoyed seeing sword fights,the romance Romeo and Juliet had for each other.The art made the love scenes so mesmerizing and not so cheesy.The story I somewhat different then the original Shakespeare version I mean she\'s the last Capulet hoping to change the way of Montague\'s reign of poverty and wealth.ofcourse you meet Romeo and how he met Juliet and how deeply he loves her and the emotion is shown throughout many of the episodes there love is shown,lots of drama,fear,sorrow and heartredfrom the both houses.The opening and ending songs are awesome the begining song is still stuck on my head the ending too Lena Park and 12012 steal the opening and ending!!The story is different in some ways how it ends is up to you,I for one the sub and dub both made me feel happy they met and up to the end was perfect sweet ending but a tragedy.Makes you think about your love...are you happy to have the joy to love someone?I hope you do because this touching story that makes you cry because it sure made me the final things they said to eachother T^TI just hope you enjoy 10/10', 'I discovered this anime by listening to the theme song on an anime playlist I have saved on Youtube. The song is called ""Inori"" - which is the Japanese version of ""You Raise Me Up"", one of my favorite songs. This wasn\'t the first time I fell in love with a song from an anime that lead me into watching it\xa0(""Angel Beats!"",\xa0""The World is Still Beautiful"",\xa0""Uta no Prince Sama""). I dove into the anime and thought ""what could go wrong?""A lot of things apparently.First off, I had a really hard time keeping up with this anime because there were some times where it bored me...half to death or a character did something pretty stupid. The only character I really enjoyed was Francisco who was one of Juliet\'s bodyguards. Another thing, Francisco and Curio were far better looking than Romeo, I\'m surprised Juliet didn\'t fall in love with one of them before she met her forbidden lover.If anyone knows the original ""Romeo and Juliet"", you know that the two lovers are together at almost all times after they meet. In this spinoff, there were only about five episodes out of the twenty-four where Romeo and Juliet were actually together. That really annoyed because EVERYONE knows Romeo and Juliet as a ROMANCE TRADEGY, but it is very hard for the show to be romantic in any way if the two lovers are always separated.On top of that, the two characters who were supposed to be the comical relief characters weren\'t funny at all, just plain annoying.The ending was the worst of all. I know the creators wanted the anime to be a little different from the play, but I just thought the idea of what they came up with was pretty lame. We all know that in the end, Romeo and Juliet commit suicide, but the ending when they DID die was so rushed that I had no idea what was happening.

Romeo and Juliet was originally about two teenagers of two opposing houses who accidentally fell in lust (I don\'t believe in the lie of love at first sight) with each other. This story spans all of two weeks and shows just how hormonal we teenagers really are!The anime was barely different.Now sure, I\'ll be the first to admit that Romeo and Juliet was not my favorite Shakespeare play which makes me mildly bias, but I watched this because of the amazing reviews from friends. I was thoroughly disappointed. The story...was changed and became an overused tissue of a plot. Boy meets girl (that he can\'t have) boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl make promise of staying together forever, boy, girl, or both, dies. (SPOILER:::::::: Well technically she turns into a tree and he\'s turned into a human shish kebab, which is ridiculous in itself.)Anyhow- this art was fabulous but was not enough to change my mind. As for sound- I see the pun within the main song ""Wind Beneath My Wings"", but they play it three or four plus times every friggin\' episode, making me detest the song!! And I love that song...The characters- ooo, the characters. I actually really liked that they pulled names from Willy\'s other plays AND even had him as a character. He, Curio and the doctor (bless his soul)  were probably the only reasons I kept watching.All in all, if you\'re looking for an anime with a predictable plot, silly ending and broken record music (With great art and interesting side characters), then by all means, watch Romeo x Juliet. was changed and became an overused tissue of a plot.

The story evolves wonderfully. Love at first sight. Then a struggle to pursue that love no matter what. But the protagonists love their country...as well as its people just as much is what really caught my attention to watch this anime. It sort of makes them the heroes of their masses. Continuity of the story is good. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to release the people of Neo verona from the clutches of the Dark King Montague who only desires power to rule all things in his grasp and beyond. Conflicts of strong emotions of love, compassion, anger, sadness are beautifully shown throughout the series. The way Neo Verona is uphead as a floating mass of land and its story is intriguing. I personally would have loved if the anime detailed some bits about how that floating continent came into being and the tree of life associated with it. Would have added a whole chunk of fantasy to the already plum plot of the series. The tragedy which follows in the end of the story just highlights the need for existence of both the protagonists and their struggles.Art [10/10]: The art of the series is definitely not mind-blowing but is very good nonetheless. Both the protagonists are nicely drawn. And their emotions rightly conveyed through the illustrations and animation together. Ruins inside the Neo Verona city or its outskirts have been aptly drawn, like the ruins of a church like structure in one of the episodes, or the where Romeo and Juliet meet on her birthday, etc. The castle exterior and interior are grand. Flowerbeds in the garden and forest landscaping is beautiful.Sound [10/10]: Hitoshi Sakamoto has done an excellent job on giving amazingly melodious Piano and Violin pieces. Deai, Kakki, Kimi no Iru Sekai are my favorites. The OP Inori- You raise me up is beautiful and the rocking ED cyclone. Voice actors of all characters have done a great job.Characters [10/10]: The tender hearts of both Romeo and Juliet have been brought out beautifully through their characters. I think the way the characters have been drawn also add to this. King Montague's past which has led him to become such a tyrant is very believable. His last words really add a lot in understanding his complex character in the end. Characters of all the colleagues of both protagonists are well built.Enjoyment [10/10]: It was a complete package really. It has bit of all things that attract a viewer to any anime romance, drama, action, adventure, fantasy. Never was a boring moment.Overall [10/10]: Full marks for a very entertaining show. as well as its people just as much is what really caught my attention to watch this anime.

There's soo much more and a whole new thought in this storyline. There's a reason behind everything!The story was well written. It is a bit cheesy compared to Shakespears version. But I liked how there's more action and some fighting scenes. Also the fact that Romeo and Juliet are actually spending time together. It gives them an even more reason to want to be with each other. There's Romance, Tragedy, Drama, and Fantasy.The opening theme( You Raise Me...Up- by Lena Park) was beautifully sung and really set the mood. I really enjoy this song :] The ending theme (Cyclone- by 12012) wasn't that bad either.Some of the characters might have been unnecessary, but in the end they played their part just fine. No one in this story stuck out more then the main characters, Romeo and Juliet. They did, however, help us understand the true warm-hearted  personalities of these two lovers.Overall I really enjoyed it. The entire story was well thought out, Love at First Sight, the Rose and Iris, Escalus, and the fact that it took place on a floating island. Like I said earlier, the story is somewhat like the original play. The falling in love and tragic fate, but the episodes aren't predictable. Each one has a shocking twist to it which is awesome because in the end it all ties together. Basically everything has a meaning to it. Definitely worth watching.

However, if you are looking for the perfect anime adaptation, you will be sorely disappointed. The only striking similarity between the two is the names. Having said that, I did enjoy this anime. It was a touching love story. Here come the numbers-Story-6 (Fair)Good, quite fast-paced in the beginning. Exciting, even. But then came the middle... it became so boring that I quit watching for a while, and valiantly returned some time later, to find that at the...end the pace picked up again.

A nice love story."", ""Romeo X Juliet, though the story borrows mostly from the Shakespeare’s story it is presented in a remarkably different way. The story has been changed a little in order to remove overly used cliché moments by making it a somewhat opaque. Due to the fact that this is an anime adaptation, it has been moulded to fit it, by offering mythical beast such as flying horse called Dragon Steeds.Story: (9/10)The story revolves around our two main characters Romeo and Juliet who are bounded by love but separated by fate. I am impressed on how the story is altered not entirely but in some parts to...give it a fresh tone. Each episode ended with a cliffhanger, and each episode felt fairly good. Although it doesn't carry the same tragic feelings on all parts, you can still feel the pain of separation and tenderness.Characters: (9/10)Though I haven’t really read the original play so I can’t compare, the characters were very well built, each having their own personality. The complexity of each character was splendid. Many of the supporting characters have names from other Shakespeare plays too!Sound: (10/10)This is where the show really shines. The background music blended perfectly with the scenes, the emotions in them really stood out. As for the ending and opening sequences, I never skipped them; they were just too touching and poignant in some ways. One more thing, the dub, this is first show I would recommend watching dubbed, the English lines are much more related to the old English. The fluid talks and use of old English in some scenes really merged well.Art and Animation(7/10)The only downside of the show, tough personally it wasn't much of a bother but still the art feels a little bland. But still the brushed out colours matches the setting perfectly. The animation is not so smooth in some part and I felt drop in quality after 15 episodes, but still it didn't took away from the show.Conclusion: (9/10)I am not a fan of Shakespeare’s work but this adaption really amazed me, the story, characters, sound all blended beautifully to provide and exceptional and lasting impression for me. Though the story deviates from the original and the introduction of fantasy elements might turn away some but if you are not a die-hard fan of Shakespeare and don’t get bothered by change, please watch the show.

The plot itself is about two lovers who were never meant to be together because of their opposing families, but love cannot keep them apart. They will find a way to live together even if it means defying their family name.Besides the beautiful story line, I did have a few pet peeves with the overall style of the anime. Yes, the action can be intense at times with sword-to-sword battle, but being allowed to jump/fall...from the top of building and still land perfectly is beyond realism. It\'s great that we don\'t have to watch the main characters sit in a hospital for numerous episodes, but seriously not even bearing a scratch or bruise.. it\'s too much for me to bear. It hurts me to see those things.There are other story elements that I\'ll try not to judge too harshly such as hosting a wedding in the middle of wartime immediately after the commander stating that the soldiers are prepared to go to war. Things like this are what is allowed in animation, and I\'ll leave it to you if you think that\'s okay, but it lacks a realistic scenario.It\'s really hard to judge this anime harshly while listening to the opening song on repeat.And now with the ratings:Story - 6 - Numerous elements of the story line were flipped from the original Shakespeare story, as if the director was given a list of names to include in the play with a very vague memory of what was suppose to happen.Graphics - 8 - Pretty modern graphics here. Nothing too exciting. Very bright colours. Most everything was in high quality, but few things were finely detailed.Sound - 7 - Touching music at certain points, but I never felt totally enthralled at any moment due to the killer situational musical atmosphere.Character personas - 7 - The mad king was played very well and the old english dialect kept me smiling.  Otherwise, Romeo and Juliet just weren\'t exciting.Overall - 6 - When I think about it, it all boils down to the entire play lacking humour, detailed action scenes, and witty commentary, which are all very compelling human characteristics to be missing.Recommended - I kind of got the \'meh\' feel from this new remake. It had it\'s moments, but they were few and far between. In a hard answer, I would have to say, ""No, I would recommend a different anime with more depth."" from the top of building and still land perfectly is beyond realism.

In order to do this, I had to overcome my initial wariness of all the deviations from the original work.From the noble origins of the main characters to their ties and relationships with all the other characters as well as the names for some new questionable characters (see Lancelot, Ophelia and even... Hermione!?), I was willing to overcome these changes and additions as they would seemingly make for a more interesting and far more developed story than Shakespeare\'s...original work.Nevertheless, this story was far from being truly original itself, for it not only borrowed from Shakespeare, but also from many other well-known tales such as Robin Hood, Les Misérables, and many others. This could, again, be easily ignored for the sake of entertainment, but as the story progresses, more and more random elements come into play, making the anime drift off farther and farther away from the source material. This becomes truly annoying towards the end, where something like ""The Tree of Life"" from Avatar suddenly appears along with a Mayan-style theme concerning sacrifices.This could, again, have been easily ignored if it actually made sense and turned the story into an outstandingly fresh piece of work, but, unfortunately, it didn\'t.As if that wasn\'t enough, at least 3 characters are spared from dying like they did in the original work, for seemingly no purpose whatsoever.Additionally, the design of Neo Verona itself is also a mix of a bunch of Italy\'s best sights along with some influence from other countries. Nevertheless, the art and architecture are generally well executed and enjoyable to look at. Although the animation overall is not outstanding, it is definitely pleasant and fits the overall tone of the story pretty well. The only downside to this would probably be the CGI (ugh, those flags!), but thankfully its use is fairly limited.The terrible CGI is compensated with some lovely music, where the opening song is used both in Japanese and in English (though I personally prefer the English version and would have liked to see it played more often throughout the series). The ending songs are also nice, and, while nothing memorable, they give a nice look and feel to the show. (Despite people being ""surprised"" about the first ending since it is kind of a rock song, it\'s perfect for the large amount of action as well as the darker themes that appear in the series). The soundtrack is also well executed, and, again, while nothing outstanding, it certainly does its job pretty well.Another strong point of this anime is definitely the voice acting, for it is of great quality (at least in the original Japanese version). Although I was not familiar with any of the seiyuus\' work before, I was pleasantly surprised at what they did with Romeo x Juliet and how it all came together so well. This may also be thanks to the pacing, which, for me, was virtually perfect. Neither too fast nor too slow, this anime takes the right amount of time to develop its story and characters (although Tybalt could have certainly used some more time for his backstory and character development).Despite its mishaps, this anime is definitely enjoyable and one well worth watching. Two pieces of advice, though: try to forget that this has anything to do with Shakespeare and watch out for developing an inevitable addiction! Now, what are you waiting for? Go and immerse yourself in the wonderful world of Neo-Verona, where I\'m sure you\'ll be in for a real anime treat! original work.Nevertheless, this story was far from being truly original itself, for it not only borrowed from Shakespeare, but also from many other well-known tales such as Robin Hood, Les Misérables, and many others.

I made it to episode 22 of 24. Being very familiar with Shakespear's 'Romeo and Juliet' I wasn't sure whether it was worth watching, but it turned out not too similar to the original, so thats one good point. However, I think the storyline is a bit too ridiculous. When I finally got to the point where the ending was starting to unravel I just couldn't watch any longer. People who have no idea about Shakespear may like this, but for those who do: stay away! "", ""Oddly, when I looked it up, some of the cliches made it look very interesting, for whatever reason: a bad dude has massacred a family except for one girl who must learn how to fight and plan to take him over, while she struggles with a love. Meanwhile, there's this dude who's on her side, more or less, but isn't anywhere near as pure-hearted as her and has a much more troubling personal history. What's not to like, right? Well, once I started watching it, it didn't feel that exciting.Story: It's not at all like the Shakespeare show. The only real similarity is the retention...of Romeo and Juliet names, and the fact that they're from opposing families; they both die, but it's not even with a double suicide. However, if you forget this fact, it's mildly entertaining; the characters are cute and their wanderings at least give something to focus on. It is, however, nothing special; there are a lot of cliches and the characters aren't much good.Art: The art is, actually, pretty good; Neo Verona is a very attractive city; particularly worthy of notice is Montague's palace, which has beautifully-rendered halls, courtyard, and more. All the other locations also are nicely-done, and seem very earnest; the mines really look like mines and the abandoned village really looks like an abandoned village. Characters are very cute, with big Honey-and-Clover style eyes, and some have very interesting stylistic points: it can be a sight to see, watching Juliet's hair cascade down every time she removes that wig of hers. Although they are realistic overall, a few of the characters seem color-coded: Juliet's hair and clothes are red; Romeo's are blue; Mercutio's are green; Tybalt's are black, etc.Sound: The sound is nothing special. The background music is not worth focusing on, the OP is subpar compared to those of other anime (particularly Fullmetal Alchemist and Death Note), and the closings are terrible; I mostly didn't even bother to sit through them to see the scenes from the next episode!Characters: Okay, the weakest point of the show. Although the characters are cute, they are really not very well-done at all! My first hint of this came from what the show did to Benvolio. Benvolio is really clueless and stupid; he doesn't even know how to use a broom! It was awhile after when I realized that he wasn't the only one like that; Romeo was no smarter (he gets sent to a mine and farms while Juliet risks her neck). Even Juliet, who is arguably the main character, is an idiot: she keeps getting in trouble and getting rescued by Curio (etc.) or Tybalt, and doesn't emerge triumphant in any undertakings. In fact, the only truly interesting characters are Tybalt and Mercutio. Tybalt gets to have a lot of the action, and Mercutio's ambition and the horrors he faces as a result are well documented. However, they are the only exceptions to the rule that most of the characters are stupid and hard to enjoy; in fact, I may be rare to even like Mercutio!Enjoyment: As I said before, the show is mildly entertaining on days off. However, compared to other anime, it is nothing special, and is in fact much less enjoyable. I find I enjoy parodies of this show more than the show itself.Although I did enjoy watching the show, it is not a very good show. I am not a Shakespeare purist and was not expecting a show faithful to the Shakespeare; however, Romeo X Juliet is mediocre even if the fact that it draws from Shakespeare in any kind of way is overlooked.

The creators of this show (and the manga, of which I figure there is one) takes the story and twists it into more of a sort of Hamlet adaptation than a Romeo and Juliet. The forbidden, star-crossed love is still there, but there is now a revenge plot to reclaim what was lost.Even so, the story was still entrancing, as were...all of the characters. As a Shakespeare fan, I did appreciate a lot of the dialogue as well as the certain nods and nuances to the Bard\'s play and several characters from his works. Not to mention the Bard himself makes a hilarious cameo.The most endearing and appealing part to this show (as well it should be) though, is definitely the two leads. Their interactions are quite heart-felt and incredibly sweet. I will give this show a nod, as it really fleshes out the romance far more than the play ever did. The two characters talk and get to know each other a bit more than the originals did in the entirety of the three days that they knew each other. Even their deaths (oh come on, you knew it would still happen) was far more heartbreaking than it ever was in the play. The play has stupid teenagers not thinking through things. The anime has two young adults sacrificing themselves for the good of all and for love.Another creative touch they added to this adaptation was the role reversal of the two leads. It\'s not Romeo who sneaks into a party, it\'s Juliet. It\'s not Romeo who flees to Mantua. It\'s Juliet. It\'s quite interesting and a new way to look at the story. I couldn\'t help but think it made the show far more interesting to see how they would twist the narrative around further.My only issue I really had with the show was the way some of the characters were twisted around to benefit the story of this loose adaptation. Sadly, we no longer have the fun-loving witty Mercutio or the villainous, crazed Tybalt. Mercutio was the character I really mourned for. There was a lot of wasted potential on his part. Also, there was a definitive lack of play dialogue. I really was missing one of them saying the famous,""My only love sprung from my only hate!!""Wasted opportunity there, man.In the end, this show is definitely worth a watch, even I would say, for those who love Shakespeare or the play. While it\'s not a faithful adaptation - heck, it\'s hardly an adaptation at all - it still retains the spirit and the romance of the play. You still love the characters and you still wish for happiness for the two leads. It\'s well worth the watch.

It is a show that will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. A show that doesn\'t hesitate to stab you in the emotions, and twist the knife just to make sure.The two main characters, after which the show is named, are Romeo and Juliet. Just like the play by Shakesphere, the two meet and fall in love. Unfortunately, their love is that which...was never meant to be. The story follows this couple as they try to bring peace to their country, and end this horrific reign of corruption and death.A brilliantly paced and executed show, Romeo x Juliet is definitely a must watch for lovers of the romance/history/drama genres. This emotional rollercoaster will constantly keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next.While the art/music isn\'t anything to write home about, I couldn\'t think of a better way to have approached it. A Japanese/English rendition of ""Raise Me Up"" by Josh Groban, coupled with beautifully written violin and piano pieces, fit the general tone of the show. The art gives the characters a youthful look, without giving them that ""moe"" (overexaggerated eyes) look that we see in countless shows today.If your definition of a romance show is one that contains ecchi/comedy/harem, look elsewhere. You won\'t find any of that here. Those of you going into this show should know that this is a serious romance that tells the tragic tale of two lovers whose first love was destined to fail the moment they met.Would I recommend this show? You bet. If you are still debating whether or not you should watch this show at this point, just watch it. Trust me, you\'ll be met with a show that not-your-typical overrated romcom show. was never meant to be.

Trust me, you\'ll be met with a show that not-your-typical overrated romcom show.', 'Romeo x JulietThis anime shares it\'s name and renaissance Verona setting with Shakespeare\'s tragedy. That\'s where their similarities end. Most of the characters have the same name as the ones in the original work but their personalities, actions and life expectancy are entirely different. Most obvious difference would be that anime Romeo x Juliet follows the structure of greek tragedy as much a Naruto does, and there isn\'t a trace of that foul and stingy Shakespearean comedy. There might be some scenes that reference the original, but since I\'m not a Shakespeare fan, I only recognized a ridiculous balcony scene that serves more as a...reference pun than a plot advancing scene.StoryCapulets ruled Neo Verona until Romeo\'s dad slaughtered them all except Juliet and usurped the duke\'s seat. 10 or so years later Juliet is a freedom fighter fighting Montague\'s tyranny with the help of remaining Capulet supporters. Romeo is a ruler\'s son flying around worrylessly on his pegasus (yeah, he has one). I will divide the story into three parts: romance, action and fantasy storyline.First would be the romantic storyline that follows Romeo and Juliet\'s relationship.It\'s a pure love story about them falling in love and transcending social boundaries that separate them. There aren\'t love-triangles or similar plot devices so I was never frustrated, it\'s just a really nice and beautiful love story.Love without much drama sounds boring, but that\'s where the action/political part kicks in. Neo Verona is under rule of a tyrant so we get to enjoy the suffering of the lower classes and resistance members clashing with the city guards resulting in violent swordplay and high speed chases across the streets and roofs of Neo Verona. We\'re also shown some court intrigues surrounding Montague and other nobles. I\'d compare this part of Romeo x Juliet with Rose of Versailles or BBC/HBO/RAI tv series Rome. Even though it\'s nowhere near as great as the aforementioned series, it should be an interesting watch for anyone who likes historical dramas infused with some action.The fantasy storyline deals with a goddess and a flying continent. Neo Verona is a small continent floating in the sky due to influence of some godly forces that also maintain the natural balance of the continent. This part of RxJ serves almost no purpose until the last two episodes, it is painfully underdeveloped und totally unnecessary. I like fantasy anime and literature but from this sentence on, I will pretend that RxJ has no fantasy stuff except that the horses are replaced with pegasi.CharactersThe best part of RxJ is Juliet, one of my favourite female anime characters. She can stand her own in a fight with any male in the series and is a resistance leader loved and respected by both her followers and more passive citizens of Neo Verona. I\'ve watched a lot of anime where ""strong"" girls shut away their feminine side and end up waiting for the wimpy guy to save them when real problems arise, but Juliet is different, she\'s always true to her emotions and always chooses her own path. It might seem she\'s a mary sue from what my fanboyish mind wrote above, but I wouldn\'t classify her as one as she tends to screw up when she\'s ""choosing her own path"" (though my uderstanding of what mary sue is might be somewhat questionable).The other main is obviously Romeo, he\'s a skinny pacifist that I can\'t say much about because he\'s hardly noticeable due to Juliet\'s awesomeness.There\'s a wide variety of side characters, they probably won\'t become your favourites but they\'re fleshed out well enough to keep the story interesting.Art and soundArt and animation aren\'t groundbreaking but I find them above average. Neo Verona looks great, it doesn\'t have Assassins Creed\'s Florence or Venice level of detail but it still looks beautiful and it\'s easy to imagine oneself living in it. Charater design is ok, I liked it but there was some ""I\'ve seen these characters before somewhere"" moments. Animation is fluid during the action scenes.Sound is nothing special, japanese voice actors did a solid job, except when pronouncing character\'s names, but I guess you can\'t expect a Japanese that doesn\'t speak italian to pronounce Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet without any problems. Background music was ok, as I neither felt irritated by it nor felt it\'s absence. They used Raise me up a couple of times so I had to mute the sound since I hate the song (I also dislike the usage of modern music in mediums that use a quasi historical setting).OverallWhen you remove it\'s obvious influences from the picture, Romeo x Juliet is a very good action romance anime set in a detailed renaissance-looking city with a loveable heroine and an interesting story featuring political intrigues, revolution and an ""awww"" kind of love. I gave it a 9 because of Juliet being so awesome, but you can considered it an 8 if you think this review sounds too fanboyish in Juliet related parts. reference pun than a plot advancing scene.StoryCapulets ruled Neo Verona until Romeo\'s dad slaughtered them all except Juliet and usurped the duke\'s seat. 10 or so years later Juliet is a freedom fighter fighting Montague\'s tyranny with the help of remaining Capulet supporters. Romeo is a ruler\'s son flying around worrylessly on his pegasus (yeah, he has one). I will divide the story into three parts: romance, action and fantasy storyline.First would be the romantic storyline that follows Romeo and Juliet\'s relationship.It\'s a pure love story about them falling in love and transcending social boundaries that separate them. There aren\'t love-triangles or similar plot devices so I was never frustrated, it\'s just a really nice and beautiful love story.Love without much drama sounds boring, but that\'s where the action/political part kicks in. Neo Verona is under rule of a tyrant so we get to enjoy the suffering of the lower classes and resistance members clashing with the city guards resulting in violent swordplay and high speed chases across the streets and roofs of Neo Verona. We\'re also shown some court intrigues surrounding Montague and other nobles. I\'d compare this part of Romeo x Juliet with Rose of Versailles or BBC/HBO/RAI tv series Rome. Even though it\'s nowhere near as great as the aforementioned series, it should be an interesting watch for anyone who likes historical dramas infused with some action.The fantasy storyline deals with a goddess and a flying continent. Neo Verona is a small continent floating in the sky due to influence of some godly forces that also maintain the natural balance of the continent.

Yes, this is Romeo and Juliet but the anime has this complete entertaining twist making maybe the storyline even better than the original. Basically, Montague has taken over &quot;Neo Verona&quot; slaying House Capulet except its sole and only survivor Juliet who must disguise herself as a boy in order to survive. In this harsh and suffering society Juliet meets Romeo and thus the story unfolds.This anime has all of...your favorites like Mercutio, Benvolio, and even the play writer himself William Shakespeare and a cast of such depth making one question, is this really the &quot;where are thou?&quot; Romeo and Juliet??? I am a person who greatly judges any anime/manga by its storyline and this has to be my favorite anime I have seen this year (well, next to Paprika). I swear Romeo X Juliet will completely surprise you at its art, storyline and music which makes this series positively solid through and through.Okay, for you people who are not into the romantic stuff cause it is Romeo and Juliet like myself, trust me there is plenty of action fighting to keep you entertained from your very own heroine (that's right Juliet's the fighter in this one) and the rest of the cast. For the haters (just kidding), there's also romantic stuff for you too.This has to be the hidden jewel for 2007 because of what it is, a hated 9th grade final research and journal project Shakespearean play but as you can see from the previous post, the grading score needs to be boosted to at least 20 in order to barely justify the greatness of this masterpiece. your favorites like Mercutio, Benvolio, and even the play writer himself William Shakespeare and a cast of such depth making one question, is this really the &quot;where are thou?&quot; Romeo and Juliet???

In this, Escalus is a tree, okay?  He.  Is.  A.  Tree.  Paris isn't even in this, so there's no fight between him and Romeo which I did miss, but whatever.  The dialogue is close to what they would've said in Shakespeare's day, but, other times, it's more modern.  They do make it so that the average...person is able to understand what the hell is going on though.  If you haven't read Shakespeare before, it's quite easy to understand when it's being spoken.  Yes, the characters do use really formal language, but you WILL get used to it.  There are also a few plot holes, but they're nothing too major.  If you think of a different solution than the characters, then, yep, you found a plot hole, congratulations.It does stick to the Shakespeare ending of his play, but there is a twist to it, BUT, when it happens, you actually will be more understanding of their feelings than in the play.ART-8The background was beautifully designed.  The buildings were drawn professionally, I could actually see them being real.  All of the landscapes and buildings actually looked old or new, depending on the age.  Cracks were added to certain structures to add realism while cleanliness was added to the newer structures.  All the fog/mist added to certain scenes added a nice touch to the mood.  The roads were quite detailed, especially the dirt ones, you could see all the tracks etched into it.  The flowers were drawn quite beautifully and, whenver one was on screen, I could help but look at them because they really are eye-catching.  This may just be the pyromaniac in me, but the fire was both realistic and cartoonish at times.The character designs left something to be desired compared to the rest of the art.  For example, even though she had to dress up as a boy for so many years, Juliet's design could've been more girlish when she wasn't in her boy's costume.  She just always maintains the boyish aspect in her face and shoulders.  Even before she really knew the truth about her past, Juliet always looked like the war between the Montagues and the Capulets had affected her.  She looked like she remembered her parent's deaths, even though I doubt she did since she was only about two at the time.  I believe that Juliet's constant companion, Cordelia (I believe she was four at the time), should've had a slightly more depressed look since she'd be the best candidate out of the two to remember what had happened that night.  I cannot ignore the fact that Cordelia does have the mature motherly look about her which was a good touch.  In my opinion, the best character design was Montague's.  He looks like the guy who has everything, but still wants more.  His design leaves little to be desired since it fits his personality perfectly.SOUND-9Voices:  I've seen the series in both English and Japanese and like them both equally.  They both convey about the same amount of emotion and the casts were both fantastic.  It doesn't matter which of the two languages you watch it in, so just go for whatever language you prefer.Music:  It fit the mood and the time period almost perfectly.  There were times when it was more like the 1800's or 1900's than the late 1500's or early 1600's.Sound Effects:  All of them were fairly accurate to whatever happened that needed a sound effect.CHARACTER-7The main characters really do get some development, but I can't really say how much since it varies from character to character.  Most of the characters, even a few of the minor ones, have a backstory and a will that drives them.  You rarely question why they did something.  The only time you come to question them is in the final few episodes when every deision is made within moments that you barely have any idea what they're thinking.  One of the characters I enjoyed watching was William himself since he gave some good advice.  I also enjoyed the Father, especially in episode 5 when he described humans.The characters sometimes act predictably, but, it's primarily a shojo, don't expect unpredictable behavior.ENJOYMENT-6There were some parts I did like, yet there were a lot of aspects I didn't enjoy.  There were things that didn't make any sense at all.  If you do watch this anime, you just have to go with the flow and acccept everything.OVERALL-7It has action for the boys, romance for the girls, it's a great mix.  It doesn't matter if you're a boy or girl to enjoy this anime, if you like twists on original stories, then watch it and don't care what your friends think (yes, boys, I mean you).  Watch it with your husband/wife, girlfriend/boyfriend, group of friends, the household pet, random hobo, whoever you want!

Though different, RxJ manages to convincingly simplify and capture the mood and ideas of the Shakespearean original.Story and Character:The first half of the series is a riot of emotions. The story begins with the all-too-familiar scene of love at first sight, secret rendezvous and eventual escape/elopement. Romeo and Juliet are your typical tragic hero and heroine; faced against insurmountable odds, yet remain true to themselves and their beliefs. Makes you wanna root for them. Although this ideal scenario does seem kinda cheesy at times, it makes for good romance. And heck, what\'s a Romeo...and Juliet remake without filling it up with sweet romanticism?The second half is a slow and torturous climb to the climax. Here, the main characters, and subsequently you, will suffer their repeated separation and reunion, and their final clash of swords and ideals. The second half can get slightly confusing at times, especially when the fantastical elements come into play. It is also much slower paced compared to the earlier half, which might lead to some impatience from the viewers. My suggestion is to treat it as a deliberate attempt to allow us to understand what the main characters felt when they pined for each other.In short, don\'t be too cynical of the plot (and plot holes) and try to enjoy this for what it is - a love story.Art:Not fantastic, but no gripes here, except that it can be quite inconsistent.Music:If you are a fan of classical or instrumental music, you are in for an aural treat. RxJ soundtrack is unbelievably good. This is not surprising since the composer Sakimoto-san also worked on Final Fantasy\'s and Dragon Quest\'s soundtracks. The OP and ED were also really well selected. The OP is a soulful Japanese rendition of ""You Raise Me Up"", setting up the mood of the show, while the EDs ""Cyclone"" and ""Goodbye, Yesterday"" fitted the hectic progression in the first half and the painstaking second half. In fact, I recommend listening to its soundtrack and re-imagining the story based on the music alone. Let loose your creativity and come up with your own version of RxJ along with the soundtrack, with each track representing a scene or an act in your imaginary play.In conclusion, if you are looking for a dramatic anime with pure love against stacked odds, look no further.It seems obligatory that I have to end with a short poetic abstract of RxJ. A tribute to its origins of sorts.Two households, both alike in dignity,In fair Verona, where laid the scene.From ancient grudge breaks new mutiny,Where civil blood made hands unclean.From forth offspring of two foes,Cruel fate brought close their souls.Through the fearless journey of their death-marked love,Could the people of Verona reclaim earth and hearth.Thus the star-crossed lovers staked their life,With their death buried all vengeance and strife.And so ceased all suffering, hate, and rage,A close was brought to this bloodied stage.""In life and in death we shall betogether forever till eternity.""~Romeo x Juliet and Juliet remake without filling it up with sweet romanticism?The second half is a slow and torturous climb to the climax.

This anime in all aspects should be regarded as a masterpiece. This anime is the perfect example of taking a story that has impacted human history, and change things around to make it your own take on it. Romeo x Juliet takes one of William Shakespeare's most famous plays, and does something with it in a way we've never seen before. This is your typical story of two star crossed lovers who do what ever they can to be with each other and either one or...both of them dies. Not only that, but this anime also pays an homage to other Shakespeare plays such as Two Men of Verona, and MacBeth, and even uses Shakespeare himself as a supporting character The animation was done by Studio Gonzo. The studio behind such series as Desert Punk, Black Cat, Afro Samurai, and Basilisk. Romeo x Juliet I think has their best animation by far. Animation on par with Hellsing Ultimate, and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. While the music and acting are just your typical anime music and acting I don't think it's bad in this case. There's only so much you can do with that. Onto the characters. Both Romeo and Juliet in this anime are in the same character as they are in the play where as Supporting characters such as Amelia and Marqucio are just standard cliche anime supporting characters. Lord Montegue on the other hand is hands down one of the most thrilling villains I have ever seen in any anime out there. He was so evil, so cunning, and so maniacal, I'm surprised he was made by Gonzo of all people. I enjoyed this anime so much I watched it over the course of a week. I just couldn't put it down. Over all this is by far one of Studio Gonzo's best, and to date the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. both of them dies.

I have never read Romeo and Juliet but I know the general story, and I must admit, the plot captured my heart and I started watching it right away. I love the development in the relationship between Romeo and Juliet. A forbidden love that wasn\'t supposed but did, in a way it was a beautiful thing. I expected to competently follow the original story, but I was quite wrong, it really had a big fantasy element...and I actually think it made the story way better then it would have been if it had followed Shakespeare\'s original story. A floating island in the sky, a magical tree that keeps that island alive, dragon steeds and godesses are defiantly not part of Shakespeare\'s work, but it made the anime that much more enjoyable. For me though, as much as it was a ""happy"" and ""exciting"" anime, it was also a bit tragic. There were a few times when I was like ´ Д｀~noo! but there  were also many times I was like ⌒▽⌒ ~yay! I won\'t spoil anything, but the ending really is a moving but tearful one (well, it was for me anyways).The art at first ind of caught me off guard. It\'s like a semi realistic type of anime compared to just normal, skinny, big eyed anime. I honestly didn\'t like it at first, but you get used to it and in a way it grows on you. The backdrops were nice though, the castles and the rest of the kingdom were drawn really good and it showed the historical element of the show quite well.  As it is, I am a bit of a sucker for historical anime and manga, and when the art doesn\'t look very historical and nice then I am completely turned off, but this anime was drawn quite appropriately to fit the time period of the anime was set in.As for the sound, I give it a thumbs up. The opening them was so beautiful and I sill listen to it now, and every time I hear it all I can think of is the anime. I watched the anime dubbed, so I don\'t know how the sound was in Japanese, but the actual story of Romeo and Juliet takes place in Europe, so of course the anime did too. So, to suit the time and setting they used the ""Old English"" when talking . Sometimes I found it a bit hard to grasp what they were saying because of the way they talked, but for the most part I understood and it really helped give the anime the historical factor.I loved the character development. As I said the relationship development between Romeo and Juliet was really good. It was paced just right, never to fast and never to slow. Seeing them fall in love throughout the anime and watching them over come all the hardships and challenges they faced together was great and kept me on the edge of my seat in a way. I also liked how the director didn\'t try to over include the supporting cast. Sometimes they can be too much and too overpowering for their role but in Romeo X Juliet the supporting cast was there just to be the supporting cast and that was really good. All of the characters did their part in the anime and all fit their role perfectly.Overall I think I have made it fairly clear that I very much so enjoyed this anime and it is definitely one of favorites. If you are looking for a great romance and  historical anime with some fantasy and action, you will love Romeo X Juliet! ^.^ and I actually think it made the story way better then it would have been if it had followed Shakespeare\'s original story.

Don\'t get me wrong, Shakespeare\'s work is amazing but this has a great twist and time difference.Well when you first start off watching it, the Artwork is amazing which brings you into the story like its a normal thing other then thinking about ""dragon horse???"" it makes you accept it and other things cause how well it goes into the story.Now what really got me are the OP & ED theme songs, they are great and this is the first time i actually keep watching it for each episode instead of...fast-forwarding it.Well i cant really say much but its a must see. wow i actually said it -.- fast-forwarding it.Well i cant really say much but its a must see. wow i actually said it -.-', 'Quien no ha leido esta maravillosa obra del maestro Shakespire?, bueno de hecho yo no y creo que hay muchos como yo pero eso no es un crimen o si? XD, en todo caso, esta adaptacion al anime ofrece maravillosas escenas, la trama envolvente en donde se dan las disputas entre llos capuleto y los montesco pero desde otro enfoque mas fantastico y mitico que el hallado en la novela orginal (que no la haya leido no quiere decir que no sepa de que trata XD) el sonido es maravilloso, realmente conmovedor y en general la trama se encarga de envolver totalmente al espectador desde...todo punto de vista. Una maravillosa animacion de los estudios Gonzo :D todo punto de vista. Una maravillosa animacion de los estudios Gonzo :D', ""This anime displays the ever so classic, Romeo and Juliet a play written by the ever so famous play-writer in history, William Shakespeare.... With a twist!~On this anime, charming prince Romeo is part of the royal family of Montague, while beatiful Juliet is the rogue helping people, and once a member of the noble Capulet family before her family was murdered. This twist, really got me attracted. It shows the typical romance and trials they had to get past, in this medieval world. It also has mystical creatures and fictional events that come into play. And displays some politics, &  corruption during this time....With all these in, they even add the little romance that Romeo and Juliet had, being the noble and the rogue, they couldn't simply show their love. The ending is the same as the original, sorrowful, it hurt me, I knew that was coming, one reason why I didn't finish it but it's still an amazing, epic story of how a person would go so far for someone they love. Even with that sad part, I still love the anime.If you love the renaissance period and if you like the plays of Shakespeare, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one.

It had a bit of everything in it. Romance, adventure, action, fantasy. A real tear-jerker at the end of the series though. The anime is more serious then comical however I was still obsessed with it for ages and have even re-watched the entire series. It was so exciting and I could even feel how the characters felt. The overall script was also very clear and easy to understand.So I HIGHLY recommend this to ANYONE!!!!(P.S. This is my first ever review. Hope I helped) ', 'When I heard of a great Shakespeare play becoming an anime, I was extremely excited. I am truly sorry to say this kind of let me down. Of course, it IS an anime, it should have twists and be awesome (like any good anime) but I just did NOT get it. It had a great first few episodes, the heart racing kind, then it went a little downhill... After about episode 8, everything (I mean everything) I could see anything that was coming a mile away. Cliche does not even begin to describe it. I believe this had a lot of potential, but it is...pretty hard to describe why without spoilers. If you think this is for you, you go ahead! I just think they missed the mark on this one. pretty hard to describe why without spoilers. If you think this is for you, you go ahead! I just think they missed the mark on this one.', 'Much of what I would write has already been written about this being a vey interesting twist on a classic story, so instead I will focus on how much fun this was for a Shakespeare fan.  While the differences are obvious, the play with which the writers made of the classic script was rather interesting.  Romeo X Juliet is filled with literary references to the original as well as to other works of the Shakespeare.Often times side comments made in jest were excuses to allude to actual phrases from the original.  For example, Mercutio telling Hermione that Juliet might have...gone after ""the object of her idolatry"" is a direct reference to the following line of Juliet\'s from Act II of the play  ""Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I\'ll believe thee"".That is just one taste.  I apologize if this wasn\'t as useful a review in terms of giving a full account of the anime, but as I said, others have done that well enough.  I just thought this aspect of the anime shouldn\'t be overlooked for those who enjoy the Elizabethan era writer.As an aside:  I did not like the opening theme and any of the similar style of music that sometimes cropped up in the anime.  I just dislike that disney style whitney houston diva singing.  The rest of the soundtrack is fine. gone after ""the object of her idolatry"" is a direct reference to the following line of Juliet\'s from Act II of the play  ""Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I\'ll believe thee"".That is just one taste.

But what if anime had a turn with the play? Can it turn...out to be good or like the Three Musketeers adaptation directed by Paul WS Anderson, it could go downhill from here?The plot is still quite similar to the play with some major differences to the play. The Capulets and Montagues are still feuding adversies like in the play but unfortunately for the Capulets, they don’t have a lasting appearance even during the start of the series. Leontes Montague and his men led a bloody coup and murdered every member of the Capulet family, with the exception of one person and yes, it is Juliet Fiammatta Arst De Capulet also known as Odin, when she disguises herself as a boy with short hair. She also masquerades as a vigilante by the name of the Red Whirlwind, who swore to aid the people who suffer from the reign of Lord Montague and his men. However, here comes Romeo Candore De Montague, who is generally the polar opposite of his father. He is kind-hearted, obedient, and noble and as you may guess, he and Juliet start to fall for each other.This is actually quite a change-up for the better. The gender roles here might be switched as the primary focus in the series is Juliet. In other adaptations and the original play, Juliet is mainly the shy and meek girl but in here, she’s a very strong, independent, and well-thought out character and is actually quite likable.Romeo, on the other hand, is really not that interesting at first, but he does get to that point where everything starts to fall into place. Another change from the play, while Juliet is arranged to be married to Count Paris; in the anime, Romeo is the one to be arranged married with Hermione, a young noblewoman from the House of Borromeo, and yet she’s not really a character from the play. Most of their characters in the story are borrowed from other Shakespeare plays.Other characters include Cordelia, Juliet’s best friend since childhood and also the representation of the unnamed nurse in the play; Conrad, captain of the Capulet Guards and the one who saved Juliet from the massacre; Francisco and Curio, a duo part of Juliet’s friends who fought alongside her; Tybalt, a mysterious warrior (also a vigilante) also has a deep-seated hatred for Lord Montague (and one of the reasons I can’t reveal to you. It is, after all, a spoiler); Antonio, Juliet’s sidekick; & William, a playwright whose works have not been well-received and also has allusions and pictured as a caricature to William Shakespeare; Benvolio, one of Romeo’s close friends; Mercutio, an sly noble who wants to become Montague’s heir due and soon become mostly like him, mainly because Titus, his father, is an degenerate alcoholic and Mercutio is often ashamed of him.The only slight problem I had in the series is the villains, who are just insanely evil just to be insanely evil. They obviously don’t care that people are rebelling against them and the fact they are just being dicks. They have no motivation but just to do what they want to do and that’s it.The music score is well-made and appropriately goes along with the series. The opening song, ""Inori~You Raise Me Up〜"" (祈り〜You Raise Me Up〜)?) by Lena Park, is a love ballad with some inspirational moments in there, overall, it’s a nice song. I did like the first ending song ""Cyclone"" (サイクロン)?) by 12012 and occasionally I did sort of sing the lyrics by myself…….horribly. The second ending song ""Good Bye, Yesterday"" by Mizrock is decent but I still like the other one better. I’m surprised GONZO did the animation to this series since I have only previously watched another GONZO-made series (Afro Samurai) and I loved that one.  The animation looks impressive in the first half of the series while some quality drop, it still held its ground.FINAL VERDICT: It may have gone through some changes in story, characters, and atmosphere; it did work out for the better and leaving only little and meaningless flaws IMO. This is one of the romantic forms of media that doesn’t come off too cheesy, overrated and only alienates different audiences. I really did like this series for what it was.

It was out of boredom that I decided to watch it recently, but I had no expectations of actually enjoying it. How wrong I was proved.Overall the anime was beautifully written and the spin on Romeo and Juliet was very well done, with many surprising twist that will keep the viewer interested. Juliet's character was well developed and notably was a strong heroine...figure; something that is refreshing to see. Though the art wasn't too much to my complete liking (a bit simplistic for my taste), the story made up for it and kept my interest (admitted there were a few dry episodes in the middle but both the beginning and ending make up for those one or two episodes). I would recommend that people who like romance and a bit of action as well as a some angst watch this. It's well worth it.Though I would suggest that you make sure you have a box of tissues with you at the end if you're prone to crying easily. figure; something that is refreshing to see.

All of their actions are simply just pure evil for the sole purpose of being evil without any reason whatsoever. Case in point: when they go looking for Romeo, who has disappeared without reason, they learn he...passed through some village. So what do the carabineri do? They take all of the villagers as prisoners, and start BURNING DOWN THEIR HOUSES - just because Romeo happened to pass though the village at some point before. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?

There are those which are pretty good (Throne of Blood) and there are those which are glorious masterpieces (Ran). This anime version of Romeo & Juliet falls kind of somewhere between. The story centres around the forbidden love people are familiar with.BUT WAIT. What's this, everyone is now on floating island? There are horses that can fly?Ok, fine. it sounds like the worst idea imaginable, I know, but there are forces at work here which make this series pretty good on the whole. The central characters (not just our titular pair) are well written and...developed, the animation stands out quite well, given Gonzo's reputation for sometimes letting a few mistakes slip into previous works.The key thing above all things, however, is the english dub, which does something the original japanese does not. It adapts the script into Shakesperean dialogue, which just makes everything just seem right. But, you say, the voice acting is probably inferior? Nothing could be further from the truth. To be honest with anyone reading this, Romeo & Juliet in my view is a strong contender for having the best dub (alongside Black Lagoon, Kill la Kill, Toradora!, Excel Saga, Baccano! and Steins:Gate) ever recorded. developed, the animation stands out quite well, given Gonzo's reputation for sometimes letting a few mistakes slip into previous works.The key thing above all things, however, is the english dub, which does something the original japanese does not.

Por un lado, que el odio a los Montesco por parte de los Capuleto responda al exterminio de su casa, la usurpación del trono y posterior difamación, sin contar la incansable persecusión a estos, es un añadido sumamente interesante; sobre todo en un punto que Shakespeare deja tan ambigüo en...la obra original. El ver como Julieta es obligada a vivir con un álter ego, escondiendola incluso de sus propios aliados, junto con las escenas que nos muestran los arrestos a las sospechosas de ser descendientes de la casa Capuleto, nos dan no solo la primera impresión del peligro al que están expuestos, sino también de la situación política que vive Neo Verona.En lo negativo, lo primero a destacar es lo desinspirado del surgimiento del amor entre los protagonistas, respondiendo mas que nada a una suerte de ""enamoramiento a primera vista"" y no a un crecimiento gradual por parte de estos; haciendo que como espectadores no sintamos ningún tipo de cariño por la pareja, sobre todo si nos quitamos el preconcepto de que son ""Romeo y Julieta"". Continuando con el tema del romance, este no hace crecer a los personajes; porque sí, Romeo y Julieta maduran a lo largo de la historia, pero su relación no, al punto de que parece un amor mas basado en lo superficial y el ""gusto de lo prohibido"" que en un sentimiento genuino; sin mencionar lo egoísta y posesivo de ambos protaginstas, algo que hereda de la obra original. Otro elemento que quedó descolocado en la trama fue Escalus, añadiendo innecesariamente fantasía e irrealismo en una historia que hasta el momento, si bien tenía ligeros toques de magia, las situaciones era sumamente realistas, asimilables y plausibles; sin aportar nada realmente mas que una justificación para que la ""tragedia"" ocurriese. Para concluir, el final también fue decepcionante, no tuvo ni el 10% del impacto de la obra original y debido al contexto fantástico previamente establecido, parecía más ser el episodio final de un shonen de peleas que de una historia trágica/dramática.En materia personajes, la serie también es un gris: no decepcionan, pero tampoco destacan. Romeo y Julieta se sienten como un potencial desaprovechado, ya que si bien estamos frente al concepto de personajes que establecieron el arquetipo de ""los amantes prohibidos"", la adaptación con el nuevo contexto familiar de los Capuleto y la posición social elevada de los Montesco pudo haber permitido un ver alguna variación interesante en las personalidades de los protagonistas. Pero la serie optó por aferrarse al arquetipo y, si bien el Romeo y Julieta originales son muy buenos personajes, estos quedan reducidos a simples imitaciones, siendo incluso mas genéricos. El cast de secundarios estuvo bien dentro de todo: buen tiempo en pantalla, caracterización decente e identificación clara de sus afiliaciones; siendo quizá la excepción el Gran Duque Montesco, quién raya el papel de tirano unidemensional que gobierna con puño de hierro porque es malo y punto, además de tener un ""pasado trágico"" que lo hace ver como el oportunista mas afortunado de Neo Verona.El apartado técnico es bueno, sin destacar demasiado por ello. Los diseños no se apartan mucho de lo genérico, aunque destacan por ejemplo los ojos mas pequeños que la media del anime, dándole un toque mas ""europeo"" a la serie, lo que me pareció una excelente decisión. Tiene errores mínimos, como el color del cabello del Duque que era negro en su infacia, verde oscuro en su juventud y azul oscuro en su adultez, o cuando Benvolio detiene a Romeo en su pegaso y esos se mantienen flotando en el aire sin usar sus alas. La musicalización es lo mejor de la serie.En cuanto al entretenimiento, si bien este es el punto mas subjetivo, la serie se va haciendo progresivamente mas aburrida, sobre todo en su desenlace, irónicamente.En conclusión, Romeo x Juliet es una adaptación más de tantas que pasó sin pena ni gloria, pero que para los fans del género o de la obra original puede ser interesante y hasta de su agrado. la obra original.

The story is well paced, and quickly grows in momentum. At times, there are some predictable moments and the story simmers down, but there is always something to get it on its feet again. With such an engaging story I expected the conclusion to be a let down, but it ends both beautifully and dramatically.Art:The art is not particularly amazing, but in my personal...opinion it is still very good. The characters are not drawn so exaggerated as in many animes, and neither does everyone look the same-which is a welcome change.Sound:The sound soundtrack played throughout works as a warming addition to the tale-especially in the final episodes, the music plays a rather important part in creating a majestic end.Character:Our hero and heroine are both interesting and complex which is a relief! Juliet is not a weak and vulnerable protagonist, but is strong and determined. I love the fact, many characters are not portrayed merely as 'good' or 'evil', everyone has their own past which shapes who they are. There are many characters in this story, due to the sub plots within the anime, and though some are cliche, for the most part they are original and realistic.Having just watched the new Hollywood Romeo and Juliet, and now this anime, I must say this tale was a far more captivating one.

One such example of a perfect &quot;fitting&quot; event would be at the beginning when Juliet arrived at home, took off her hat, and got her hair brushed by Cordelia. This event was soon followed by the introduction of other characters, and so it fitted with the story. The only one aspect of the plot of Romeo x Juliet which I did not like was the introduction and the explanation of Escalus, the tree &quot;goddess&quot;. I didn't like it because the artists or director of this anime only used a few short scenes to explain what Escalus really was. It would've been better if the director spent half of an episode to explain the origins of Escalus, or how Escalus actually works, etc...Besides from Escalus, I thought that the plot of RomeoxJuliet was excellent.I thought that the art of this anime was somehow different than any of the other art in other animes because of many reasons. First, the eyes of the characters were drawn with less emphasis on the eyes; this is different from those &quot;sparkly&quot; characters from other romance anime. Second, the action scenes were much better drawn because more colors were used to emphasize blood, or other &quot;casualties&quot; of fighting. One such example of this is the ending, when Romeo bled and blood fell out from his body. The blood from his body were well-detailed.Lastly, the characters and the sound of the story had many strong points and many weak points to them. I will explain the sound first. The background music of the anime gave me the feeling of that scene. One such example was when Romeo and Juliet lived in that village. The music of that scene was sad, but at the same time it had a loving feeling to it. That made me feel very connected to how Romeo and Juliet were feeling about each other. I didn't really like the background music of the ending scene because it gave me tears :D!!! I thought that the characters of Romeo and Juliet were very well-made to fit into the environment of the anime. This is probably because the director made the character do certain things that would fit into the story, such as having them go to balls and fighting. If the director were to make them practice magic with a staff (like the ones in Mahou Sensei Negima), then the characters would've been an &quot;awkward&quot; addition to the story. Asides from the two main characters, I thought that the other characters were very well detail, except for the gardener of Escalus. As mentioned in the plot paragraph, the director or artists of this anime did not really focus much on Escalus and how it works. This explanation would go toward the gardener character, too.Overall, I thought this anime was a very sweet, tender, and loving anime that anyone can learn to love. Romeo. Juliet. Forever. with each event &quot;fitting&quot; perfectly with the next (that may not have made much sense, but what I was trying to say was that the events in the story are very well made). One such example of a perfect &quot;fitting&quot; event would be at the beginning when Juliet arrived at home, took off her hat, and got her hair brushed by Cordelia. This event was soon followed by the introduction of other characters, and so it fitted with the story. The only one aspect of the plot of Romeo x Juliet which I did not like was the introduction and the explanation of Escalus, the tree &quot;goddess&quot;. I didn't like it because the artists or director of this anime only used a few short scenes to explain what Escalus really was. It would've been better if the director spent half of an episode to explain the origins of Escalus, or how Escalus actually works, etc...Besides from Escalus, I thought that the plot of RomeoxJuliet was excellent.I thought that the art of this anime was somehow different than any of the other art in other animes because of many reasons. First, the eyes of the characters were drawn with less emphasis on the eyes; this is different from those &quot;sparkly&quot; characters from other romance anime. Second, the action scenes were much better drawn because more colors were used to emphasize blood, or other &quot;casualties&quot; of fighting. One such example of this is the ending, when Romeo bled and blood fell out from his body. The blood from his body were well-detailed.Lastly, the characters and the sound of the story had many strong points and many weak points to them. I will explain the sound first. The background music of the anime gave me the feeling of that scene. One such example was when Romeo and Juliet lived in that village. The music of that scene was sad, but at the same time it had a loving feeling to it. That made me feel very connected to how Romeo and Juliet were feeling about each other. I didn't really like the background music of the ending scene because it gave me tears :D!!! I thought that the characters of Romeo and Juliet were very well-made to fit into the environment of the anime. This is probably because the director made the character do certain things that would fit into the story, such as having them go to balls and fighting. If the director were to make them practice magic with a staff (like the ones in Mahou Sensei Negima), then the characters would've been an &quot;awkward&quot; addition to the story.

Forever."", ""I had mixed feelings about watching this anime because of the title and I thought it would just be another drama romance that drags everything out.I was most definitely wrong, I watched this anime in one sitting and wasn't bored for a second of it.Watching as Romeo and Juliet's romance continue made me want to ship them like mad.The soundtrack for the series is outstanding and was brilliantly performed.The story I have definitely seen in other places but they changed the typical plot for revenge into a exciting romance which I will definitely watch again and buy the dvd. "", ""So yeah. We all know the tragic story of Romeo and Juliet; The son and daughter of rivalling families who fall in love with one another. We all know the cheesy crap the said to each other. Pain, hatred, sadness and a love that could not be. Nothing new about that. So with that said, it may seem impossible to make an interesting anime out of it. Without boring people with corny, overused vows and predictable plotlines. However, Romeo x Juliet proved the opposite to me.Story:The first thing I liked about this story already was the fact that the 'Mysterious Hero' in this story, is...the girl. It's the girl who saves innocent townpeople in distress. It's the girl that risks her own life in order to save other's. All that, while in the beginning, the boy is more of a wuss. A very kind wuss though. =] Apart from that, the story didn't seem to be all that promising from the start. The first few episodes were a little bit predictable. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, fall in love, and then find out it's an impossible love and all that stuff, but it got way more interesting after a few episodes. The story gradually unfolds in a way that's easy to follow, yet not slow. Turns out there's a lot more to it than Shakespeare's original play.Art:Okay, initially, I had a little problem with the art style. But as soon as I got used to it, I also came to love it. It's way more realistic than all of those huge-eye-animes, and that suits the story as well. (I'm not saying the story's realistic though, it's fantasy after all. ^^ But the feelings of most of the characters were illustrated very realistic.Character:Sometimes I get a little tired of anime where every character looks identical except fot their hairstyle and -colour and their eyecolour. It's really refreshing to see something like Romeo x Juliet once in a while, where you could immediately recognize each character just by looking at them, even it they were wearing a wig and colour contacts.Based on character design, there are three sorts of anime: Anime where every single person is pretty. Most of the time I find anime like that pretty annoying, but in cases like Clannad, Ef, or Nana, I can get over it. Second, there are anime where all the goodies are beautiful and the baddies are ugly. (Even more annoying, if you ask me). And last, there are anime where characters looking ugly can still be good guys, including handsome bastards. Romeo x Juliet belongs to the last sort, and also the most realistic sort. Even better is the fact that basically there are no real goodies or baddies. Most of the bad guys just do what they're told because they're scared, and even the biggest badass is not completely evil. It's no good or evil. Just people like you and me who do good and bad stuff. That's the way I like it.Overall:This is the very best anime I saw ever since Clannad, and I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good love story. It got me in a really romantic mood, and sometimes; I just wanted to hug my laptop. It didn't brought me to tears, but I think this should be able to make somebody cry. For the anime-boy-fangirls among us, there's plenty of drooling materials with Francisco, Tybalt and Romeo himself. However, if you want bouncing breasts and 'accidental' panty-shots, you shouldn't bother wasting your time watching this until you grow up. the girl.

I can’t really say I do, because if there’s one genre I can’t stand, it’s romance. Well, kind of. I’ll never pass up an opportunity to do a little character shipping or see some really sweet scenes, but soppy romance just makes me want to throw up. Romeo and Juliet is FULL to the brim of soppy romance, so I guess I am inclined to give this anime a lower score.Let’s start off with the story. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, and heavily implied...through the title, this is an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Needless to say, it has the same basic plot line. For that plot line, I would give a 5. However, I’m able to move that score up one notch because of the differences presented between this one and the original. I really did like the new setting of Neo Verona, in a sort of future environment, that the Capulets have been almost obliterated. In short, I found the numerous tweaks on the story intriguing and ultimately better than the original (gotta say, I’m not a huge fan of Shakespeare, possibly because of the amount of plays bearing his signature I’ve had to study and will have to study in the future). I add one more point to the score because of the plot twists. No, setting it in a different environment and shaking up the story weren’t enough - we also discover that the natures of characters are not as it may have seemed - they are actually quite complicated.However, this is another failed ending. While it does include some of the tragedy of the original play, it doesn’t make that much sense. It’s nowhere as confusing as the ending of Kyoukai no Kanata, but it’s still puzzling and kind of disappointing. I would use this to bring the story down by 0.5, but since I’m feeling nice today, I won’t.Next comes art. It’s quite obvious that this was a low budget anime. The art style isn’t too dreadful, in fact scenery and particularly buildings come out quite nicely, but the characters… Well, they’re not that dreadful. For once, they look much too old, and they do not bear the traditional anime-style traits. I will admit that some characters are cute and/or mildly good-looking (I think ‘mildly hot’ would be a little bit of a contradiction - don’t you?), but the rest, well, I can only say one word - Meh. A big fat ‘meh’. Juliet looks nice, I would say, only in the opening when she has hair up and is shouting. But, I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. No more than a 6 in my opinion.Music was okay, I really don’t have much to say about this subject. I liked the first ending theme. Perhaps it’s because I have so little to say about this that I give it a 5.5.Next comes character. This is perhaps the first time I am criticising character because of a different factor other than development. The character development here was decent, it was okay. No it’s not that which caused me to give this a 5. In fact, I could almost say that it’s because of the character development that I give this a 5. Now I’m starting to sound like someone who is never happy, which is not the case, so let me explain.I’m aiming mainly at Juliet here. Her character is sometimes so grown up and other times so childish I firmly believe that her age changes constantly between 5 and 30. I watched this anime with my dad, and most of our time was spent yelling at Juliet and laughing at her ridiculous decisions. She may be good in battle, but in strategy, even I, the person who never plans, am better at her in seeing future scenarios. She makes such stupid decisions at times, what are supposed to be dramatic scenes turn plainly comical.She is also so lovestruck with Romeo, it’s past hilarious. While he is also in love with her, his case is nowhere near as bad.I also think that too many characters have little or no relevance to the plot. For instance, Regan, or Hermione. And I LIKE Regan, so I’m not being biased her. I also think that Antonio could claim child abuse. I mean, making that tiny, little, cutie-pumpkin fight? It’s criminal.Romeo is also one of those perpetually lucky protagonists, which is another cliche element that I cannot tolerate.Sometimes I think that the most decent character in the anime is Cielo - the dragonsteed (a horse with wings). *scoffs*Really, some characters made this anime comical, which I don’t think was intended.To conclude, while this was an interesting adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, it did have some confusing elements, okay art, and sometimes ridiculous characters.Story: 7/10 (would give 6.5)Art: 6/10Music: 5.5/10Characters: 5/10 (I’m being nice here)Enjoyment: 6Overall: 5.9/10 (rounded to a 6)A/N: Thank you to all those who have commented on my reviews!

This is a good show underestimated.I wasn't very excited to watch a show about Romeo and Juliet because I'm not too much into romance and drama. The romance on this show was not the dominant hero. It went side by side with a much greater cause.First, as a person who studied English literature in college, this was a big treat. Imagine having a mash-up of Shakespeare's characters in one place. This is Romeo x Juliet. We even have Shakespeare himself.The creation of Neo Verona gave the story a new depth and flavor. The conflict is...not about merely a teenage couple but it the struggle of a nation. The topic of the star-crossed lovers is accentuated. It does not follow the original plot per se so it leaves you wondering what will happen next. It is also fun to try and recognise which character if from which other play by Shakespeare. It is a choice of stereotypes.One more personal bonus for me was the first ending song. It's so beautiful and sad despite the upbeat music. It has a sense of nostalgia and something in it just tears my heart.story: 9art: 8sound:9character: 8enjoyment: 9 not about merely a teenage couple but it the struggle of a nation.

No unpredictable turns... But then again, no desire to try and predict something. What politics? What war? What plot? Hey, they look so sweet together.""-"" If cliché put you in a bad mood, you\'d better not to come close... If you\'re thinking when you\'re watching, avoid this of all costs. And hey, their logic makes you facepalm so hard. I nearly broke my nerdy glasses doing so.', 'If you were looking for a faithful anime adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, sorry to disappoint this isn\'t it. Please go watch the 1963 film bc that\'s the closest you will get to one.Now I\'m not the biggest fan of Romeo and Juliet, mainly because the play is full of too many contrivances and miscommunications and weak characters all mixed in with the most flowery of rhetoric. Now my boy Willy Shakes was never really known for his ability as a story teller but HE IS A MASTER OF LANGUAGE! Shakespeare can take the shittiest story and make it classic because he knew how...to use language in such a way that makes it so.So, to see an anime adaptation of R+J not only completely turn the story on its head, but actually making our two leads interesting and likeable characters, while also having lines pulled directly from the play and other references to Shakespeare\'s works? And my boy Lil Will from Stratford upon Avon born and raised is an actual character?! Color me impressed.Like I said this is not a faithful adaptation, there are a lot of changes from the original play. The capulets and the montegues are not wealthy merchants with a rivalry that no one can fucking explain. Instead the entirety of the capulet family isn\'t even in the anime; having been the slaughtered ruling family of Neo Verona, ending their rule by the wicked villain montegue, where he ascends to the throne as Neo Verona\'s ruling tyrant; holding power with an iron fist. Juliet is the sole survivor of the house of Capulet and must hide her identity and disguise herself as a boy until her 16th birthday were all would be revealed. Romeo, being the son of the now dictator prince, is a young man with a gentle soul always looking out for and willingly helping others. He looks upon the oppression of Neo Verona sorrowfully and vows to make things right when he assumes the throne. Juliet must take it upon herself to reclaim her birth rite and free the people of Neo Verona. They fall in love and work together to build a world where they could live in peace without their families names. There are a lot of references to Shakespeare\'s other plays including character names like Petruchio, Antonio, Cordelia, Ophelia, etc.Animation wise, it was pretty solid although there was some jarring CG used in some of the landscape and scenery backgrounds that kind of looked bizarre. There was also the branches of the esscalis tree that were animated with CG and they look like PlayStation 2 graphics, they were pretty bad. The character designs were really nice, and special shout out to my boy tybalt HE IS SOOO FREAKING HOT LIKE DAMN JULIET WHAT YOU DOING WITH ROMEO\'S BITCH ASS WHEN YOU GOT THAT BEEFCAKE TYBALT HANGING AROUND YA GIRL!! Yea I sort of developed a crush on him bc he is hot and mysterious and has black hair and momma like her the cool mysterious types.The music was absolutely finominal, but I should warn you if you don\'t like ""You Raise Me Up"" by Josh Grobin you will not be able to stand the score; they play that song like 65% of the time in English, Japanese and instrumental. Also you need to watch this in the English dub bc duh it\'s Shakespeare!Overall, I give this anime a solid 8. It does loose a couple points for it does slow down a bit halfway through and we get like 3-4 episodes where Romeo is at this mine and tries to start a village with the prisoners who worked in the mine and yea didn\'t really much care for it. It also lost a point because of the ending. So if you don\'t want to be spoiled ( but you know how it ends because everyone knows how Romeo and Juliet ends) STOP READING NOW! Go watch the anime!!Ok, WTF was up with that ending. If one thing did not work in this anime is the whole plot with the esscalis tree bc When you think about it, it\'s fucking stupid. According to Ophelia, there were two trees instead one but one died so Juliet has to die in order to give life back to the tree that\'s left because it is also dying and the world will crumble and fall if it dies. Romeo dies trying to save Juliet from this fate and kills Ophelia ultimately destroying the esscalis tree. BUT THEN THE BITCH SACRIFICIES HERSELF TO THE FUCKING TREE ANYWAY. Wtf was the point of Romeo dying to protect you of yo ass was going to die to give life to the tree anyway. WHY? And also, NEO VERONA WAS A FUCKING FLOATING ISLAND! The entire reason to save the esscalis tree was because it was the source that kept Neo Verona a float. In the end the city falls anyway and get this, it was a mother flipping island the whole time. Like I don\'t understand did these people not know? William said they didn\'t, so what did they think that Neo Verona was the entire world? We\'re there minds not blown when they touched upon the ocean and saw there was more to their world like wtf? Why was it played off so lightly their world turned out to be a whole bigger than they could ever imagine! The more I think about it, the stupider it gets so I\'m just going to chalk it up to being fucking anime. Only in anime man.

Thanks for reading the review!', 'Story: about 6.8, really, but 7 was a bit too high.As has been mentioned, RxJ is an adaptation of Shakespeare\'s Romeo and Juliet. I too, would like to draw attention to the word ADAPTATION. Meaning, any Shakespeare purists who would complain about a butchering of Shakespeare\'s original, should steer clear, now. From the first episode, it is evident that the plot is totally different, and this really could have been a very good thing.Instead, two key things were not handled well, and it turned out to be at best a good thing, with misgivings. First, if they\'re going to throw in the Tree subplot(if...you watch, you\'ll see what this means by about the middle(around episode 12?)), please explain it better throughout, and not toss in the hurried explanation towards the end. I personally am very fond of fantasy stories, and appreciated the explanation about the tree\'s purpose(if you\'ve read JRR Tolkien\'s the Silmarillion, it parallels a part of this). The random :cough: gardener was also...random, and severely underdeveloped. Her purpose felt really contrived.Also, Montague, Romeo\'s father. As mentioned by many, his character is so extremely the one dimensional evil villain...and then they try to save his one dimensionality by also cramming in a ""sad"" backstory at the breakneck ending. Except, again, cramming does not a good story make. Definitely does not get his character any sympathy either.If these two elements of Montague and the Tree\'s importance were better integrated, then Romeo x Juliet fantasy could have been much better.Art: Being a poor judge of art, and very not creative to the max, I can\'t really say much. But it was smooth enough, and never made me wince about how the characters are drawn(with a few exceptions of Juliet\'s nose). Much unlike...:cough: Naruto fisheye shots :cough:Sound: Props to Juliet and Romeo\'s seiyuus, also to Tybalt\'s, Willy\'s, and Montague\'s. Juliet and Romeo\'s seiyuus felt like they grew into the roles, and seemed to express more emotion, especially when calling the other lover\'s name, as the series continued. Tybalt=Byakuya nii-sama=win.(total bias, forgive me). Montague\'s deep/sonorous voice also suited his despotic character. Kazuhiko Inoue as Willy in a flowery voice was also amusing.Otherwise, the opening and its sibling english cover of ""You Raise me Up"" was very memorable, as mentioned. Soundtrack, not so much.Characters: Minus major points for the random Gardener, and Montague, as mentioned in story. Otherwise, none of the characters really made me go GACK, and I was definitely shocked and sad at the ending of the two lovers. None really stood out either though. Tybalt was shoved to the side for so many episodes! Mercutio also! That is not good.Enjoyment: As I\'ll tell all my close friends, I\'m very much a closet romantic and big sucker for sap. Combine sap with my more boyish love of fantasy, sword fights, save the world and such, and you\'ve got a very very enjoyable anime for me. Again, minus a point simply for how much the Gardener and Montague made me wtf through the middle.This is pretty personal though, and most of the population I\'ve met think cliche=cliche=bad, and especially rolled all into a ball like this.Overall: 8...6 or so? More than 8, but if we remove the wtf, then I\'d actually be raving about this anime as one my top favorites. It isn\'t quite that, sadly.Again worth mentioning though, for me, the ending was really beautiful and poignant, and a very good close. It managed to actually make me miss Romeo, who spent most of the story as an unreformed Suzaku-falsely happy, preaching love and peaceful things, and doing a whole lot of nothing. you watch, you\'ll see what this means by about the middle(around episode 12?)), please explain it better throughout, and not toss in the hurried explanation towards the end.

Outstanding. I have never seen any other anime like this one, it's doesn't have a typical story and the plot is well-written. Although I have read only up to Act 2 of the original Romeo and Juliet script in the past therefore not qualifying to be able to differentiate and criticize between the original and this version, I find this anime entirely amazing and utterly stunning out of all other animes I have watched. There are many changes though, because it is only loosely based on Shakespeare's work. Also, I was completely hooked that it was almost as though it wasn't...just an anime anymore. xDIt's just out of the ordinary.To be honest though, the only points I didn't like about it was that there was rarely any humor, and instead, it was all seeerious like Peach Girl. But that makes it appropriate and well-suited to the whole plot, story and background anyway. If it was comical whatsoever in any way it would've been a joke altogether.Also, sometimes there are scenes of violence that I can't stand. At least they don't display the actual sight of the bloodshed, but the way they present the scene in those moments just send shivers down my spine. ._.Whatever, overall, it left me with a huge overall impression.I definitely recommend this anime to, well, entirely everyone. just an anime anymore. xDIt's just out of the ordinary.To be honest though, the only points I didn't like about it was that there was rarely any humor, and instead, it was all seeerious like Peach Girl.

Please realize, however, for those of you who have yet to watch it, the title, I believe, is purely for commercial reasons. Using the title of something so familiar was what first drew me to it, and I am certain that was their intention. Quite clever, really. Apart from the 'star crossed lovers' plot, there is no similarity to the play. When they say it's loosely based on the play, they mean a completely different thread.They borrow names from other of Shakespeare's plays, such as Ophelia, and Patrucio (if that's spelled right) But I found no...similarities to the characters of the 'original' plays.When Romeo leaves the mines with the other workers, it truly shows his competence as a ruler. In the scene where his father dies, there is a very clear contrast in which you see both Romeo's and Montegue's capes; Romeo no longer wears the family crest, meaning he truly gave up his name. In that same scene it is obvious they used the ending of Hamlet; the poisoned sword and all that.On a historical note, the besieging of the castle in episode 22 (I think) was reminiscent of the Glorious Revolution, of course in the revolution, the king simply flees to France, but still everyone else surrendered and even welcomed the rebels.The end was befitting, and I loved it, but I kept hoping they were still alive 'till the very last minute of the last episode. Perhaps it had been wishful thinking, but I kept seeing hints that they would live--like when they acting out the play in Mantua and Juliet doesn't say the lines assigned to her. Also, how Romeo seemed be almost maturing as a leader. I hated it, really, because it kept you so optimistic and then, they're dead.Unfortunately, I don't think there was much character development. It feels as if they remain static. None of them really change through out the series. I think they could have expanded a bit more on some of the supported characters, since we still don't know what was Cordelia's original connection to Juliet. Was she a maid or daughter of a loyal noble? Antonio as well. I didn't even know he was the old man's grandson until the very end. And how about the other two? How did they get involved? The ending left a lot of unanswered questions.I did like watching it, but in all honesty, I was a bit disappointed with the romance. I didn't quite feel the conflict. Really, what's to keep him from joining rebel forces? I don't know if this is simply me being silly, but when I watch a romance I expect to feel giddy or depressed depending on the even, and I was only touched (not enough for tears though, which I would have hoped for) when they died at the end.

The most obvious difference it is more in-lined with fantasy, semi-action and of course the romance/drama genre.Its story simple if you read or know the novel, it is basically like this: two families, war, unrest, lovers, romance and death those are its main concepts. The flow of the story is more like the simple introduction, conflict, climax, conclusion and ending. The built up or the pacing is quiet slow and more on story based than action. However it has its different approach on...concept it’s more modern or somewhat does not follow the stereotypical damsel in distress and other clichés the characters are okay and easily understandable. The plot is good with mix of fantasy and a few turn of events that are obvious on what’s going to happen but nevertheless quite fascinating. The romance on this anime is plain a bit cheesy but still quiet romantic depending on the viewers. Next is the action element, the fight and death scenes are bit mild it just adds a dramatic effect on the stories events for example duel of handsome guys or a display of martyrdom. As for the music the opening song and the BGM is good but I like the ending song it has a somewhat rock. Although the BGM is good it still lacks a certain vibe. The characters voice actors are good. The art style and . How the characters are portrayed are more on the typical but not totally cliché but still retain their distinct features and personality that are unique in a way.

The first chapters will catch your attention, the middle could be repetitive and a little boring, but the final chapters save in a incredible way the hole history.If you\'re looking for a romance history, I can recommend this one.Story: Like I said before the final chapters will make you happy to seen this anime. I like that the sequence...of the story will reveal hints that induce to guess the ending. Maybe in the middle you may think ¿this chapters are really necessary? I would said not for the main history, but for characters. Is really original in the develop since I know the original one, and I\'m sure you will satisfy with the end.Art: At the begging I have some doubts if it really gone fit with the characters but as the story progresses it will. The landscapes are really nice, and the main characters outfit suit really well. Some of the character designs appealing don\'t really convince me until the end, but others fit in the instant you see them. The art is not may I say ""strong"", I mean there not will details in everything but the important thing, It offer a soft atmosphere that follow the love history.Sound: The seiyus personifying very well the characters, and in a love history of course for love scenes will be romantic music. The background music and sounds fit very well, and you should take into account the time that the anime was released for evaluate the quality. The opening is really beautiful and sadly romantic, but since some times the history need to be known as soon as possible, the opening relax the climax. The ending songs suits, second more than the first.Characters: At the begging I was not totally convinced with the main, since they keep acting in the same way, specially Julieta, excepting a strong and decided woman, not always is like that, but for this is that the other characters exist, to complement her. I really like Tebaldo, is the kind of character that make the history more interesting because is full of mysteries, and sure he is. But in general the develop of each character is well done, it could be more but its just the necessary to understand the history.Enjoyment: Like I said I enjoy watching it but I won\'t repeat it. Its a great anime that I can recommend If you have free time and want a romance history that will surprise you. Im sure you will enjoy if you see it until the end. of the story will reveal hints that induce to guess the ending. Maybe in the middle you may think ¿this chapters are really necessary?

But watching this I was gobsmacked.  Thinking about it my jaw hit the floor.  This was at all not what I was expecting.  Floating islands flying horses rebellion all intertwined around the classic story of Romeo and juliet.And the title song they chose I instantly recognized as it is an all time favourite song of mine.  And it is beautiful in japanese and is the perfect choice I felt for this.If you...come to this anime to try and fog off studying the play for an english project just to watch some Anime and try and cheat that way you will be disappointed.  It is not the original story that shakespeare wrote but in a way it is plot wise.  If you come looking for a good anime to watch that just has a habit of pulling you in and shouting NO!! at the grand ending then this ones for you. come to this anime to try and fog off studying the play for an english project just to watch some Anime and try and cheat that way you will be disappointed.

My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryHmm, what can I say. To be honest I\'ve never seen any of the more ""classical"" adaptions of Romeo X Juliet story, nor the original. So this is for the most part my first experience with such story. It\'s possible I\'ve seen similar things but simply with different title. Point here remains that this is my actual first ""Romeo X Juliet"" experience.Anyhow, I did find the progression in the story just fine. Although the contents I found oddly boring. It is suppose to be tragic love story....Which I understand, especially how it was bound to be wrapped up, but in the end became less tragic.Biggest question here still for me is. Why is their relationship tragic, why should offsprings care what their parents did. I just cannot understand it. I mean, if my love of the life would be actually a daughter of a serial murderer that also killed my family. I just wouldn\'t care, yes hate probably the criminal, but that would be limited to that criminal. Not automatically hate the whole family tree. Same as with respect, is with hate. To get it, you have to earn it.Aside that, I can say, I finished this series instead of dropping for a very simple stories. I absolutely love love, and idealize and thrive for vanilla love. So in that aspect it was enjoyable show. Had some cute scenes and their relationship was okay for the most part. But yeah as mentioned, for the most part I found the story and lot of plot points quite moronic if not annoying.Moral of the story is that story wasn\'t bad, it just didn\'t impress me.✦Art & SoundVisuals were okay. Good enough.As for sound, once again, writing review weeks after finishing the series, which means I cannot really remember details anymore. And I cannot  remember it being either bad or good. So probably that means most of the tracks were okay\'ish. But some had actually quite a presence, which means ""sound"" aspect was good enough.✦CharacterWell, not fan of whole ""stage play"" acting. Find em oddly annoying. Especially by how they speak or act. Thankfully this anime didn\'t have such ""acting"" as much I imagined it would have. But to be honest, no characters really impressed me.Probably only one I can think of is that theater story writer. Rest were either boring just simply with no presence.Our main coupling wasn\'t as interesting either. There was some growth and progression regarding the characters within the story, but in the end I found the characters ""meh"" valued.✦Enjoyment & OverallTo sum it up all. It was quite a mediocre series for me. Didn\'t enjoy much, saw multiple stupid elements, didn\'t really get into characters nor in general got much impressed.As said, if this series wouldn\'t had romance element (+vanilla coupling) I would quite likely dropped it by the episode of 10. So yeah, some cute moments. Sums it up for me. Which I understand, especially how it was bound to be wrapped up, but in the end became less tragic.Biggest question here still for me is.

There are not two influential families in (Neo) Verona, only one, which is the Montague family. They took over the rule over Neo Verona by slaughtering the whole ruling family, the family of Capulet, 14 years ago. One of the few survivors of that night was the true heir to the throne, Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet who was later on hidden by loyalists in wish to, one day, overthrow the Montagues and take over the rule over Neo Verona.Juliet would eventually find out...the truth on her 14th birthday but even though she never knew what had happened to her family she tired to protect the people of Verona as the Red Whirlwind. She is basically a Red, European version of Zorro from the movie The Mask of Zorro (I guess we all know that one).And there's also that part when she meets Romeo, the prince of Neo Verona, son of the man that murdered her family. But of course, they don't know that yet and fall madly in love. In addition to that, an ancient prophecy will also try to get in the way of their love but will they be able to actually 'defy the stars'? Now, in my opinion, the anime would have been truly amazing if it weren't for the prophecy/fantasy part and here's all why.First of all, let's talk about the story in general. It was outstanding. The whole part about hiding Juliet until she is fourteen and then coming up with a plan to take over the throne was both intriguing and exciting. I just love what anime do to classics like this one. Gonzo Studios turned a romance tale into an action/fantasy drama that should definitely be seen. If only I had seen it before but I always though that the anime would be only about the romance.Secondly, Juliet as the Red Whirlwind was amazing. A strong and fierce swordsman fighting for justice in her hometown. Not only is she accounting for most of the thrilling action in the anime but also building up a strong relationship to her people which would be of uttermost importance in the end of the anime. Her fight for justice is what is giving the people of Neo Verona hope that a better time will come and I was truly happy and excited to see how her destiny literary guides her all the time.The romance was of course an indispensable part of the story and it was as cheesy as I expected it to be, but it was still nice. Their relationship might look like love at first sight but you can actually see how it develops trough the anime. It is not forced nor rushed and as cheesy as it might be I must admit that I enjoyed it for most of the time.And now the part that I didn't like that much. As the anime progresses, a prophecy is slowly introduced to the viewers in a really intriguing way and I was definitely excited to see where it goes. But as it turned into a supernatural/fantasy I slowly lost interest. Not because it was bad, I love fantasy, but it just didn't fit into the whole story. It was too much and in my opinion the anime would have been ten times better if it stayed that way. A realistic setting of two families fighting for the throne and a young love in between was truly enough for Romeo x Juliet to be a masterpiece, but it was not.Still, I cannot deny that the story is brilliant with or without the fantasy part and I'd really like to add that it is better than most of the anime stories I have seen recently.CharactersI might not remember the Juliet from Shakespeare's play, it's been way too long since I read it but I definitely love the anime version of her. As I said in many of my posts, my favorite type of characters are those amazing, fierce, strong and independent female characters and Juliet definitely made it to the top. She is all that and still a sweet and caring person that is not afraid to take the lead when it comes to fighting for her people. Romeo's personality was just as great. Just a sweet, down-to-earth prince that is trying to change the way his father rules over Verona. He was a great support to Juliet and a well written character despite his somewhat cliche personality. Many of the side characters were equally as well presented in the anime and I'd like to mention three: Cordelia, who was a mother/older sister figure for Juliet. She was such a sweet character and a great support to Juliet in her hardest times. Tybalt is a mysterious character that joins the Capulets later in the show. It is his secretive personality and his history that make him stood out among the other characters And in the end, Romeo's father Laertes Montague.  From the looks to his behavior, he was the perfect antagonist and scary as hell if I may add.Animation and StyleIt is really interesting to see how the design of anime animation evolves from let's say the 1990's over the 2000's and from the 2010's to now. Just by looking at the design,  not the animation quality, you can predict what year an anime is approximately from. What I dislike about Romeo x Juliet is not the animation quality (it is 2007 so I cannot compare it to today's animation) but the dull colors in the anime. I have the feeling that the makers somehow decreased the saturation of the whole anime. Still, I must mention that there are many beautiful scenes and backgrounds in the anime that I loved especially the flower beds. The character design was also great so on the whole, the animation and style were actually pretty good.ConclusionThe story of Romeo and Juliet has been told so many times but is seems that the world will never get enough of it. Tragic or not (no spoilers 😉), it is a story that gives people hope that love can defeat any evil. Romeo x Juliet is the same yet a completely different tale set in a fantasy version of Verona that is waiting for the return of the righteous heir of the throne, the daughter of Capulet. The story is so much more than a simple drama or romance. It is a story about freedom in every sense of this word that is both emotional and thrilling at the same time. I might not like the fantasy part about the prophecy, thinking that the story would have been better if it remained in a somewhat realistic setting, but it still far from not being good. It was amazing.So, to all you having doubts that Romeo x Juliet is just a cheesy romance anime, it is. But it is at the same time so much more. Don't miss it, I am sure that you will enjoy it as much as I did. the truth on her 14th birthday but even though she never knew what had happened to her family she tired to protect the people of Verona as the Red Whirlwind.

This is my first time writing a review so I have no idea how well this will go but ""ahuehuehue"" it anyways.Story (9):Not really what you expected to happen. At least, if you want to watch it to see how would the anime look like. Honestly, tho I had read the play and I was with the idea ""Oh well, I\'m going to be bored"" in my head, I went ahead and watched it. If you think about the show as an interpretation within an interpretation you\'d get it somehow why it happened the way it happened....I\'ll give you a hint: trees. But because it was made this way there are chances that you wouldn\'t agree/like it, so it\'s a bit ""dangerous"".Art (9):Nothing much to say, I pretty liked it. It was bright and the details were well done. Irises flowers and petals were astonishing. There were a bit of weird noses around, but let\'s not make the end of the world from it.Sound (8):What I can say about the OP? One word - amazing. But sound isn\'t only about the OP. I really felt sometimes like it was really ""silent""- just the voice acting. And talking about the voice acting, I felt like the Japanese version was better made. Not quite sure if just my preference to the language, tho English is my second one, or the acting was stronger. Watch an episode dubbed and one subbed and choose. Imo, it really matters in your enjoyment how you find the voice acting.Characters (7):Some characters do a lot and you don\'t get much about them, some do a little and you could say more about those. There\'s no balance. I really expected Juliet and Romeo, at least those to develop more.Enjoyment (9):Yup. As for me I pretty had much fun watching. After a batch of episodes I was always ""going"" to sleep. But, I was finding myself thinking what will happen next, why something happened and ""OMG JULIET YOU DID IT AGAIN GJ GIRL"" or ""OMG...."" oh wait sorry spoilers. Spoilers sweeties. Seriously, I really had fun.Overall: 8 I\'ll give you a hint: trees.

Seriously, I really had fun.Overall: 8', 'I have seen this on my recommended list quite a lot of times but have always been hesitant to watch it. I have never liked Romeo and Juliet the Shakespear play and was expecting this anime to be just as bad. I was wrong........While the basic storyline is the same, the whole star crossed lovers and all, the details are completely different, and to top it all off, its a fantasy too. There are flying horses and all sorts of magical stuff that improves rather than detacts from the story.While it may completely destroy shakspears play, it is far more enjoyable and i want to...strangle the main two characters far less. Definitely worth a watch! 9.5/10 strangle the main two characters far less. Definitely worth a watch! 9.5/10', 'For a while now, I\'ve been alternating between watching newer and older anime. While I do think it\'s important to keep up with the great stuff that\'s coming out more recently, something I failed to do for quite a while, I also think checking out stuff from the past, especially ones a lot of people haven\'t seen, is a worthwhile exercise too. I\'d heard decently good buzz from other critics on ""Romeo x Juliet"", and I like the Bard alright, so I gave it a watch.My highest praise for this series, oddly enough, has to go to the dubbing stuff, most especially the writers. They...easily could have just translated the dialogue into English and be done with it, but instead they not only used Shakespeare-appropriate dialogue wherever they could, they also fit it into iambic pentameter, the rhythm of dialogue consistent throughout much of his work. It genuinely elevates the work, not only connecting it better to the source material but also giving the words that some poetic quality that makes a good Shakespeare performance worthwhile. It also goes without saying that the cast is good as well, with Brina Palencia as Juliet herself doing a great job, she really captures both the gravitas and the humanity of the character.I\'m also one-hundred percent behind their alterations to the story. Pulling in other Shakespeare plot elements, such as cross-dressing women and corrupt monarchs who must be overthrown, feels natural, and the way it recasts their romance by changing the power dynamic is interesting. Both leads are also made more compelling characters: Juliet\'s vigilantism and idealism makes her likable; Romeo\'s astonishing levels of compassion makes him a cute love interest for her. The very fact that it is Juliet, not Romeo, who leads much of the story is a great way to tell the story. The romance between the two, while still playing heavily on ""Love at First Sight"", develops at a reasonable pace, and I\'m happy they spend more than half the series actively in love with the other, and not just pining. The whole plot to overthrow the tyrannical regime also worked well for me, at least in concept.Where this series fell flat for me the most was how it handled the conclusion. Rather than develop the strong ideas it had at the start, it instead skipped past much of the intrigue or warcraft to instead tie everything to the science-fiction/fantasy roots of the setting, which I was never a huge fan of in the first place. Neo Verona was okay, but I feel like the story would have worked just as well in something more mundane, the fantasy was never a huge sell for me. By the end, the story gets so far into the minutia of its world that the plot and characters suffer, and with it my interest plummeted. It isn\'t like this was the prettiest show on the planet (in fact it was fairly middling work from an already lower-rate studio), and while it has a fantastic OP (it took me quite a while to figure out it was a cover of a famous English song) and ED the music isn\'t something that blew me away either. The ending soured me on the entire experience so much that a series I\'d hoped would end up a favorite of mine instead equaled out to just be sort of okay. If you\'re someone who thinks the premise sounds neat, than I\'d recommend giving it a few episodes and seeing if it sticks in your brain, but otherwise it really isn\'t worth going out of your way to see.

It's because it was so original and different for the way the story was told that I loved it. The ending was BS though. There was no reason for it to end that way. There were so many other ways it could have ended. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the ending for one of the characters was unavoidable and it does happen. Though in this trying to like defy fate they just go in a circle and go back to what...they were originally trying to stop. Even so, that's not the reason its BS. The reason is that what they were saying in the end totally contradicts what's happened already in the series. They only think differently in this case because they're all in love. Other than it being BS though, the ending was visually appealing and the sound was amazing. That's all just my opinion though. I would definitely recommend this. Tybalt is THE BEST character though. That is a fact. they were originally trying to stop. Even so, that's not the reason its BS.

Other than it being BS though, the ending was visually appealing and the sound was amazing. That's all just my opinion though. I would definitely recommend this. Tybalt is THE BEST character though. That is a fact."", 'This is a show that I did not expect much out of, not only from the title signalling that the premise is not 100% original, but that the idea of star-crossed lovers has been done time and again with this anime\'s source inspiration being probably the world\'s most known telling of such a story.Visuals wise, for the time this anime came out, its quality is definitely lower budget than its spring 2007 contemporaries. Still, the feel and character designs are elaborate and distinct enough. This show probably nails around the midtiers. The animation is largely pretty smooth and as it\'s not too action heavy, there\'s...not a lot of poorly budgetted shots.Art: 6Unfortunately, the sound is largely lackluster. There is a distinct lack of originality to be had with the opening song effectively being a translated version of ""You Raise Me Up"". To make it worse, because the original of that song was not composed or written for this show, its atmosphere or its message, whenever this song is played, it grinds eerily against the mood of the scene (it tends to play in romantic scenes). The other tracks are fine, the majority of the OST is not a poor fit most of the time and the ending themes are at least original and fitting. For the flaws in the sound and a lack of tracks to make up for it, this area does poorly.Sound: 3However, one area that does well is the main characters and support cast. Juliet and her inner turmoils are very realistically portrayed. Her desire to right the injustices handed down by the Montagues is a very human and relatable one. It\'s conflict with her inate girlhood and desire to love and be loved romantically and find happiness with her beloved is most understandable for her age, and easy for the audience to empathize with. Romeo, who starts off as someone who will pretty much fall apart and listen to his father eventually also grows through his bond with Juliet as well. He becomes someone who gains the courage to stand up to his abusive parent and consolidate his feelings on his given identity versus the identity he wishes to take up. For those with verbally abusive parents and a lack of support due to financial or social situations leading others to think their abused position is something worthy of envy, he becomes an especially relatable character.Where applicable, this show has also fleshed out some support characters. Hermione starts off very flat as the mandatory forced fiancee, but her own feelings on the matter and conflicts with the main couple forced her very realistic feelings to come to light. The miners in a later story arc also portray very realistic minds for the things they went through and their feelings on the current monarchs. Other notable support characters with good characterizations include Tybalt and Mercutio.Lastly, while the job here is imperfect, there is a distinct attention paid to explain the motivations of the show\'s main villain. Still, the antagonist do not come off as grey or even worthy of empathy and even those with real-life blue-and-orange morals cannot hope to empathize with him.Characterization: 8As for the plot, despite being heavily inspired by William Shakespeare\'s original work, there were enough touches to the plot to make it more original. The fantasy elements and world of the show is very well built for what was needed. The atmosphere of Neo Verona is well portrayed and is done in a way that the audience can empathize with the plight of its people, and the heroine and her supports.Moreover, despite the nature of the source material, the nature of this work is more in line with a story of political rebellion ala French Revolution (with magic mixed in somehow). As such, the star-crossed nature of the main couple\'s relationship does not have as much focus as the original and the plot comes off as more uniquely its own rather than borrowed.The flaws to this approach is that the resolution of the couple\'s ending then comes as unnecessary as most of the show focused on the political tension between the people and the nobility, with the foreshadowing of the need for the expected ending of the main couple coming off as vague and the elements leading up to it, unnatural. The show could have, in fact, taken out the Escalus tree aspects of the plot altogether and told a much more uniquely original story with vaguely any influence by Shakespeare.Story: 7To finish, this show did some things really well, but overadherence to its inspirational material caused flaws that were not possible to overlook. Coupled with the black&white nature of the villains vs the main cast, and lack of exploration of higher concepts, this show is locked from hitting the highest rating tiers but nonetheless reaches an excellent score.Overall: 8As a extra, regarding enjoyment of this show, I personally had not expected I would enjoy it. I had expected it to be bland as I already know the story of Romeo and Juliet. Most people have heard of it and its ending before high school and many across the world have read it as part of a literature class at some point by high school graduation.Yes, in spite of my expectations, this show surpassed what I expected and then some.Enjoyment: 7 not a lot of poorly budgetted shots.Art: 6Unfortunately, the sound is largely lackluster.

(B Tier).Romeo X Juliet was on pace to be a 9 through 16, 18 episodes, and if the ending/story outcome was different could have ended up a 10.  Unfortunately, the ending fell short and left a somewhat sour taste on an otherwise outstanding series.Characters were well done, the story is an interesting take on a classic, and the setting adds intrigue.  Not an expert on art/music, but the soundtrack was well done and...the art was pleasing.Romance between Romeo X Juliet is refreshing- no high school timidness, shyness, inept characters etc.  A mature, adult, if somewhat ""puppy love"" -esque romance.  Juliet is particularly well done, with her character as the Red Whirlwind an outstanding addition.  Romeo is a few notes less complicated, yet still endearing, and his mid season arc with the mines and village definitely helps add some depth and balance to the character.I was absolutely loving this anime until the final act, where the insertion of a supernatural element derails what was previously a grounded inspection into humanity, fate, love.The closest comparison i can make is when the source material is a light novel or manga that wont see further adaptation other than a single anime season or an abrupt cancellation; the last 2 episodes in particular seem totally out of left field, depart from the tone of the story and present character \'development\' which is head scratching.  This is simply inexcusable for an anime where the source material if a completed work of over 500 years; either the planning was glossed over or the execution failed, neither of which is a particularly satisfying explanation.Still, all that being said, Romeo X Juliet is an outstanding romance anime which stays mostly clear from common anime tropes, especially for adults who are rather tired of \'classroom\' \'shy MC\' \'unable to admit his/her feelings MC\', or any number of other childish rubbish.  The majority of the series is engaging, interesting and definitely a pleasant viewing experience with a good deal of intrigue.  Depending on your interpretation/expectation/tolerance for supernatural \'deus-ex\' type endings, you may have an even better interpretation than I did.TLDR:  Outstanding, refreshing and interesting version of Romeo X Juliet, a well done romance/adventure/action/drama.

I have always loved the tragic story of Romeo and Juliet, in it's old and wondrous English, full of emotions. Right away when I watched the first episode, I knew that it was going to be good. It kept the older English, and that immediately made me love it. It was just as tragic and beautiful as I remembered. There are some fantasy elements that are not so in the book, and the two families are not feuding, but House Montague has killed House Capulet, and Juliet is the...sole survivor. I have to give a warning, the ending is near unbearable. There was so much pain in my heart watching it, and I don't know if I've ever cried so hard watching an anime. Seeing Romeo and Juliet's precious moments together makes it hard to say goodbye to them, and to a world without them. Be prepared to cry. Honestly, I could cry just thinking about it. I think that we put off this story as a trope so often we forget to just simply see how sad it is. A girl and a boy, in love, their families at war. A love so deep, neither could live without the other. Truly, there was never more a tale of woe, then of Juliet, and her Romeo. sole survivor. I have to give a warning, the ending is near unbearable.

I will admit in the beginning this show was a bit slow getting into but as each episode went on, it just got better and better!The story is alright, I never saw the original Romeo and Juliet so I can't say how accurate it is to the original story but I still enjoyed it even if I haven't seen the original. I think this is an anime that almost everyone can find something in it. I really like the characters in this version and I think this is the first time I just loved an anime...solely because of the characters. These are characters you can react to like Juliet might be my favorite female character in an anime or any media. I really got behind her pacifism and kindness attitude. And then there's my favorite villain in anime Montigue. He's evil but his motivation for being evil is unexpected I just never thought about it.As for the art/animation/whatever I think it's okay but it never really wowed me with it's animation. As for the sound I think the music is good but like the animation it never really stood out either however what does stand out is it's excellent English Dub. I know this might sound crazy but I recommend watching the English Dub over Japanese with subtitles.The English dub did something neat and that's adding Ye Olde English to the mix and it's not just a gimmick the delivery of some of the lines are brilliant and adds a lot to the overall experience.So yeah it gets 10 from me all around.

Although its based on the beautiful play by William Shakespeare ""Romeo and Juliet"", it has a fantasy brush to it.The story is more than just Romeo and Juliet, the star crossed lovers, it is its characters and how they evolve and struggle through everything that happens along the story line. But surely it does center greatly on Romeo and Juliet\'s everlasting love.The story is outstanding, and I found myself crying, laughing, and feeling joyful every second of the series.Story: 10The art is the essence of perfection.

It includes elements typical of anime, such as fantasy, but also features the iconic scenes, like the balcony, that fans enjoy.The story is genuinely impressive, with diverse climaxes and thrilling moments throughout the show. The first ten episodes are particularly intense, following the emotional and tragic experiences of the main characters. While subsequent episodes are more subdued, the narrative picks up again, demanding your continued attention.The art style may be...challenging for some initially, but you\'ll become accustomed to it within a few episodes. The backgrounds are stunning, especially the expansive flower beds. The art is well-executed, avoiding exaggerated features commonly found in other shows, such as oversized eyes or overly skinny limbs.The opening theme is particularly memorable, and you\'ll find yourself humming it long after the series has ended. The impact of Lena Park\'s rendition of ""You Raise Me Up"" is demonstrated by the anime images that come to mind.The director deserves commendation for the mental development of the main characters. The romance between the hero and heroine is delicately portrayed and gradually revealed throughout the show. This aspect is executed flawlessly, avoiding the predictable love-at-first-sight scenario and adding significance to the story.Despite being an excellent anime, I must confess to experiencing some fanboying moments during the exceptionally sweet and touching scenes scattered throughout.

The first few episodes were great but it had it\'s problems  it seem they would fix these over time they don\'t.  The story doesn\'t follow the original material so read the book not manga. The main bad guy looked to be OP and looked like the ""good guys"" had no shot.  Also the bad guy is awful to everyone including the rich noway he would have stayed in power for that long.  Also the bad guys look unrealistic they are cartoonish evil.  There a supernatural elements which i won\'t spoiled but it...not necessary and comes out of nowhere.  I have no idea if this is earth.  Another problem is  the characters don\'t improve.  Romeo is weak and timed and I have no idea if Romeo is straight because he seem to like weak boys Juliet passes for a boy when her hair is up so I can see why Romeo liked her.  Romeo can\'t stand up to his father even after his father tired to killed someone he knows.

Kidou Butouden G Gundam,https://myanimelist.net/anime/96/Kidou_Butouden_G_Gundam,"['The story itself is simple and fun, and minimally engaging. I like how it has unpredictable elements in it and you don&rsquo;t really expect certain things to happen. The premises within the Future Century universe where games, politics, and wars is handeled through the Gundam Fight is quite an interesting concept in my personal opinion, because I frankly think that&rsquo;s how things should be. We wouldn&rsquo;t have war, and it&rsquo;d be pretty entertaining. But sadly, the people on earth will be collateral damage as a result.The presentation of the culturally diverse cast is of course where the Ring ni Kakero influences come into play. Certain...portions of the characters are stereotyped or portrayed in what Americans would find not politically correct. I mean, the Russian is a prisoner? The Japanese portrayed as righteous? The American portrayed as strange and arrogant? And the list goes on. If you&rsquo;re not offended by that kind of stuff, then you&rsquo;ll probably laugh because it gets to you in that kind of way. Because the Japanese are oblivious to the concept of political correctness, they can of course get away with doing something like this in their own country. In addition all religious referenes such as Domon&rsquo;s future Gundam, known as the God Gundam, or G Gundam for short is changed to Burning Gundam; and the Devil Gundam would be renamed to the Dark Gundam.I really enjoy the characters because of their personalities and they each bring in different elements to the show. Domon is the quiet and anti-social super powered guy; while someone like Chibodee is the obnoxious loud mouth comic relief character. Even some of the minor characters like Alleby have their own contribution to the advancement of the story as well and has some touching moments that I don&rsquo;t want to get into because it would be a spoiler.Along with a whole new set of story, setting and characters, you also get new Gundams. For traditional purposes obviously, a huge majority of the Gundams will stick to the grill face, have either the green and yellow eyes, and still maintain the iconic red, white, blue, and yellow color scheme. But they add new details to certain Gundams to make them look more culturally authentic to each country. Like Lumberjack Gundam of Neo-Canda is literally meant to resemble a Candian lumber jack. The Gundam Spiegel piloted by Schwartz has a skinny frame to give it the agility and speed that gives blitzkrieg-esque assaults.The human characters on the other hand were really meant to have the old school style of design from the 1970s mech anime. The character&rsquo;s slim builts, the pointness of the chins and faces, the shapes of the eyes, the hairstyles and side burns, and some of the clothing designs gives some indication of that. Plus, it&rsquo;s not Gundam vs army anymore. Prior to Gundam, mech anime was always the main mech against another bad guy&rsquo;s mech of the week and G Gundam&rsquo;s story was meant to present that kind of narration so they bring in all of these Gundams for one one one battles which I will now get into.The battles are also distinctive because it&rsquo;s not about lazers, guns, and beam saber fights. It&rsquo;s hand to hand combat and as Daigouji Gai from Nadesico would say, that a mech is most idealistic for such kinds of battles and is the best means of proving who is the man. Granted certain Gundams are bulky, but the heavy blow action makes up for it. While the smaller Gundams like Spiegel and Nobel Gundam have speed and agility and they move like Spider-Man. So you&rsquo;re getting martial arts mixed with mech. Despite the lack of convenient war fare weapons, the Gundams of course have special powered moves. Like Domon&rsquo;s finishing move is the shining finger where he turns gold Super Saiya-jin style and then emits a large beam of light to his opponent.Of course there are also times we get to see the pilots fight outside of their mechs. Afterall, you need to be a legitimate accomplished fighter to be legible to compete in the tournament. The fights are DBZ-ish with the speed but not of course where they power up and fight for a long time and do fire balls. The fights are still intense and fun. So, the art and animation of G Gundam for it&rsquo;s overall unique use of character and mech design and intriguing battle.Tomokazu Seki also happens to play the main character Domon Kasshu who has played other notable roles like Keisuke from Initial D, Miyata from Hajime no Ippo, and Kenichi from History&rsquo;s Strongest Disciple Kenichi. He uses a rough and loud voice, but not high pitched. He can make the character sound cold and calm when he&rsquo;s not in battle, and yet sound crazy when he&rsquo;s in a fight. Speaking of the dialog in fights, I just love how dynamic the acting and dialog is in the middle of battle. Like before a fight starts, to officially commence the fight, the fighters have to say &ldquo;Gandamu faito!!! Rediiii Goooo!!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s something you can say is as synonomous as John McCarthy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lets get it on&rdquo; when he signals to start a fight in the UFC. It&rsquo;s just that awesome.And it&rsquo;s real funny in the Japanese version, Chibodee, played by Hochu Ohtsuka, the voice of Jiraiya in Naruto and Yazan in Zeta Gundam brings a funny tone to his voice and really brings the comedy out of him with his Engrish and how he calls Domon &ldquo;Japanese.&rdquo; And Saisaici is played by Yamaguchi Kappei, the voices of Ranma and Inuyasha, and the voice of L from Deathnote. So the Japanese version has a top notch voice cast. As for the dub, I have not seen it in years, but I just feel with the Japanese version, you&rsquo;re getting the accurate dynamic delivery you need to most enjoy it because I don&rsquo;t think this anime isn&rsquo;t fun without the silly Engrish.The music itself is pretty good. The opening themes Flying in the Sky and I Trust You Forever are really good songs that have a type of passion and feeling to it. Though it doesn&rsquo;t have a warriors feel like Ring ni Kakero&rsquo;s or Ashita no Joe&rsquo;s, the songs still reflect on its semi-unintended campy nature.G Gundam was mixing old school Shounen Jump, old school mech, and the moderninzing of Gundam all into one. It brings its own unique story that excellently mixes a diverse cast of characters in not just culture, but in personalities; top notch unintended comedy if you&rsquo;re not Japanese; and high octane action portions of the characters are stereotyped or portrayed in what Americans would find not politically correct. I mean, the Russian is a prisoner? The Japanese portrayed as righteous? The American portrayed as strange and arrogant? And the list goes on. If you&rsquo;re not offended by that kind of stuff, then you&rsquo;ll probably laugh because it gets to you in that kind of way. Because the Japanese are oblivious to the concept of political correctness, they can of course get away with doing something like this in their own country. In addition all religious referenes such as Domon&rsquo;s future Gundam, known as the God Gundam, or G Gundam for short is changed to Burning Gundam; and the Devil Gundam would be renamed to the Dark Gundam.I really enjoy the characters because of their personalities and they each bring in different elements to the show. Domon is the quiet and anti-social super powered guy; while someone like Chibodee is the obnoxious loud mouth comic relief character. Even some of the minor characters like Alleby have their own contribution to the advancement of the story as well and has some touching moments that I don&rsquo;t want to get into because it would be a spoiler.Along with a whole new set of story, setting and characters, you also get new Gundams. For traditional purposes obviously, a huge majority of the Gundams will stick to the grill face, have either the green and yellow eyes, and still maintain the iconic red, white, blue, and yellow color scheme. But they add new details to certain Gundams to make them look more culturally authentic to each country. Like Lumberjack Gundam of Neo-Canda is literally meant to resemble a Candian lumber jack. The Gundam Spiegel piloted by Schwartz has a skinny frame to give it the agility and speed that gives blitzkrieg-esque assaults.The human characters on the other hand were really meant to have the old school style of design from the 1970s mech anime. The character&rsquo;s slim builts, the pointness of the chins and faces, the shapes of the eyes, the hairstyles and side burns, and some of the clothing designs gives some indication of that. Plus, it&rsquo;s not Gundam vs army anymore. Prior to Gundam, mech anime was always the main mech against another bad guy&rsquo;s mech of the week and G Gundam&rsquo;s story was meant to present that kind of narration so they bring in all of these Gundams for one one one battles which I will now get into.The battles are also distinctive because it&rsquo;s not about lazers, guns, and beam saber fights. It&rsquo;s hand to hand combat and as Daigouji Gai from Nadesico would say, that a mech is most idealistic for such kinds of battles and is the best means of proving who is the man. Granted certain Gundams are bulky, but the heavy blow action makes up for it. While the smaller Gundams like Spiegel and Nobel Gundam have speed and agility and they move like Spider-Man. So you&rsquo;re getting martial arts mixed with mech. Despite the lack of convenient war fare weapons, the Gundams of course have special powered moves. Like Domon&rsquo;s finishing move is the shining finger where he turns gold Super Saiya-jin style and then emits a large beam of light to his opponent.Of course there are also times we get to see the pilots fight outside of their mechs. Afterall, you need to be a legitimate accomplished fighter to be legible to compete in the tournament. The fights are DBZ-ish with the speed but not of course where they power up and fight for a long time and do fire balls. The fights are still intense and fun. So, the art and animation of G Gundam for it&rsquo;s overall unique use of character and mech design and intriguing battle.Tomokazu Seki also happens to play the main character Domon Kasshu who has played other notable roles like Keisuke from Initial D, Miyata from Hajime no Ippo, and Kenichi from History&rsquo;s Strongest Disciple Kenichi. He uses a rough and loud voice, but not high pitched. He can make the character sound cold and calm when he&rsquo;s not in battle, and yet sound crazy when he&rsquo;s in a fight. Speaking of the dialog in fights, I just love how dynamic the acting and dialog is in the middle of battle. Like before a fight starts, to officially commence the fight, the fighters have to say &ldquo;Gandamu faito!!! Rediiii Goooo!!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s something you can say is as synonomous as John McCarthy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lets get it on&rdquo; when he signals to start a fight in the UFC. It&rsquo;s just that awesome.And it&rsquo;s real funny in the Japanese version, Chibodee, played by Hochu Ohtsuka, the voice of Jiraiya in Naruto and Yazan in Zeta Gundam brings a funny tone to his voice and really brings the comedy out of him with his Engrish and how he calls Domon &ldquo;Japanese.&rdquo; And Saisaici is played by Yamaguchi Kappei, the voices of Ranma and Inuyasha, and the voice of L from Deathnote. So the Japanese version has a top notch voice cast. As for the dub, I have not seen it in years, but I just feel with the Japanese version, you&rsquo;re getting the accurate dynamic delivery you need to most enjoy it because I don&rsquo;t think this anime isn&rsquo;t fun without the silly Engrish.The music itself is pretty good. The opening themes Flying in the Sky and I Trust You Forever are really good songs that have a type of passion and feeling to it. Though it doesn&rsquo;t have a warriors feel like Ring ni Kakero&rsquo;s or Ashita no Joe&rsquo;s, the songs still reflect on its semi-unintended campy nature.G Gundam was mixing old school Shounen Jump, old school mech, and the moderninzing of Gundam all into one. It brings its own unique story that excellently mixes a diverse cast of characters in not just culture, but in personalities; top notch unintended comedy if you&rsquo;re not Japanese; and high octane action', 'The Gundum franchise has long been hailed for it\'s depiction of war, the human condition and of course awesome mecha fights. Although the quality of titles vary from one to another when viewed in accession, the core themes regarding war was still always factored in. So when a title like Fighter G Gundam comes along and breaks this commonality it\'s quite easy to see where the harsh criticism of it comes from. Being the 1st title in the Gundam franchise to really dabble in unfamiliar territory, what we get is a balls to the wall battle shounen that left out the essentials but only retained...the Gundam name.But simply being different isn\'t enough to be good and that doesn\'t change the fact that the end result is nothing short of a nonsensical battle shounen that thinks an excessive amount of plot twists and shouting equates to actual quality.Story: 3/10The story can be split up into 2 parts, the first being a revenge tale and other a long winded battle tournament. Set in the future where war is abolished and a new system is put in place, each nation takes part in a battle royal to determine who will obtain supremacy of the universe and the other colonies. These fights are carried out by a Gundam pilot of their choosing and is the driving force behind most of the show\'s conflict. It\'s through this battle royal that we meet our core group of characters, with our lead obviously being Japan\'s representative Domon Kasshu. Using the battle royal as cover Domon\'s true objective is to find and defeat his brother Kyoji who has come to poses Dark Gundam, which objective is (you guessed it) to destroy the world.Now the core story itself isn\'t bad on paper but where the problem starts is how it\'s presented. Being that it takes a shounen approach, it should come to no surprise that it also obtained the issues commonly found in the shounen demographic. Containing everything from poorly conceived asspulls and powerups to questionable plot twists, G Gundam\'s storytelling is just all over the place. Another glaring issue is it\'s regurgitation of needless exposition and plot conveniences.  And despite the constant bombardment of nonsense like a mermaid, a mummy and windmill Gundam or gundams going super saiyan, it still ask of the viewer to take it seriously. This wouldn\'t have been a problem if it was going for a self-aware satire but sadly it never took that route. What we get instead is a show trying too hard to angst and too hard to be cool while coming across as a laughable concoction that you\'d think up as a child while playing pretend with your toys.Art/Animation: 7/10Now if there was ever an area where G Gundam deserves recognition it would be with it\'s production values. The Gundam franchise has always been proclaimed to being ahead of its time, with titles like Zeta Gundam that was leagues ahead of other anime titles of it\'s era in terms of cinematography and choreography. But with titles like Double Zeta and Victory Gundam it had seemed that the franchise was finally losing it\'s luster. But G Gundam brought on something like a Renaissance for Gundam, bringing with it the familiar levels of animation quality found in OVAs like War in the Pocket and Stardust Memory.Being that the story focused on mecha fights a great deal of effort was placed into making all the battles to feel grandiose when called for it. And with a introduction to a new way of piloting the mechas by body synchronization, the aesthetics and easy to read body mechanics were ahead of it\'s time. The attention to detail really made it an entertaining watch that never felt hindered by the time period it was made. It even looks good for today\'s standards. But of course corners were cut with reused scenes and still shots but given the effort placed into everything else it\'s easily forgivable.NOW the same can\'t be said for the mecha designs. To put it bluntly half of them are beyond idiotic. Everything from a evil clown to a windmill, I have a hard time wrapping my head around the poorly thought up designs. It\'s like the artists all got drunk and doodled up any nonense that popped into their heads. But given the cheesiness of the story they may just help heighten your B-movie experience.Sound: 5/10""so bad it\'s good"" is the best phrase used to describe the voice acting of G Gundam. This is schmaltzy over acting taken to a new extreme. Every one liner is delivered with so much ham that you can\'t help but chuckle as they\'re delivered. That said I highly suggest watching this dub to optimize the effect. The soundtrack itself works well with the show\'s content. Delivering the right amount of ""oomph"" when needed and adding to the overall 90s vibe.Characters: 3/10The characters all felt like they\'ve been ripped right out of the pages of cliches. With a spiky hair protagonist that think yelling and ""talking with your fists"" is the only way to solve problems, it borderlines obnoxiousness at times. The rest of the cast follow the same 1 sided personality with one predominant straight that forces them to be marginalize as typical archetypes. May that be the pretty boy ""man of honor"" or the strong dumb brute, all of them exhibit the behaviors of easy to write and even easier to read characters.But being typical characters aren\'t necessarily bad per say but the way the writers go about using them is where it really becomes a problem. Everyone is flimsily handled to the point where their personality can flip flop from friend to foe with no proper build up. It\'s like they were manipulated in order to serve whatever objective the plot was going for at the time. This result in too many role reversals to be taken seriously and also a sad attempt to try to add depth and complexity to a cookie cutter cast that were only surface deep.Enjoyment: 7/10Now without a doubt G Gundam is entertaining. Due to many factors but mostly contributed to the time period it was made, G Gundam has aged into a campy b-movie romp that offers cheesy one liners, laughable plot twists and hammy moments throughout. This b-movie experience is even heightened further if watched dubbed, with a vast array of schmaltzy voice acting performances that deduces genuine bouts of laughter. It\'s truly among the pinnacle of cheesy 90s entertainment and those simply seeking dumb fun should look no further.Overall: 4.5/10G Gundam is the ultimate 90s cheese experience. Idiotic plot twists, nonsensical mecha designs and over the top voice acting. It\'s the pinnacle of anime cheese but a face palming journey that can\'t be forgiven. For everything it had going for it, it always took 2 steps back. It was an experimental attempt to do something different with the franchise that led to half-baked results. For fans of Gundam this might be a fun time waster but this isn\'t a something recommended to any newcomer trying to see what the franchise is all about. the Gundam name.But simply being different isn\'t enough to be good and that doesn\'t change the fact that the end result is nothing short of a nonsensical battle shounen that thinks an excessive amount of plot twists and shouting equates to actual quality.Story: 3/10The story can be split up into 2 parts, the first being a revenge tale and other a long winded battle tournament.

For fans of Gundam this might be a fun time waster but this isn\'t a something recommended to any newcomer trying to see what the franchise is all about.', ""Well, it's been a while since I wrote another review, and yes it's a Gundam review. I'm the person who has pretty much watched them all (not all but hey, I know all the ones that came out in the USofA). Okay what you have here in front of you was the first of its kind in Gundam History. While after the release of Mobile Suit Gundam Char's Counter attack, a few people in BANDAI came up with a new concept, fuse Martial Arts with Gundam, and hence for became Mobile Fighter G Gundam. No one thought that this would work but it did. Though...many fans of the seires were kinda annoyed that the constant Custom Gundam were over used, it created an new basis for many of the new Gundam series. Many of you know them as the pretty boys of Gundam Wing and the overly issued Childrern of Gundam Seed. The concept of Five Hero Gundams shaked the Gundam world and is still happening now.The story takes place in an alternet setting, not Universal Century. This new world is called Future Century. In Future Century, nations from around the world leave their homes and begin to live in space, in the newly formed space colonies called the Neo Nations. Even though many have left Earth, it's still a vitial resorce, and to prevent any further wars the Nations declare that every four years there is to be a Gundam Fight. The Gundam Fight determines which Neo Nation will take Earth into their hands. After each Nation selects one of their best fighters and locks them down on Earth, the battle begins.In this story, it is now the 13th Gundam Fight. A Martial Artist from Neo Japan, Domon Kasshu, is sent to Earth. With his newly earned title of King Of Hearts, he brings fear upon his opponents, but Domon's true intensions is to search for his brother, which mysteriously disappeared after an incedent in the space colony of Neo Japan. Now the only remaining member of his family is his father which has been frozen as pusnishment for actiing against the Neo Japan Government. And to release his father, Domon must fight and win the Gundam Fight.Eventually Domon realizes that he's not the only one that is willing to go the distance as he meets many formidable foes. Chibodee of Neo America, George of Neo France, Sai of Neo China, and Argo of Neo Russia all have their reasons of fighting within the tournament. They soon become friends after facing a menacing foe known as the Devil (Dark) Gundam.The story is pretty good. It's not what I really expected from Gundam, and it was a completely new twist to things. I can rewatch it a few times and still enjoy it. Although, the birth of this series pretty much brought an unnecessary evil to the Gundam Franchise. With all the spoofs of Gundam Wing, Gundam War X, Gundam Seed, and a few other Super Gundam legacies, I can't help but get mad that because of this one show it had made Gundam into a Super Hero Five show. In the long run, its an okay show, not one of my favorites of the Gundam series, but Gundam Seed wasn't any better. So if you really want to see what started the Gundam Wing and the Five Gundam concept, this is what you are looking for. many fans of the seires were kinda annoyed that the constant Custom Gundam were over used, it created an new basis for many of the new Gundam series.

Unfortunately, this series does not get the love it deserves as compared to the newer ones. Although it is named G Gundam, it is in no way a Gundam at all. (Excluding the designs and premise &gt;_&gt;)Gundams get into one-on-one brawls in the tournament called the Gundam Fight and beat their respective opponents one by one until they win the tournament. The fights are very super-robot-esque, with lots of hot-blooded shouting and super moves, including finishers such as SHINING FINGER! They even come with their own cheesy incantations to be recited before execution.StoryThe show...basically starts of as a monster-of-the-week, with one enemy being introduced every episode. However, near the middle of the series, the show uses the development in these episodes to reveal a plot gradually piled up from the beginning. Some parts of the story are quite touching despite the cheesiness of it all, and it has a number of twists as well.ArtThe art style stays true to the original Gundam hand-drawn style (back when CG wasn't used yet). Fans of the older series will immediately take to it, and newer watchers might be initially turned off by the lack of shiny computer generated lasers, but may grow to love it. The action scenes are pretty well animated and are quite constant, although some scenes you can clearly see how more effort was put into.SoundThe music for this show is great. Music during fight scenes will pump you up, and more melancholic tunes during touching/sad scenes will jerk your heart real good. The songs are quite fitting, but can sound a little old fashioned at times. (They even have authentic Cantonese music for when they are at Neo Hong Kong!)The openings and endings are also among the better ones, topped with above average animation. The openings really help to get you in the mood for the show.The voices are very fitting. They can be serious when they need to, and perform crazy hotblooded move yelling when needed. The chemistry between Domon and Master Asia's seiyuus are very natural. Overall great voice acting for all characters.CharacterThe characters are very well written, and the main crew and their fellows get superb development over the course of the 49 episodes. Don't want to spoil anything here, so I'll just say that their relationships are very well portrayed, especially that of Domon (protagonist) and his master, Master Asia (you have to have heard that before).All in all, I enjoyed this show a lot more than I thought I would. As my second Gundam series, it's impact on me has not faded since I have watched it unlike many other anime series. In fact, I think I'll be rewatching it pretty soon. What are you waiting for?

At first, the mesh of Gundam with martial arts and silly-looking robots might be off-putting to hardcore Gundam fans, but once you embrace the show for what it's trying to be, it turns out to be pretty good.When you think Gundam, you probably think about war and a serious space opera with minimal wackiness and very little in the way of anime-style expressions.  G Gundam, for better and for worse, does a complete 180...degree turn on all the Gundam series that preceded it, and many that came afterwards. You'll find a lot of overused anime tropes here, from people yelling out the name of their signature attack (SHINING FINGER!), to big mouths, to quivering eyeballs when they get angry. Plus, the comedic appearance of a lot of the Gundams themselves definitely appear to make G Gundam slanted to a younger audience. For example, the Gundam from Spain has a giant bull head for a torso. The Gundam from Egypt is a mummy. The Gundam from Kenya is a zebra, and so on. Not what you'd expect to see in the original Gundam or Gundam Wing for sure, but not only do these unique Gundams become highly amusing, they add to the charm of the show once you learn to stop taking it completely seriously.The story revolves around two main things, the Gundam Fight and the Devil Gundam. The Gundam Fight is a contest held every four years to determine which country gets sovereignty over space. This is a gentleman's agreement done so that there won't be any wars. Every country submits their best Gundam to represent them, and the last one standing wins legislative power in space. All of the main characters in the show participate in the fight, including our hero Domon Kasshu, who represents Neo Japan. The Devil Gundam is a nigh-invincible world-destroying mega-sized Gundam that is threatening the very safety of the world while the Gundam Fight is going on. In the entire Gundam history, it is probably the largest Gundam ever made by a longshot. Along the way of this 49-episode series, Domon will make friends and enemies from other nations, discover the secrets behind the Devil Gundam and his brother's disappearance, see people close to him reveal their true colors, and many other fun plot twists.If at first you have a hard time getting into G Gundam, stick with it. The show definitely starts a little slow, but it gets incrementally better as the series goes along. It gets better with the appearance of Master Asia around episode 12, then even better once the Gundam Fight begins in the mid-20s, then even better once the final Battle Royale begins. The last ten or so episodes showcase some really fun action and highly epic conclusions to all the main storylines. The show definitely aims to be a fan-pleaser in all aspects.All that good stuff being said, I can't give G Gundam a rating worthy of a masterpiece. The show is at many times shallow and kind of a typical anime. Some of the fight scenes take a lot of shortcuts when it comes to animation, and a lot of the characters aren't very deep (although Master Asia is a pimp). I don't believe G Gundam is trying to be a masterpiece though. It wants to be a fun action series that you can watch and have a good time. At having fun, it succeeds, in spite of (or perhaps because of) all the cheese it brings. Recommended. degree turn on all the Gundam series that preceded it, and many that came afterwards.

In the entire Gundam history, it is probably the largest Gundam ever made by a longshot. Along the way of this 49-episode series, Domon will make friends and enemies from other nations, discover the secrets behind the Devil Gundam and his brother's disappearance, see people close to him reveal their true colors, and many other fun plot twists.If at first you have a hard time getting into G Gundam, stick with it. The show definitely starts a little slow, but it gets incrementally better as the series goes along. It gets better with the appearance of Master Asia around episode 12, then even better once the Gundam Fight begins in the mid-20s, then even better once the final Battle Royale begins. The last ten or so episodes showcase some really fun action and highly epic conclusions to all the main storylines. The show definitely aims to be a fan-pleaser in all aspects.All that good stuff being said, I can't give G Gundam a rating worthy of a masterpiece. The show is at many times shallow and kind of a typical anime. Some of the fight scenes take a lot of shortcuts when it comes to animation, and a lot of the characters aren't very deep (although Master Asia is a pimp). I don't believe G Gundam is trying to be a masterpiece though. It wants to be a fun action series that you can watch and have a good time. At having fun, it succeeds, in spite of (or perhaps because of) all the cheese it brings. Recommended."", 'G Gundam is by far the most experimental of the main Gundam shows to have been created.  Many fans from the West first encountered G Gundam when they were kids watching Toonami, so this show has a strong nostalgia factor for many who have seen it.  However after recently re-watching this show, I can confirm that it still contains the same charm and energy I remembered as a kid and it is still one of the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched.  It contains some amazing fights, and also has some amazing intentional and unintentional humor.G Gundam is set many years...into the future where much of humanity has gone into space to live on colonies.  Achieving the ability to live in space did not bring humanity together, but only serve to drive it further apart.  Countries such as Japan, the United States, France, China, Russia, and every country that existed in 1994 has their own space colony and they all foutght against each other to gain supremacy of space.  In response to the bloody wars that came about, the countries agreed to hold a Gundam fight tournament ever four years.  Each country would send only one Gundam, and whoever won the tournament gave their nation the right to rule space and Earth for the next four years.At its core, G Gundam is merely a kong-fu anime that happens to have the fighters and martial artists in giant robots.  The pilots don’t use joysticks to maneuver their Gundam, but instead have a suit that causes the Gundam to mimic their own moves, making it by far the coolest way to control a Gundam or giant robot I have seen.  The action is over-the-top, and the fighters are able to perform crazy attacks both inside and outside their Gundam; one fighter even cut an entire skyscraper in half with a single kick outside of his Gundam. The story is simple, but it is well paced for its length.  Each episode has its own featured fight, and I don’t recall any fight lasting longer than one episode.The characters are what truly make this show.  Domon Kashu is the main character of G Gundam and is the representative from Japan.  He is a loud, aggressive and powerful fighter who only knows how to communicate with his fists.  He is in search of his older brother who destroyed their family and has stolen the most powerful Gundam ever made and is now hiding on Earth.  On his journey for revenge, Domon will encounter Gundam fighters from other countries who are amazing characters in their own right.  Some of his fellow fighters will become friends and others will become enemies, but each of them is a joy to watch.  You will definitely find a Gundam fighter that is your favorite.  It is a joy to watch Domon grow as a fighter and as a person and to see him develop throughout the series.I must note that this show is one of the cheesiest anime you will ever see, and that is what makes it so good.  The fighting in G Gundam is ridiculous, but the show plays everything with a straight face and is serious in how it handles it.  This causes the show to be extremely hilarious throughout.  All the fighters scream out their special attacks, but I found you never get tired of it.  Often, I realized I was saying the attack names along with the characters.  This show is often extremely racists.  The Gundams representing their countries are often stereotypes of the country itself; for example, Mexico’s Gundam has a sombrero, and Egypt’s Gundam is a mummy.  However, none of the stereotypes feel malicious and it all just ends up adding to the humor.  I believe this comes from the fact that political correctness is not much of a thing in Japan, though it is in the United States.I justify this anime receiving a nine because of its immense enjoyment factor.  The best way to describe G Gundam is that it is the embodiment of a young boy’s dream, which is where the charm comes from because kids have the best dreams.  If you are willing to release your inner child, then you will have no regrets watching G Gundam. into the future where much of humanity has gone into space to live on colonies.

My idea of camp consists of 80s/90s action films, 70s-80s porno films, 80s horror films, the new Godzilla movie, Dredd, the first 2/3 of Umineko, the 90s Zorro film, etc. etc. And you know what they all have in common? They\'re not f*cking Sunrise mecha!Seriously, I never got the appeal of these things. Sure Geass was entertaining back when it was fresh and you were new to anime, but not only has it gotten more dated and boring than Independence Day overtime (and by the way, why are...we getting a sequel to that shit?), but these attempts to copy its formula along with just being Gundam in general are horrible. Sunrise\'s attempts at camp more often than not come off like they\'re trying way too hard to be cool rather than as a labor of love and it\'s awkward and cringeworthy, like those godawful Boondock Saints movies. At least the majority of exploitation films during its golden age stuck with one method at most when it came to pleasing the audience.Not that I\'m much of a fan of Gundam even when it\'s ""good"". I\'ve gone on before on how I can\'t stand war dramas and I\'m not a particular fan of the space opera one either, something Gundam soaks its roots in very heavily. Not that I hate everything from those genres, but with every Star Wars comes a Mass Effect, and I don\'t think any more words need to be said. But on the flipside, for every Mission Impossible 2 and 3 comes a Ghost Protocol, and Imagawa\'s take on the Gundam franchise is definitely the latter. It may not be deep compared to its counterparts, but it\'s very well-executed in terms of pacing and action set pieces, and it even manages to slip in some cool meta-commentary regarding the franchise its a part of, making for a very rewarding piece of spectacle.I know I previously wrote that G Gundam was a ""decent at best"" experience that I could only really pay attention to when I listened to its awful dub. Honestly, I don\'t know what I was thinking back then, and I don\'t think anyone else does, so let\'s not dwell on it. G Gundam already captures my attention right off the bat by having a premise where world conflicts are solved by the best method anyone could have ever conceived: martial arts tournaments with robots. Seriously, why haven\'t we thought of doing this, let alone make more pieces of fiction about that? Granted, I prefer my martial arts tournaments to be robot-free, but G Gundam has its fair share of mano y mano fist fights as well and you need to be a good martial artist in order to pilot these things correctly anyways. There\'s no ""instant-control of mecha despite not being trained to pilot it"" bullshit here. In fact, trying to do that pretty much kills you before you make the robot so much as twitch a finger.The story is centered on a young Gundam fighter named Domon Kasshu and his quest to find his missing brother - who has been marked a fugitive after a certain series of events caused their parents to suffer the same fate as any parent in an anime except with actual physical presence. In order to do this, he participates in the Gundam fighting tournament and from then on, we get a current-gen fighting game style story in which Domon meets up with someone and fights them with his ""shining finger"" whilst inching towards the plot points needed to complete the story ever so slowly. Well let me tell you right away that it does hell of a better job at telling that kind of story than any of Netherrealm\'s fighting games, in that it doesn\'t keep changing characters Guy Ritchie-style in an attempt to make things more ""epic"", only to make it disjointed and excessively padded. There are episodes when it does focus on other characters, but they\'re sparse and only used when necessary to develop them - barring one episode involving a kid that was frankly stupid because that trope has never worked once in fiction and it sure as hell doesn\'t work here.G Gundam is divided into two distinct halves: the qualifying rounds and the actual tournament. You win no points for guessing that the tournament half is when I think the show truly shines, but the first half is fun too in regards to setting up the rules and having Domon discover portions of the mystery regarding his brother and the Devil Gundam. The episodic fight-of-the-week style of storytelling can be a bit of a problem at first though, not going to lie. Whilst there\'s some hinting, you don\'t really get a clarification of what Domon\'s goals are until the sixth episode, and even then, it\'s a pretty simple story. Even when the formula gets dropped upon Master Asia\'s introduction and stakes ramp up, that fact doesn\'t really change. G Gundam is one of those anime you have to get into, so it\'s not really a surprise that it didn\'t do so well upon release and is still criticized even now.So why do I like this show? Because it\'s f*cking camp, that\'s why.In addition to the concept of the Gundam tournament being just cool in general, this show captures a lot of what I enjoy about the Golden Age of Hong Kong\'s martial arts cinema and presents it as a (mostly) visually interesting show that shows its self-awareness through the cinematography and technicals rather than the characters denting the fourth wall with obnoxious fourth-wall commentary and try-hard poses that would embarrass the Tick. Okay fine, there\'s a bit of that in regards to people screaming each other\'s names during battle, but I never said G Gundam was perfect, let alone on the same level of The Drunken Master. And since it\'s essentially a martial arts anime, you\'ll be happy to know that the show delivers when it comes to the action in terms of choreography and creativity. The only thing I can say that\'s bad about them is that they always end with Domon using his traditional ""Shining Finger"" move, because that\'s the only finishing move the show seems fit to give him. It\'s a cool name and all, but how about a roundhouse kick to finish things off every once in a while, Imagawa?Also, for an anime that rides mostly on presentation (especially considering it\'s almost fifty episodes long), there\'s bound to be times when it can\'t keep the energy up. So you get your occasional weak episodes that come off more gimmicky than purposeful, as well as some fights that might feel extraneous. The biggest problem comes near the end when the show peaks too early and devolves into a generic ""save the world"" type story for its final stretch with the only real standout being the ending scene. I won\'t spoil it for you, but let\'s just say that fans of cheesy romance and shipping will definitely get a kick out of it as soon as they wake up due to passing out from LOVE overload. Actually wait, some of you have watched Aquarion EVOL right? Well it\'s like that, only a thousand times better because the female lead was actually interesting, amongst other things.G Gundam isn\'t really the most sophisticated thing in the world, even by anime standards, let alone Sunrise\'s. However, it does a lot right with me in terms of finding fun in regards to spectacle appeal, and that\'s why I like it so much. It has funny characters, each with their own goals and ambitions regardless of the situation. It has fight scenes that have weight and tension behind their creativity. And above all, it has a decent sound track that gets your blood pumped for the next episode let alone some awesome opening and closing themes. I even kind of like the love triangle thing between Domon, his childhood friend Rain, and Gundam fighter Allenby, mostly because you couldn\'t take it that seriously and it\'s a pretty minor blip in the grand scheme of things here rather than in Escaflowne (Sunrise\'s other stuff indulges in it as well, but Escaflowne man. Oh god).It\'s a bit of a mess when you get down to it, but it\'s a fun mess, and I will jam sharpies into my nipples if I ever say that about another Sunrise mecha ever again. we getting a sequel to that shit?), but these attempts to copy its formula along with just being Gundam in general are horrible.

Mobile Fighter G Gundam - a very unique Gundam series which for many reasons I\'m really glad I watched.The setting is in the future where each country vies for the right to rule space by participating in a ""Winner Take All"" Gundam Fight on earth every 4 years. It started out slow (6 rating) but the pace picked up throughout and the last 10 episodes flew by. Although parts of the series are predictable, there are plenty of plot twists to keep us entertained, Cliches and...all it was still very entertaining.These are my top 10 reasons why G Gundam is worth watching:-*01* The hero has limitless potential. So, the ""young fighter in training"" sequence is mandatory. There is always a wise Miyagi-san (Karate Kid) like character willing to teach our hot-headed hero. Who eventually powers up!*02* Hong Kong style martial arts movie-like fights, except in Mecha. The Kung Fu moves come along with their special names, which must be yelled out while executing the moves e.g. ""Burning Finger"", ""Hurricane Punch"". There is ALWAYS a hyper mode/super mode/super secret technique. e.g. School of the Undefeated of the East\'s secret special technique.*03* Men may start off as enemies, but if you are a true martial artist after you fight you end up learning about, respecting and finally becoming friends with your opponent. Very macho, very manly man. Very true to life.*04* The bond between teacher and pupil is very strong. See episode 45. Similarly, the bonds of friendship between men who have come to an understanding through fist/martial arts communication are extremely strong to the point that friends are willing to risk their life for each other in true ""band of brothers"" fashion. All the characters rock, even the secondary characters were very well developed.*05* Men cannot multitask well. If they are fighting they can only think about fighting and nothing else, whereas when fighting a woman can multitask by (1) fighting (2) thinking about repairing a gundam (3) worring if a man loves her and (4) agonizing with another off screen character or her superiors on what is going on with the man she is in love with.*06* A man will treat his childhood friend and crewmate like a disposable doormat. He will only realize what he feels for her AFTER she is gone, then he will have trouble expressing his feelings.*07* There is more than 1 enemy and the enemies are complex. After a while you\'re not even sure if the person is a villian or just misguided. This ambiguity makes us relate to the series better*08*  Gratituous eye candy factor!!! Fan Service for females! Tightest mecha suit ever, tighter than even CC\'s (from Code Geass). Also, Master Asia and Major Ulube are majorly built, with what look like 12 packs. Yowzers!*09* Tribute to Hong Kong Style Chinese Martial Arts. The names in this series were very cute. Name of one of the villians is Wong Yun Fatt (Chow Yun Fatt?), Final tournament set in Hong Kong, Cantonese music. Aaah, the memories!*10* FUN watching each country\'s Gundam and learing their special attacks. Most fun of the whole series! Africa\'s gundam was a zulu warrior, Holland\'s had a windmill. China\'s was a dragon and the US had a boxer. Singapore and Malaysia were represented! I loved Nepal\'s Gundam too.

I certainly wasn\'t bored with this :)', ""The oddball of the Gundam Franchise.G Gundam is probably the most child friendly Gundam Series there is.As a kid I alway's felt I watched these shows in the wrong order. because I saw Gundam Wing when I was 14 and G Gundam a few years later.While it tries to give us a serious story like most Gundam series It's sometimes hard to keep that serious tone. This is because each country has their Gundams Gimmicked towards somethings that (usually) relates to their country. This causes them to range from serious, creative, to silly and absolutely bizarre designs.G Gundam sadly did seem to suffer from...a bit of a tight budget, the Mid 90's wasn't a good spot for anime, and it shows, the pacing in certain scene's feel weird, color scheme's are fairly akward,  repeative super-move animations each episode & rather rusty hair and uniform designs.But to it's credit G Gundam knew where to spend it's money on, while they clearly cut back on the things I mentioned above they did put money in the actual fights and supermove animations. which are the most important. Because you watch a Gundam series for Robot fights. so they did good putting the budget in that direction. The best example of this is when a fighter enters a Gundam and we get the transformation animation where they put on their uniform, which is very creative and unique, but with the payoff of a very ugly and weird uniform design itself.Yet somehow G Gundam has this weird charm over itself. and I think a lot of that is due to a soundtrack that was clearly too good for the shows budget. each time a super attack gets charged up and those bombastic drums or violins begin booming in you're just hooked on the moment!Ultimately I can't call the show Bad, but Not Good either, it's flawed.the Plot is direct, the characters are a bit bland but not unlikable.But for the budget it had it's a fair show. a bit of a tight budget, the Mid 90's wasn't a good spot for anime, and it shows, the pacing in certain scene's feel weird, color scheme's are fairly akward,  repeative super-move animations each episode & rather rusty hair and uniform designs.But to it's credit G Gundam knew where to spend it's money on, while they clearly cut back on the things I mentioned above they did put money in the actual fights and supermove animations. which are the most important.

I will never forget this anime, this is ONE of the best anime forever!!This is really worth watching, even how many times you watch...it ;) it ;)', ""Now I'm just gonna come out and say it, this is the only Gundam show that I could get into and to this day is the only one of the Gundam franchise that I'm into. I tried watching the other Gundam's but just for some reason couldn't get into them. I don't know if it was the story, the characters, or what. I do know one thing though that one of things that I couldn't get into with them was the way they pilot the Gundam's like some type of original aircraft. I mean, these were warrior machines for crying out loud. Shouldn't you be...piloting them like a warrior or something.Well G Gundam made my fact a reality. In G Gundam, the way that the pilots, pilot the Gundam's is just badass. They control them in an artifical intelligence way and not the same old way they were. The fact that the pilot can control them just by moving there body and fight like an actual warrior is just real cool. The Gundam's themselves were pretty cool too, especially; the Dark Gundam.I totally loved the story in this version. I think the reason why I liked this story was because while it did mainly take place on Earth, it was more of a space related show. The story was just well written, and well developed and continued to do so throughout the entire show.The one thing that really made me love this show though were the characters and the music. The music was real awesome and had not only some of the best themes ever, but those two songs, Fly in the Sky, and Trust You Forever; dude, that is some of the best music you'll ever here. The characters were just awesome, especially; the main villian. I'm not gonna say who though many of you know but the reason why is because some people depate about who the real villian is and I'm a little in the same boat but do know who it is though through careful analyization. I will say though that I really did like Domon, he was everything that you'd want in a protagonist and come out on top in the end.As I said, this is the only Gundam that I could get into and still into today. I really did enjoy it and plan to really get the DVD collection for this. It's fun, it's enjoyable, and a very epic show. piloting them like a warrior or something.Well G Gundam made my fact a reality.

It has no complicated politics or commentary on the futility of war or the psychological damage that a soldier endures. Instead we get ethnic stereotypes, over the top fights, and absolute grade A cheese! If you are in a light and playful mood and want to watch something delightfully idiotic, here is G Gundam!Plot 5/10The plot takes place in the future of course, but this future is not a part of the main Gundam series canon and exists in its...own universe. War has been abolished and which country gets to rule the world is decided every few years with a giant robot fighting competition. This plot was actually stolen shamelessly from an 80s B movie called ""Robot Jox"". The main character is Domon, who as you would expect fights for Japan. He is searching for his brother Kyoji and a gundam called the ""Dark Gundam"" or Devil Gundam in the original Japanese version. To get this out of the way, the G in the title actually stands for God gundam, but I guess they figured with all the national stereotypes this series was offensive enough as is. While searching for his brother, Domon meets fighters from many other countries and must defeat them to advance in the global tournament. Domon is a member of a 5 nation team called the ""Shuffle Alliance"" consisting of Japan, China, USA, Russia, and France. As an aside, the way the characters pilot the gundams in this series along with the nations making up the alliance give this a striking resemblance to Pacific Rim, which was released 20 years later. Together the Shuffle Alliance must uncover the Devil Gundam conspiracy and defeat those that would use this evil gundam to permanently conquer Earth and all its colonies!Characters 5/10The characters are mostly an amalgamation of ethnic stereotypes, so don\'t look for amazing depth or development here. The American is a streetwise, arrogant blockhead that is a boxer. The Chinese pilot is an obnoxious, hyperactive kid (think Short Round) that is also a shaolin monk. The Frenchmen is predictably a fairy that throws roses at people. The Russian is a hulking Siberian convict that looks like Leonid Brezhnev fucked a Grizzly bear. These are some of the more subtle characters in this series! Although the characters aren\'t well written, they are enjoyable to watch and this series will have you rolling with laughter, albeit some of it unintentional.Sound track 8/10Believe it or not the soundtrack in this series ROCKS! The opening is catchy as hell, the battle themes are gripping, the drama themes get you in the right mood. All around very impressive for such a silly series.Art 6/10The art isn\'t of the highest caliber, but for a 90s anime it isn\'t bad. It does recycle animation quite a bit, but it is what you would expect from a shonen series of any length greater than 13 episodes during that era of anime.Enjoyment 10/10G gundam is a guilty pleasure series for me. I am quite aware of how stupid it is, but it is damn fun to watch! Some of this is nostalgia of course, but I would bet that younger viewers would also get a kick out of this massive piece of 90s cheese.Overall 7/10This series has massive flaws, but is quite enjoyable for what it is. Don\'t go into it expecting deep art that will change your assessment on life. This is not Tolstoy\'s Death of Ivan Ilyich. This is fucking G-Gundam. BURRRRNNIIINNGGG FINNNGEERRRR!!!!! own universe.

I am really serious that they call him this all throughout the show and it gets really annoying but that doesnt stop there. Most of this show is making no sense or just being silly, like trying to copy bleach but with robots and humans living together.The Story is a bunch of humans fight in this robots which controls the movements of the robots outside and they are commanded to by there nation. Its so stupid why would nations fight robots like a sport, we dont decide issues with soccer. They...also have some stupid machines called dark gundams and god gundams and its so stupid. Its like a story for kids, they even call the main character a cashu.The Art is old and nothing new. The robots usually look real stupid and one even has a windmill on his chest. Completely offensive.The Sound is old too and the music tends to grate the ear. This is not a show for people who are hard on their animes or don't like old.The Characters are mostly the same as in other stuff. Really you can almost know what happens before it happens. Theres nothing really cool here but they try to make Dragon Ball Z with robots which I will review soon two.The overall this show is old and not worth people's time, probably better robot shows. also have some stupid machines called dark gundams and god gundams and its so stupid.

Before watching the show, I knew of the Gundam featured in the show and I was absolutely enthralled by the outlandish designs. There’s a windmill Gundam, a mermaid Gundam, a Sailor Moon-esque Gundam, and even a Gundam made out of a Gundam face. I actually owned a Gunpla of the Sailor Moon-esque Gunda, the Nobel Gundam, well before I started watching the...show.As the designs can tell you, this is very much a Super Robot Show, with super modes, shouting your attacks, plot twist upon plot twist, everything. If you’re interested in Gundam solely for the gritty, realistic war stories, then it’s best to sit this one out. If you love action anime and also love giant robots, then man, have I got the anime for you.The quotes at the beginning of the review are a variation of quotes said in the show, quotes said so often that I basically had them memorized. But amazingly, they never got old. A large part of the show’s high score for me is the Shounen Hype Syndrome striking again. Even if there was a low spot, G Gundam would be sure to get my blood pumping again and all would be forgiven.Which isn’t to say the show is perfect. As good as that sequence is, action in and of itself can wear itself thin very fast. The dynamic story is why Attack on Titan is so great to me. Admittedly, G Gundam is one of the shows with a slow start. The first episode is good enough, it’s a fine introduction to the world of G Gundam, but the episodes after it quickly lose steam. One of the biggest criticisms is that G Gundam is a monster-of-the-week anime. The biggest problem with this format is that it’s easy for things to get monotonous and stale quickly. Honestly, around episode 4, the monster-of-the-week format started to show and it got tiring. Luckily, the story really breaks out around episode 10, and it’s all uphill from there. While the second half of the series does begin to dip back to the monster-of-the-week format at times, but the story surrounding these episodes is so interesting that I didn’t notice as much as I did the early episodes.The dub is a bit hammy, but given the tone of the show, I find it actually adds to it.Tone might not be the right word. Character performances are hammy, suit designs are outlandish, and the powers the mecha display are arguably the strongest we’ve seen in the entire Gundam series. The show, however, takes itself completely seriously. And you know what, I love it. Unlike Build Divers, there are actual, honest to god stakes in this show. I’m actually engaged in the characters and their struggles. Just because you have a Gundam show that’s not real robot, you can still tell a gripping story, and G Gundam shows this.G Gundam features a multinational cast as colorful as the robots they pilot. All the main characters are interesting and comical. Master Asia and Domon are great for their energy as well as hamminess. I liked seeing Domon progress as a character; from a man with a perpetual frown, to someone who genuinely smiled and saw joy in fighting alongside friends. The breakout character, in my opinion, is Rain. I was impressed by how independent she was as well as how divorced she was from tropes other female characters from 90s shonen anime might have been prey to. She was smart, could fend for herself, and was no-nonsense. I rolled my eyes when she ended up being jealous, but overall, Rain Mikamura was A-okay in my book.However, another criticism of the show is that it plays into stereotypes. This is true, unfortunately. This much can see seen in the Gundam that fighters pilot.The main characters’ Gundam are mostly exempt from this, or at the very least, their features aren’t exaggerated. I still think the American Gundam Baxter’s design — with its football helmet and boxing gloves — is stupid, but maybe that’s just because I’m American myself. Naturally, God Gundam looks extremely normal, as far as Gundams go. But goddamn, if it isn’t cool as a cucumber.G Gundam has 49 episodes, it could be concluded at around episode 43, but it keeps going. Normally, I’d dock a show points for this, but the final arc of the show was amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat. When G Gundam gets going, it just can’t be stopped.There were a few dumb decisions made by characters, but I didn’t mind too much.G Gundam is a very unorthodox Gundam show, and that’s alright. It challenges what can be a Gundam show, and I was glad it was made, because sometimes, you just need to see a giant robot do kung-fu moves.

The result is called G Gundam. Now if you don't know about the Gundam series it's basically about people who fight in large robots called Gundams and each one is unique in each series. Yet G Gundam, set in an alternative universe from the main series of shows, still manages to deliver. The story, at times, can be very predictable yet enjoyable because of the nature of the show. The pacing never felt rushed or slow because of how unique the episodes are from each other. Now the art style is your...basic 90's anime. You have characters with huge eyes, characters that are drawn strange, and characters with some downright bizarre designs. Yet I couldn't help being impressed with how well the designs fitted each character and their goals. The sound, with English Dubs, was a little odd at times. It wasn't bad or anything just a little strange. In fact, this didn't stop me from listening to some songs from the soundtrack after I finished the show. Certain songs, especially the ones used in the fight scenes, fit the atmosphere of each fight so well that I think the show wouldn't be the same without them. In terms of character development I thought a show about giant robot battles wouldn't leave a lot of room for it. Low and behold the show surprised me by just how important the characters actually are. The majority of characters, some more than others, have their personalities so fleshed out it's unbelievable. The villains are believeable, the narrator is a welcome decision, and the dislikeable characters are needed. These are characters that you will definitely remember. I think that anyone who loves over the top action bundled in a nice package of awesome should definitely enjoy G Gundam. Its unforgettable characters, story, and general mood is definitely worth recommending. basic 90's anime.

While most other Gundam series focus on the hardships of war and have political subtext and so on, this anime took the direction of being an action-packed tournament-style battle anime, and that\'s not a bad thing as long as you aren\'t expecting the same kind of story and development of other Gundam series. If this anime has to be compared to any other mecha anime at all, let it be considered the predecessor to Gurren Lagann mixed with Kill...La Kill.Story: The story essentially doesn\'t matter, the only purpose it serves is to give our main character Domon a reason to travel and fight. The fights are all that matter and not a single episode fails to deliver in the quality of the battles. However, because the ""main story"" it has doesn\'t really matter, they could have quite easily made it in a Kill La Kill fashion where the main character\'s purpose is to fight and become stronger only to reveal the same kind of omnipotent evil entity that you know is coming at the end anyways.Art: The art and animation are without a doubt what you\'d expect from any Gundam series. Ahead of its time, G Gundam has quality animation that can still be enjoyed today. The art style is great for portraying the recognizable real-world landmarks as well as allowing a creative freedom for any kind of mecha design that could be imagined. While some mecha designs were a bit silly, it really showed a unique style of mecha fighting for each different mobile suit that should be expected if the series is going to go out of its way to make so many different models. Granted it did have some limitations at the time being an early 90s anime, so there\'s plenty of still shots and reused animations that don\'t happen frequently enough to take away from the action.Sound: In all honesty the soundtrack is what makes up for the bulk of this score in sound. The music always fit the tone and everything from the opening song to ending song to the main character\'s action theme song was a great composition that not only suited what was going on, but was also catchy and enjoyable. As far as the voice acting goes, without a doubt the dub for this anime is not the greatest quality even for its time. However, each and every character\'s voice suits them well, which, compared to even anime of today whose character voices don\'t always match, is an impressive and respectable feat. That\'s about the only praise the dubbing will get, none of the voice acting is poor quality, but it\'s very corny and over-the-top most of the time, whether the character is having an emotional moment or not, chances are their lines will be delivered in a way that is almost awkward.Character: Every character is a stereotype and/or a cliché. Generally speaking there is nearly no character development either. Each character will suit a cliché from their sovereign nation and stick to it, as well as having one or two major personality traits that they will never abandon. While it is true that the characters fit their roles well and most are quite likeable, there\'s no real excuse for such lazy character creation. But it\'s also inconsequential, since all they need to be able to do is fight well to keep the pace of the anime and keep it entertaining.Enjoyment: This is an anime about mobile suit Gundams fighting each other. The fights are all action-packed, the characters offer a diverse set of mobile suits and personalities and usually each different character will have unique powers, weapons, and/or fighting styles that make it so no battle feels stale or repeated (even in rematches). Despite being lazy, the characters are still likeable. The anime is definitely enjoyable through and through if you don\'t expect it to be anything greater than what it is giving you at face value, because that\'s all it needs to be entertaining.Final Evaluation: If you\'re interested in this anime, there\'s probably some interest in mecha anime in general. This isn\'t a plot-heavy mecha anime like Code Geass. It\'s a battle-fueled mecha anime like Gurren Lagann. If you want a typical Gundam anime that has the same reused plots and stories as every other Gundam, watch any of the other Gundams. If you want to have a good time watching tons of unique Gundam fighting each other, G Gundam is highly recommended.

G Gundam is a hotblooded martial arts-filled, ethnically insensitive, over the top explosion of hot blood and guts and I have no idea how it got made with a Gundam name.However, I'm glad it did. With some great moments, a fantastic character in Master Asia, great(and hilarious) designs for the mecha, and a break-neck passionate feeling encapsulating the whole show, G Gundam is one of the greats of Gundam, though it honestly really shouldn't by any means share the name.The start is admittedly somewhat slow and episodic, but...it's not hard to just take it easy and enjoy the ride. The music is iconic, the characters are colorful and bombastic, Allenby is one of the best Gundam girls, the God Gundam might be my favorite mobile suit to bear the series' name, and even the English dub is pretty decent, which is not usually the case in anime, especially ones with people constantly shouting silly lines full of emotion and passion.The theming in this one is more about conflict from a competitive standpoint being a net pro, which again stands out from the usual admittedly hypocritical message of war being bad despite making money off of war machine merchandise from standard Gundam. However, G Gundam still has a pretty decent delivery on an environmentalist message, which delivered by one of the characters later on. Despite such a base theme, especially by now, and being delivered in such a goofy show, the message did kind of get to me as I was so wrapped up in the crazy hyped-up over-the top emotional atmosphere the show gave off.G Gundam is really good, I think. it's not hard to just take it easy and enjoy the ride.

Now this is just my opinion but I have come across others with the same opinion. If you have been recommended a multitude of Gundam series, watch this one last. I do say that for good reason. Every time I've seen reviews of Gundam series I have seen people writing that they have seen Mobile Fighter G Gundam first and the other series they have seen don't compare. this is not to say that they aren't great but if you watch this first, there will be a feeling that something is missing in all the others. It's not that I'm biased but i have...seen many reviews like the one I'm writing, if you see this first the others will have a feeling that something's missing. It's just that simple lol seen many reviews like the one I'm writing, if you see this first the others will have a feeling that something's missing. It's just that simple lol"", ""G Gundam is the first main title to take place out of the universal century, and probably the title that diverged from what the essence of gundam was about. It removes several aspects of what made gundam into the genre of real robots, while at the same time putting aspects of the super robot genre. In essence it tries to be a hybrid of the too while also incorporating aspects of martial arts anime and live action movies. It’s through this blend that G gundam has also been able to garner this aura of campiness. While camp is fine, i firmly believe that there should...be more to it than that, and G gundam does it to a sub-par level.G gundam follows Domon Cashew as he, based on the premise, is selected by his country to join the Gundam fight. As an alternative to actual wars whoever wins the gundam fight basically has control over the other nations until the next fight, however domon has other plans that aren’t revealed until later on. The first dozen or so episodes of the show are fairly episodic with domon fighting against other nation fighters while his true objective is kept to a minimum. It’s also some of the worst episodes in the show as there is no cohesion in the episodes leading for the plot to feel erratic and fast for its own good. While there is value for these episodes as they are meant to set-up for future episodes, the way it was done was pretty bad. Once Domon’s objective becomes clear, and the plot starts to kick in, the show starts to have long story arcs which it has 3 or 4 of (with some episodic episodes placed in as well).  They are all ok-ish for the most part, but i can’t help but feel that the initial episodes put a hamper on the later episodes as they also at times have trouble keeping the story tied together. It’s because of the lack of a cohesive plot that during certain parts, the story comes off as incoherent or erratic and at other times makes it seem like the story is going to fast. It all comes to a head during the final with the addition of a romance sub-plot which is just there and not much else, and by the end i can’t help but feel a bit dissatisfied with what i got.I also can’t help but be dissatisfied with the characters in the show as many of them come off as one-dimensional  especially the main group. Since the gundam fights is a world wide event, many of the characters come from different countries. It’s because of this that the traits for the characters are usually the stereotypes that are associated with their home countries.  That’s why there are characters like the chivalric french, obnoxious american, snake charming indian, so on, and so forth. There's nothing wrong with it, and there are characters who aren’t like this. The problem is that nothing is done with them, and it’s just the characters repeating the same character traits. Some characters do get some development, but most of the time it’s less about them as characters and more as them as fighters. Even then, just like the story, it at times feels incohesive and erratic making it a chore to watch.The production value for the show is ok to say the least. The characters of the show are simplistic and over-stylized given in the nature of the show. The same could also be said for the mechs for the most part although i would have preferred that they all looked cool like the french and Russian, and not ridiculous like Denmark's or India. The show also uses a lot of shounen tropes for it’s animation allowing them to reuse certain animation clips which the show ends up doing alot. The show is also not that consistent with character models as it shows a dip in quality during the second half.I should also note that i watched this show in english dub because why not watch a campy show with corny dialogue, and for the most part it was alright. The voice acting wasn’t that bad and the changing of the names of some of the gundams was better like burning gundam. I do wish the voice acting was more overthetop with accents because if your going to stereotype characters with their designs and mechs why not go with their voices as well. The soundtrack for the show was ok as well with maybe 2 tracks that stood out, such as when domon does his finger attack. Maybe the original dub is different and added to the show, but i’m not really up to watching this show again.I don’t mind the campiness of the show. I don’t mind the martial arts, the signature power moves, the tournament,  the fact that a person can cut a mech with a sword, or the way the characters act. I do mind that a show at least tries to be cohesive enough that it at least makes sense without having to think about it. It’s because of this that it feels underdeveloped, and not that well planned. With very little to really stick to, the show just comes off as being remembered as “that one campy gundam show”, and nothing more. be more to it than that, and G gundam does it to a sub-par level.G gundam follows Domon Cashew as he, based on the premise, is selected by his country to join the Gundam fight.

Wish the creator made a 2nd season to this. I highly recommend all Gundam fans to watch this. Just some simple classic Gundam ', ""ok, so it's been a little while since I've seen the series, but I followed the series PRETTY closely as a kid.it remains to this day all I've seen to date of the gundam franchise, but I have to tell you.even if it had more cutaway facial expressions and cliche typical things youd expect of more action oriented anime.It was actually kind of niceI always LOVED the big conclusion at the end of a particular battle where the actor would scream in this passionate wayTHIS HAND OF MINE GLOWS BURNING RED...I certainly wouldn't say its the best thing I've ever seenThe sound effects are mediocre, and the music can be pretty cheesy almost to the point of taking you out of the action at times BUTThe characterization is pretty solid, and a diverse array of characters keep things fresh.Good main character, soild vewpoints blah blah blahmy biggest beef is the action itselfI understand robots are not easy to characterize or emote, (this was after all pre-wall-e)but the CONSTANT jump back and forth from gundam to pissed off dude in the cockpit got real old.Its almost like the animators wanted to INSIST on what was going on, no ad libbing of the imagination for you sir.instead you'll ALWAYS know how the character feels during the fight, which frankly.isnt the most important thing in the world when I just wanna see robots kick some assBELIEVE me, you'll get plenty of emotion throughout WITHOUT gundams even being involved.robot fights can be pretty contained to just a few minutes. and sometimes character defeatsNeo america :( lolcan seem a little contrived and tilted in favor of the super asian manbut for old school stuff its pretty solid.very strong in some areas while lacking seriously (at times) in others.in my honest opinion its a little give and take.If you come into the series NOT expecting superb action and a maintaining patient mindset.you'll definitely find things to enjoy.

It makes for a really interesting viewing experience in comparison to other Gundam entries. It’s a show that wears its heart on its sleeves and isn’t afraid to be as over the top and outlandish as possible. And that’s exactly ecstatic makes it so appealing.I’m a bit of a Gundam Neophyte. I’ve watched Gundam Seed and thought it was just okay, stopped Reconguista in G because I thought it was awful. But then I really liked the original 1979 Gundam, and I’m loving The Witch from Mercury. So I’m a bit all...over the place in my relationship to the franchise. But I found myself really liking this one. I don’t think it’s plot is as good as the original Gundam but I think where G Gundam excels is it’s characters.The characters might not all be the most complex, but they are almost all instantly endearing. That comes down to both their character designs and their writing. They all have defined goals and experience degrees of character development. Domon is the stand out character as the protagonist. He is hot-blooded and full of passion and not afraid to proclaim how he communicates with his fists. But he has quite a bit of character development and that becomes really apparent near the end. The core relationship at the center of the show is also well defined and they have good chemistry, their connection was never in doubt.I also really liked the characters of Sai Saici, Chibodee Crockett, and Argo Gulskii. They were pretty well defined and enjoyable to watch, with Sai Saici potentially being my favorite. They also all have very unique character designs. You can easily pick them out of a character lineup and that’s always a credit to character designs.The Gundam designs range from being pretty cool for the main characters to absolutely insane for a lot of the side characters. I’d have loved to see even more of the completely wacky designs! I’m beginning to get into Gunpla and there are a ton of model kits I’d love to get from this series. I think my favorite designs are probably God Gundam, Dragon Gundam, and Bolt Gundam.The animation quality is strong but also has a really nice nostalgic feel to it. I was only 1 when this series first aired but a lot of the animation techniques and design sensibilities of the Pokémon anime series from my youth are reflected in G Gundam. And I really like that. It might be dated but it made it really nostalgic and endearing.I’m also just a sucker for tournament stories, so that aspect perfectly aligned with my interests. It did drag in a couple of places. The training arc went on for a little too long. But around the half way point it kicks in and doesn’t really let up until the end. And it’s a great ending. It has a lot of shades of Eureka Seven, my favorite anime series, in its conclusion and I’m obviously a sucker for those storytelling choices.It isn’t the most in-depth series. The bad guys are bad with little nuance. And it does have some pacing issues. But it’s still a very fun, and energetic watch, of which I’m glad to have partaken. over the place in my relationship to the franchise. But I found myself really liking this one.

It's as far away from your typical Gundam series as you can get, but on it's own is amazing. I grew up with this series on Toonami when I was eleven and these days I'd say I can enjoy it more than Dragonball Z or Toonami. Keep in mind this anime isn't for everyone. Especially if you're a hardcore Gundam fan. But as a Shonen Jumper and avid fan of SNK's old school fighters, I absolutely loved this show. "", ""G Gundam is simply everything I love could love put into a show. It is basically one part 70s kung fu movie, one part mecha, and one part soap opera; these essences form together to make what is possibly the greatest show ever. English dub is fantastic, Mark Gatha really nails it as Domon.  The artwork is solid and the fights look really good even today. The sound design is also some of the best of what you'd expect from any other super robot show. This show may be looked down upon by some purists, but they don't know what they're missing out on....Overall this is one of the best shows ever made in my opinion, and is my favorite show ever. Overall this is one of the best shows ever made in my opinion, and is my favorite show ever."", ""G Gundam is well known not solely because of being the only Super Robot series in the franchise, but because how ridiculous the story and designs (both bad and good ways) are.While some bish-bashed the show for being not serious at all compared to the other ones, I would say that's pointless because this story is making a serious show out of a nonsensical story which is so overly serious that it is so godamned fun.Story: 6 out of 10Being a Super Robot Anime, you cannot expect some really serious-toned storyboard - It's basically some regular shonen stuff mixed with martial arts that are over-the-top...ridiculous and inhuman to start with (say, how the hell do you do the Shoku Hao Denindan where you can spin your whole body and launch like a missile without your head spinning in the process?), you can turn super-saiyan and become golden in colour, a super robot fight to decide who can control the Earth and the colonies...... If you are that kind of people that can't stand bullcrap then it probably isn't a good idea to watch this, but if you simply don't care or doesn't mind then welp.Art:An American robot that wears a hockey mask, yields its American football shoulder pads and expels its protection chestplate to become a (visually) muscular boxer, and yields a handgun like a cowboy, A Holland Gundam that has a rotating fan on its chest and is basically like a windmill, and a German Robot that looks like a German military officer in WWI somehow performs ninjatsu, and a Sphnix that has a giant Gundam face in place of the human face as it rose. Right.The characters in the show are just as stereotyped as the Gundams (except probably Schwartz Bruder which is a German ninja), so ridiculous to the point that it's clearly the general image of a certain nation's people, yet so funny that you can't stop giggling at its ridiculousness. Not necessarily a bad thing, as why so serious if the whole storyboard already decided to be not serious at all?To increase the goofy and fun of the show, the colouring is the good ol' 80's bright and vivid instead of the same gloomy style used in the 90's. This is a reminiscent of the 80's hot-blooded animes to make the scene more hammy that it is.Sound: 7 out of 10The OPs (Fly in the Sky and Trust You Forever) are both catchy, and despite the difference in tones, they still work really well with the show.The BGMs, although they aren't something extremely top-notched, worked and are easily memorised, especially Shining Finger and My Heart is Clear and Serene because you will expect the villain to have their asses kicked really hard by Shining/God(Burning) Finger.In addition, to emphasis how much Hong Kong martial arts movies influenced the film (which basically actually transformed into something totally irrelevant), several songs have their cantonese counterparts, such as Hoshikuzu no Requiem (Stardust's Requiem).Character: 7 out of 10Although it's an extremely generic shonen anime, the characters are well structured according to their own genre, have their own personalities instead of being one-dimensioned, and are all hot-blooded as hell.The downside is there aren't much stoic persons (or at least logical ones) due to the genre, and Rain doesn't have a really large role in the story despite she should be the hero's girlfriend.Enjoyment: 10 out of 10THIS HAND OF MINE IS BURNING RED! IT'S LOUD ROAR IS TELLING ME TO DEFEAT YOU! BURNING FINGER!!!Seriously, despite most of the sentences are outright stupid, the VAs from both Japanese and English still managed to pull out a straight face, thereby remaining the over-the-top serious hot-bloodness of the show worked so well, even there isn't much content you will still get your emotion flowing because of all that yelling and ridiculous stuff.See how a person runs faster than a car, uses his cloth to disassemble a Mobile Suit, kicking a whole building straight towards the sky despite being injured, spinning his body without his head spinning, that's the Undefeated of the East for you. Yes, it's that ridiculous, but you can't stop having a big grin on your face even you already saw that coming.Overall: 8 out of 10Recommended?

I still kind of feel like I start losing engagement the more I watch it.First of all, if you are one of those people who thought the Gundam franchise took itself way too seriously, this show might be for you. G Gundam while having the setting, the mechs, and the battles of a Gundam show, it\'s much more of a traditional fighting shonen, if you have ever seen Saint Seiya, this show feels like it borrows heavily from it. From...the loudly screamed attack names that are mostly just punches, to the characters of the main cast representing a certain part of the world, and to the characters all having armor that represent their ""gimmick"". It all feels very familar. Familiar but welcome.I do like the first half the show even if so many of the moments feels like you got to suspend your disbelief heavily just to go along with it but at the same time that first episode is pretty much make it or break it, the show established how ridiculous it is from the moment Rain makes a shield with her make up accessory, if you can\'t accept that, then the show is better off being dropped because it only gets more ridiculous from there.The first half, I liked since it was introducing new fighters and expanding on the world and it\'s just over the top mech fight after over the top mech fight, plus Domon is just so typical of a shonen protagonist but at the same time so pure about it and never really contradicts himself that much that I can\'t help but find him delightful.I did like how it was alluding to the Dark Gundam as this big overarching threat with him hiding but slowly showing his hand in affairs. It also had some solid character building with Domon and Rain while establishing other characters in the main cast with Domon fighting them and then their backstories getting revealed afterwards. The show will remind of their goals constantly to the point where it would be hard to forget even years after you watch the show.But then the issue I had with the show and where I started to lose engagement with it is when Domon beats the Dark Gundam for the first time. It was way too early to fight him and it should\'ve been saved for the end of the show since when Domon was fighting him, it didn\'t so much feel like Domon wanted to beat the crap out of him but because Domon was annoyed and wanted him out of the way so he can get to the tournament. It kind of lacked emotional investment by Domon to be engaging. The Dark Gundam also loses two more times and never gets a clean win over Domon so it\'s even harder to care about his as a villain.After that it\'s a tournament arc and it\'s...okay, not terrible but it Wong and later Wullube are way too dull of villains to carry it. Wong\'s goal weren\'t all that interesting nor did he have an interesting enough prescence to make me wish he got beat up and Wullube is just such a generic out of left field and boring villain that I zoned out every time he was on screen. Wong also somehow gets access to the Dark Gundam parts...so the series can still have some overarching plot thread connecting everything. Wullube\'s redeeming aspect is that he gives all the Gundam fighters an excuse to band together and defeat him which does a good job making the tournament arc feel more than just a generic tournament arc.Master Asia is a decent villain and a solid rival to Domon and his english voice actor does a good job at giving him a major prescence even if at times, he feels like he is crazy one moment and then rational the next but he is an entertaing character that I kind of let this slide.Kyoji Kashu feels like a prototype to Itachi Uchiha from Naruto and to Kyoji\'s credit, he is done better here than Itachi, but I do ask questions why on earth did Neo Germany let Kyoji run around and do want he wanted and didn\'t question if that was actually their original fighter. He\'s decent character.Overall, I do like G Gundam and it is a show worth checking out, but I can\'t deny that I did start to get slightly bored the more the series went on. It\'s still watchable but the later parts could\'ve been handled better. the loudly screamed attack names that are mostly just punches, to the characters of the main cast representing a certain part of the world, and to the characters all having armor that represent their ""gimmick"". It all feels very familar. Familiar but welcome.I do like the first half the show even if so many of the moments feels like you got to suspend your disbelief heavily just to go along with it but at the same time that first episode is pretty much make it or break it, the show established how ridiculous it is from the moment Rain makes a shield with her make up accessory, if you can\'t accept that, then the show is better off being dropped because it only gets more ridiculous from there.The first half, I liked since it was introducing new fighters and expanding on the world and it\'s just over the top mech fight after over the top mech fight, plus Domon is just so typical of a shonen protagonist but at the same time so pure about it and never really contradicts himself that much that I can\'t help but find him delightful.I did like how it was alluding to the Dark Gundam as this big overarching threat with him hiding but slowly showing his hand in affairs.

It takes place outside of Gundam\'s main Universal Century timeline, there\'s very little in regards to the political war drama the franchise is known for, the whole thing is a shonen tournament arc, and some of the mecha designs are downright goofy. And yet the show really hits all of Gundam\'s other strides as well as possible: great story, awesome animation, a soundtrack you can cheer to, and a roster of characters with stupid names that will grow on you by the end.Mobile Fighter G Gundam follows 20 year...old Domon Kasshu, who represents Neo Japan in the 13th Gundam Fight. Domon is an aggressive young man, who starts off as a distant loner who kicks some dude\'s ass, then jumps in his Shining Gundam to kick the ass of the Gundam piloted by the guy whose ass he just kicked 5 minutes ago. Domon really shines as he grows his relationships with his newfound friends, family, a few mentor figures, some stupid toddler characters that only exist because every Gundam show needs a group of little kids, and a romantic love interest he tries so hard not to say that he loves her throughout the whole 49 episode series.While the best animation in the show is reused transformations and techniques, the overall animation of every fight is some grade-a mecha goodness, and the backgrounds of every shot are very detailed and beautiful. As this show is a tournament of Gundams, the idea of every country making a Gundam based on their culture is such a fun concept, even if it does get a little silly sometimes (looking at you, Nether Gundam).Mobile Fighter G Gundam is the kind of show you put on when you just need a show where a robot in a fish suit gets beaten up by a Gundam with dragon heads for hands. When people erroneously say that ""mecha is just a genre about robots, not characters"", they probably watched this show on Toonami and thought that this was the norm. And if they watched it 25 years ago, then they probably forgot how good everything in the show is. Give this a watch if you want to get into mecha, want another Shonen anime in your life, or if you just want to see some heads explode with a Shining Finger. old Domon Kasshu, who represents Neo Japan in the 13th Gundam Fight.

But it\'s a popcorn anime. Cheap, harmless, but fun.', ""There's good in Mobile Fighter G Gundam, but it's drowned in a sea of copy-paste filler, which is a shame considering the potential this has.I feel like there's two sides to G Gundam, the A-plot focusing on the devil Gundam and the B-plot with the Gundam fight. These sides do cross over, but mostly stay separate. The reason I divided this series in two is because the A-plot is way more interesting than the B-plot. However, for the vast majority of the runtime, the B-plot is the main focus and it's awful. This series mostly sticks to self-contained episodes, meaning almost every episode has its...own mini-arc started and finished. This can work well but, Mobile Fighter G Gundam insists on copy-pasting the same one-episode arc for pretty much every B-plot episode. It's a plague on this series that ruins the experience to see the same episode again and again, I felt my sanity slipping away watching this. It's not fun to be able to perfectly predict the outcome of every episode because of the use of clichés and reuse of the exact same plot with a different opponent.I genuinely like the A-plot of this show for the short duration when it's the main focus, there's good emotion and theming that feel pretty transformative for the Gundam franchise. These sections also break the one-episode arcs, with more depth to the battles and characters involved. Unfortunately there's not too much to say about it other than that, because it's barely prominent despite being the actual story part of the show.The animation is fantastic for the time, even by today's standards it looks great for the most part. It adds so much to the series, even in this show's worst parts the animation stands strong. In spite of the great animation, the battles in this show manage to be dull. For some reason every battle plays out like a turn based RPG video game, where it never feels like two parties are fighting each-other, but rather that one beats down on Domon first and then waits for their next turn while Domon then uses his Shining Finger and wins. The majority of battles here play out exactly as I described, and it's not exciting no matter how much the characters scream at each other. The battles should've had much more depth and chaos to them, especially since most episodes are built around them.I cannot recommend this show, I wish I could, but I can't stand the vast majority of this show. If it had more focused writing, this same set up could make for a great show. Unfortunately they wanted it to air for far longer than the main part of the story could hope to last, so they just wasted the audience's time instead to fit the whole 49 episodes. own mini-arc started and finished.

Kind of sort of a low point in Imagawa's directorial efforts. I could sum my feelings on this show up pretty well by stating that it suffers from a major, fundamental identity crisis.It's Gundam but it's Not UC, it's real robot but it has a super robot director, it's made to sell model kits but the animators are spiteful towards commercialization, and so on and so forth.People will try to tell you it's wild and crazy and like the best thing ever because so much wacky stuff happens in it, but let me tell you, it...takes 40 episodes for a horse to pilot a gundam and it's not even that impressive when it does.Storywise it's kind of a self-contradictory wreck that's trying to be funny but then trying to be serious and it never fully balances those two things; there's attempts at serious drama, such as in the episodes about Neo Mexico's Gundam Fighter, which are almost always undercut by other parts of the show- in that case, the Tequila Gundam's silly name and design. I think that it suffers severely from a lot of senseless padding that occasionally- especially around the midway point- makes it difficult to sit through.The art is decidedly Not Good. I can forgive it a little on this point because it's from 1994 and most TV anime from 1994 doesn't exactly look good, but I think I just have a problem with the art style overall, even when it's executed well. Most of the time it's not though, and I think for a modern viewer what was viewed as average for its time may now look just straight up horrendous. There's also very little appeal to the toyetic mecha design or the stiff, unattractive character animation. At the very least, the main cast is fairly unique and memorable in appearance.The sound design is generally very good, and I enjoyed most of the insert songs; these days it doesn't quite feel like we get enough of those. Lots of great vocal tracks laid down right where they need to be, though in the last few episodes there's some repetitiveness.Most of the characters in the show are written very flatly, though Domon himself is not, and it does gain character complication in the latter half. Domon is a character that for me teeters on the edge of being unlikeable, but he always pulls back from it and the best moments in the show are the ones where he's able to break down and admit that he's vulnerable or weak in order to grow stronger and move past that. Unfortunately almost no one else has that, and basically every other main character has their development stunted or even thrown away for the sake of highlighting Just How Cool Domon Is. The entire world of the story basically revolves around him. It's very much something written for a juvenile mindset, and there are even little kid characters that spend 95% of their screentime yelling about Domon Is The Coolest Guy Ever.I know I'm laying it on pretty harsh for a show I rated 7, but 1) it's a low 7, and 2) it still has good moments, good highlights. I think that if it was revisited, chunked down to just 26 episodes, had more of a focus on Domon and Rain's relationship(since the actual ending of the show is all about that), and was 10000% less racist, it could be a strong 8. takes 40 episodes for a horse to pilot a gundam and it's not even that impressive when it does.Storywise it's kind of a self-contradictory wreck that's trying to be funny but then trying to be serious and it never fully balances those two things; there's attempts at serious drama, such as in the episodes about Neo Mexico's Gundam Fighter, which are almost always undercut by other parts of the show- in that case, the Tequila Gundam's silly name and design.

What a classic 90s Shounen anime, and with it being a classic it also has all the problems of 90s anime. This show breaks its structure into cours revealing each story arc in succession. This is pretty common and can be seen anywhere (the most similar comparison would be most Kamen Rider series), the issue stems from the 1st cour being a 6/10, the 2nd cour being a 3/10 (the sai saici episode is where these 3 points come from), and the 3rd cour which is a fantastic 8/10.I have to rate these cours by themselves before giving a final grade, because they...fucking pissed me off that much. The first arc starts off as an episodic “CAN JAPAN DEFEAT THIS WEEK’S STEREOTYPE?” (LOOKING AT YOU TEQUILA GUNDAM), and VERY slowly reveals info about the devil Gundam and these eluded “Gundam fights” which is a tournament, I think? Throughout the entire show they never explain how this fucking works. Is it a bracket? Is it Swiss? Is it free for all? I’m being fucking serious here they just don’t say shit and expect you to know. The next arc is much worse though.Gundam G’s tournament arc is dogshit, because it has like 2 good episodes and then for every other episode not involving the devil gundam, the opposing country turns into America and just create terrorist groups to try and kill the MC or opposing fighters (sourcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/.../United_States_and_state...). What I don’t understand is WHERE DO YOU GET 50,000 Time Bombs???????? This arc genuinely fucking sucks, but again Sai Saici’s first love episode is cute, and last few fights are cool. More stereotypes!And last but not least, the best part of the entire show. From the final fight against the Devil Gundam on the Island to the after party with the Shuffle alliance to defeat neo Japan. Everything culminating here and Domon not being dense about Rain makes it great. Even Master Asia ( I loved him the whole time and I knew I swear) was a good villain, who’s ending I really appreciated. This part is the shortest and the best.I have to give it a 7/10. It could have been higher, but here’s my BIGGEST ISSUE.IT’S SO FUCKING LONG MAN. THIS SHOW GENUINELY REFUSES TO END AND EVEN THE WRITERS ARE PUTTING IN JOKES FOR IT.

Gundam and every other Gundam series in general in the Gundam Franchise that's considered the more thing about this series is that this series has capsulated about 49 episodes as a matter of fact which it was until Mobile Suit Gundam Wing arrived in many ways for this as well and that's is what you called it a typical Gundam series takes place in Future Century timeline instead of the Universal Century timeline even though this...was created by Hajme Yatate and Yoshiyuki Tomino that worked on the original Mobile Suit Gundam series which started the Gundam franchise as well as Invincible Superman Zambot 3 and Invincible Steel man Daitarn 3 and thoughs for the point basically for this whole statement about this series has ever been created from the beginning.PlotThis takes place in the Future Century 60 which wanted to put an end on the war than has ever happened before considered how the Gundam Fight has been developed especially the fighters used the Gundams for the Gundam Fight especially when the fighters had to continue fight to be the first Gundam fighter that's the thing for this at all but then again in this case is that of what has occurred especially a Gundam fighter named Domon Kasshu who piloted his Gundam the Shining Gundam first he has defeated he has battled his opponents first being Michelo Charriot with Neros Gundam in Neo Italy especially in Europe then he fought his second opponent Gundam Maxter piloted by Chibodee Crocket of Neo America and then later on where he fought his other opponents Dragon Gundam piloted by Sai Saici of Neo China, Gundam Rose piloted by George De Sand of Neo France and most of all Bolt Gundam piloted by Argo Gulskii of Neo Russia which later on they became part of the Shuffle Alliance at this point and then he have been realized that he founded out that Kyoji has been inside the Dark Gundam ever since his mother was shot and his father was sentenced to the cryogenic state as his imprisonment as for this as well originally the Dark Gundam was originally supposed to be intended as a healing Gundam but unfortunately it landed to Earth when that happened and at this time of course he has faced his Opponents later on such as Royal Gundam piloted by Gentle Chapman of Neo England as well as the other opponents he fought has well especially for the Gundam Fight when Sai Saci has fought his opponent who is actually a ghost of a former Gundam fighter piloted his Mummy Gundam in Neo Eygpt in particularly how it goes quite well which goes on later on when The Undefeated of the East himself Master Asia of Neo Hong Kong he is also a martial arts teacher when he has met Domon in Shinjuku when he wanted to be the Gundam fighter as well at this time of course and then Domon has met Allenby Beardsly of Neo Sweeden she has piloted her Gundam Nobel Gundam if I'm not to mention as well especially after Domon's shining Gundam was destroyed after he was doing the martial arts fight with Master Gundam piloted by Master Asia until it was a miracle that it was the first time that Domon has now piloted his new Gundam that arrived Burning gundam ever since Rain has been finding out about the terrible mysterious DG Cells which they are basically called Dark Gundam cells which effects into the body especially of that has happened when Domon wanted to reach out for the final battles in Neo Hong Kong for the Gundam fight finals ever since Master Asia wanted to fight his ex pupil which it has gotten to him since that happned later on the Battle Royale comes and the remaining Gundam Fighters piloted with their Gundams for the Gundam Fight finals has been located on Lantau Island because considering how the fighters could fight it out for the only one who will remain standing during the Gundam fight finals prime minister named Wong Yunfat once again alterted the rules and allowing previous defeated Gundams always wanted to participate in order of how his evil scheme in addition these four new Gundams appear as part of the one of the four evil Kings of how they became what they involved from when they were affected with DG cells especially the ones that were selected as well and at this point Rain has stolen Ulube's Rising Gundam and this time it makes an appearance whenever it gets into the fight when Domon has realized that Schwartz Bruder is a mirror image of Kyoji the brother of Domon Kasshu truth be told which is before he defeated the Dark Gundam when Kyoji has been gone this how it was until he fought Master Gundam piloted by his Martial arts teacher Master Asia under the school of the Undefeated of the east since the fate of Domon's brother happened that's why he could realize that considered how henfaced against his former master once again than has ever happened which it occurred from that battle during the Gundam fight finals until Master Asia was defeated until he realized that he has no Dark Gundam cell in his entire body until his last breath he died after he congratulated Domon that he is the champion of the Gundam fightfor the first time and thoughs being said he has been only one of them has been walking away when he wouldn't realize that something how it has happened to him and yet it happened when he has find out that Major Ulube has kidnapped Rain in order to resurrect the Dark Gundam now Domon and his friends which they are part of the Shuffle Alliance ever since Rain has been inside the Dark Gundam since that happened and by this time of it has been going on when Domon and the rest of the Shuffle Alliance must face the battle against something Evil happening in space in order to defeat the Dark Gundam in order to rescue Rain in order to save the Earth aside from Domon and the Shuffle Alliance you got the Gundams from All of the nations of Earth especially the Gundam federation when this has been anything has been ever occurred at this point of course when Domon and the rest of the Shuffle Alliance has defested Grand Master Gundam piloted by Ulube ever since Ulube has gotten alot of the DG Cells which makes him reach to Evil but he was defeated and at the all this happened of this Domon wanted to rescue Rain in order to defeated the Dark Gundam ever since he finds out that his father came back from his cryogenic imprisonment which he came back once again from the very beginning of his childhood and for this point he wanted to defeated the Dark Gundam because he wants to be with Rain so he and Rain once again defeated the Dark Gundam which is basically as a miracle.My Thoughts:I must say is that i remember watching this Anime on Toonami when it was on Cartoon Network i remember coming back home from School just in time to watch this anime during my childhood in the early 2000s and on top of all of that this has got to the point out is that i see some cameos in the final episode of Mobile Fighter G Gundam there is cameos of Wing Gundam from Mobile Suit Gundam Wing as well as RX 78-2 Gundam from the original Mobile Suit Gundam series and there is other cameos from other anime such as Invincible Superman Zambot 3 and Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3 which i have ever recognize since i was rewatching the final episode of Mobile fighter G Gundam.Animation is great what can you do it's pure superb the music is good i like the music especially when the Burning finger as well as the shining finger Parts in every episode of Mobile Fighter G Gundam which i have ever hear in this anime unlike anyother ones before for the credibility for this as i know to come to think of it the sound is good than has anything done before the characters we had a credibility of characters to be included in this seriesOverallLike most of the other Gundam series in the Gundam franchise Mobile Fighter G Gundam is the kind of anime is more different than the other Mobile Suit Gundam series they used Gundams to pilot for the Gundam Fight battles instead of using Gundams to pilot as the military use this series is like of how you have the inspiration from Dragon Ball Z series but added with Gundams for the fight tournament for a day as well and ironically that this series has been got the controversy especially the names like God Gundam and Devil Gundam but in the English dub of Mobile Fighter G Gundam they change the names to Burning Gundam and Dark Gundam especially to prevent the religious controversies just to begin with as far i could think of all for this however i liked the Gundam Fight battles which i think how how it come sto this has ever seen in this particular Gundam series it has its moments but overall if ypunwanted to watch a particular Gundam series to binge watch give Mobile Fighter G Gundam a watch because this anime series is more different than other Gundam series has ever got to this for the journey that has ever got to this.10/10 was created by Hajme Yatate and Yoshiyuki Tomino that worked on the original Mobile Suit Gundam series which started the Gundam franchise as well as Invincible Superman Zambot 3 and Invincible Steel man Daitarn 3 and thoughs for the point basically for this whole statement about this series has ever been created from the beginning.PlotThis takes place in the Future Century 60 which wanted to put an end on the war than has ever happened before considered how the Gundam Fight has been developed especially the fighters used the Gundams for the Gundam Fight especially when the fighters had to continue fight to be the first Gundam fighter that's the thing for this at all but then again in this case is that of what has occurred especially a Gundam fighter named Domon Kasshu who piloted his Gundam the Shining Gundam first he has defeated he has battled his opponents first being Michelo Charriot with Neros Gundam in Neo Italy especially in Europe then he fought his second opponent Gundam Maxter piloted by Chibodee Crocket of Neo America and then later on where he fought his other opponents Dragon Gundam piloted by Sai Saici of Neo China, Gundam Rose piloted by George De Sand of Neo France and most of all Bolt Gundam piloted by Argo Gulskii of Neo Russia which later on they became part of the Shuffle Alliance at this point and then he have been realized that he founded out that Kyoji has been inside the Dark Gundam ever since his mother was shot and his father was sentenced to the cryogenic state as his imprisonment as for this as well originally the Dark Gundam was originally supposed to be intended as a healing Gundam but unfortunately it landed to Earth when that happened and at this time of course he has faced his Opponents later on such as Royal Gundam piloted by Gentle Chapman of Neo England as well as the other opponents he fought has well especially for the Gundam Fight when Sai Saci has fought his opponent who is actually a ghost of a former Gundam fighter piloted his Mummy Gundam in Neo Eygpt in particularly how it goes quite well which goes on later on when The Undefeated of the East himself Master Asia of Neo Hong Kong he is also a martial arts teacher when he has met Domon in Shinjuku when he wanted to be the Gundam fighter as well at this time of course and then Domon has met Allenby Beardsly of Neo Sweeden she has piloted her Gundam Nobel Gundam if I'm not to mention as well especially after Domon's shining Gundam was destroyed after he was doing the martial arts fight with Master Gundam piloted by Master Asia until it was a miracle that it was the first time that Domon has now piloted his new Gundam that arrived Burning gundam ever since Rain has been finding out about the terrible mysterious DG Cells which they are basically called Dark Gundam cells which effects into the body especially of that has happened when Domon wanted to reach out for the final battles in Neo Hong Kong for the Gundam fight finals ever since Master Asia wanted to fight his ex pupil which it has gotten to him since that happned later on the Battle Royale comes and the remaining Gundam Fighters piloted with their Gundams for the Gundam Fight finals has been located on Lantau Island because considering how the fighters could fight it out for the only one who will remain standing during the Gundam fight finals prime minister named Wong Yunfat once again alterted the rules and allowing previous defeated Gundams always wanted to participate in order of how his evil scheme in addition these four new Gundams appear as part of the one of the four evil Kings of how they became what they involved from when they were affected with DG cells especially the ones that were selected as well and at this point Rain has stolen Ulube's Rising Gundam and this time it makes an appearance whenever it gets into the fight when Domon has realized that Schwartz Bruder is a mirror image of Kyoji the brother of Domon Kasshu truth be told which is before he defeated the Dark Gundam when Kyoji has been gone this how it was until he fought Master Gundam piloted by his Martial arts teacher Master Asia under the school of the Undefeated of the east since the fate of Domon's brother happened that's why he could realize that considered how henfaced against his former master once again than has ever happened which it occurred from that battle during the Gundam fight finals until Master Asia was defeated until he realized that he has no Dark Gundam cell in his entire body until his last breath he died after he congratulated Domon that he is the champion of the Gundam fightfor the first time and thoughs being said he has been only one of them has been walking away when he wouldn't realize that something how it has happened to him and yet it happened when he has find out that Major Ulube has kidnapped Rain in order to resurrect the Dark Gundam now Domon and his friends which they are part of the Shuffle Alliance ever since Rain has been inside the Dark Gundam since that happened and by this time of it has been going on when Domon and the rest of the Shuffle Alliance must face the battle against something Evil happening in space in order to defeat the Dark Gundam in order to rescue Rain in order to save the Earth aside from Domon and the Shuffle Alliance you got the Gundams from All of the nations of Earth especially the Gundam federation when this has been anything has been ever occurred at this point of course when Domon and the rest of the Shuffle Alliance has defested Grand Master Gundam piloted by Ulube ever since Ulube has gotten alot of the DG Cells which makes him reach to Evil but he was defeated and at the all this

Modern Love Tokyo: Kare ga Kanaderu Futari no Shirabe,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53585/Modern_Love_Tokyo__Kare_ga_Kanaderu_Futari_no_Shirabe,"[""Minor spoilers ahead.Modern Love Tokyo tells the story of a 32 yo office clerk that lives frustrated with her job and the lack of meaning in her life. She drowns her sorrows in alcohol and doesn't really know herself. One night after finishing her work day, she seats at her usual bar when a specific song comes on the record player and she is immediately transported to her high school days.This is the story of the protagonist's self (re)discovery, as she remembers her past love and her dreams of becoming an artist and doing something meaningful with her life.Although this short is only 30 minutes...long, there was a nice development of the protagonist and we get to know her qualities, flaws, wishes and fears. She is an introverted yet rather interesting woman with some hidden talents and she actually comes to believe in herself and put those talents to good use. As for her love interest, his love for her is portrayed as always being there and he wants her to be happy.The soundtrack is also really good, especially the songs played on the piano. It complements the plot in a nice way.As for the art, it uses a very light style with smooth colors and clean lines, very pleasing to the eye. The animation is also excellent with almost movie-like quality.All in all, this was an heartwarming slow-burning romance and I recommend it to everyone that enjoys light movies. long, there was a nice development of the protagonist and we get to know her qualities, flaws, wishes and fears.

What's more startling, is the fact that even a 30-minute movie could be one of the best movies one has ever seen.The way anyone can easily relate to the protagonist and the way the characters' feelings were portrayed completely drew me in. Their moments together were so short yet so sweet, and the way they disappeared from each others' lives was simply heartbreaking- and felt very real. But even after such a long time apart, they were reunited, and...all it took was a tiny little bit of courage. Just that. It is magnificent how a tiny step forward can slowly but surely, take you as far as your heart desires.And the soundtracks- oh the MUSIC. It isn't hard at all to imagine myself listening to that song and crying. Last but not least, I absolutely adored the animation. The animation was amazing and so were those little illustrations, intricately designed and simply beautiful. All in all, I think it was a wonderful anime movie, and I believe it will be worth your time. all it took was a tiny little bit of courage. Just that.

It premiered via Amazon Prime.This anime is the inspired adaptation/based off a Japanese Drama with the same name and have launched in the same year. Certainly this had caught me off guard on how good the story and the presentation. The good thing about the film? it has that happy ending.The anime is about a woman (Tamami) who is struggling in her adult life. While drinking in a bar she then hears a rock song...that she used to listen in her youth. During her younger years, she met Rin (an aloft guy that plays piano alone in the school gym). The film is the retelling of their past and what happens after they met in the present day.The animation is unique but you can never really say ""its one of its own"". However, it has done a great job on that department.The only downside I felt worth mentioning is the ""length"" of the movie. For 30 minutes, I felt like this should have been 1 hour to fully flesh out the story. Rather it felt rushed and some plot holes left unexplained. Nonetheless there is nothing that made me feel like confused.If you really wanted a good romance anime film - this is certainly a good recommendation. that she used to listen in her youth.

Naoko Yamada is back to a very familiar 'modern / high school with socially awkward characters' with a relatively straightforward story and a minimal set of characters - which is where I believe her strengths as a director lie, as results have been a lot more mixedVery conventional and takes no risks, although as I believe it's based on an existing story, scope to do so is probably limited in this regard. Avoids trying to juggle complex narratives, and an over-reliance...on melodrama, tonal shifts and cliches which has been present in her work at times - notably The Heike Story.In short: a simple story, that although plays to Yamada's strengths as a director, results in a very good - if amazingly under-watched - piece of work. on melodrama, tonal shifts and cliches which has been present in her work at times - notably The Heike Story.In short: a simple story, that although plays to Yamada's strengths as a director, results in a very good - if amazingly under-watched - piece of work.""]"
Kara no Kyoukai Movie 1: Fukan Fuukei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_Movie_1__Fukan_Fuukei,"[""Kara no Kyoukai review Part 1Kara no Kyoukai (lit. The Boundary of Emptiness), is a series that has taken a long time to become well known. The story was originally created in 1998 by Nasu Kinoko and Takeuchi Takashi (who later went on to form TYPE-MOON), with the first five chapters being released on their doujin website, whilst the final two chapters were released in August 1999 at Comiket 56. The series was picked up by Kodansha for commercial publication in 2004, and this year (2009), will see the series released on the international market courtesy of Del Rey Manga.Now fans of  Shingetsutan Tsukihime...will be find many things in Kara no Kyoukai familiar, not the least of which is the fact that they are both created by TYPE-MOON. The stories have several parallels within them, which has led to the latter series being considered an alternate version of the former, or at the very least, set in the same world.The anime adaptation of the series is being released as seven movies that run for approxiamtely 50 minutes each. Each individual film features a different time period, with no two consecutive movies following in any kind of chronological order. Unlike Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu though, this seemingly out-of-sequence airing is not simply because of a whim on the part of the producers. The non-consecutive ordering is how the series is should be portrayed, and the anime has stayed faithful to that method.The first movie, entitled Overlooking View, is surprisingly good in terms of its story. Although there is very little character development, the story moves along at a nice pace, and the tense nature of the movie is very much apparent to the viewer. The movie is somewhat predictable in places though, however this doesn't really detract from one's enjoyment of it as an individual episode.One thing to note is that the series subtitle, &quot;The Garden of Sinners&quot;, is actually very appropriate. The first movie does a good job of highlighting the fact that the world in which the story takes place is no heaven by any measure, and that not everything is as simple as people may at first believe.The art and animation for the series is done by Ufotable, a company for which I have a distinct soft spot. Like many Ufotable productions the animation style is distinctive in certain ways, especially during the action sequences (fans of Futakoi Alternative will know what I'm talking about here), and fans will notice Ufotable's trademark claymation sequences at the beginning of each movie (in other series they are shown with the credits at the end of each episode). The animation is generally very well done, and what may seem like blips in the animating sequence are often purposeful, part of this distinctive style I mentioned.The backgrounds and backdrops are generally excellent. The maze-like structure of the Fujo building is very well depicted, as are the various outdoor scenes and indoor scenes. The CG has been almost seamlessly incorporated into the show, and the smoothness of the CG adds to the effect of the action sequences.Character designs are taken directly from the original designs for the novels by Takeuchi Takashi, however fans of Tsukihime will also notice similarities in the features of several of the characters.One area where the movie manages to stamp it's mark is with the sound effects. These are often very clear and well used, fading to background noise when necessary.The effects used during the action sequences are sometimes sharp in comparison to the rest of the movie, whilst the effects used to promote an atmosphere of tension are a little lacking. The music sometimes lacks a little subtlety, but generally serves to heighten the effect of a particular scene, addinga sense of foreboding in some sequences.The voice actors are well used, with the three main characters being decently portrayed. Sakamoto Maaya, who plays the role of Ryougi Shiki, brings a certain edge, a certain chill, to her voice at the times when it's necessary, something which adds to the overall effect of the character. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast don't really have much scope to display their skill. Hopefully the following movies will rectify this though.I will freely admit that the rating I have given the characters is not fair, but this is because a valid assessment of each character is extremely difficult in this case. The fact that the movie is only 50 minutes long means that there is no real development to each character, but I am withholding a final opinion until the end of the series.As I mentioned before there are certain parallels with Shingetsutan Tsukihime, and nowhere is this more apparent than with the characters. Ryougi Shiki doesn't just share her name with Tohno Shiki of Tsukihime, she also has the &quot;Mystic Eyes of Death Perception&quot; (and she looks a bit like Ciel). Likewise, Aozaki Touko shares her name with Aozaki Aoko, and both help the person named Shiki in their respective shows (they also seem to know more than they let on as well).In general the characters are well done, but they lack a certain depth which will hopefully be rectified as the series continues.Overall this is a very enjoyable movie. The pacing of the story, the tension of various scenes, and the semi-combative relationship of the characters, all serve to raise this above the often substandard fare around. The fact that the series is being done as individual movies is also a plus, as each story arc is completed within a nice timeframe. The movie may be a little predictable, but as a first offering it was very impressive nonetheless.Some people may not enjoy the first movie for a number of reasons (it has no real romance, no character development, no sequential plot, etc), but personally, I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. will be find many things in Kara no Kyoukai familiar, not the least of which is the fact that they are both created by TYPE-MOON.

Despite the first in a septenary - for better or worse - the movie takes a rather disjointed, obscure approach.You may expect the first in a septenary to chronicle the inception of the cast, or to establish the universe and conflict in the series. Instead, audiences are thrown into the middle of a story which seems like it was written for people with previous knowledge of the Kara no Kyoukai franchise. There's little in the way of...introductions, which musters very little connection to or understanding of the characters. The film is shrouded in mystery, but produces very little intrigue - the foundations seem absent; it sets up a plot but struggles (or rather, doesn't attempt) to develop any of the characters. It's an okay technique to pull in the audience during the first act - get them pondering and interested through obscurity - but it doesn't work well when that's all you're doing throughout the entire film. This causes the story to fall flat and come across as lackluster with very little substance; just another plot involving baddies and a team adept at dealing with them.It's this extreme lack of depth to the characters that really spoils what could be an exciting film. With no connection to the cast comes a struggle to care about them and, by extension, the story. There are three members of the main cast, with a very weak supporting team, and hints of depth are just that - hints. The writers want it to be interesting by being cryptic, but they completely miss the mark.The animation and art style are saving graces, if the film isn't already too far gone. The character designs, backgrounds and general views are all very crisp and detailed. The art department communicate well a very dark and isolated tone. The animation is fluid and the action sequences are stunning. The music, too, is very well implemented. The backing tracks blend fittingly with the dark tone and the more uptempo pieces used during the action sequences complement them significantly.However, due to such uninspired characters which pave the way for a very bland story, the film comes across as fearfully mediocre. Some depth to the characters would have gone leaps and bounds, but the writers' refusal engage with them in the first installment doesn't make for a very compelling film. introductions, which musters very little connection to or understanding of the characters.

And even  in that department it has flaws (the characters are way too traditionally drawn). The story is, actually, non-existent, and we get to see only a glimpse of character development. There's a wide range of quasi-philosophical mumbo-jumbo which seems absolutely random and pointless.This movie did nothing for me. I've seen more happening in first five minutes of a series that has 110 episodes, than I've seen in 50 minutes of Kara no Kyoukai: Fukan Fuukei.The sound has it's good moments. But there's so much silence, trying to unsuccsessfully create an...'atmosphere' that the movie, in my opinion, fails in this department too.The good parts (art, sparse fight scenes) are slaughtered by Aozaki Touko's lamentations, as well with trying to force a dark, desperate atmosphere onto the beautifully drawn world. I guess it was supposed to be smart and intellectually enticing, posing questions about suicide, courage to withstand life, and whatnot.However it may try, the movie fails. The characters seem as rough drafts, with too many typical traits, the stoyline of a 50 minute movie should have actually existed.Now, I do not know the background of the story. I have not read the novels, I just wanted to watch a movie for a change. I think Kara no Kyoukai should have been categorized as a series. Because Fuukan Fuukei cannot call itself a movie, even if it goes on for 50 minutes.I will watch the other 6 movies because I hate making decisive opinions about something I haven't gotten to familiarize myself with completely. However, I think it is reasonable to form an opinion after watching something that calls itself a movie.

Okay, so Kara no Kyoukai is a series of 7 films and 1 OVA epilogue to them, please do not assume that each movie has its own beginning and end like normal movies do, i would rather consider this as extended episodes rather than movies as much like Harry Potter, each one ends on a cliffhanger to tell the one same story and while yes each movie does have its own plot,...it takes all 7 movies to explain things you may have seen in the first, thankyou for reading!Fukan Fuukei is the first of 7 anime movies produced by studio Ufotable (well known for Fate/Zero) and is the introduction to possibly one of my favourite anime of all time.Story 9/10:While this film is rather slow in comparison to the later films, Fukan Fuukei (Overlooking View) has a lot to like in terms of pacing, we follow Ryogi Shiki, a woman who has the ability of Death Perception as she works for Touko Aozaki to investigate paranormal events and  take them by force if necessary.This film in particular is heavily story driven, with only two action scenes in the entire 48 minute movie, Overlooking View focuses squarely on Mikiya, Shiki and Touko's relationship with eachother and the story should be considered a prologue to the overarching story.Art 10/10:The budget Ufotable has for their shows can seemingly buy Japan itself as this film's art and animation is possibly one of if not the most beautiful thing ive ever had the pleasure of watching in the anime medium, the vibrant colours inside Shiki's eyes (when in battle) contrast to the overall dark and gloomy background gloriously and the divine backgrounds this show has to offer are equally a treat for the eye. Every penny they spent on the animation was superb and then some with only Fate/Zero and Gankutsuou being possible contenders for best looking anime i have ever seen, this is seriously not something that should be missed.Sound 9/10:I gave this a 9 as, even though all of the music in the movie is the same song composed in different ways, tempos and using many different instruments from a choir accompanied with an acoustic guitar to the completely badass 'Fighting Medley' which is the same song with a full blown orchestra in the more intense parts this film has to offer, and because of how perfectly it blends in with Shiki ripping off her jacket to fight, it has found its way onto my list of all time greatest anime OSTs, plus, you know, an anime with songs composed by Yuki Kajiura? C'mon of course the soundtrack is awesome!Character 7/10:As i previously stated this film is heavy on character development to give you the basic premise of who they are and nothing more, the film can only give you the amount of character development you get in a regular 2 1/2 anime episodes and aside from Code Geass and Persona 4, that isnt enough time to solidly develop any character, especially one's with so much back story that this film has prepped you for, but not explained.Enjoyment 9/10:I try to be fair with my reviews but when it comes to an anime i put on a pedastal as possibly the greatest anime i have ever watched, its difficult to say i dont thoroughly enjoy watching all of these movies, this film is quite slow, granted, but the Yuki Kajiura OST, beautifully executed fight scenes, perfectly paced character development to set you up for the next film and absolutely GORGEOUS visuals, how can anyone say they didn't find something to like from this?Its also difficult to only review the first film which is the equivalent of only reviewing 2 episodes to your favourite anime, i cant explain whatll happen next nor can i explain what this film holds because in comparison to the entire set of movies, this doesnt contain as much as some of them, so i'll let you enjoy it when you go watch it, which i whole-heartedly recommend you do as this is not one to miss and its a real shame not as many people are aware of this truly stunning series. it takes all 7 movies to explain things you may have seen in the first, thankyou for reading!Fukan Fuukei is the first of 7 anime movies produced by studio Ufotable (well known for Fate/Zero) and is the introduction to possibly one of my favourite anime of all time.Story 9/10:While this film is rather slow in comparison to the later films, Fukan Fuukei (Overlooking View) has a lot to like in terms of pacing, we follow Ryogi Shiki, a woman who has the ability of Death Perception as she works for Touko Aozaki to investigate paranormal events and  take them by force if necessary.This film in particular is heavily story driven, with only two action scenes in the entire 48 minute movie, Overlooking View focuses squarely on Mikiya, Shiki and Touko's relationship with eachother and the story should be considered a prologue to the overarching story.Art 10/10:The budget Ufotable has for their shows can seemingly buy Japan itself as this film's art and animation is possibly one of if not the most beautiful thing ive ever had the pleasure of watching in the anime medium, the vibrant colours inside Shiki's eyes (when in battle) contrast to the overall dark and gloomy background gloriously and the divine backgrounds this show has to offer are equally a treat for the eye.

However, all I found was a forced dialog with forced depth that ended up preaching through most of the movie with lame arm-chair psychology that lacked any depth.  I don\'t mind endless dialog when the characters have intelligent, intriguing things to say but the ideas within the dialog in this movie were neither original or interesting.  If you\'ve read some psych books, you\'ve read it before... and if you\'ve watched other psychological shows, you\'ve heard the...same concepts explained in better detail and in more depth.   I think they did manage to fool the masses into thinking that this movie is a work of psychological genius though.  At best it is a movie of cobbled together psychological/philosophical concepts that the writers themselves poorly understood to make it ""sound"" intelligent.The character, Shiki, is interesting though, and may convince me to watch the other movies... maybe. same concepts explained in better detail and in more depth.

I expect this to get some down votes as a result, but I figured the best place for this review would be attached to the first film in the series.The plot mostly revolves around two young people, Mikiya and Shiki. Shiki is a gorgeous but weird girl. She frequently speaks in cryptic riddles, and is almost never seen wearing anything other than a kimono. She seems consistently bored and disinterested with what goes on around her. Mikiya is your average ultra-nice guy who...always tries to see the best in everyone--and of course, he falls for Shiki hard, in his own restrained way. As he becomes closer to her and she beings to open up to him in spite of herself, he learns that she may have something to do with the mysterious (and very violent) murders that have been occurring in their city. And while it's true that she does, nothing about this series is as straightforward as it initially seems to be, and the mysteries that revolve around Shiki and the bloody violence that plague their city is what drives Garden of Sinners forwards. And sometimes backwards. And sideways.I've got mixed feelings about this movie series--on one hand, they are some of the prettiest and most detailed animated works I've ever seen, complete with fantastically choreographed action sequences, a decent soundtrack, and chillingly dark, gory mysteries blooming like a poisoned blossom in each installment. On the other hand, they possess an unrelentingly (and occasionally laughable) high opinion of their own seriousness, are populated almost entirely with either thinly developed or just plain unlikable characters (with maybe one or two exceptions) and make the grave mistake of thinking that they are about more than they are actually about. Top it all off with some occasionally lazy writing and way more purposeful obfuscation than an action series like this requires (is there any real reason why these stories aren't told in chronological order?) and you're left with something that's sort of a pleasure to behold, but difficult to enjoy or care much about.There is some meaty substance here worth digging into (the fifth film's central plot revolving around a magnificently bizarre apartment complex was particularly satisfying for a good chunk of its length), and when it pushes into emotional territory without overextending its reach it proves itself capable of some seriously great scenes, but otherwise, serious fans of pitch-black action/horror anime (to the exclusion of nearly all else) are going to probably be the only ones who are going to seriously nerd out about this series.Still, it's worth noting that I'd probably watch it again, and I wouldn't be too terribly surprised if I wound up liking it more the second time around. Ultimately though, I'd say that Garden of Sinners is mostly a severe case of style over substance that pretends as if it possesses substance by slowing down the pace and keeping key plot elements in the shadows for far longer than is necessary. (Not to mention the terribly cryptic dialogue and clumsy philosophizing. Where do I even begin with this stuff?) On that note, however, I must say that I'm more than a little concerned about how often the pacing of this series is criticized: for all of its frustrations, I was never once even remotely bored--which leads me to worry somewhat about the attention span of your average anime fan. (I was similarly frustrated to see many anime fans complaining of Serial Experiments Lain and Haibane Renmei being too slow.) Garden of Sinners suffers from numerous problems, but pacing issues are not one of them.The biggest problem is that most of the individual films themselves are pretty decent in and of themselves. (I'll get to the rest of the problem in a second here.) Yes, they tend to wallow in mindless darkness for longer than they should (seriously, if Garden of Sinners blows your mind, go check out something like Clockwork Orange, then report back to me), but as atmospheric action mysteries they succeed, occasionally magnificently. The problem is that even with none of the films being too weak when taken individually they just don't add up to anything too compelling when all are taken together. It's like the team (or teams) behind it all spent so much time carefully crafting each individual piece that they forgot to make sure that the pieces all added up to an appealing whole when taken together. Nor does the big picture, which is doled out to the audience in bits and pieces, really add up to anything particularly surprising--indeed, I had already filled in most of the blanks myself by the time the final film rolled around, and as the credits rolled on the final picture, the overwhelming thought I had was: 'That was it? What was the point?'Ultimately, I appreciate the ambition and technical artistry that's on display here, and I'd be a liar if I said that I didn't really enjoy on some level the gore, action, and the occasional nice character moment. Otherwise though, Garden of Sinners feels pretty hollow once you get past its polished exterior, and looking back on it I mostly see wasted potential. always tries to see the best in everyone--and of course, he falls for Shiki hard, in his own restrained way.

That was Fatezero and it was glorious. Why do I bring this up? Because this week I\'ll be looking at an adaptation of a Type-Moon work handled by Ufotable. This is Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei which is far too long of a title so I\'ll just refer to it as KnK for the rest of this review. One of the odd things about KnK is that it\'s actually a series of eight films and an OVA looking at different parts of the light novel series and two...of the films tell a single story. Wouldn\'t it have made more sense to do an actual anime series or was there some reason they couldn\'t? Since I like to make up my own explanations for this type of thing I\'m just going to say that the Predacons and Maximals were arguing over whether it should be a series or a long OVA and the film series was a compromise. Let\'s take a look at the franchise\'s first film (I love alliteration.)There\'s an abandoned building where girls have been committing suicide. Our protagonist, Shiki, looks at the building and sees people floating above it. So, she responds by doing absolutely nothing... No examination out of curiosity? Okay, anyway Shiki goes to a place that may or may not be a business of some kind, it\'s not exactly explained, to talk to her friends Touko and Mikiya. Mikiya collapses because he went to the suicide building and... likes dolls. And that\'s the point of the film where I lost any hopes I had for it being good. It doesn\'t help that they leave the dude comatose on the couch instead of taking him to, you know, a hospital. Where they treat people who are suffering from medical issues like being comatose. That\'s when Shiki goes to the building to properly investigate. I won\'t go any further into details. Let\'s look at the problems with the movie. The first is that we learn virtually nothing about any of our characters or how they gathered together. It\'s not like there isn\'t time to examine it in part, but they prefer to spend the time showing off the artwork or having Shiki eat for several minutes. Seems like she could\'ve investigated the condemned building earlier and nothing of value would\'ve been lost. The biggest issue with the story is that roughly thirty minutes of the fifty minute run-time accomplish nothing. And one of the big problems that emerges from not having any back-story is that when Shiki uses her abilities during the climax a lot of what she does comes out of nowhere and you have to wonder where her abilities came from and why she\'s able to do what she\'s doing. Seriously, these are not elements you introduce for the first time in the climax without explanation. Another issue is that the only action sequence before the climax is unintentionally hilarious. What it\'s supposed to be doing is building tension and setting up the threat but the sequence is so over the top that it comes off as funny instead. They also try to establish atmosphere with over-used horror cliches like having laughter play in a secluded and rundown place. I hate to break it to you, Guys, but that stopped being scary when they started using it in the Halloween episodes of children\'s cartoons. Another issue that\'s quite prevalent in the final third of the film are the overly preachy, faux philosophical speeches. They get so ridiculous and they\'re so generally pointless that I\'m tempted to call this a PSA film, except that the opening two-thirds are only tangentially related to the subject.Then we have the characters. You can probably guess already, but they\'re not interesting. They don\'t get any development nor do they have much in the way of personality. Yes, I realise that it\'s difficult to develop characters in a fifty minute film, but KnK never even gives us any reasons to care about these people. When Mikiya collapses you don\'t want to see him get better, apparently neither do Shiki or Touko since they just leave him where he fell. You barely know anything about him. You know that he likes dolls and he buys people things they don\'t like and that\'s pretty much it. How would a good movie have handled something like this? Let\'s look at Mononoke Hime for the answer. In Mononoke Hime Ashitaka is cursed almost immediately. Why do we want to see him get better? Because we already know that he\'s a courageous and kind individual. Yeah, we know bugger all else at that point, but it\'s enough to get us invested in his plight since he\'s already a sympathetic character. And back to KnK. To discuss our other major characters, Shiki and Touko. Shiki is kind of a blank slate and Touko is a doll maker/scientist. The scientist thing isn\'t actually mentioned but the plot doesn\'t make sense if she\'s just a doll maker. Neither one has a whole lot of personality. Which is another issue with this first film. It should be our introduction to the characters and instead you have three characters with virtually no personality interacting in order to get the plot moving while revealing almost nothing about their motivations or personalities. It\'s boring. If the characters had interesting personalities then the film could be dialogue heavy and interesting, but the characters don\'t so it\'s just dialogue heavy.The artwork is the best part of the movie. The character designs are a bit typical, but they still look good. The backgrounds, textures and various objects are all excellent. The only real problem I have with the art is that they do the ""blood splattering everywhere in a way that blood doesn\'t actually do"" thing.The voice acting... It isn\'t exactly bad but it\'s not good either. A big part of it is that the performances are really unemotional and detached. Which I\'m certain is the result of the direction since I know that Sakamoto Maaya, Suzumura Kenichi, Tanaka Rie and pretty much everyone else in this can act. The music can be good when they\'re trying to set an atmosphere, but they usually ruin it by adding faint laughter or by using overly dramatic music when the scene is just Shiki walking home.The yuri factor is a 1/10. This has no yuri. Granted that could be because the character interactions are so emotionless and Shiki might be supposed to have a thing for Touko. I only bring that up because the film is given romance as a sub-genre and I can\'t really tell whether it\'s going for Shiki and Touko or Shiki and Mikiya. Either way the interactions don\'t really support the idea of romance. I guess Touko and Shiki would make more sense since she doesn\'t even care about Mikiya enough to take him to hospital when he\'s comatose. Yes, I did have to bring that up a third time. It\'s just too stupid not to.The final rating for Kara no Kyoukai 1 is a 2/10. Granted, the visuals are very impressive but the story is a lot of nothing and the characters couldn\'t have less personality without being inanimate, or in a Kingdom Hearts game. Seeing it doesn\'t interest me in the rest of the series. It just makes me want a nap. of the films tell a single story. Wouldn\'t it have made more sense to do an actual anime series or was there some reason they couldn\'t? Since I like to make up my own explanations for this type of thing I\'m just going to say that the Predacons and Maximals were arguing over whether it should be a series or a long OVA and the film series was a compromise. Let\'s take a look at the franchise\'s first film (I love alliteration.)There\'s an abandoned building where girls have been committing suicide. Our protagonist, Shiki, looks at the building and sees people floating above it. So, she responds by doing absolutely nothing... No examination out of curiosity? Okay, anyway Shiki goes to a place that may or may not be a business of some kind, it\'s not exactly explained, to talk to her friends Touko and Mikiya. Mikiya collapses because he went to the suicide building and... likes dolls. And that\'s the point of the film where I lost any hopes I had for it being good. It doesn\'t help that they leave the dude comatose on the couch instead of taking him to, you know, a hospital. Where they treat people who are suffering from medical issues like being comatose. That\'s when Shiki goes to the building to properly investigate. I won\'t go any further into details. Let\'s look at the problems with the movie. The first is that we learn virtually nothing about any of our characters or how they gathered together. It\'s not like there isn\'t time to examine it in part, but they prefer to spend the time showing off the artwork or having Shiki eat for several minutes. Seems like she could\'ve investigated the condemned building earlier and nothing of value would\'ve been lost. The biggest issue with the story is that roughly thirty minutes of the fifty minute run-time accomplish nothing. And one of the big problems that emerges from not having any back-story is that when Shiki uses her abilities during the climax a lot of what she does comes out of nowhere and you have to wonder where her abilities came from and why she\'s able to do what she\'s doing. Seriously, these are not elements you introduce for the first time in the climax without explanation. Another issue is that the only action sequence before the climax is unintentionally hilarious. What it\'s supposed to be doing is building tension and setting up the threat but the sequence is so over the top that it comes off as funny instead. They also try to establish atmosphere with over-used horror cliches like having laughter play in a secluded and rundown place. I hate to break it to you, Guys, but that stopped being scary when they started using it in the Halloween episodes of children\'s cartoons. Another issue that\'s quite prevalent in the final third of the film are the overly preachy, faux philosophical speeches. They get so ridiculous and they\'re so generally pointless that I\'m tempted to call this a PSA film, except that the opening two-thirds are only tangentially related to the subject.Then we have the characters. You can probably guess already, but they\'re not interesting. They don\'t get any development nor do they have much in the way of personality. Yes, I realise that it\'s difficult to develop characters in a fifty minute film, but KnK never even gives us any reasons to care about these people. When Mikiya collapses you don\'t want to see him get better, apparently neither do Shiki or Touko since they just leave him where he fell. You barely know anything about him. You know that he likes dolls and he buys people things they don\'t like and that\'s pretty much it. How would a good movie have handled something like this? Let\'s look at Mononoke Hime for the answer. In Mononoke Hime Ashitaka is cursed almost immediately. Why do we want to see him get better? Because we already know that he\'s a courageous and kind individual. Yeah, we know bugger all else at that point, but it\'s enough to get us invested in his plight since he\'s already a sympathetic character. And back to KnK. To discuss our other major characters, Shiki and Touko. Shiki is kind of a blank slate and Touko is a doll maker/scientist. The scientist thing isn\'t actually mentioned but the plot doesn\'t make sense if she\'s just a doll maker. Neither one has a whole lot of personality. Which is another issue with this first film. It should be our introduction to the characters and instead you have three characters with virtually no personality interacting in order to get the plot moving while revealing almost nothing about their motivations or personalities. It\'s boring. If the characters had interesting personalities then the film could be dialogue heavy and interesting, but the characters don\'t so it\'s just dialogue heavy.The artwork is the best part of the movie. The character designs are a bit typical, but they still look good. The backgrounds, textures and various objects are all excellent. The only real problem I have with the art is that they do the ""blood splattering everywhere in a way that blood doesn\'t actually do"" thing.The voice acting...

And the anime is based on the  Japanese novel series, authored by Kinoko Nasu and illustrated by Takashi Takeuchi.Well enough about ranting onto the review.Story - 8Well first of all, any plot progression or story development in this first movie is pretty much stand-alone from the series itself, and since this is the first movie of seven, it can be quite(or very) confusing, even if...you read the first chapter of the novel. So don't expect to understand it well the first time watching it.Art - 10This category is where this anime truly shines. Everything from lighting effects, backgrounds and character animations are top-notch for this modern-day anime. You won't be disappointed with the visuals.Sound - 9The bgm for this anime was actually well-done for its mystery/supernatural theme and fitted well with the majority of the scenes in the movie. Not to mention the theme songs were performed by Yuki Kajiura.Character - 8Now this movie suffers in this category because you get a complete lack of introduction and/or exposition about the characters in the anime. There&rsquo;s no explanation about Shiki Ryōgi and her mysterious ability; Likewise Tohko Aozaki and her dolls, although the characters themselves are interesting and cool.Enjoyment - 9Now although this movie is suppose to serve as the introduction/pilot movie, it actually is very interesting and intriguing. With its mix of mystery, supernatural, and action it is definitely something interesting to watch. Although there is quite abit of talking in the movie; the action scenes, despite short, were actually depicted very well and cool. Although the suicide scenes are quite explicit.Overall - 9Overall the movie, in my opinion, is great. It has its very noticeable flaws, but its still a great supernatural/mystery movie with excellent animations. While the story can be very confusing for the average anime viewer as well as a lack of character introductions; the way its depicted gives you a sense of curiousity, making you want to wait for the next release.I recommend checking it out despite its flaws for the average anime viewer, especially watch it if your a TYPE-moon fan. you read the first chapter of the novel.

Due to the fact that I think you should know what you\'re getting yourself into before you decide to watch this movie, I am attempting to write one review for 7 movies. Also, I feel many people will not watch these movies due to the bad ratings given to the first movie.If there is one thing that I want to emphasize more than anything, it is this-- do not let the first movie discourage you. If you do, you will be throwing away a chance to watch an amazing anime. I am...guilty of putting off watching the rest of the series because I didn\'t like the first movie. I saw several reviews saying that there was no link whatsoever between the separate movies, and after watching the first movie I was disappointed. ""Where was the much needed character development?"" and, ""Where was the beginning, or even the end of this story?"" I felt like I was thrown into a story that could have been something great, and then kicked out before it reached fruition. I\'m sure thoughts similar to mine will be racing through your head after the first movie. Due to these thoughts, I stopped watching this movie series because I thought each movie would be like this one- an underdeveloped short story attempting to be something original.However, due to some heavenly information received from a trustworthy friend, I decided to pick up where I\'d left off. This was one of the better choices I\'ve made in my life. All that the first movie could and should have been, developed right in front of my eyes. All the character development that such an original story needs, was given to us in creative ways. You get see the story in a different way then most stories are projected. Almost exactly like the star wars movies, the first episode is actually near the end of the story. The second episode is at the beginning, and the last one is the end. Instead of seeing cause and then effect, we see effect, and then cause. For a lot of people this will spice up the story and give a much needed push in the plot. Even if you aren\'t one of these people, I believe everyone should watch series in the traditional sequence. If you don\'t, you won\'t get the full experience that you should get. Also, you\'ll miss some clever scenes that seem random in the beginning, but mean everything in the end.Some people will put off this ""series"" because it\'s a sequence of movies. Don\'t. If you do, you will be making a grave mistake. Honestly, I didn\'t even view this anime as a series of movies. I viewed it as an anime series spanning 21 episodes and 7 arcs- each about 3 episodes long but some up to 6 episodes long. If you view it this way, you will realize that you get everything you get while watching a series- and more. Due to the fact that movies can take up bigger budgets, everything is better. The art, of course, is superb. Kara no Kyoukai has some of best art I\'ve ever seen present in an anime. Only short to \'5 centimeters per second\', any artist will be instantly drawn to this show. On par to the art, is the sound department. Brilliantly dramatic, the sound is just what these movies need to give them that extra beefing up that was required to attain a 10. Due to the fact that you will be on the edge of your seat for most of the eight and a half hours, music will not be given much recognition. However, even if you don\'t notice it, the music is playing a big part. Due to a broken link, I had to watch a whole movie with no sound. To say the least- this was my least favorite movie of them all.Even though a lot of what this series has to deal with is suicide and murder, many of us will be able to relate and feel for the characters in this story. Most of these principles are down scaled, and play an important role in part of our everyday lives. Kara no Kyoukai is an anime that many people will be able to relate with, which is what you want in any story. Few will regret watching six movies to be able to experience what the last movie gives you. If nothing else, please watch the seventh movie, because it really is something else. guilty of putting off watching the rest of the series because I didn\'t like the first movie.

If nothing else, please watch the seventh movie, because it really is something else.', ""I've been feeling so disappointed in anime lately: lame plots, predictability, standard art styles, the loss of that uniquely Japanese flair to the art of  storytelling and visual art. Lately it feels like no one is pushing the envelope any more and the truly great stories are coming fewer and farther in between. Luckily, I came across this series and I was so, so very happy! Kara no Kyokai is a collection of seemingly unrelated stories of varying lengths told in a not so sequential order, and even though they are told in this fashion, I would still consider this a series since the...core characters remain the same and the stories are ultimately related. Thus once again my review is for all 7 films + the epilogue.VISUALS: This is top of the line stuff. I watched this in 720p HD and the art was absolutely beautiful. I think what I liked about this series was that it was visually very dark, which matched the overall tone of the story. When a story, whether it be a TV show or film or anime series is dark, it tends to be much more serious...unless it's something by Tim Burton, and then it's comedic. But from the first few moments of watching this, I knew it would be good because it was dark. The buildings looked grimy, the sky was grey or midnight blue sometimes even black as pitch, the street lights and the hallways were dimly illuminated, as a matter of fact, this series was very good at illuminations and the appropriate amount of soft glows, that on scene with the police car driving on the dark road with the lights flashing looked very believable, not cartoonish. It all still remained a work of anime but yet the serious realism of a film, very similar to how Ghost in the Shell pulled it off. If you like anime that has a more serious, mature look and feel then you will enjoy this one.No corners were taken  with the animation either, the fight scenes were all out spectacular and definitely the highlight of the series. Every detail was drawn carefully, movements were very fluid, I especially loved the uses of angles, 360-rotations, perspective, slo-mo and blur effects. Whenever they flipped and rolled during the fights it was breathtaking, it was like....wow!AUDIO: The music of this series was amazing as well, I think only the 7th series had an OP, the rest did not but the ED themes were really good. However, it was the music of the fight scenes that really stole the show for me. It made the battles even more epic; it was glamorous, it was dramatic, it totally fit the moment and made the fights seem more like a dance of death. There was only the Japanese dub available, I kinda wished there was an English dub for this and they should use the same cast as Ghost in the Shell. If there were an English dub I could enjoy the visuals even more without having to glance at the bottom to read subtitles, but that being said the Japanese dub cast were really good. No one had an annoying voice.STORY: Kara no Kyokai, basically centres this one woman Shiki Ryougi, and her ability to see death...or rather, she can see the lines of death connected to all living things. We see her struggle with her inner demons: conflicting desires, isolation, loneliness, the burden of carrying such a frightening power and it's insatiable desire to kill all things. The story is told non-sequentially, which I thought was absolutely brilliant because we see the action first but then we are also given the reasons why those actions were taken and why the more difficult paths were chosen. The story is also a supernatural mystery, with seemingly random and mysterious murders committed by these truly  psychopathic villains, it's not a traditional mystery where you have to figure out who is the killer, this is more of a mystery where you have some serious doubts about the protagonist, Shiki, and her mental state; Is she a killer or not? I really enjoy this aspect because it adds another layer [a psychological one]to the already greatness of this series, so now you can enjoy this series visually, emotionally and intellectually.CHARACTERS: The central cast of characters for this series is a small one but the dynamics between each of them is brilliant. We have Shiki, the main character, strong, quiet, conflicted and very deadly. We have Mikiya Kokutou, the male lead character, he's very smart, kind and compassionate, not overbearingly masculine but yet provides a very strong and supportive role for Shiki. He's willing to have her take the lead on many things because he is all to aware of how much of a regular human he is, he doesn't try to get in the way to prove how special and heroic he can be and that makes him all the more special. He knows his strengths, his intelligence, and he applies that through his investigative research which is invaluable to the team. He also has another secondary and extremely redeemable quality, which is the fact that he is the team's moral compass, the only one not willing to just kill someone and skip off into the sunset happy or with indifference.And then we have Aozaki Touko, the boss-lady, the leader of the trio and also somewhat surrogate mother for both Shiki and Mikiya. Aozaki is the very relaxed, chilled out brains behind the operation. Very shrewd and very well connected, she has her fingers in everything and every project. She can figure things out very quickly and anticipate their outcomes [very similar to myself—not to brag or anything]. But for all that smartness, she can be pretty lax and irresponsible at times [such as impulse buys and then forgetting to pay her employees], she also has some maternal qualities always looking out for [and patching up] both Shiki and Mikiya.There are some nice supporting cast as well who fulfilled their roles nicely and all the crazy villains who each had their own stories and individual suffering which made it all very credible even if they were flying 20 feet in the air. The only character, I didn't care too much for was Azaka, Mikiya's younger sister, who didn't fit the overall dark and serious tone of the series. She was a bit too high-strung and comedic for my taste...and the semi-incest thing doesn't fit. It felt contrived and thrown in for some kind of “moe” factor. If she were more serious I would have liked her, but as it stands her role wasn't very vital and I'm glad her appearance was very limited.VERDICT: Watch it! For all the bitching and moaning I do about the downgrading of anime lately, this is a beacon of hope to remind us not all anime is goofy, chibi-humour, slapstick, predictable, magic mecha, testosterone-rage shounen or high-school fluff. There is life and action outside of a high-school setting, it can be exciting, it can be serious and most importantly it can still be “adult-themed” and not be hentai. core characters remain the same and the stories are ultimately related.

Because it isn’t Fate/Zero that’s why!Jokes aside, Garden of Sinners offers high production quality in all aspects. The story is interesting as it loosely follows ideas and re-written philosophy based on something basic. As much as I despise some works that follow this structure, Garden of Sinners was the one that I could easily go back into for something that it isn’t, and that is what makes it an interesting production.As the series is divided into seven novels, I’m going to write a...script for each and every one of them.2) Section 2: Story & Presentation2.1) Visual Presentation:The novel stories are divided into seven arcs, and each arc consists of a movie, now. They’re structured differently as they tell the story out of order, thus on your first viewing you maybe very confused about what’s going on. The writing follows a very basic and standardized formula. Exposition, visual presentation and narration, outcome, credits roll and epilogue.And by doing so the movie makes the viewer think about what’s the real meaning behind the actions given in the movie. But the main problem is that just like some other Light Novel Adaptations, it’ll tell you everything you need to know by the end of the film in a very abstract and nonsensical to the common viewer way. This way of story telling ruins the experience for someone looking for a relatively dark and a semi-thought-provoking series, knowing that’s a given to the presentation, you may ask: “Well then, how will that affect my over all opinion if I’m looking for something to make me think a lot?” And I’ll answer: “The story is a mere basic concept of something little trying to be something big.” But that’s enough about the Visual Presentation.2.2) Story Presentation:Story-wise the first Garden of Sinners movie is alright, the movie is paced fairly well. It holds up relatively well compared to other works that need a whole 3-6 episodes to get their point across. The mysterious murders going on during this movie are just a shell of something bigger, something unexpected. As it slowly turns from a dull mystery to human philosophy, this is something that made caught my interest the when I had first watched it, keeping the tension and its intrigue. While at the same time not it’s nothing out of the ordinary. The concept of “floating” and “flying” depicting a persons ability to be free and be chained down, restricted by the boundaries which the movie establishes, foreshadowing major events throughout not only this, and the sequel series as well. This simple complexity makes the show entertaining to watch and think about, while at the same time it makes you think about how pointless it can boil down to. As I stated above, while it is intriguing, it doesn’t manage to make you care for what’s going on because the characters themselves are like empty shells, all the complexity they have is restricted to interpreting events through their own way and even, make fun of it. Mikiya, our protagonist also finds the events in the movie silly, as he states: “That sounds like something out of a cheap novel.”  When he is informed about the events, making him as down to earth and humane as possible so we can understand at least one part of the movie.3) Characters & Script/Direction3.1) Characters:Like I mentioned above, the main character is by far the only relatable character in the series, why? Because he’s as close to being a human being and alive than any of the characters shown throughout the movie, he questions the events that happen, tries to act normal and gives the idea for being plain and boring. But exactly that was the thing the show needed, a character who doesn’t know what the heck is going on during his absence or during an event that occurs. His acknowledgement makes him us the viewer, relatable and understandable. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the rest. Touko and Shiki, our main heroines of the movie always act abstract derived from any sort of emotion or expression. (Well, for the most part.) And because of this they seem like aliens that are speaking in another language. This minor fact makes the story hard to follow as you’ll mostly be guessing what they mean through the end events when the movie is revealing everything to us.3.2) Script & DirectionNow, if you’ve seen the other stuff Nasu has written (Fate/Stay Night, Tsukihime, co-wrote Fate/Zero and some others) you’ll know that his style of writing is not ordinary he gives out the ideas for the viewer to add the rest of the core elements to them. So, as he’s writing something basic, we find it much more symbolic and unnecessarily philosophic exposition and it only gets worse and worse, as you continue to fill in the gaps for his mistakes, more pop up and thanks to this it’s very hard to follow what he meant and what we think. Simply because, it’s convoluted and requires you to find empty “ideas” as interesting, if you’ve seen any of his other works you’ll also notice a lot of the ideas presented here (philosophy character ideals and morals etc.) are copy and pasted. You could say then that’ll be easier for others to find it interesting as they probably liked the author’s other works so this one will also be on their list. However, I find it lacking and tame, as it really dries out without having any creativity left for this series, it leaves me wanting more which I’ll never get.Directing is superb, the tension is there and there aren’t any unnecessary info dumps that make you feel dissatisfied. Because of this, I could get over some of the dull moments.4) Art Design, Character Design, Animation4.1) Art Design & AnimationThe backgrounds are extremely detailed, they’re very well polished and contrast well with the emptiness that the world is, and it’s worth some wallpapers if you can catch the right moment, I personally think that “The Garden of Sinners” is by far Ufotable’s most gorgeous work, the transition between scenes is also excellent.Animation-wise it’s probably their best budgeted work, aside from a few frame skipping moments, the animation is stunning, and there aren’t that much special effects covering the screen, and when they are, they don’t get in the way of the action so you can see the choreography pitch perfect. However, this cannot entirely save the overall production from being what it is, the action scenes are short while most of the animation is basic and isn’t something spectacular or eye catching. Thus being nothing more than solid.If Ufotable animated an action show with the same quality animation (No Fate/Zero, nor Night) things would get really fun.4.2) Character DesignThe character designs are okay, they look like every other anime character and offer almost no variety, again, their designs are also taken from Nasu’s other work “Shingetsutan Tsukihime” and if you compare them, they really look identical…5) Enjoyment. Music & Overall ScoreEnjoyment-wise it was fun, but I wouldn’t recommend it to basic anime fans, the script, presentation aren’t meant to be viewed casually, so I highly suggest you try to focus and write your own story with the help of this.Music is either good or average I personally like 2 tracks out of the ones that played the opening and the insert one during the fight, well… at least half of it.Overall, I think that The Garden of Sinners is a must see to at least get a gist of what great ideas can actually make a great philosophy, but I wouldn’t want you to think too hard, as it may rot your brain. script for each and every one of them.2) Section 2: Story & Presentation2.1) Visual Presentation:The novel stories are divided into seven arcs, and each arc consists of a movie, now. They’re structured differently as they tell the story out of order, thus on your first viewing you maybe very confused about what’s going on. The writing follows a very basic and standardized formula. Exposition, visual presentation and narration, outcome, credits roll and epilogue.And by doing so the movie makes the viewer think about what’s the real meaning behind the actions given in the movie.

Reviewing them individually would result in quite a bit of repetition, so I believe one overarching review should suffice.  I will keep this review spoiler free, but it assumes you understand the premise for the story.Story - 6/10Kara no Kyoukai follows the lives and actions of those surrounding the mysterious Ryougi Shiki, a girl with...eyes that can see the ""seams"" of the of world, and her friends Mikiya and Toukou. The episodes/movies are generally done in a ""one arch per episode"" format, but recurring characters\' plots tie them together. What makes this different from most anime of this type is that it is told almost completely out of chronological order. This can make things a bit confusing during the first watch, especially if you are used to anime that slowly reveal the characters and plot points to you. You are thrown headfirst into the world, and it is a bit hard to wrap your head around at the beginning. Once you know what is going on, there will still be enough twists to keep you on your toes.Peel back the strange style, however, and you will find a relatively average story. There are a bunch of bad guys who the good guys have to get rid of. It is, at its core, a monster of the week show. Due to the confusing style covering a not-particularly-special story, I have to give this a ""passable"" 6/10.Animation - 9/10One would be hard pressed to find a better looking series. The character models are beautifully detailed and colored, and care is used in the backgrounds. The action scenes are very fluid. Nothing to complain about here.Sound - 6/10The soundtrack was nothing special, but it fit the scenes well. I never have much to say about sound unless it was outstanding or abysmal.Character - 8/10It is difficult to get into this without spoiling the show, but I can assure you that the majority of the characters and the entirety of the main cast is well developed. Even the side/episodic characters are generally well developed, and a motivation for their actions is explored. The relationship between Shiki and Mikiya is developed throughout the series, and comes to a somewhat meaningful end. While most of the characters are simply adequate, Shiki has an incredibly deep level of characterization which spans the length of the series.Enjoyment - 7/10Each person will have their ups and downs in the series, with some episodes\' stories varying widely in depth and darkness. I would recommend watching at least two other episodes/movies if the first doesn\'t agree with you.I was never bored in this series (with the exception of the epilogue episode). There is plenty of plot to keep the action scenes tied together intelligently (for the most part), and enough action to keep that type satisfied. My enjoyment was somewhat brought down by the release style mentioned in the story section, but I was hooked and could not stop watching to see things tied together.Other ThoughtsThis story contains intense violence very often, occasional sexual themes, and many scenes and themes some may find disturbing. I would strongly recommend avoiding this show if you can\'t handle this sort of thing. I use Elfen Lied as a standard for violence as many have seen it (leaving all else on that show aside), and this is on a totally different level. It is somewhat amplified by the great animation, making it all the more graphic. eyes that can see the ""seams"" of the of world, and her friends Mikiya and Toukou.

But, I'm sure they will enjoyed the story that supported with awesome story, art, voices, also the character plot that made them couldn't be waiting the next sequel...!!I saw Shiki as the main character that played by Sakamoto Maaya very outstanding. That's cool! Also Kokuto Mikiya that played by Suzumura Kenichi, very handsome and do the job great!!I'm very recommended this anime and I'm sure that this anime will...be the most anticipated anime in 2008!!! be the most anticipated anime in 2008!!!"", 'This is part 1 of the KnK seriesAfter watching one of Type-Moon/ ufotable\'s best anime of 2012(F/Z)and 2015(UBW), I decided to go back in time to check their (potentially) best work of 2007. I haven\'t read the novels of KnK so I\'m watching the movie series with no knowledge of the KnK series whatsoever. So far, I\'m not disappointed but it\'s too early to judge the series.(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS)Please take my story rating with a grain of salt. It does not reflect with I how feel about this movie. It\'s just my first impression of the story...introduced to me.In the city where Shiki lives, something triggers a spate of mysterious schoolgirl suicides. The connection between the girls who\'ve leapt to their deaths is unclear, although all of them have jumped from the Fujou Building, a skyscraper scheduled to be demolished.The first movie showed us that there\'s a bunch of schoolgirls jumping off the soon-to-be demolished building and killing themselves for no reason. Then there\'s a bunch of creepy ghost girls floating around at the top of the building where the girls committed suicide. At this point, you\'re probably asking yourself ""what the hell is going on"" like I did. Since this is the first movie and there\'s 6 more to go, I\'m not really going to complain about the story that much and the amount of plot holes this movie has created. I\'m pretty sure I\'ll understand once I watched the rest.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (10/10)For a 2007 movie, the animation is very well done. The character design looks beautiful, the lighting is great, the fighting scenes are so fluid, and the atmosphere fits perfectly as this movie has a dark story. Nice job for ufotable.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (9/10)As expected of Type-moon and ufotable, they make one of the best soundtracks for their anime. Their F/Z soundtrack is great, their UBW soundtrack is great and the KnK\'s soundtrack; so far is great. The soundtrack used in the fighting scenes fits so perfectly well. Especially those goddamn choir in the background. There are no OP theme songs and there\'s 1 ED theme song. It\'s sung by Kalafina so it\'s immediately a perfect song for me. The voice actors have done a great job so far with their characters.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Character]: (8/10)I don\'t know these characters that much yet so don\'t hate me for getting some of these characters wrong. The movie introduces us to Shiki, a female knife-wielding person who lives alone on her small apartment. She has a prosthetic arm that looks like a real human arm and a magic eye that I have no idea what it\'s used for yet. Then there\'s Mikiya, a man that we know nothing about that much. He occasionally visits Shiki\'s apartment, probably because they\'re friends or a couple. I don\'t exactly know yet. Finally, there\'s Touko, a red-haired girl who I don\'t know that much yet.Basically, the movie introduces the characters like you already know them. There\'s no character development and no real reason why I should care for them. No problem, I\'m sure I\'ll get to know more about the characters in the sequels.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (8/10)I personally enjoyed the first movie because of that one action scene, the perfect animation, the great soundtrack and how the series introduces itself. I\'m sure I\'ll enjoy KnK series even more after I see the rest of the movie.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[OVERALL]: (8.4/10)So far, I think this movie is great. There\'s a lot of talking which I\'m used to when watching Typemoon/ufotable\'s anime. I\'m also very confused but I\'m sure I\'ll get a grasp of what\'s going on as I watch the rest of the movies. If you\'re a fan of supernatural or mystery animes then this is a must watch for you. Just like any other ufotable\'s anime, you need to be actively thinking about the plot or else you\'re going to miss some important information.

After all, this is the first movie of the anime, so its normal to have questions about it. But my first impression is that the series have pottential and i consider the story interesting.9.Art (10.0) - My first impression was the the visuals are a great aspect in this movie. Background, light/shadow, envyronment, characther designs and animations, well, its all great...i dont remember to see much better than this. so a 10 in here is well deserved in my opinion.Sound (8.8) - In first movie i got the idea that it fits very well , and i...liked it. 9.Characthers (8.0) - Characters look great for sure, and have some nice abillities. However, in this 1st movie they are not much develloped.Something i expect to be changed in the next movies.Enjoyment (8.8) - It has action, mystery, suspense, a bit of everything. The plot seem interesting and its a fine way to spend some time. Somehow, theres something missing in my opinion, something that would make it special. anyway, its a well deserved 9.overall (9.3) - A very high 9 on this one.

Well, Kara no Kyoukai certainly can.This is one of those anime that put you in a middle of an unknown story and makes you sit through 50 minutes of dialogues without knowing what is going on. Some people like this, some people hate, but it can be okay as long as you get ANYTHING else from the anime to make you want to watch. It can be anything, but when:- You don\'t get anything about the characters, their past, personality. Literally nothing,...it feels like watching some random people talk for 50 minutes about stuff you don\'t know nothing about, but even worse, about what you don\'t care.- Dialogues are vague, are not smart, are not deep (they try to sound deep but they are not for me at the least).- There is pretty much no action  at all, and when you do get some of it it is badly animated, not exciting- Blood and gore is not properly matched to the reality, for example a girl committed a suicide by jumping out of the building, but she is massacred and covered in blood as if someone blew her up with a shotgun- Music is decent, but it feels not properly matched to what is going on (on top of that remember, that you don\'t know what is going on)- The episode does not finish with any cliffhanger nor shows any possibility of story development. Sure, I don\'t expect corny cliffhangers but when I just sat through 50 minutes of ""I don\'t know whats going on"" and then they finish me with ""Ok, it is done"" then please, I want to know who made this anime and I will never watch your stuff again in my life.TO SUM UP: If you want to watch this anime, at the least prepare to invest 50 minutes of your time after which you won\'t know nothing, you won\'t feel nothing and you won\'t enjoy nor action nor dialogues. I dropped this after 1 episode and it is not because I only like easy and corny shonen anime, but because I really got nothing out of my 50 minutes so how can anyone expect me to go and invest more? it feels like watching some random people talk for 50 minutes about stuff you don\'t know nothing about, but even worse, about what you don\'t care.- Dialogues are vague, are not smart, are not deep (they try to sound deep but they are not for me at the least).- There is pretty much no action  at all, and when you do get some of it it is badly animated, not exciting- Blood and gore is not properly matched to the reality, for example a girl committed a suicide by jumping out of the building, but she is massacred and covered in blood as if someone blew her up with a shotgun- Music is decent, but it feels not properly matched to what is going on (on top of that remember, that you don\'t know what is going on)- The episode does not finish with any cliffhanger nor shows any possibility of story development.

Who are the people there, what is their relationship? What is the point?

Even an ordinary landscape looks beautiful. But a vision that\'s too large creates a boundary between you and the world...."" I spent a long time thinking about lines like this one.Aside from that, which is the most important thing...for me, you know deep thoughts, well aside from that you are gonna love the characters. Well on character at least. Shiki...she\'s so cool, really reminds me Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell, by appearance and even by behavior etc.The art was beautiful as well, kinda dark and creepy though. However that how it\'s supposed to be after all. There was also one action scene, kinda epic...hah well everything with music by Yuki Kajiura and Kalafina girls is epic.That another awesome thing, the music here. Some of the songs became legends and every Kalafina fan knows them.So I won\'t make it too long. If you like dark and serious anime with some stuff to think about, this one is for you. And don\'t worry if you\'re confused after finishing this. I have seen the second movie today and everything is much clearer know, I guess after the rest it will be alright. for me, you know deep thoughts, well aside from that you are gonna love the characters.

I have seen the second movie today and everything is much clearer know, I guess after the rest it will be alright.', ""This review is based on all the movies of Kara no Kyoukai.It is possible to contain the urge to kill ?First moment: Ryougi Shiki is a beautiful young woman that shortly woke from a coma. With her confused memories, she feels a deep emptiness, as if something had died in itself, doing it with it closed itself. Upon awakening, Shiki discovers that she now has a supernatural ability called ' Mystic Eyes of Death perception ' that makes her look the' line of death of all things '. Joining his great fighting ability and this supernatural ability, Shiki works as an investigator of paranormal cases...and murders, since your eyes knows exactly where to cut an opponent and immobilize him, which costs a spirit to exorcise it and a magical barrier to disable it. At his side, always supporting her, there is your devoted friend, Mikiya and Touko Kokutou, a sorceress investigating paranormal events and exorcist.Second Moment: Ryougi Shiki is a different teenager. She has something like two personalities. One, the Ying side ' Shiki ',  is a serious quiet and reserved girl. The other, ' SHIKI ', the Yang side, is talkative, outgoing and ... killer. Yes, this personality is attracted by death, blood, and have a deep desire to kill. However, his lone rigorous training routine is broken by Kokutou Mikiya, a young man who insists on being her friend.How this teen dual personality becomes this empty, cold and possessing an uncanny ability woman? What happened to Shiki in the meantime? What are these paranormal cases they are investigating? Well, i present to you this work of art called Kara no Kyoukai.Is fucking hard to talk about this anime, especially without giving (a lot) of spoiler. Sorry guys, but it is impossible for any review to explain everything that is Kara no Kyoukai. So instead try to explain it (and fail) i'll give some tips and precautions before you watch the series.1 - Kara no Kyoukai is nothing chronological. There are 7 movies ever released, only that each film has a different time. So, the first movie shows Shiki as a adult and the second is when it is still a teenager. So, when watching the first movie, you're thinking ' dude, what the fuck was that? '. This is normal, the plot will make sense over time, but in the beginning you will float away. Some people prefer to watch in chronological order, which will make you stay a bit lost, but the two orders make sense, nothing hinders the end.For those who want to watch in chronological order: Movie 2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7.2 - Kara no Kyoukai has a difficult story to understand... and does not care to explain.Complicated dialogues, paranormal abilities, many details and different tips that connect a movie on the other. And even with all that, KnK does not bother to give you all the answers, leaving your account by connecting the dots. Attention turns to anime characters, to show people with troubled minds, frustrated dreams, desires, fears ... and how good these people deal with their supernatural powers and their consequences. So KnK requires a lot of attention.3 - Kara no Kyoukai is a heavy anime. If you want a typical or an anime with cute things, let KnK aside. Here you will see rape members of people being twisted as it screws, shredded people and a lot of blood. This is an adult anime, that addresses complex issues and heavy, but well quality drama.4 - Kara no Kyoukai is synonymous with quality. Kara no Kyoukai is the eldest son of the love triangle ' work of Type -moon Ufotable + studio + band Kalafina '. Anyone who has watched FateZero knows that this trio is quality assurance. Oh, and did you know that Kalafina band was formed because of KnK ? Yes, Yuki Kajiura Vocal formed the band to do the soundtrack of the film 1, and the band responsible for the soundtrack of every film. So expect a visually beautiful anime, with a plot that balances the supernatural and reality and a wonderful soundtrack.Now, the characters. The focus is on three main characters. Touko, a mature and irresponsible, sexy, loose and great sorceress wife. Kokutou, partner and friend of Shiki, is the example of the 'boring' guy. But he's the only one able to contain all the killer instinct of Shiki. Not to mention his dedication to her.And finally, Ryougi Shiki. Is rare to produce a character with such a complex subjectivity as in Kara no Kyoukai. Shiki addition to dealing with the duality of his dual personality, is a deadly killer while it's human. We follow her at various times of his life dealing with many dilemmas , dualities and trauma during the storyline. When confronted with different people , she thinks , she feels , she turns. So when you think you got used to it, it cuts in half your expectations . I confess: i love this character.Not to mention that even being a skilled assassin with his knife, Shiki will face more powerful people than her. But she's going to win the latest consequences for facing any challenge ahead.Ah, the end of the last film for me is perfection in the form of anime.But I reiterate: Kara no Kyoukai is not an anime for children, but it's an anime for those seeking more than a simple drawing. Take care to see it , otherwise it will be a stab in your mind and in your stomach. Shiki will make you bleed. and murders, since your eyes knows exactly where to cut an opponent and immobilize him, which costs a spirit to exorcise it and a magical barrier to disable it.

Shiki will make you bleed."", 'Based on some of the first published, literary attempts of Kinoko Nasu, later of Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night fame, Kara no Kyoukai already contains many of the traits he would later streamline and perfect for a wider audience, such as the tough female heroine, the sadomasochistic undertones, the complex and rich background always only subtly hinted at, the long and intense fights, the melancholy air and tragic outcomes, and the peculiar borrowing of techniques from literary modernism. What his later works lack is the sort of daring and ruthlessness most commonly seen in young, still unaccomplished writers: In a recent interview he admitted that the...novel had partly been meant as a prank. Self-printed in a copy shop and sold at a comics convention, Kara no Kyoukai, despite containing anime illustration and tropes, throws the reader into the middle of the story, only returning much later to explain even the most basic things about the characters. It\'s also written in a very old-fashioned style that even gives many Japanese native speakers a lot of trouble. Though cutting back on a particularly nonsensical discussion on heights, this movie adaption mostly stays true to his youthful spirit. So why does it work so well?It\'s in the heat of summer and for mysterious reasons high school girls are frequently throwing themselves off an old, abandoned skyscraper during night in modern Tokyo. Shiki Ryougi becomes curious, a girl who can see ""death lines"" that allow her to kill anything having them as long as she traces the lines, even with her fingernail, and who wears a leather jacket over an anachronistic kimono. The cause of the suicides, unsurprisingly, is partly paranormal. What makes Kara no Kyoukai different from most other horror/mystery animes though, is the way it is told. The characters speculate in a strange, almost technical, philosophical-sounding manner about the causes of the phenomenons and a lot is left ambiguous and unclear. As said earlier, no mercy is given to the viewer in terms of the more earthly sides of the plot either. The characters have known each other for years and have no reason to discuss their own relationships in depth. The only thing, strangely, the anime doesn\'t hold back on are the small, little things in life. Like the endless singing of the cicada, the ambiance of an abandoned building, the melancholy of an evening walk, or something as specific and mundane as having Häagen-Dazs ice cream in the middle of the night. Beautifully animated with a cinematography sometimes reminiscent of arthouse films, Kara no Kyoukai side-steps all your anime intuitions and makes you believe in this reality first of all and more than anything else. And when the supernatural finally does take center stage at some point and Yuki Kajiura\'s amazing, ethereal music comes on, it feels almost like you\'re experiencing it in your living room. If you\'re the kind of person who likes to know what they are coming to, having a nicely packaged, classifiable, well-done fill of anime, you\'re probably in for some discomfort. For others though, Kara no Kyoukai 1 does what all beginnings strive for: It makes you desperately yearn to get to know more about this strange, mysterious yet believable world and its characters.

No more, no less.', ""The Kara no Kyoukai or Garden of Sinners films are difficult to review. The reason for this is one their own the stories can be difficult to appreciate but as a whole they are fantastic and a lot easier to review.At the centre of it all is Shiki, a loner of a teenage girl with homicidal urges who wears only kimonos. I would love to alk more about Shiki because she is a fascinating character but that is more for Kara no Kyoukai 2.In Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fuken Fuukei Shiki investigates a series of apparent suicides where teenage girls have been jumping of the...same abandoned building, however, Shiki believes there is more to the suicides than meets the eye and something or someone sinister is making the girls jump.Like I said before Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei struggles to stand up on its own mainly because although the story is good it isn't great. What save it are the characters, beautiful and detailed animation and the haunting music.Another problem with Kara Kyoukai is that the series is not in chronological order so if Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei does not draw you into Shiki's world you are probably not watch the rest of the series. Which would be a shame because the best is yet to come. same abandoned building, however, Shiki believes there is more to the suicides than meets the eye and something or someone sinister is making the girls jump.Like I said before Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei struggles to stand up on its own mainly because although the story is good it isn't great.

Which would be a shame because the best is yet to come."", 'So i finally decided to watch the kara no kyoukai movies. They seemed fairly popular and I’ve had good experience from the anime movies I’ve seen so far. Well apart from bleach and naruto movies, they are just bad.[6]Story:  So the story is about this girl called Shiki and this guy called Mikiya. We also got a character called Touko that’s the boss of the detective firm that the other two works at. These three are our main characters. So, strange suicides begin in the city they live in and Mikiya falls mysteriously ill. Shiki then sees a girl take her life, and...realizes there is a connection between the suicides and now tries to stop whatever is causing them. To be honest, the story is fucked up. You don’t get an explanation to anything really and on top of that it’s a pretty boring watch overall. I got loads of things I wanted to know more about, but in the end none of my questions were answered. Perhaps it would have been better had the movie been longer, because 50 minutes is way too little time. There are some good scenes though, and sure, this could server well as an introduction to the series, because there are like 5 (?) movies left for me to watch. The only way I can say that the story was good is if I see it this way, that it was an introduction to the series.[9]Art: Probably the best thing about this movie. The art was very good and the animation fluently. I especially liked the backgrounds and all they really matched the feel of the movie. The coloring was also good, it was always this “dark” tone in every scene, which I think fit perfectly. Really I was drooling at the backgrounds..[7]Sound: The sound was pretty good, but nothing outstanding. The thing I liked the most was the ending theme, which I now have on my Ipod.  Sometimes I would notice the background music, and sometimes I wouldn’t think about it at all. All in all, it was decent. As for the voice acting it was ok, but you’ll notice it isn’t exactly Hirano Aya or Fukuyama Jun doing it if you get what I mean. But yea, The voice actors dont really get any time to show what they can do as the movie is rather short and isnt exactly packed with good ""talking"" scenes.[6]Characters: The characters were really bad, really really bad. To me the characters are perhaps the most important thing in an anime, and if you have good characters you can get a good story just out of that really. But here we are presented to our three main characters, and throughout the movie we don’t get to know much about them, and because we don’t get to know them, there cant be any character development either. Also there is a lack of side characters, and because of this the world feels a bit empty. Again this may be due to the fact that the movie is only 50 minutes long, and again I’ll be forgiving since this is the first movie in the series. But still![6]Enjoyment: The enjoyment score is an important one, because that’s why I watch, I want to be entertained. As I said the movie is lacking in many aspects and its kind of boring, but it left me wanting to watch the other movies, because I wanted to know more about the characters. I really think the characters can be interesting, if the other movies explore them unlike this one. As I said I think that some scenes were good, and I loved the art/animation. All in all it managed to entertain me quiet a bit, mostly because of the eerie feeling it gave off, but it wasn’t enough to get the score very high.i was wavering between a 5 and a 6, but in the end I decided to go with a 6.  All in all I give the movie a 7 with the hope that the other movies will be better.Thank you for reading. realizes there is a connection between the suicides and now tries to stop whatever is causing them.

I have seen other reviews which state this is the first of seven movies in the series. So maybe this classed as just the prologue? Because I feel like there wasn't much given away...explainations below.ArtBut before I tell you about that we have art. The art was very nice in this anime...and I doubt you will be dissapointed. There was always alot going on in the background and the characters and scenary was well drawn.SoundThe sound wasn't much worse than the art it has nice BGM and a good atmosphere through out the movie regarding music.CharacterOkay back to my confusion. After watching this I don't feel like I know much of anything about the characters nor what happened to them or where they came from etc etc all the works. The main character doesnt seem to be human and seems quite uptight...but has a soft side to her...even at that I'm just guessing...sorry but I could only give this a 6.EnjoymentOkay this was quite enjoyable but what let is down was that I was glued to the seat wanting to know more...and that time never came. As a standalone this would've got a 4-6 rating here but because I found out it's the first of 7 movies. I gave it a 7, under the condition that I will find out the answers I'm looking for in sequals. It wasn't treated as a cliff hanger...just unfinished. It's fustrating not knowing what exactly happened or who people are and how they can do certain things.OverallI'm not entirely sure about this like I've said before but giving a guesstimated average on story art sound character and enjoyment...congraulations kara no kyoukai...a 7 out of 10 overall for confusing me =] and I doubt you will be dissapointed.

First I would like to say that I have no past experience with any product of The Garden of Sinner series, and this review is based off of this movie with no knowledge to anything else. First off to people who don\'t like such things, this is a strange and abstract way of storytelling, and apparently the rest of the series follows a similar style. You will spend time not knowing anything about what is going on in the story, besides the plot points that are...introduced to the characters at the same time they are to you, and even at the end you won\'t know anything about the characters. One more thing worthy of mentioning, I don\'t know about the whole series, but this movie isn\'t on the action or fantasy side, and only has a little romance development at the end, and for the most part was a Supernatural/Horror movie.The story in Fukan Fuukei revolves around a mysterious strings of suicides by jumping, with all of the victims being high school students. On the surface besides where they jumped, the deaths are unconnected and will probably always be seen as such. As you like as you don\'t mind it\'s strange way of telling things, the story presented in the first movie is actually quite good. It present great ideas, an intriguing plot mixed in with a nice sense of Horror, Supernatural, and Mystery (or maybe just because they don\'t tell you much about what the hell\'s going on). The idea of why people commit suicide was actually quite interesting, as is the other psychological styled ideas presented in the story, the majority of which came from Touko Aozaki, with some also being presented by another main character Mikyia Kokuto. The plot moves at a nice pace, it always remains interesting (at least once we get to the actual building where they committed suicide) and provides a good outcome to the story, though if anything, can be a bit confusing to understand the criminal behind it all, and at first left me with a ""what the hell\'s going on?"" type of thing. It\'s nothing amazing, but it does a surprisingly good job of telling it\'s story.The art in the movie, is stunning. The backgrounds, details, character designs, everything in Fuukei is done with gorgeous art. It\'s also to note that it looks brilliant especially during the Horror/Supernatural scenes of the show, for instance watching a person\'s body after committing suicide has never looked as good as it does in Fuukei. Everything runs pretty smooth, and there aren\'t any drops in quality that are noticeable throught the series. I\'m not an expert on Anime, though I\'m trying to work up to being one, but this currently ranks among the best looking Animes I\'ve ever seen.The sound of Fuukei is done very well, though not as extravagant as the visuals. There\'s nothing extremely complex or beautiful to it, it\'s just all the fitting themes at all the right times, and it adds to the movie well, as music should do for a movie. All the voice actors used in the show fit their characters well and are pretty good, though it didn\'t offer any memorable moments, it didn\'t need to either. The voice acting was also done well, and added to the show.I\'m not sure how to rate the characters in this one. The three main characters are actually very interesting, with the main character Shiki Ryougi being particularly mysterious among the three, but the other two also are certainly interesting characters. However the movie offers lacking development as the short fifty minutes focuses upon the plot presented during the story, instead of backgrounds and relationships between the characters. There was a little development of hinted romance at the end, which was great to see, but it did not go much of any where either. The second movie preview at the end looked like it would was completely focused on character development though, so added to the fact that it is part of a series, and the character\'s were interesting, I would say the characters are great characters, ranking about 7.Overall, this is a great movie, with an interesting though confusing plot, breath taking art, and still good though underdeveloped characters. The horror styled parts of it and the psychology like questions asked in the series are particularly interesting, and I would recommend it if you like things like that at all, as Fuukei does it stuff well, and makes the future of the series look very bright as long as the characters get developed more and the plot gets a bit less confusing. introduced to the characters at the same time they are to you, and even at the end you won\'t know anything about the characters.

The idea of why people commit suicide was actually quite interesting, as is the other psychological styled ideas presented in the story, the majority of which came from Touko Aozaki, with some also being presented by another main character Mikyia Kokuto. The plot moves at a nice pace, it always remains interesting (at least once we get to the actual building where they committed suicide) and provides a good outcome to the story, though if anything, can be a bit confusing to understand the criminal behind it all, and at first left me with a ""what the hell\'s going on?"" type of thing. It\'s nothing amazing, but it does a surprisingly good job of telling it\'s story.The art in the movie, is stunning. The backgrounds, details, character designs, everything in Fuukei is done with gorgeous art. It\'s also to note that it looks brilliant especially during the Horror/Supernatural scenes of the show, for instance watching a person\'s body after committing suicide has never looked as good as it does in Fuukei. Everything runs pretty smooth, and there aren\'t any drops in quality that are noticeable throught the series. I\'m not an expert on Anime, though I\'m trying to work up to being one, but this currently ranks among the best looking Animes I\'ve ever seen.The sound of Fuukei is done very well, though not as extravagant as the visuals. There\'s nothing extremely complex or beautiful to it, it\'s just all the fitting themes at all the right times, and it adds to the movie well, as music should do for a movie. All the voice actors used in the show fit their characters well and are pretty good, though it didn\'t offer any memorable moments, it didn\'t need to either. The voice acting was also done well, and added to the show.I\'m not sure how to rate the characters in this one. The three main characters are actually very interesting, with the main character Shiki Ryougi being particularly mysterious among the three, but the other two also are certainly interesting characters. However the movie offers lacking development as the short fifty minutes focuses upon the plot presented during the story, instead of backgrounds and relationships between the characters. There was a little development of hinted romance at the end, which was great to see, but it did not go much of any where either. The second movie preview at the end looked like it would was completely focused on character development though, so added to the fact that it is part of a series, and the character\'s were interesting, I would say the characters are great characters, ranking about 7.Overall, this is a great movie, with an interesting though confusing plot, breath taking art, and still good though underdeveloped characters. The horror styled parts of it and the psychology like questions asked in the series are particularly interesting, and I would recommend it if you like things like that at all, as Fuukei does it stuff well, and makes the future of the series look very bright as long as the characters get developed more and the plot gets a bit less confusing.', ""Kara no Pacing, more like.The major plot points are thrown at the viewer one after the other without  proper lead ins or follow-up. Each scene change is accompanied by a new development in the plot which was jarring to me. The main character has personalities and traits introduced and then thrown away a scene later, or used in ridiculous ways.My impression on the soundtrack was that the artists were trying to get an eerie piece to trick you into feeling some kind of emotion during this pounded together 10 piece jigsaw puzzle. A cheap imitation of better works like in the Ghost in the...Shell soundtrack with traditional vocals and a synth.This was a real reminder as to why hard work pays off, as it's very obvious this studio didn't put any effort into Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei.

KnK differs from most anime in that1)\tThe core series is broken down into 7 films rather than 20+ easy-to-swallow episodes.2)\tEach film has a different director3)\tThe story is told out of sequence, with the chronological order of the films being: 2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 6, & 7.4)\tThe total content of the Knk is less than what you might find in a longer anime series. The first seven core movies (i.e. excluding epilogue and OVAs)...are 507 minutes combined. This is roughly 80% of a regular 25 episode series.Story 7: Watching the KnK animated movie series is like being stuck in an elevator with two other people for a few hours. If you get along with them, then it’s fine but if they annoy you the experience will be unbearable. Likewise, the only characters that get any real attempt at development are the two mains, Shiki and Mikiya, so you’d better like them. Additionally, the non-linear flow of the movies forces the viewer to pay an above average level of attention to the two main characters’ plotlines, especially Shiki’s. You will have to ask yourself, at X point in time, what is going through Shiki’s head? Has she met “X” character yet? Is “Y” character still alive? You get the picture. To complicate matters further, the individual films are not always easy to follow. They tend to use a lot of surreal imagery, cut scenes and flashbacks, while introducing new characters abruptly. I haven’t read the light novels so I don’t know if this is just the narrative style or if the anime had to whittle down lots of backstory and transitions to make everything fit.Characters 7:Mikiya. I’ve seen versions of him in many other anime but this is the worst. I hate Mikiya…even more than Emiya Shirou from Fate/Stay Night. He’s the super trusting, loveable doofus whose endless wellspring of patience and persistence completely destroys the viewer’s suspension of disbelief. Mikiya, the puppy dog boyfriend who even a diehard shoujo fan-girl would want to curb stomp out of irritation. Mikiya, the ever cheerful, ever good natured jackass with a head-to-toe suit of plot armor. A character who consistently gets rewarded for choosing the retarded the path. What saves him from dragging this anime down is that by the 4th film I didn’t really think of him as a real character anymore, and instead, a plot device for Shiki.Shiki: Like Onions and like Shrek, Shiki has layers. To be honest, figuring her out is probably the main conflict in the anime series. Her psyche is certainly very unique and captivating. Throughout the series she does get a fair amount of character development but unfortunately too much of it comes in the form of longwinded expositions. This comes dangerously close to violating the sacred story-telling maxim: “show don’t tell”. Ultimately, I like her character a lot and most of the important questions about her get answered.Art 10: The animation is beautiful. It’s classic ufotable. The movement, faces, scenery, effects are all superbly done. It’s crystal clear and so damn fluid.Sound 8: Some haunting tracks and a good OP.Overall 7: In my opinion, KnK is an ambitious, one-of-a-kind series. Ufotable took a lot of risks with the style and format and I believe they largely succeeded, creating a dark and sometimes creepy anime with a compelling storyline. I do take issue with some of the character development. The 7-movie format and non-linear narrative style caused many key questions regarding Shiki and Mikiya’s relationship and Shiki’s psychological state to get glossed over or simply omitted between films. Often, the viewer is left to make inferences about key plot points in order to bridge the gaps from film to film. The end result is to make two characters who are already hard to empathize with even more difficult to understand.Strengths:-You will have no idea what’s going on at first but slowly the gaps will fill in.-Their use of dates was critical. It was the trail of breadcrumbs that let us follow KnK’s bizarre path through the woods. I realize paying attention to individual months may seem tedious but it is absolutely necessary to follow what’s going on, and KnK is pretty good about keeping the viewer in touch with the timeline.-Films 5 and 7 were the jewels of the series. The 5th film was brilliantly done with an extremely intricate plot, great action and some creepy as fuck scenes.-Older viewers may not find KnK “scary” but KnK left little off the table when it came to its vivid depiction of human depravity. The 5th film was probably the closest thing to anime horror that I’ve seen.-As a mystery-romance-horror series with a little bit of mindfuck, KnK fills a pretty rare niche. I’m reminded of Mirrai Nikki, Elfen Lied and maybe Gosick on crack.Weaknesses:-You will have no idea what’s going on at first but slowly the gaps will fill in.-Characters (Mikiya in particular) will make hopelessly stupid decisions-Longwinded explanations of abstract concepts.-Lack of backstory for many characters- Lack of chemistry (in my opinion) between the two MCs. are 507 minutes combined.

The word awesome is not enough to describe this work of art made by ufotable. This experience will probably be one that I will never forget so long as I live.Great animation as expected, beautiful soundtracks, fantastic story and likable characters where the male protagonist doesn't really seem like a retard. Kara no Kyoukai is the perfect thriller anime for those who seek for the greatest of actions,...drama , mystery and supernatural.I've fallen in love with this movie in a second after just seeing a pixel of its existence. Kara no Kyoukai is great, and honestly it should deserve a lot more attention. Sometimes I don't understand it, sometimes I do. But regardless of my understanding, only one stands true and unwavering from start to end - The fact that it is a masterpiece.P.S. ( to those who are unsure ) If you can pass the first movie then you will enjoy the rest. There's a reason why the score of the first movie is so low whilst the 5th movie is sky-high. Trust me. The first movie is only 50 minutes of your life. Appreciate boredom and you will later on get enjoyment and happiness. :-) ( I know this came from an impatient hypocrite but please trust me on this one - you won't regret it ). drama , mystery and supernatural.I've fallen in love with this movie in a second after just seeing a pixel of its existence.

After watching this movie I still know close to nothing about the series. I understand that there is a deep complex plot based on some novels here but I would still expect at least an intro narration or some other form of back story to kinda help newcomers like me get into the plot. Anyway moving on.Story (7): As I said before the movie offered almost know background information. I could tell that there was a highly complex story going on and what I did get was...very good but it just felt like I was supposed to already know what is going on from the get go. I should not have to read a wikipedia page in order to understand the background after having actually seen the movie. There were a few parts were the story seemed to drone on and other parts where the subplot of the movie did not make sense at all but for the most part the story I did understand was pretty good.Art (10): Let me tell you that this movie has some of the best visual effects I have seen in any Anime. Everything from the expressions on a characters face to the water splashing was amazing (the latter actually made my jaw drop during the fight scene). Some of the character and scenery art was not consistently up to snuff with the level of other character and scenery art but now im being nitpicky. This movie is eye candy.Sound (9): Although it didnt wow me like the art did, the sound was almost flawless in everything from the characters' voices to simple audio effects. The music in particular was perfect for setting the appropriate mood.Character (7): Much like the story I kinda felt like I was already supposed to know all the characters which made it difficult to become attached to them. Kudos to Shiki for wearing a kimono and wielding a katana (technically it was a Tanto or Wakizashi) which is something I havnt seen since Sakura Wars. Still when the main character's hand turns into a puppet's hand making me believe that she is some kind of animated doll halfway through the movie...yeah. Ambiguity aside the characters were engaging enough to make me curious to see what happens to them next so good job.Enjoyment (8): This would have gotten a 7 if it were not for the fight scene. After spending the first part of the movie demanding to know what the heck was going on it was nice to have a spectacular fight scene thrown in to make me forget that I still had no idea how the main character had the ability to kill ghosts but then I didn't care. Even without knowing any back story I enjoyed this movie. very good but it just felt like I was supposed to already know what is going on from the get go.

The anime looks beautiful, the story is horribly lacking, given that this is one, in a series of stories I can only hope that the story will develop with time. Though this being the first of the set it certainly didn't intrigue me enough to want to continue. I found myself pausing numerous times because I just got so bored of watching the lack of story develop.  This is one of those animes that fall along with the same lines as Paprika, in that its beautiful to sit back and watch it, but...don't try understanding anything that's going on, you're only going to give yourself a headache. I do hope the other stories in this set do better with the story line, but I'm not going to hold my breath and judging this as a stand alone story, it doesn't do well. don't try understanding anything that's going on, you're only going to give yourself a headache. I do hope the other stories in this set do better with the story line, but I'm not going to hold my breath and judging this as a stand alone story, it doesn't do well."", ""I have not read the manga therefore I will be reviewing this movie strictly from anime perspective as someone who has only seen the first part of the Kara no Kyoukai story as if it was a completely individual production.The general impression I have after watching this anime is that the great animation tries to make up for the relatively poor storyline.Regarding the story, before watching the movie I was hoping for something more than a typical there are suicides and a ghost cliche. What I was looking for was some moral or philosophical truth which I could understand only after watching the full movie...and putting all the pieces together as if it was a jigsaw.Unfortunately, although that slight amount of moral thought is present throughout the movie, after the very first coversation between two of main chracters it becomes so straight forward that the next twenty, or so, minutes of the movie should be cut down to no more than five, since they do not stimulate one's mind to think even in the slightest.The greater picture of the movie and the message it was suppose to sent was literally served to me on a plate half way through, therefor causing the movie to be an inengaing yawner for at least one third of it.That's pretty much it about the greater picture, which is dissapointing becuase the way it is being shown ruins a pretty damn good idea.When it comes to the suicides on which the story was supposed to develop I had a feeling that I have seen all of it before. But still it could have been quite intriguing if the suicide story want in pair with the developments of the moral background of the movie. This practically does not occur, the moral aspects to why is everything happening seem to develop in a very loose relation to the suicides and entity related to it.I did not expect to see a state of art story, yet this movie, did not use the potential it had even in the slightly, leaving me with a generally avarage, barely engaging story.Another thing that actually I couldn't connect with were the characters. In the movie we actually have three that play any part in the story. That would be Touko, Shiki and the menace responsibile for the suicides.Individually the characters don't seem too bad. Tokuo is especially intriguing, it is evident that she hold a few secrets, which will be revealed later on in the following movies. The 'ghost' is somehow typical but somehow I really felt sorry for what it had been through. Shiki is a different pair of boots, like to story she has potential, which is simply not used properly, let's hope that is the case only of the first movie.Shiki has powers, of which originins we have no clue. She seems to be deeply frustrated by something, possibly from her past, but once again we have no clue what it is. You can actually call her a big question mark with ass-kicking abbilities. I don't find this method of character development appealing at all. Instead of being shown a billion question at the same time and not providing any answers, I'd rather get a few in the begining, have some of them asnwered and then receive a new bunch. Here, I barely got a single answered about Shiki, therefore in my eyes she did not develop as I have expected and due to this state of things I could not establish a connection with the character.If we look at our the 'mystery solving' as one we get quite a good picture. They seem to complete each other in their tasks, they have easily distinguishable personalities. However what bothers me is the fact that the primary question why did they get involved in the fight with the supernatural is not answered. You need some sort of reason to do that, it's not like you wake up one day and an idea to kick some etheral ass pops into your head.When it comes to sound the movie is good. The voice acting does not have too much work to do, since some characters are underdeveloped, but it is still handeled in a pretty decent fashion.The music is good yet akward. In some moments it's genius while in other not even noticeable. It also suffers from the fact that it does not build up steadily. Some themes are gentle and mysterious while other are action packed and emotional. The problem is that there is nothing between the two and it may give the impression that two seperate soundtracks were written for the movie.Without doubt, animation is the best aspect of this production. The character animation is good, not too good though. But the enviroment, especially that of the Fujyou building is amazing. The suicides scenes are also a masterpiece. However, sometimes I had the strange feeling that the computer generated animation was running visibly smoother than the drawn one, but that did not ruin the general impression which was great.Without any regret I have to admit that the movie suffered from the fact that the story was simply not told in an intriguing and intresting fashion and rather poor character development. It is a beautiful picture, but an average story. If it was not for the genius animation this movie would not exceed avarage.However, it was still worth to watch it till the very end and see the trailer of the second Kara no Kyoukai movie, which hopefully will answer all the questions asked in this one.Still, even on its own, this movie is worth watching because of the stunning animation. and putting all the pieces together as if it was a jigsaw.Unfortunately, although that slight amount of moral thought is present throughout the movie, after the very first coversation between two of main chracters it becomes so straight forward that the next twenty, or so, minutes of the movie should be cut down to no more than five, since they do not stimulate one's mind to think even in the slightest.The greater picture of the movie and the message it was suppose to sent was literally served to me on a plate half way through, therefor causing the movie to be an inengaing yawner for at least one third of it.That's pretty much it about the greater picture, which is dissapointing becuase the way it is being shown ruins a pretty damn good idea.When it comes to the suicides on which the story was supposed to develop I had a feeling that I have seen all of it before.

Aside from background that you dont get until later the charecters are soild and feel apart of the world.Enjoyment: 10, If you can accept the slow pace of the movie you should find it meaninful and connect with the world and form an initial connection to the main charecters that will only grow as you watch the sequals.Overall: 10, The overall score comes from the overwhemling impact of the art, sound and the formula that sums the kara no Kyoukai movies.  The first half of the show sets you up for the inveitable action sequance in which Shiki shows her skills, after which is followed by a solid resolution to the aftermath of that movies plot. 10, Kara no Kyoukai is simply one of the most beautiful anime I have seen in a while.

First off thank you japan for being crispy enough to twitter my mouth with delights such as this.This show is irrelevant to my review, a platform to type inanities.  Yes cartwheel.Whatever this may lack, it makes up for with an abundance of atmosphere.  And bluebirds fluttering in the space that should occupy what zombies crave.The discontinuity of events as the movies progress is a triumph.  I never understood reviews that use the word triumph, it isn't like a film has autonomy or reached the 9000th level...by sheer force of blond hair.I imbibed an organic substance once and went to an arena, to this day, that place was swaying with the wind.  As previously mentioned, I believe this to be an atmosphere driven series, the characters are not very developed and the story is thin, with dark chocolate undertones seeking to burgeon your belly.  In actual fact, that is the most flavorsome aspect; the mysterious background of the characters and story enter into the foreground to play a central role.The tension is perfected throughout, yet this isn't a thriller for the most part.  I am no connoisseur of drama, however these films delivered it in such a package that I didn't call in the bomb squad.  The only real disappointment was the epilogue, which I thought was unnecessary and convoluted.  Whereas I thought the explanations, while expounded slowly, were satisfactory.  It did not need a 30 minute ending of philosophical ramblings to make it coherent, it achieved the reverse. by sheer force of blond hair.I imbibed an organic substance once and went to an arena, to this day, that place was swaying with the wind.

It did not need a 30 minute ending of philosophical ramblings to make it coherent, it achieved the reverse."", 'Before we start two things I would like to mention :-This review will be short.  (Spoilers free)- This review will feature each Kara no Kyoukai movie (excluding Mirai Fukkin only).Few to no anime manages to reach a certain level of complexity that this one does. Being a short series composed by 7 movies (some of them 40 min long) Kara no Kyoukai is an anime about a peron named ""Shiki Ryougi"" and how she deals with the life around her.And no, it\'s not a slice of life type of show, you see, Shiki Ryougi is everything except normal, in every aspect...you can think off..Story : 9/10.  Kara no Kyoukai has a solid story (for the most part), the thing is, it gets messy quite easily. If you don´t keep your attention throughout the entire movie you will be losing the trail of it. If you decide to follow the series by their date of release (which I totally reccomend) then you will be feeling that sometimes you will be compeletly lost. They try to explain themselves but sometimes you gotta rewind the video so that you can read again what they said and actually think about it, unless if you don´t care about detail and just wanna have a general idea about the all thing.That\'s a good point and a bad point at the same time. For a series that can be quite bad because some viewers are not into that kind of thing, rewinding a video just to make sure everything is clear. They might just drop it. But if you are one of those guys that actually enjoys to know everything about the show they\'re watching then I think you will have quite a nice time with this one (at least I did).Aside from that, the story takes different sides as you progress in the movie, while Shiki remains the protagonist in all of them, the rest of focus changes from movie to movie.  This makes the story less repetitve and still not losing it\'s ""identity"". I mean the story is still about Shiki, you just get the chance to hear and watch other characters as you move along instead of only 1 or 2 characters like some series do.Now exploring multiple characters usually means one thing : They will fuck it up.. most of the times they do ! Either because they didn´t develop well some of the characters and so the series or that specific part of the series was crap, or they spend way too many time with secondary characters and forget about the main ones. Kara no Kyoukai gets away by placing Shiki in the center of everything. She literally is the plot device for any other story (maybe movie 6 is the one who doesn´t follow this rule, but that\'s because that\'s the only movie where Shiki isn´t our main protagonist).As for the pace, I consider it quite good. Slow when explaining the plot and the characters, fast when moving foward. This series do not seem to waste their time here. Every single second seems important and entertaining !The story is structured (if you follow the order of release) in a way that you discover tiny pieces of the story in each movie so that you can get to the very end, movie 7, and understand the all thing. On top of that, they end up with this specific movie, the last one ""Kara no Kyoukai: Shuushou"" which for me was just the cherry on top of the cake. 30 Minutes of awesomeness :DFor last, the story itself. It\'s hard to find an original theme these days, as most of the action anime out there repeat themselves over and over .. the protagonist is usually someone who lost somebody and is know trying to get revenge or fighting for others or some kind of shit .. or they usually have some problem to deal with.Kara no Kyoukai doesn´t entirely move away from this standards, but makes them a little bit different. Our main character is not trying to resolve anything .. isn´t trying to help anyone as well .. she is trying to find herself.. as I said at the beginning, this series are about Shiki\'s life and how she deals with the world around her. Now what problems does she face? That\'s up to you to discover ;)I can just say, you will get amazed. Along with the fantasy this anime also speaks about themes such as : death (what is death, what is the void, what is after it etc), suicide (is it wrong to commite suicide, why we want to commite suicide, is there any advantages ..), mind control (how we, humans, can get controlled, how can our minds be fooled so easily), love (of course (: ) and for last, dreams(are they worth being chased, what are the costs, etc ..)My point is, this series aren´t just about some guys fighting the evil .. it\'s beyond that.Art / Animation : 9/10Kara no Kyoukai has strong points on this one.. The first one being the pallet used. Bright colours that contrast with Shiki\'s. Everything seemed to be made around her, and you clearly notice that. She was designed so that she always takes your attention when you look at the screen, yet the background is what contrasts more (she is pale, white tones, what makes her stand out are the clothings or the eyes, while the background usually is much more bright). The art is pretty generic for ufotable\'s work. Still pretty shitty at dwaring faces ..Another thing they do get right though, were the covers, oh my god those covers .. so awesome :OAbout the fight scenes .. well we all know Ufotable for their superb fight scenes .. Kara no Kyoukai is no exception.. they\'re spectacular. Full fo detail, pretty and sweet animations, Kara no Kyoukai just meets the standards for any fight scene. Still below Fate\'s level though :DSound : 10/10.Composed by Yuki Kajiura, what else could we expect .. srsly .. you start the movie with Kara no Kyoukai\'s intro, no talk, no nothing, just a background and the music starts playing .. right from the back I could tell this would be a great series just because of the soundtrack. and I was right (: Pretty much every trakc fills it\'s needs, if there is action, let\'s put some kickass music, if you\'re looking for drama, let the sad musics take place. They\'ve got you covered, as well as the animation, they did a good job with Kara no Kyoukai\'s themes .. and oh god the endings .. each movie has it\'s own ending .. and oh my they were amazing .. what a magnificient way of ending a movie like this .. no words to describe those 5 minutes of ..Characters : 9/10. Really short, each one is well defined and developed. Some series don´t pull it off with 2-3 characters but Kara no Kyoukai does it with many more. Unlike other movies, the characters don´t feel as generic, they have their shiny thing that distinguishes from your normal side characters. As for our second main protagonist (I haven´t mentioned him yet xD), Kokutou, Mikiya, I think you can consider your generic good guy. Though at least he is not as dumb as other generic good guys out there cough* Emiya *cough .. he has a little bit of sense and will be the pilar for Shiki\'s problems during the series.The relation between this 2 is quite entertaining and intriguing. Even though it\'s never the main focus in any of the first movies, it\'s still there .. it\'s still present. You always have their relation in mind when the fight scene comes even though we only had 10-15 min of development in that movie.But the star of the show, with no doubt is, Azaka Kokutou, Mikiya\'s sister.... jokes aisde, Shike made it all worth. This 7 movies would be just another generic action anime without her. She has to be one of the most complex characters I\'ve seen so far, yet she is always looks so simple, so elegant. It\'s a pleasure just looking at her with her divine design. We can tell how much work they\'ve put into her because everything seems to fit, the sound track, the art, the colors used, everything seems it was made to max out, to extract every single drop of awesomeness out of her. I don´t wanna spoil you a thing, I promised it would be a spoilers free review so I can´t go any longer. Though I can assure you she will be one of the hardest anime characters to understand. And that my friends, is something that I approve. Most of the times you watch a movie or so for the climax, for that fight scene really asweomse cough* every shonen out there * cough which is a shame because the rest of the show will be boring or at least not has good. But thanks to Shiki\'s personality, Kara no Kyoukai has both.Enjoyment : 10/10. It is rare for me to give a 10/10. I\'m a nitpicky person, at the minimal mistake I blame the anime for days and decide to not give it a 10/10. But this one deserves, come on event he fucking credits scene was delightful to assist. From the very first second to the very last, this series built up their story around Shiki so that in the end .. yes you gessesd it. The end of this show culminates in a fantastic ending in my opinion, honestly I tried to predict the ending and I failed, pretty badly. Intense, deep, sad, happy, a mix of emotions I didn´t know what to feel .. but I do know something.. I felt the ""void"" .. that feeling of ""What I\'m gonna do with my life now"" when you end a really good series .. that\'s one of the feelings I want endings to have , and for me, Kara no Kyoukai\'s ending nailed at it.Overall: 9/10. Even though the 7th and 5th movie could be considered some what like a 10/10 I still can´t deny that there is that 6th movie (I don´t understand why this one exists in the first place, probably to cash in some money) and that the others movies, even though they were great, they were not 10/10 movies. They relied too much on the 5th and 7th movie (this movies in some way concluded certain parts of the story). By any means the other movies are bad, they\'re just not as good, and in my opinion, not worthy of a 9/10 rate, close though.So really short, Kara no Kyoukai is not your typical action anime, it mixes elements from psychological anime, drama, romance, fantasy, and combines them into one single anime .. an amazing series in my opinion and if by any chance you\'ve watched Fate series, then this one is a must. In a nutshell, an awesome series (: you can think off..Story : 9/10.  Kara no Kyoukai has a solid story (for the most part), the thing is, it gets messy quite easily.

In a nutshell, an awesome series (:', 'Being the first installment in the critically acclaimed Kara no Kyoukai, means any regular person watches it expecting surreal and vivid plot and suspense, where things aren\'t always what they seem. Instead we are greeted with a borefest which thankfully lasts only 50 minutes, otherwise I would have quit halfway.CharacterCharacter development is non-existent and the archetypes mostly bland. If I had to sum it up: You can\'t solve a puzzle without its pieces. We know next to nothing about the characters\' life, beliefs, motivations and most importantly how they ended up in the present situation, which lends itself to their mysterious personas. However, you...feel no real belief or strong emotions from our bland protagonist which leaves you wondering what is her purpose in life. We don\'t feel any empathy or connection to any of our protagonists which removes any sort of tension the movie could have and leaves you apathetic and uncaring towards their struggles (if you can call them that). How can you solve a puzzle without its pieces? How can you learn about the character if the movie doesn\'t develop them?StoryI saw a review which stated the movies are in random order and that this is a good thing because it is how the series is meant to be watched. Well, I can say that they could have made one less movie, because you gain nothing by watching this. I could literally skip this movie and watch the second and lose absolutely nothing by it. Nothing is revealed throughout the movie so you stop watching it with a bitter feeling in your mouth. It\'s incomplete, there\'s no satisfaction because there\'s no development to the overarching plot. There\'s no difference in the beginning and the end. No character development, no change in circumstances (they return to life as it used to be) no enemies or friends made just...nothing. NOTHING HAPPENS!!!! EVERYTHING\'S THE SAME!!!!ArtStunning at times but the faces are really bland. and fight choreography is woefully mediocre.SoundI found it very good with beautiful ost, the best part of the movie certainly.Which leads me to one major gripe that I have is with one scene in particular. The fight scene. It has beautiful animation (like stunning) and amazing soundtrack, but when I watched all I could think was"" what a waste"".There were two glaring issues: one was the lack of any tension whatsoever (even with the art and sound which says a lot about the movie), as I said you don\'t care about the characters at all which helps, but adding to that you never once doubt the outcome, its pretty obvious the protagonist will win. But other than that its the way in which she wins, its a massacre. None of the opponents put up any sort of fight besides the ""last boss"" which yells once (it has no effect) and then dies. Truly a waste of very good art and brilliant sound.Enjoyment/Overall - 3Skip this movie, you gain nothing from it. Inflated ratings mainly due to future installments (I hope).Sidenote - pretty complex abstract ideas and philosophies that certainly require thought to interpret it, but I bet most won\'t even pay attention because the subtitles go so fast you need to either be engaged (which you won\'t be) and instantly understand or pause to read. A nice touch but they mostly aren\'t realistic (as in I personally don\'t think more than a handful of people would have those trains of thought). Lol don\'t know why I even bothered to review such a shit movie, no one\'s gonna read this anyway.UOVOUVDEUALLHAILTRUMPBUIOBTVOUIRHUNRBUIALLLHAILTRUMPHKSVBLUIBTTRUOALLHAILTRUMP feel no real belief or strong emotions from our bland protagonist which leaves you wondering what is her purpose in life.

The purpose that the creators decided for movie is very likely because they did not want to follow the regular TV episode release date system (one episode per week), and thought that if they split it in movies, they could perfectly split them in Arcs. Personally, I would prefer TV, though, because it would make it easier to review than reviewing an alonestanding movie where it is barely possible to consider certain aspects, such as the character development. On the other hand, it is a good possibility to...consider how all the Arcs were done when they are separate. Still, if I had to decide, I would definitely go for TV. It would perfectly fit as a 22 episodes Anime.For a short movie like this with bare content, it was amazingly done. It is not ranked too high, though, but I can easily see why. It is probably because this Anime is kind of dark, but in another way. It is difficult to define, but it did not feel like there was much life, or maybe unentertaining would hit the meaning. What I am basically talking about, is that it is more or less difficult to concentrate on the conversations, because they did not have an interesting shape. I actually had to watch the first ten minutes twice in order to prevent getting lost and actually understand the plot.Speaking of the plot, it is definitely interesting. The plot is about various feminine high school students who all of sudden suicided, without having an actual reason for it. They had a splendid life, and there was one conspicuous similarity between all of those deaths - namely that all of them jumped from the top of a high building, but on the same building. A girl named Shiki went to the place because she was curious about it. That building is definitely suspicious, it is abandoned, maybe it is cursed, which is why Shiki went in it, and this is where the Genres start getting more meaning.Eventually you are asking this question yourself as well, why does a girl have to do this? Why did the police not investigate the building? So far, this is an unclarified question, which I might have missed, though. The story definitely shows potential, but this is all I can say about it, really. It was not shown much enough to judge the story as a whole, but it seems definitely promising so far. It is quite original as well. Considering there are two really high ranked movies, I can easily this getting one of the best stories ever. Knowing that fact, it will be difficult to predict the story, although I already now have no clue what this could become.For some reason, this movie reminded me a little bit of Fate/Zero. The plot is different in all considerable ways, but both give me a similar feeling. Not only the art is almost completely the same, even the soundtrack sounds slightly identical. Well, most of the tracks do not sound similar, but sometimes the soundtrack manages to create an identical atmosphere between both. It is definitely not a bad thing, though, and I believe I am one of the only persons who does actually think so.It is enough to see only one or two minutes of this movie to get the feeling of hardly belief that this movie is actually made in 2007. The backgrounds are immensely detailed, sometimes even too immensely for my liking, the characters look amazing and the animation is magnificent as well. The mere background art makes you want to stare at the screen the whole time, and it perfectly conveys the atmosphere a real thriller Anime needs. Like aforementioned, the art is pretty much the same of Fate/Zero, just with a slightly lower quality. It even uses these awesome background effects, such as the mist you might notice. The art is absolutely perfect.The soundtrack is certainly one of the best soundtracks ever. There is one melody that constantly pops up in this movie and I can not get it out of my mind. It sounds kinda heart-warming, mystical, and beautiful. It is not only that theme, the rest sounds awesome and fitting, too. I have rarely seen something like this before, and especially that it feels so special in a movie that does not even last for an hour, makes it even more special. The characters were voiced decently as well. There is still something regarding the sound I disliked; the sound effects. They sound unrealistic and unfitting sometimes, and sometimes, even sounds were missed.Overall, this is an awesome movie. It is a little bit difficult to determine a score when there is not even a real end and when there are barely any development remarks in a movie of this length, so I'm forced to rate it from my so-far-impression. Usually, even when there are several Anime seasons, they have an actual end which makes it possible to judge, but this case is different. But so far, I have a good impression of this Anime and this will probably become one of my favorites, because this movie is in comparison to some other KnK movies, ranked fairly low, but is still impressive.

The story, at times, was a bit weak and a bit confusing, but on the whole I enjoyed Fukan Fuukei  a lot. The fight scenes during the movie were outstanding (probably the most colourful i've seen) and the music to go with the fight scenes hit the mark. The characters were human at most times but some times they seemed to lose themselves. Overall, I would have to say the Kara no Kyoukai series is...one of my favourites and the movie truly was outstanding. one of my favourites and the movie truly was outstanding."", 'NO SPOILERS(This review is for all the movies that compose Kara no Kyoukai)Story(7) According to me, the story of Kara no Kyoukai is too complicated, philosophical.

However, there are some plot twists which are enjoyable.Art(9) The movies didn\'t grew old! The drawings and particularly the animation of ufotable are joyous. The settings are very beautiful too. The 4:3 format also makes me nostalgic. It\'s surely the point to justify the fact that it\'s an...anime I recommend.Sound(9) The overture and the action theme are really pleasant to hear, the music of Yuji Kajiura fill its role wonderfully, accentuating the actions and the replies.

I recommend it despite all these things', ""In my never-ending search for good anime, I've tried a number of different series. Some knocked the wind out of me in terms of sheer quality. Others have caused me to question why I even decided to watch them in the first place. However, I've never come across a series such as this, one that tells it's story through movie format. While this presentation of a 50-min movie may cause some viewers to shy away, I for one commend Kara no Kyoukai: Overlooking View, as it offers a nice adventure and introduction to the series.Now, onto the review!The story of this first episode is...centered around a string of suicides, all of which are without a suicide note. However, the dead are not the only ones who are victims to the mysterious occurrence. A woman by the name of Shiki loses a dear friend, Mikiya, to the ominous force behind the suicides and she must do whatever it takes to rescue his soul. The story is contained nicely and has excellent pacing. It is obvious that there is more back story to come, and thus the lack of such information can frustrate some, yet it also entices the others to continue watching. The ending is also satisfying and loops back nicely to the beginning. The action scenes are few, but the moments of tension easily build up to them.STORY: 9/10The art is from Ufotable, the studio behind Fate/Zero. Even though this is an earlier work, it easily keeps up with the studio's more recent ventures. Animation is fluid, character designs are beautiful, yet down to earth, and the  special effects, such as the blood and Shiki's eyes, are colorful and crisp. Heck, even the smoke from Touko's cigarettes is nice to look at. A warning on the action scenes though. When the true fight kicks off, it looks as though the camera is constantly changing fields of perception, changing focus at the drop of a hat, creating an almost pulsating feeling. I think of it as a nice touch to the action, but it can make some viewers nauseous if they're not used to it.ART: 10/10The musical score is eerie, with choir pieces capturing the mood perfectly. The beginning theme and ending are nice and the voices are fantastic, especially the voice of Shiki. Their moods are portrayed effectively and they don't have the exaggerated emotions that plague other anime.SOUND: 10/10Each main character plays a substantial role to the story. No one feels wasted and I actually can't seem to fit anyone into an anime archetype unless I try really hard. Shiki is a somewhat conserved young woman who, while seeming somewhat cold, cares deeply for those she loves. Touko is a beautiful lady who is surrounded in mystery as her near infinite wisdom brings up nice philosophical touches to the anime. Mikiya at first seems like a typical nice guy, but his importance to Shiki drives her forward. The factor that keeps the characters back is that they never truly develop. They are great characters, but we don't know about their past or anything like that. This entices the view to learn more, but also injures the entire package.CHARACTERS: 8/10I loved watching this. It was a nice treat from the great studio of Ufotable. I sadly was not able to enjoy it fully since there is just so much left unsaid about the characters and their back stories. Once I finish this series, though, I will look at this episode again.ENJOYMENT: 9/10Overall, this is a great way to spend 50 minutes. It has great characters, beautiful art and awesome sound. It does, however, suffer from lack of character growth and a story that takes a hit because of that. This will, however, be fixed as the series goes on and we learn more about what makes Shiki and her gang tick. centered around a string of suicides, all of which are without a suicide note.

Not knowing who the characters were and as I wasn\'t attached to them - I really did not even care about the story. Yet the animation and the sound were phenomenal ,it drew me in and made me watched the whole series. Now I get it why people rate this movie 7 or lower, it was meant to be the first film in a series that is presented in a non-chronological order. But now that I have watched the series...the second time, I realized that this was a really great film. I rated this film a 6 earlier, but now it was 10. In fact, I believe that this is on par with the seventh and fifth films, which were thought to be the best in the series (and one of the best in anime in general).On the second viewing and subsequent viewings, you could really appreciate the atmosphere that ufotable expertly crafted. This is a world that is dark and gritty - with magic that are there not to inspire but to slash things. This is anime that has gore and violence, and lots of it - yet they are not there merely for fun, they actually mean something to the story. But this is the film that actually showed how Shiki misses Mikiya, and how she longs for him. Mikiya was asleep for most of the story, which was probably why I didn\'t care much for him at first. But the longing that Shiki feels because he is gone, now that\'s what really drew me in. Shiki appears tough and strong. She apparently is immune to all the shit that has been happening to the world, now showed how human she is. This would be further developed as the story progressed, but the longing here is evident. Everytime Shiki wokes up in her apartment all alone you could feel it. Touko here is bad-ass as always, yet her presence is subdued. This movie is after all centered mainly on Shiki.The animation is top-notch, the best that animation has to offer. The lighting and the action scenes were truly breathtaking, and even more recent anime can\'t even compare of the beauty that this anime has. The sound, given that Yuki Kaijura is the composer, is obviously also topnotch. Kajiura\'s other work (that I know of) on Fate/zero is beautiful, and you expect the same on all his works. Overall, I did enjoy Fukan Fuukei as you could only on subsequent watches. I is worth the rewatch! For me, the film series is hard to actually like - but it is worth the effort to force yourself to watch it. The  depth of the characters and the story is enough to be seen as a classic. the second time, I realized that this was a really great film. I rated this film a 6 earlier, but now it was 10.

The story is something like a dream, which means it was simple and yet confusing with unexplained supernatural occurrences, but that's perfect for this film. Such was the power of this film that it had me enthralled to watch someone eat a container of ice cream in silence.To me, this forms a pair of aesthetic polar opposites with My Neighbor Totoro. Whereas I loved Totoro for its natural style depicting...energetic, lifelike children exploring a vibrant, forested rural area that reminds me of where I grew up, I loved this film's hazy, decaying cityscape rendered in heavily stylized light and color, inhabited by pensive adults.After Sam Watches Anime's youtube analysis has been watched, it becomes apparent that the point of the film is that the risk of gaining a broader perspective is losing one's own place in the world, and therefore oneself. energetic, lifelike children exploring a vibrant, forested rural area that reminds me of where I grew up, I loved this film's hazy, decaying cityscape rendered in heavily stylized light and color, inhabited by pensive adults.After Sam Watches Anime's youtube analysis has been watched, it becomes apparent that the point of the film is that the risk of gaining a broader perspective is losing one's own place in the world, and therefore oneself."", 'First time writing a review, so feel free to criticize/disagree with me.For something that was so hyped up by Nasu lovers, I was kind of disappointed, since it felt like this was something written by Nasu in his edgy/chuuni days. I never understood why people want to force symbolism into anime so badly. I don\'t watch anime to be confused (feel free to call me stupid for it, but I\'m sure I\'m not the only one that just likes to watch anime casually to enjoy it). I had to read someone else\'s analysis to even understand what was going on (it talked about things that...were never even mentioned in the movie, and I don\'t think they\'re things that get explained in the later movies either). The characters were fine until we meet the edgy/tryhard philosophy character that Nasu probably uses to portray his own edgy thought processes on. One thing I REALLY hate about certain anime is when they try to get smart with psychological/philosophy stuff. I try to analyze these thought processes that they try to portray, but really they\'re so unique/unrelatable that I can think of them as nothing more than pointless/useless ""plot"" devices. At the same time, some of the symbolism was just some simple/common sense idea that was made complicated and disguised as something profound in a way to make it look edgy/cooler (but symbolism is also what the viewers make of it, so maybe the anime isn\'t as much as to blame for all the speculated ""symbolism""). And the even more annoying part is when people claim that the symbolism and ideas/thought processes in the anime correlates with real life (it doesn\'t....). An anime so edgy, it makes its viewers edgy. Oh boy.As for the things I enjoyed: soundtrack and maybe art. UFOtable has never failed me with their soundtracks, but I didn\'t really like it when they used the volume of the music to build suspense. The sudden jumps in volume scared me, which was a cowardly way of grabbing my attention for something that isn\'t exactly part of the horror genre. The art isn\'t something I can really complain about, since it was made in 2007. UFOtable has a habit of putting most of their art efforts into fighting scenes (to, guess what? make the anime even more edgier). But now I\'m just being cynical.I probably would\'ve rated this anime a bit higher, if I didn\'t have the expectations I did from the praise from all those Nasu lovers. For something that was 50 minutes long, I didn\'t get any background at all. I know the 6 other movies are in different orders on the timeline that might/might not explain all the questions I have, but I just hate it when an anime makes a confusing first episode/entry as a way of pulling in the viewers from their curiosity. This is mostly just a preference thing. Like they could\'ve at least explained some things, instead of making it vague/edgy. I know I used the word edgy a lot, and a lot of people are going to say something like: ""What did you expect from an action/mystery anime?"" And you\'re right, I\'ve seen much worse.

But again, this is also because of the expectations I had for it.', 'This is the first film in the Garden of Sinners series and it appears to be a quite confusing introduction. In this dark film, we follow the mysterious suicides of girls without motives jumping from the same building and plummeting to their deaths. We are introduced to Shiki who appears to have supernatural powers in the form of the ability to kill demonic spirits, Kokutou, a friend of Shiki and Touka, who is their colleague and a puppet master, yet it is unclear what her job appears to be.Shiki is shown as cold with moments where it appears that she’s struggling with her emotions, especially...when it comes to Kokutou, the glasses guy that brings her ice-cream. The animation of Shiki’s movements is emphasised in this film, especially simple things like her drinking water or eating ice-cream - her swift, decisive and abrupt movements whilst completing these simple tasks really helps to show her personality.The soundtrack is breathtaking. It actually expresses so much depth. Shiki’s theme is hopeful yet solemn and has multiple variations ranging from the big dramatic scenes and the action filled battle scenes. There’s just an eerie yet peaceful quality to it. I know those things don’t really seem like they could exist together, yet listening to the theme really feels like a nice balance between an ominous yet calming feeling. The character design is simplistic, yet the backdrops and lighting is superb!! The battle scenes are also enchanting when Shiki goes full on bad-ass mode.When Kokutou seems to be heading towards becoming the next victim of the ominous force that’s resulting in the suicides, Shiki takes to scouting the building to defeat this force as she has a connection to Kokutou, yet it is unclear the full extent at which their relationship spans. The connection of Kokutou and Shiki with the puppet master is also one that’s quite curious in terms of how they got involved with each other.Embedded in this story are a lot of dark themes about the meaning of suicide. It explores the burden that suicide places on all of the people’s lives whom the person has touched and it explores the ambiguous nature of whether suicide is a result of a detached indifference from not being able to feel at all, or is due to feeling things so strongly that only a statement as strong as suicide is enough to show the depth of their need to express their emotions. It also explores which is the harder option when life gets too hard with this amazing quote by Touka:‘There are two ways to escape: escape without a purpose, and escape with a purpose. I call the former ""floating"", and the latter ""flight"". You are the only one that decides which of the two your view of the world from on high was. But you don\'t choose these paths because of the weight on your soul. We don\'t choose the path we take because of the sins we carry. But we carry our sins on the path we choose.What this means to me is that we aren’t inherently our sins, our sins are not tightly attached to our actions and we still have an ability to choose the right path whilst keeping the mistakes of our past in our minds. Our actions are not us. It is not our mistakes that take the wheel when determining what we’re going to do next, but the strength of our inherent self to combat and deal with our mistakes. Whether we choose to live or not depends on the ability of our soul to bear the burden of the actions which we may view as moral atrocities.I have a feeling that there are many layers to this than I can fully realise without watching the other seven movies but I feel that this is the beauty of this series…to slowly unravel the mystery. If you’re looking for something supernatural with epic battle scenes, animation and soundtrack, this is for you. when it comes to Kokutou, the glasses guy that brings her ice-cream.

It explores the burden that suicide places on all of the people’s lives whom the person has touched and it explores the ambiguous nature of whether suicide is a result of a detached indifference from not being able to feel at all, or is due to feeling things so strongly that only a statement as strong as suicide is enough to show the depth of their need to express their emotions. It also explores which is the harder option when life gets too hard with this amazing quote by Touka:‘There are two ways to escape: escape without a purpose, and escape with a purpose. I call the former ""floating"", and the latter ""flight"". You are the only one that decides which of the two your view of the world from on high was. But you don\'t choose these paths because of the weight on your soul. We don\'t choose the path we take because of the sins we carry. But we carry our sins on the path we choose.What this means to me is that we aren’t inherently our sins, our sins are not tightly attached to our actions and we still have an ability to choose the right path whilst keeping the mistakes of our past in our minds. Our actions are not us. It is not our mistakes that take the wheel when determining what we’re going to do next, but the strength of our inherent self to combat and deal with our mistakes. Whether we choose to live or not depends on the ability of our soul to bear the burden of the actions which we may view as moral atrocities.I have a feeling that there are many layers to this than I can fully realise without watching the other seven movies but I feel that this is the beauty of this series…to slowly unravel the mystery. If you’re looking for something supernatural with epic battle scenes, animation and soundtrack, this is for you.', 'Kara no Kyoukai is an Action, Mystery, Thriller, Supernatural and Romance anime made by one of my favorite production studios, Ufotable. When I think about it, I can\'t say that I loved it, but it is not like I hate it either. I am neutral about it but it was good. Now let\'s discuss the details in the review.PLOT AND STORY LINE...Kara no Kyoukai follows Shiki Ryougi, a girl who, after a terrible car accident, stayed in coma for two years. Being a member of the Ryougi family, Shiki owned a dual personality, a feminine and a masculine side which were created by splitting her soul. After waking up from the coma, Shiki realized that the masculine side was gone but as an after effect she gained the power to perceive death with her \'Mystic Eyes\'. The ability to kill any living being with only a knife lures Shiki into a darker world but fortunately for her, she is not alone.The thing about Kara no Kyoukai is that it is really complicated. Actually, it is not the story that is complicated but the story-line. The movies actually tell Shiki\'s story in a retrospective way of telling. Moving from the present to the past, back to the present then into the future...I found it rather confusing and I always had the feeling that I had missed something very important. It made me think that either I am too stupid to understand what\'s happening or the anime is really bad.  It was neither of those, just the specific way of telling the story. Now I don\'t want to say that the retrospective story line is bad, but it did took some time to understand everything. In addition to the retrospective-confusion, plot holes also made the story less enjoyable. Things like how the Ryougi family actually split Shiki\'s soul or how did Touko teach Shiki to use her eyes are important and interesting parts of the story, but there is not a single scene that actually covered that. I can\'t remember much plot holes right now, but besides little plot holes that appear in almost every anime, Kara no Kyoukai also had some greater ones.When it comes to the story alone it is really interesting. Especially the way the story develops trough mysterious cases going on in the city. They always find some connection to Shiki, whether it is a girl who bends things just by looking at them, a mage that collects deaths, a cannibal etc.  I pretty much enjoyed the whole story from the beginning to the end. It was entertaining, catchy, rich in action and amazing fight and of course romance. Now for those who think that the romance is a side story of Kara no Kyoukai, I have to say that they are wrong (in my opinion at least). True, Kara ni Kyoukai is firstly a thriller and supernatural story but the romance between Shiki and Mikiya is the core of it. Everything happens because and around the two of them and to be honest, it is probably the best love story I have ever seen. It starts of as a cute, little high-school love but becomes a dramatic and serious love story in the end. It carries that deep and heavy meaning of love and becomes the only thing to guide Shiki trough the Garden of Sinners. By the way, in the end you\'ll also understand the depth of the subtitle of Kara no Kyoukai, ""Garden of Sinners"". It is ingenious.On the whole, it takes some time and to watch all seven of the Kara no Kyoukai movies to understand it completely, but it is definitely worth it.ANIMATION AND STYLEEven tough I praised Ufotable for their animation in the Fate series, I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed about the animation of Kara no Kyoukai in the beginning . Still I had no reason for that because, when compared to other animations from the period 2007-2009, the animation of Kyoukai no Kanata rocks. Wery fluid movements, amazing backgrounds and despite I am not a fan of dull environment it actually amazingly brought over the darkness and the depth of  the anime\'s story. The style is also very good, nothing special but also nothing to be criticized about. As always, I especially liked the action and fight scenes of the anime because they were incredible. I really have to get rid of the habit not to watch anime just because of their age, because even older anime may have good animation.CHARACTERSGenerally, the characters are not bad. Still, the only characters that you really get to know in the anime are Shiki and Mikiya. There are also Touko and Mikiya\'s sister Azaka but they are the randomly cool and genius investigator/mage/senpai and Azaka is a typical tsundere character. Mikiya\'s character does have some depth in his personality but nothing that special that would make him a unique character. Shiki on the other hand is special due to the story. The whole anime is about her complex and unique personality and I must say that I loved it. She is lovable and cheerful in one moment, but in the other she turns into a killer. Just do not confuse her with Yandere characters, she definitely is not. Her character undergoes a great development and that\'s exactly why I  loved her character the most.CONCLUSIONWhen it comes to Kara no Kyoukai, I personally didn\'t like it in the beginning. Mostly because it was all so confusing and I didn\'t understand what was going on in the first two movies. Despite some plot holes, the idea of the retrospective way of telling was actually pretty good. I even loved it after finishing all seven movies. Kara no Kyoukai is a catchy and entertaining thriller and supernatural story that still turns around a romance, but around a very good one. It could also have been a 12/13-episode-long anime but it is okay either way. Not my favorite, but I do recommend you to watch Kara no Kyoukai: Garden of Sinners.

Not my favorite, but I do recommend you to watch Kara no Kyoukai: Garden of Sinners.', '*This review is for the entire Garden of Sinners series not just the first movie.The chronological order of movies is 2, 4, 3, 1, 5-7.Garden of Sinners follows Shiki and Mikiya, two college students that work for The Hollow Shrine, a paranormal investigation service. What makes Shiki uniquely qualified for this job is her Mystic Eyes which allow her to see, among other things, death.Story 9/10It\'s hard to talk about the story because it\'s told so randomly out of order, but I still encourage anyone watching to watch the series in the existing order because, even though I was very confused in...the beginning, this is one of those stories where if you keep watching to the very end all your questions get answered eventually.Each movie centers around Shiki and Mikiya investigating a different case, always involving murder and the supernatural. Part of what makes it such a great mystery, however, is the minor details that you really have to look for. For example, you see a woman stabbing a boy to death, but if you look closely you\'ll notice there\'s no blood on the knife; this gets explained later in the movie and I really admire little details like that.Plus, every movie climaxes with an awesome fight scene between Shiki and the killer that is just shounen-level exciting.Also, I said you should watch the movies in existing order because sometimes a character will say something like ""I guess Shizune\'s vision came true"" and I\'ll be like ""Who\'s Shizune? What vision?"", but, after I watch the next movie, I say ""Oh, that\'s Shizune"" and I get this feeling of closure now that things make sense.However, if I had one complaint it\'d be how confusing some of the exposition is, especially whenever Touko tried to explain something supernatural.Characters 10/10I really think Psychological should be one of this anime\'s genres because, especially with Shiki, you really get to know who these characters are and learn what their motivations are.Shiki: If there\'s one word to describe Shiki it\'s mysterious; she acts so secretive and her appearance with the fact she always wears a kimono, she talks in a masculine voice, and she never shows any emotion all just makes her more mysterious. Furthermore, as you begin to unravel the mystery that is Shiki she becomes even more amazing and terrifying. Shiki is a good person who just likes to kill people; I think Touko called her a ""murderphile"".Mikiya: Mikiya isn\'t as complex as Shiki, but I do admire his devotion towards her and how he can overlook her murderous ways to still love her. Plus, Shiki\'s smart, but Mikiya really does all the actual detective work.Touko: Touko is basically just around to spout exposition; she helps out sometimes, but mostly you just see her sitting at her desk smoking a cigarette.Antagonists: Each movie has a different killer so I won\'t talk about them all, but I will say that it isn\'t like they\'re evil because they\'re the bad guys. The part where you learn the killer\'s motivation is my favorite part of every movie because it\'s always so creative and complex.Overall 9/10This is an amazing movie series, one of my favorite anime, and I encourage you to watch all the movies in order to hear the full story. the beginning, this is one of those stories where if you keep watching to the very end all your questions get answered eventually.Each movie centers around Shiki and Mikiya investigating a different case, always involving murder and the supernatural.

Excellent! Outstanding! This anime movie is one of the most brilliant I have ever seen. The beautiful animation, the superb soundtrack, the powerful story, everything plays together in an epiphany of sheer brilliance. Nasu Kinoko's story is done justice with this adaptation, leaving in almost every last detail from its original source material. In my ten years of watching anime, I have yet to see an anime that ever deserved 10/10 in every category... until now. Kara no Kyoukai is a very rare find; an anime that does not slip-up once in its 60 minutes of pure genius.The characters themselves are extremely well designed,...with much effort put into matching their look exactly with the original designs. Aozaki Tohko was the only major change in design for the story, most likely to make her to be closer in appearance to her sister, Aozaki Aoko (A key character in another of Nasu's works, Tsukihime).The music is well suited to every scene, and the majority of the music is simply a different mix of the same theme, giving the film a sense of unity, with only the change in musical instruments and tempo occurring between most scenes.The overall story is brilliant, however, for those who know nothing of the storyline, it should be noted that, in terms of chronological order, this film is NOT the first in the series. It is, in fact, the fourth in terms of chronological order. Due to this, relationships between characters are already assumed and the film jumps straight into the story, with very little being explained to the audience. For those who are confused, or are just wanting to know more, fan translations of chapters 1-4 do exist, and can be easily found with a little effort.I recommend this film to any anime fan. Every part of it screams brilliance and will keep you on edge until the final moments with much effort put into matching their look exactly with the original designs.

The antagonist in this movie is pretty good.Sound (15/15) Simply amazing.Animation (15/15) Simply Amazing....Overall: 82/100Movie 1 was a very good start to this series, and will be a tough movie to beat. While this movie (and the rest of the series) is a murder mystery, it is more the kind of mystery you want solved for you than a mystery you are actively engaged in trying to solve, at least that's how it was for me. The story of Movie 1 deals mostly with suicide and loneliness, and those seem to be the problem the villain is facing. Overall the movie does a good job in telling the story, but lacks any character details. The dialogue between the characters are great though. (28/35)Because we are thrown basically in the middle of the story, the characters will seem like a mystery to you in the first movie. You aren't told much about them, perhaps we are told too little about them. Regardless, the characters are somewhat interesting, even if we aren't sure of their purpose yet (and why they have such dangerous jobs). I think the character we are supposed to focus the most on is the villain, as this is her only time to shine in the series. I thought she was a good antagonist, but certainly not the best in this series. (24/35)If you have read anything about Kara kn Kyoukai, it probably has something to do with its production values. The music in this show is simply amazing. It is composed by Yuki Kajiura, who composed music for way too many shows to list, but some of there recent ones include Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica, Sword Art Online, and the .hack series. I haven't heard all of her work, but this is one of, if not the best of her work IMO. I really adore this soundtrack. (15/15)The animation is just as good as the music. This movie was made by ufotable, who is also responsible for the beautiful Fate/Zero series. So think animation like Fate/Zero, only better. From what I hear this series had a big budget, and from the looks of it they spent their money very well. At first glance it may not look special because of the setting is a Japanese city and the story always happens at night. But when you look past that and actually see the animation for what it is, you will end up in love with it. (15/15)This is a great start to a great series, a personal favorite of mine. One thing I really like about it is they it can be enjoyed simply because of its production valued alone. The action scenes in this movie are great, and the score that accompanies it is equally amazing. But you can also enjoy this series for its dialogue and story almost as much as you can its production values.

It's colors are great, and sound + quality is amazing. I, in my opnion, think this movie should be awarded. It has a beautiful plot, and shows much feelings. Overall, it is the best! Atleast everyone should take a look or watch the movie. "", ""No spoiler.To depict a horrific/thriller atmosphere, the anime is set in a greenish desaturated environment. It’s like looking through fog or pollution: it’s boring.I liked the intro scene. It is clever at introducing the main character but then it’s your typical storytelling: look-how-contemplative-and-deep-I-am. Unfortunately the scenario is empty as the main character’s appartment ;) Characters are so blasé that you can’t connect with the unoriginal story drama. Soundtrack is nice.Avoid if you're suicidal <- jokeThat being said, I know it's the first chapter of seven, so the rest may have the overall story fuller. Though, I clearly lack the motivation to try the second part....This review got me a bit of hate. It's ok if you strongly disagree with me. Be nice to people. This review got me a bit of hate. It's ok if you strongly disagree with me. Be nice to people."", ""This movie is based on a light novel by Nasu Kinonko, a writer for TYPE-MOON that brought us Fate/Stay Night and Tsukihime. Before watching this movie, I've read some chapters on baka-tsuki and I find the novel confusing so I decided to read other novels from that site so in other words I watched this movie with only little knowledge but what the heck?? This show is awesome!!! Good thing I saw the torrent link in animesuki and I immediately downloaded it.What really caught my attention in the movie was the outstanding visuals. The studio ufotable was able to make KyoAni's animation look like Gonzo....It's evident that the studio was given big budget and I think they used it very well. The water effects and camera angle are so awesome that it's breathtaking. The character designs was lovely and I'm in love with a new Tsundere Ryougi Shiki. The movie is quite bloody but I think most people could tolerate it. The bloody scenes are only for just a few moments. I don't find it that gory mainly because I enjoy watching this kinds of thingsThe voice acting was also superb especially how Maaya Sakamoto voiced an apathetic, male sounding voice of Shiki. I really find her VA appropriate for Shiki, it fits her character.The story was at first confusing for me because I don't really know the story. There are so many questions in my head like when did Shiki got those eyes, what happen to her, is Kokuto her love interest etc. but good thing this is a movie series so I hope the sequels will clear everything up. This movie also touches up some philosophical things about life and there are also some inspiring quotes. I like the quotes about suicide and flying vs floating. Your thoughts will get provoked by this movie, I promise you, it will left you wondering during bedtime.The character I liked in the movie was Shiki alone because the other characters are just so-so. I like this girl, she's strong and tough and to boot that up she's also pretty and if ever she became a boy I think she's handsome. This movie is full of moe moments like the 90 seconds ice cream(Haagen Daaz) eating and the pouting Shiki at the near end.The music/sounds was also appropriate with each scenes. The story is has an eerie athmosphere and the bgm gives more emphasis on that. During action scenes the bgm was pumped up and if it's just conversations it's slow but the mystery-eerie feelings are still there.All in all this is the best anime movie I've watched so far. It has pretty visuals, awesome female lead and an interesting story that makes you crave for more. This movie is quite serious and it requires your concentration so you shouldn't watch it with tired minds. I really love the movie and I'm excited on the sequel because we get to see the background of Shiki and Kokuto.The next movie is entitled Kara no Kyoukai : Murder Study (Part 1) and I've watched it already and it's also awesome. I don't know when will I be reviewing that together with the 3rd movie but I hope that I won't be possessed by the spirit of laziness so that I can make a review.

The plot is about girls that fall off a building, except nobody knows why. However, I hope the next ones are better.Art (10/10): Ufotable has an insane budget when it comes to these movies. From the way they open food packages to how Shiki's hair moves, it is flawless.Sound (10/10): The voice actors do a great job, and I really like the ending song....Also, the sound effects sound very realistic. Even the opening of the food packages sounds amazing.Character (7/10): These are nice characters and the only flaw with them I think is that they don't seem to have much character development.Enjoyment (5/10): Despite how good this anime is, it was mediocre when it comes to enjoyment. It is so plot-heavy that it is agonizing to watch. I had to replay a lot of parts because I was confused. On top of that, the movie was very slow paced and only had 1 exciting scene during its 50-minute runtime.Overall (8/10): This anime is clever and the art and sound are flawless.

I haven't had that feeling since watching bird box, not in TPN, not in any other series I watched in between. I usually don't care about soundtracks but the...soundtrack here is actually so immersive it's ridiculous, it pulls you in for a ride. I actually started caring about characters I know nothing about because of the great direction. It hits some notes on depression and loneliness. The first few seconds of the movie had one of the best monologue on loneliness I've heard in my life (I've watched evangelion for reference), the aesthetic themes and the take on loneliness/depression/suicide was probably one of the best I've seen in all of time of me watching and the first part isn't even rated that high which led to me having very low hopes entering into the movie, but damn was I surprised.Also, this is only my 2nd series I've watched by ufotable, they did a great job in fate from what I've heard but here, it's totally different, top notch direction, great va's and well animation, it's ufotable so it's the best animation you'll ever see in your life. soundtrack here is actually so immersive it's ridiculous, it pulls you in for a ride.

It was really difficult to try to understand what the point that each character was trying to make was because their lines were so vacuous and vague. They tried to tie it together with the overarching...theme of 'falling vs flying' and some other bs but it falls flat because unless you do a English literature analysis of the movie and watch it like 5 times you wont really get what they are saying, and even then it doesn't really mean much. The story didn't make much sense either, but I guess you need to watch the rest of the series. The characters were also kinda boring but again this is one movie in 7 so I can't make any big judgement.The art was pretty good, and so was the animation for the most part. The two fight scenes were okay but they were edited quite weirdly and the only shot that stood out to me was the big jump. There was a weird lack of sound effects overall that made some of the shots super awkward because Shiki would be jumping around stabbing shit and the show would be mostly quiet.One thing I did like was the soundtrack, it set the mood really well and Oblivious is a banger.Criticism aside, I still enjoyed most of the movie, it felt that uftoable was at least attempting something cool, even though most of it fell flat in the end. theme of 'falling vs flying' and some other bs but it falls flat because unless you do a English literature analysis of the movie and watch it like 5 times you wont really get what they are saying, and even then it doesn't really mean much.

Unfortunately, I was unable to watch the 5th movie to start off with since I didn\'t want to be awkwardly confused about what has happened. So I decided to check out all the Kara No Kyoukai movies.This movie was quite unique compared to the other anime I watch. Be it that there is actually FOR ONCE a strong female character in this movie. The male protagonist wasn\'t too girly either which gave me confidence to continue the movie. Anyways, the drawing of this movie...was well done and the makers did not cut-out any of the gore, which interested me even more because this is something that could in real life.I found the entire supernatural thing kind of off, but most anime has to have some sort of unique power to make a great storyline. Moreover, the story is very vague in the beginning, which gives the watcher a sense of confusion and the usual: ""What the heck is going on...""Thus I give this movie an overall rating of a 9. was well done and the makers did not cut-out any of the gore, which interested me even more because this is something that could in real life.I found the entire supernatural thing kind of off, but most anime has to have some sort of unique power to make a great storyline.

The melodies in the animation, on the other hand, are quite interesting and nice, which adds a bit to this hard-to-understand animation.The characters have their own characters despite the tangled plot, they are also not annoying, stupid and stereotypical like a crying idol or a character who only glows...with his chest.

Anyway, it\'s a movie series but people tend to judge it as this movie or that movie not the whole...mixture of the show. Yes, it\'s a slow-burn character and philosophy-driven, show with high visual storytelling.It\'s mainly for character introduction and world build. And just like any other nasuverse series, it takes place in a city where under the eyes of the general mass the play of soul and magic goes on. The aesthetic and dark urban settings of the show are second to none. The tone of the empty, abandoned city and the world crumbling night with the ghostly moon is so perfectly adapted. You will see tons of apartments and people lurking in the city but somehow you will feel it\'s hollow. Even to the point of carefully crafting the little-to-little background details. like the shabby street lights, broken signs, concretes, or washed road dots. The atmosphere is just peak. NO not even fate doesn\'t come close in these types of settings. If you have watched fate, tsukihime, or read other works of Nasuverse then I don\'t need to breakdown everything to you.

You have minimal knowledge of it's source material (Kara no Kyoukai Novel), prequel material (Tsukihime) and it's world (Nasuverse) apart from it being supposedly at the same setting as the Fate series with the same writer (Nasu). Chances are you just finished Fate/Zero and was yearning from something like it, people pointed you in this direction (Kara no Kyoukai) and you were on the verge of diving in like a madman plunging yourself in a story made of concrete that - by the way - you're wholly ignorant of but in the last...minute managed to stop yourself out of hesitation so here you are, reading a review to convince your hesitant mind on whether to push or pull. Ignorant and insane but wary.. I like that. Fear not for we are brothers! I'm in the same boat as you. :3Do note that I am reviewing this with no prior knowledge of the series, it's source material, world and prequel novel as I've stated above. I am also going in on this as a standalone episode, going through the next movies with the previous ones in mind and vice-versa so the existence of it's next movies doesn't really affect my opinion of this specific one.Story - 5/10Makes as much sense to me as why I was even born in this world. Yep, guessed it. That means zero (yes as a matter of fact I'm a guy who's wallowing in self-despair) sense. Though at this point in time, my ignorance prevents me from actually understanding what the nuts is up with this revered 'masterpiece' I think that the ambiguity behind the story to us plebeians reverberates some feeling of interest and thrill. Seems like there's actually some merit to it, as I've noticed that I was more attentive to detail and dialogue than I normally am - a result of trying to 'crack the code'. It might not have much of a story but the beauty is in digesting what you see as if you were a newborn chick so in that light, it's still entertaining even if you just don't know what the YOLK(tm) is going on. It's a mystery but from what I see it does seem to drop some hints for what's to come.Art - 8/10The visuals are great, eyecandy enough to call it splendid. Why just eight though? It might be that my standards are just high but I'm mainly attributing it to the fact that it's a movie. If this was a series then it'd be a ten but more time was spent on the production of this (and I guess more budget too) so I'm not really convinced that this is the best that they could've done. Then again, that might be just me.Sound - 6/10Yeah.. this is looking pretty subjective and I'm not trying to hide that. I was pretty disappointed because Yuki Kajiura is my favorite composer. It's a six because it is certainly slightly average and does accomplish the specific ambiance that both the composer and the directors were going for but it ends there. It's nothing more than achieving the goal - not trying to go beyond it.Character - 5/10The ensemble is nteresting enough to be quite entertaining to watch and decipher. I can't say much. I think that it's enough to be 'average', not good to upscale the balance but not bad to drag it down either. They're okay though they do seem to be of much depth, but that's really just a guess.Enjoyment and Overall Score - 6/10It's cool, pretty relaxing to watch actually.

This was the anime that made studio ufotable worth something. Prior to 2007 and The Garden of Sinners, the studio had not really done anything too notable. The studio was founded by former TMS Entertainment staff (Lupin the Third, Detective Conan), and interestingly enough Kara no Kyoukai was written by Kinoko Nasu and published by Type-Moon. Basically, The Garden of Sinners was the blue print for the Fate/Stay series and other popular Type-Moon productions.The Garden of Sinners main plot takes course over...seven movies. Our story takes place in Mifune City following the character Shiki Ryogi. These movies do not take place in chronological order. Each of the seven movies which in total amounts to about a 25 episode show are watched like a mystery novel where the viewer’s job is to put the pieces of the puzzle together. This puzzle consists of everything from combining the separate stories into one coherent story to stringing together character development for their actions and moods to make any sense. It really is an interesting and unique take to tell a story compared to any anime prior. Some would easily be put off by not watching the show in chronological order, but the point to the movies are to build up an extraordinary amount of suspense fitting for a mystery.Shiki possesses what is called the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. It is a powerful ability in which allows Shiki to see the death of all things. The plot focuses around her working at an agency that investigates “disturbing events.” There is the boss of the agency who is a mage known as Touko Aozaki, and there is Shiki’s friend who somehow finds his way into the agency as well called Mikiya Kokutou. The extra little interesting information is Shiki has dual personalities; one male and one female. Female Shiki is a bit shy and very unsociable while the male personality is outgoing and extremely violent. This disorder Shiki has creates complicated feelings, conversations, and interactions with Mikiya. Where the story has the interesting mystery sub-plot events the agency solves, there is the on-going main-plot of a string of murders where the male Shiki is involved leading up to an accident where Shiki ends up in a coma. That particular mystery is always present and thought about.The Garden of Sinners does have a slow start, long expositions of philosophical mind-bending questions, and inconsistent pacing. Animation is brilliant. It immediately attracts the viewer while the philosophy and high amount of symbolism keeps the mind working. Type-Moon knew how engage the audience with this grim, dark, and gritty mystery. No subject in human morals is missed throughout the seven movie journey from drug use, rape, suicide, and of course murder. Of course, have back to the animation and action. It might be one of the best visual experience for a human’s eyeballs. The atmosphere is filled with dark emotion yet maintains it despite a colourful mixture of deep purples, wild oranges and reds, blues from moonlight reflection, and an interesting use of turquois around characters to almost emit their personality. Plus, the choreography of action with music from Yuki Kajiura is among the best in anime seen at this point in time.However, where the series faults hard is what makes Kara no Kyoukai so interesting and that is the storytelling. This is pretty difficult to grasp with how complicated in can be while putting everything together over the course of seven movies. It is also very serious and pretty morbid most of the time making the viewer adapt to a certain dark mentality. Just from watching the first movie, it just throws the audience into the world and the characters without reason or backstory or development. It would not be unheard of for people to be irritated from that. Once more is the Type-Moon basic male character protagonist. In this case, Mikiya is boring, nonsensical, and overbearingly righteous. Plus, he has a little sister just pot-filled with too much energy. Mikiya is incredibly underwhelming and his actions really hurt the show and even Shiki both as a character and in the show. Mostly, Mikiya is there just to install emotions into Shiki with a proper build and emotional investment.Each movie is almost entirely self-contained with an interesting mystery to tell, but together with all the other movies, The Garden of Sinners is so much more. It is unique, brilliantly animated, amazing sound/music, atmospheric art, crazy-detailed backgrounds, and with unmatched lighting quality and effects it is a wonder how consistent the movies were with: 7 movies, all different directors, and 4 different animation directors! Just how?! Including just a wonderful ending to tie everything together, there is not too much to complain about. The Garden of Sinners is a wonderful ride that can now best be described for anime action fans as: an orgasm for your eyes, pure sensual intercourse for your ears, and multiple climaxes for your body. seven movies. Our story takes place in Mifune City following the character Shiki Ryogi. These movies do not take place in chronological order. Each of the seven movies which in total amounts to about a 25 episode show are watched like a mystery novel where the viewer’s job is to put the pieces of the puzzle together. This puzzle consists of everything from combining the separate stories into one coherent story to stringing together character development for their actions and moods to make any sense. It really is an interesting and unique take to tell a story compared to any anime prior. Some would easily be put off by not watching the show in chronological order, but the point to the movies are to build up an extraordinary amount of suspense fitting for a mystery.Shiki possesses what is called the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. It is a powerful ability in which allows Shiki to see the death of all things. The plot focuses around her working at an agency that investigates “disturbing events.” There is the boss of the agency who is a mage known as Touko Aozaki, and there is Shiki’s friend who somehow finds his way into the agency as well called Mikiya Kokutou. The extra little interesting information is Shiki has dual personalities; one male and one female. Female Shiki is a bit shy and very unsociable while the male personality is outgoing and extremely violent. This disorder Shiki has creates complicated feelings, conversations, and interactions with Mikiya. Where the story has the interesting mystery sub-plot events the agency solves, there is the on-going main-plot of a string of murders where the male Shiki is involved leading up to an accident where Shiki ends up in a coma. That particular mystery is always present and thought about.The Garden of Sinners does have a slow start, long expositions of philosophical mind-bending questions, and inconsistent pacing. Animation is brilliant. It immediately attracts the viewer while the philosophy and high amount of symbolism keeps the mind working. Type-Moon knew how engage the audience with this grim, dark, and gritty mystery. No subject in human morals is missed throughout the seven movie journey from drug use, rape, suicide, and of course murder. Of course, have back to the animation and action. It might be one of the best visual experience for a human’s eyeballs. The atmosphere is filled with dark emotion yet maintains it despite a colourful mixture of deep purples, wild oranges and reds, blues from moonlight reflection, and an interesting use of turquois around characters to almost emit their personality. Plus, the choreography of action with music from Yuki Kajiura is among the best in anime seen at this point in time.However, where the series faults hard is what makes Kara no Kyoukai so interesting and that is the storytelling. This is pretty difficult to grasp with how complicated in can be while putting everything together over the course of seven movies. It is also very serious and pretty morbid most of the time making the viewer adapt to a certain dark mentality. Just from watching the first movie, it just throws the audience into the world and the characters without reason or backstory or development. It would not be unheard of for people to be irritated from that. Once more is the Type-Moon basic male character protagonist. In this case, Mikiya is boring, nonsensical, and overbearingly righteous. Plus, he has a little sister just pot-filled with too much energy. Mikiya is incredibly underwhelming and his actions really hurt the show and even Shiki both as a character and in the show. Mostly, Mikiya is there just to install emotions into Shiki with a proper build and emotional investment.Each movie is almost entirely self-contained with an interesting mystery to tell, but together with all the other movies, The Garden of Sinners is so much more. It is unique, brilliantly animated, amazing sound/music, atmospheric art, crazy-detailed backgrounds, and with unmatched lighting quality and effects it is a wonder how consistent the movies were with: 7 movies, all different directors, and 4 different animation directors! Just how?! Including just a wonderful ending to tie everything together, there is not too much to complain about. The Garden of Sinners is a wonderful ride that can now best be described for anime action fans as: an orgasm for your eyes, pure sensual intercourse for your ears, and multiple climaxes for your body.', ""Kara No Kyoukai is just as promising as it sounds. With breathtaking cinematography, a very well-crafted story, and an unforgettable soundtrack, this first installment does not disappoint.To begin with praising the writing, one can confidently say by simply watching the first movie of the series that this may easily be regarded as Nasu's magnum opus, surpassing even the critically-acclaimed Fate/Stay Night franchise. Right from the beginning, you can tell the weight and depth of the plot, even if you've not yet fully experienced it, owed mainly to the masterful execution carried out by Ufotable. The movie lets you taste the writing slowly but steadily, building...itself up to a visually stunning climax that wraps up the thrill and suspense of the film in a beautiful manner. Although not giving you too much in terms of plot (certainly something that other people find annoying), it gives you just enough to keep you intrigued about what is to come.That isn't to say this is the absolute best work of film in anime. Though relatively minor, the movie does suffer from flaws in two areas:1. The first one is how dialogue-heavy the film is. Though personally not much of an issue, the viewer may find it off-putting once or twice when watching the amount of attention that is demanded to fully comprehend the narrative.2. The characters are not portrayed with the kind of depth they deserve. I personally find this bearable considering this is the first of a seven part series, but if we're being just, a spade needs to be called a spade.Overall though, the highs of the film greatly overshadow its lows, and provided you can digest some extremely heavy content (being labelled R does not do justice to the intense atmosphere of the movie, and from what I've heard, later installments are even more gruesome), this is a film that puts to shame many if not most productions of the anime industry. itself up to a visually stunning climax that wraps up the thrill and suspense of the film in a beautiful manner.

The start of the movie screamed potential it just went nowhere.  I felt as if so many of the aspects of other amazing shows we right there but this movie really didn't push any of them. Pretty much nothing happened the entire time I watched. I believe that the mysterious aspect of the movie was done great, just I wish I was given an explanation, or at least some material where I could make some inferences during my watch. Bits of the fights were really enjoyable,...yet straightforward. Now some scenes, very visually appealing to me, but they had no context. Most of the time its just a depressing feel with the characters reflecting. I found this to be a repetitive Ryan anime. yet straightforward. Now some scenes, very visually appealing to me, but they had no context. Most of the time its just a depressing feel with the characters reflecting. I found this to be a repetitive Ryan anime."", 'Though this is only the first movie I\'ve seen out of the entire Kara no Kyoukai series of movies, it\'s certainly done enough for me to warrant a series of reviews to go along with each movie. This one in particular, titled ""Overlooking View"", was one I genuinely enjoyed and occupied a sort of emotional space that comes off as very unique to me.Paired with ufotable\'s masterclass artwork, which looked damn good by 2007 standards, Overlooking View felt more like a visible and kinetic piece of poetry rather than an anime. Whether it was the atmosphere it presented or even the philosophical dialogue that came...in spurts throughout its 50-minute runtime, I just felt like there was something that just kept me intrigued all the way through.Story (8)The story felt a little convoluted and maybe it went nowhere at points, but the events of the film flowed really well and the pacing was nicely done. It didn\'t feel too long or too short; Extended shots either dragged or it held long enough to convey emotion, and when it did there was legitimate tension in the air. The entire atmosphere of the story was dark and gloomy, and it was unafraid to do so; in handling a serious story, there were no out-of-place comedic moments, and the consistent tone throughout was something that made the experience a lot more compelling.The story of Overlooking View not only asks important questions about existentialism and the inherent meaning of suicide, but also on a more broad scale and what it means to die itself. Choosing to die for purposeful reasons or for no reason at all brings about entirely different outcomes; you\'re either floating or flying to escape the world. Whether we as people choose to live or not, the choice is presented to us to shape our own futures, and despite making mistakes, we have the choice to either let it die with us or let it influence us to make the right choice further down the line. It\'s remarkably profound, and even if it was rather spelled out through dialogue rather than shown, it\'s still impactful to listen to.Art (10)I don\'t have much to say about ufotable\'s art style and choices, because it\'ll be like a broken record talking and hearing the same spiel about how great it is. They\'re the same people who animated the beautifully-done Fate series, and even though this series came long before Fate/Zero or UBW the top-notch art direction is still there. Shiki\'s eye design may be my favorite eyes in all of anime that I have ever seen, and although none of the character designs are really standout, they\'re realistic enough to contribute to its real-world-esque setting.Sound (10)Soundtracks in anime don\'t really stand out to me unless they clearly and completely dominate the experience, and Kara no Kyoukai\'s music may just be the best example of this. Sound design contributes IMMENSELY to the atmosphere of a film or show, and all of the sounds and songs and bells and whistles in Overlooking View were done to perfection. The angelic-yet-dark feeling of the music felt grand and intense, and it was utilized extremely well to the point where I got tense and breath-taken just watching the entire movie play out. The music amps itself up during important and compelling moments, making them all the more memorable.Character (7)Character gets a 7 for setting up the characters for future episodes really well, as I wasn\'t really given much in such a story-driven film. The cast itself is really small, and I left with more questions than answers, but they\'re interesting enough to where I want to watch more to learn more.The main character of this series is Shiki Ryougi, a seemingly apathetic ghostbuster with supernatural abilities. Not much is said about her or explored much in this first film, and that\'s part of the mystery of not only the story but her character herself: who is she? It\'s apparent that she is special amongst a cast of normal humans, possessing an ability within her eyes to see death itself and destroy it. She\'s a certified badass, but it seems to come at a cost as she\'s rather cold, distant and unemotional, even possessing an artificial arm that\'s yet to be explained. The preview to the second film hinted at an incoming backstory, so it\'s something I\'m definitely looking forward to as she shows a lot of potential as a character.The other main character, Touko Aozaki, is a puppetmaker who also helps run a detective agency Shiki works for. Everything philosophical, existential, or thematic that\'s told in the film is told through her words, her perspective, and almost works as a pseudo-narrator in this sense. She asks important questions that not only are asked towards the other characters, but to us, the viewers, as well - while I do think this is crucially important to the themes and literary implications of this series, I can find it a little excessive and she\'s not really explored as a character other than that. Of course, this is most likely bound to change since this is only Film #1 out of many so I can\'t pass judgement so far.Mikiya Kokutou is the only male character in the main trio, and hardly any screentime is given to him to establish his character in this film alone; That said, his story is presumably going to be tied to Shiki\'s, as he spends most of his screentime within her presence. He\'s shown to be quite caring for Shiki, and despite her reluctance to accept his kindness, he still goes out of his way to help her. Like I\'ve been repeating, this is only one part of a whole, and at this point there\'s a base for his character to walk on, so it\'s not like he\'s a waste of space but rather setting up to be important later down the line.Enjoyment (10)It was an enjoyable ride all the way through. Despite the characters being really underdeveloped (which I can excuse, I interpret it as a way to intensify the various mysteries of this series and I\'ll learn more about them in due time), the atmosphere it brought was so strong and the soundtrack was so moving it was impossible to look away from what I was watching. Beautiful, powerful, and grand, it checked all the boxes for what makes a show memorable to me.Overall (9)As a standalone movie, it leaves with more questions than answers, which would probably make me give it a 7 - however, given that this is the setup to a much larger story, it\'s a great starting point for me to build on. The characters, especially Shiki, seem interesting, the plot is more than what I see unfold on the screen, and the combination of ufotable\'s beautiful artwork and masterclass soundtrack leave me wanting even more of this series. The beauty of movie series is seeing how the parts add up to a whole, and as I will continue to progress through the Garden of Sinners, I can only hope to find the mysteries as fulfilling as this one. in spurts throughout its 50-minute runtime, I just felt like there was something that just kept me intrigued all the way through.Story (8)The story felt a little convoluted and maybe it went nowhere at points, but the events of the film flowed really well and the pacing was nicely done.

This aspect of the series is a clear 10/10 with the most gorgeous and fluid animation you\'re ever going to find, extreme attention to detail, excellent lighting effects and a genuine cinematic quality to the way the entire series is shot and presented. This is the gold standard of what presentation in anime can be.Having purchased the official (quite expensive) Aniplex blu ray release...of this series, my expectations of quality and polish are very, very high. So, while the English subtitles were correct 99% of the time, I did nevertheless still notice a handful of mistakes here and there, sometimes as egregious as misspelling the word ""somewhere"" as ""somehwere"", and I feel that for over 200 USD I deserve better. If you\'re going to charge me insane, over the moon prices like that (nearly 30 dollars per movie, many of which are under 1 hour in length) it should absolutely be somebody\'s job to watch the series with English subs and catch these things. I would have appreciated a little more polish.Because I watched with subs and I\'m a non Japanese speaker I don\'t have too much to say about the voice acting itself. I wouldn\'t know how good or not good of a job someone is doing at pronouncing words and whatnot, but no one\'s voice felt blatantly out of place or not matching the character in my eyes.Yuki Kajiura is my favorite composer on the planet and I deeply enjoy and appreciate all of her work. This soundtrack is very distinctively hers and feels very similar, sometimes TOO similar, to a number of her previous works. She\'s very solid and consistent with what she does so you know when she\'s on the team you\'re going to get a high quality soundtrack, which you do indeed get here, but comparing her to herself I don\'t know that this is an all timer among her bigger picture catalog. It\'s just another solid, respectable entry but nothing truly stood out to me as different or better when compared to her previous works.The pacing for the series as a whole, while never outright dragging, never felt fantastic either. More or less there was always forward momentum, but somewhat slowly. Certainly one episode in particular felt very bloated to me, which is exasperated by the fact that the lengths of the episodes vary significantly. Several of them are in the vicinity of 40 or 50 minutes whereas two of them are in the vicinity of 2 hours. I was never ready to fall asleep from boredom, but there were absolutely a few slower stretches.The action scenes, like everything else about the presentation, were fluid and gorgeous, and arguably the high points of the series, but I feel there weren\'t as many of them as I\'d like. At the end of the day we\'re looking at about ten hours of total content and within that there\'s probably a dozen or 15 action sequences, which with 30+ minute gaps between them sometimes can feel a bit sparse at times.Character development was lacking throughout the entirety of the series. Only the main character, Shiki, gets delved into somewhat deeply but then it really drops off a cliff. Even the male lead is largely unexplained and undeveloped and any secondary characters beyond that are developed at a surface level at best.The story itself is difficult to discuss without inadvertent spoilers, but I definitely found it convoluted and hard to follow and I spent a large portion of my viewing experience confused and feeling like I\'m not getting it. The final episode resolves things somewhat, but it doesn\'t do enough, and at the end of my first watch through I\'d say I 70% get it, but I definitely am still unclear on several things.I\'m totally fine with the decision to present the movies out of chronological order, and I think that is just a storytelling technique that helps build the mystery and keep the viewer guessing, but I also feel if you\'re going to do that you need to be very, very clear with your resolution and your payoff and I don\'t think we got that here. This is ABSOLUTELY one of those anime where a viewer would likely understand it more and appreciate it more after watching it a second time, especially in chronological order, but to that I\'d say should I have to? I feel I should be able to watch the entirety of the series once and at least fully understand what was going on at its conclusion.At the end of the day I liked this series more than I disliked it, and the presentation is simply stunning, but at the same time I don\'t feel confident saying it\'s worth its hefty price tag assuming you\'re purchasing it the legal, ethical way, nor do I feel overly inclined to jump back in and watch it again anytime soon, knowing full well I\'d probably understand it better and appreciate it more if I did, because the pacing is mediocre as a whole and it\'s a fairly lengthy time commitment. So, summing it all up, it\'s probably worth a watch once if you can stream it or borrow it for a friend or acquire it some way other than shelling out over 200 dollars, but I don\'t see this as a ""must have"" or an all time masterpiece. I really wish I could review anime WITHOUT factoring in price, but in a world of 20 and 30 dollar full series, when you\'re asking for literally 10x that amount, expectations are higher. I don\'t know that this necessarily meets them.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5-7.75PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7.25-7.75 of this series, my expectations of quality and polish are very, very high.

While this may not be the best starting point for an uninitiated, it does have several qualities that make it a good place to start consuming elements of the Nasuverse, namely the fact that it is a good stand alone film that doesn't rely too heavily on the deeper lore and backstory of the world.STORY/ENJOYMENTAs a single film, disregarding it's connection to the Nasuverse, this film is a crime/mystery drama...that treats the supernatural. The meat of the story is the mystery surrounding the apparent suicides of a number of young high school age girls, all from falling to their deaths from the room the of the same abandoned building. As such, the film builds up this mystery very well, building extra tension into the incident by having the it personally affect the main character Shiki, who was investigating it. The pacing of the story is the film's strong point, keeping you intrigued throughout the film as to the cause of the incidents.CHARACTERThe characterization of the main characters is slight and, occurring mostly at the beginning and end of the film and, if I had to give the film a low score it would be here. But, there is enough to keep the story interesting and get you interested in the characters and lore surrounding them. Also, there is more characterization in the following films, so we can be forgiving of the lack of it here.ANIMATIONIt's crazy to think Ufotable hadn't done much before touching these films. Because of the Fate Series, Ufotable is now known as a powerhouse animation company that can accomplish a lot within it's budget. The animation in this film is not on the same level as later works like Fate/Zero or even other films in the Kara No Kyoukai series, but it is still incredible when compared to other films of the era. You will not be disappointed by the animation in this film.SOUNDThe score for the film is also great, adding tension to the murder-mystery, and longing to the deeper scenes of the film. Quiet when it needs to be, and intense when it needs to be. It's nothing revolutionary, but is interesting when looking at the perspective of how it acts as a precursor to later works in the Nasuverse.OVERALLWith everything together, I would give this film a solid 7/10. It's an enjoyable film with a strong supernatural-mystery edge. If you enjoy other parts of the Nasuvere, or have a love for mystery, this film is for you. If you would like to get into films/shows in the Nasuverse, this isn't a bad place to start, as it doesn't rely too heavily on the lore of the world and is easy to follow. that treats the supernatural.

Because of the Fate Series, Ufotable is now known as a powerhouse animation company that can accomplish a lot within it's budget. The animation in this film is not on the same level as later works like Fate/Zero or even other films in the Kara No Kyoukai series, but it is still incredible when compared to other films of the era. You will not be disappointed by the animation in this film.SOUNDThe score for the film is also great, adding tension to the murder-mystery, and longing to the deeper scenes of the film. Quiet when it needs to be, and intense when it needs to be. It's nothing revolutionary, but is interesting when looking at the perspective of how it acts as a precursor to later works in the Nasuverse.OVERALLWith everything together, I would give this film a solid 7/10. It's an enjoyable film with a strong supernatural-mystery edge. If you enjoy other parts of the Nasuvere, or have a love for mystery, this film is for you. If you would like to get into films/shows in the Nasuverse, this isn't a bad place to start, as it doesn't rely too heavily on the lore of the world and is easy to follow."", ""A few things I wanted to note about this movie series.The later movies if you are watching them in order, are significantly better than the first 3. This is more of a show that is in movie format, and so even though I gave this movie a 7, the following movies get progressively deeper into the story and characters. The first movie is not indicative of the final state of the story once you have watched all the movies. It has a very monogatari like system, where the deeper you go, the better it gets.That being said, the first movie (and all the following) have...your signature ufotable quality to them. You can't say anything negative about the art or sound, which is probably their defining trait.I would also say that although my enjoyment is a 10/10, it took me watching this movie series twice to wrap my head around all of the plot points. It is in fact that complex, and not super easy to understand. This is a high effort high reward series and don't be fooled by the simplicity of the first movie or lack of details, as those will build upon each other through out and have an absolutely fantastic finish. your signature ufotable quality to them.

The story sometimes goes nowhere and calling it confusing is an understatement. Its also very true that the pseudo-philosophical conversations drag on too long and often times make no sense once you strip back the big words and look at what's actually being said.However: ive never seen an anime that gripped me this much with its atmosphere. The confusion is partially intentional because the mystery adds to the atmosphere (even though the unintentional confusion...is still definitely there and is a legitimate flaw) and as such i dont advice watching it in chronological order. Watch it in the release order even though you will be completely lost a large portion of the time.Accept the confusion and mystery and let yourself be absorbed by the dark and depressing yet still hopeful mood of the show.I also found it helps, when another speech is being given that doesnt really make sense, to just pretend like it does make sense and that its profound. This sounds stupid but it works: just act as if something very deep was just said because most of the time the actual content of the speeches doesnt matter and its more the effect they have on the characters that is truly relevant.The episodes/movies have their ups and downs with episode 6 and 8 being my least favourite, although they are still absolutely worth a watch.Basically: you can pick this show apart if you really want to but it would be a waste because a small amount of suspension of judgement landed this a place in my top 10 favourite anime of all time is still definitely there and is a legitimate flaw) and as such i dont advice watching it in chronological order.

This is the same studio that also did Fate/Zero and the other two Fate/Stay Night routes, in addition to that he also did Kimetsu no Yaiba. The animation is splendid for all these animes, except I really prefer Kara no Kyoukai's style.The soundtrack is also very characteristic, it is very striking, it has a lot of identity and it looks like the others that will be shown throughout the film, in addition to the fact that the franchise maintains a standard, so there is a basis and the strands of this  base,...which makes the soundtrack quite identifiable.  That's really good.And now let's talk about what really matters. The script of the film and its messages. The film already begins with a suicide scene, and with butterflies to represent death symbolically.In Japan, butterflies have some meanings for their symbolism, but what it really ends up representing for this scene here, is that butterflies are seen as traveling spirits, and when they appear, they announce a visit or the death of a close person  .But at the same time, there is a whole lot of suicides that don't make much sense in that building, and in that you can remember the dragonfly showing up too. The dragonfly has several meanings in the symbolism, both good and bad, but here in this scene of the film it represents doubts and confusions, to contextualize with the meaning of the butterfly.There is another meaning for the dragonfly, when it comes to that same scene, only that it only reveals itself at the end of the film, so when I'm there for the end of the review, I'll bring this discussion back.The butterfly doesn’t represent the death of someone close, because it wasn’t really a person close to Shiki, so the dragonfly is very close to that.This is a film that has a very strong and precise psychoanalysis, of why a person ends up committing suicide when he has contact with height. The film speaks in a more complex way, but basically it has a dialogue that shows that the person builds up courage as he gets closer to higher places, until he loses track of the danger and everything becomes one.But it is clear that this is a subtext of the film in relation to all this, since its main characteristic is the supernatural, so there is also another way to observe what is happening through it.The villain develops a supernatural power by being lonely, wanting friends and wanting to escape the outside world. The outside world would basically function like the Earth itself, in this approach, so it is for all of this that it ends up developing a second personality that acts for it in the spirit world, which automatically causes it to control two astral bodies in one terrestrial body.In contrast, the protagonist Shiki Ryougi has a supernatural power to be able to see the thread of life and death not only of people, but also of all the things that exist in the spiritual world and in the terrestrial world, but in this film this is not so clear  like this; I only know this because I’ve watched the entire series and I’m watching it again. The first film is very vague in the context of the series itself, but after having seen it once, it is perfect.The chronological date of this film is September 1998, which is an absurd coincidence since September 10 was chosen worldwide to be the day of prevention against suicide;  it is because of this that September was chosen here in Brazil to be the month of suicide prevention, and yes, this is all a coincidence, because Kara no Kyoukai's novel was published in 1998 and September 10 was only sanctioned as  the world suicide day in 2003.And I'm talking about all this because in the end the objective of this film is to be there to discuss with the viewer what suicide means, what makes a person commit suicide and whether suicide really is a correct way to end all your suffering.Mikiya's statements during his dialogue with Shiki, saying that suicide is an escape and that in fact he is also a line of suffering for facing death, as well as facing the suffering of staying alive fighting his sadness, are fragments  of a dialogue that for me are totally cohesive.Many people can say that the theme of this film is beaten and that their discussions are too simple, or that they do not collaborate with the viewer, because there is nothing very new being presented, but I would disagree if someone said that.This film has a very big role in several aspects, and within its narrative it is extremely dense and necessary. Debating with people about suicide, no matter how many times and in how many different media it happens, is very important.There are forums and problematic songs that encourage suicide, so it is always interesting and important to see some media dealing with this matter with seriousness and complexity, seeing mainly that Kara no Kyoukai is an anime;  something that comes from Japan trying to debate with people about suicide, is extremely important, since the country itself unfortunately has several problems with this.The film does not encourage suicide at any time, and it also does not leave a message on the part of its script, but it does leave a question to the viewer.Mikiya functions as the brain of the author and the basis of thought for all the main characters there in that film, with their dialogues saying that suicide is an escape and that you should think carefully before taking the courage to commit the same.The scene of Mikiya's dream even talks a lot about the whole symbolism of the dragonfly and butterfly at the beginning of the film, since his dream was exactly what we saw at the opening of the same. In addition to the butterfly signifying the death of someone, and the dragonfly signifying life, in this second approach from the point of view of that scene, the film does not let you understand everything only through symbolism, and it tries to explain to you in a way that is not so chewed that  the butterfly was the girl from the hospital and Mikiya was the dragonfly.Both Mikiya and the dragonfly would also represent a hopeful person who sees meaning in life and does not want to surrender easily to death, just like the hospital girl and the butterfly also represent a negative person who is trying to drag someone with himself because he feels alone on the terrestrial plane and you will probably feel alone on the spiritual plane.This film does not give you the answer about what suicide is and whether it is wrong or not to commit suicide, but the questioning is super valid and functional, so I really like how he treats it here.  It is not simply someone wanting to lay down the rules of their life, but a movie wanting to show you that this will never be the best way out of something, and that problems can be solved.For those people who still need a way to guide themselves, the post-credit scene in this film carries a short dialogue between Azaka and Touko, where Azaka says she doesn't understand why people commit suicide, or what goes on in the mind of a person thinking about committing suicide, and Touko is quite extremist in the response, saying that there is no reason for a person to kill himself.That sentence alone says a lot and I agree with it.  Once again, this film does not need to take the viewer's hand and go on explaining its metaphors, analogies and questions, but he even does this from time to time out of generosity.With all this supernatural outfits, the great ufotable animation and the extremely epic soundtrack, my note for Kara no Kyoukai's first film is 10.I really don't see any problems with this film. There are some moments when some people may end up bothering, such as Touka going to talk to the patient at the hospital, and then people may find this scene extremely convenient to explain to the viewer everything that is going on there...But honestly, I think that scene is necessary; it is obvious that Touka was going to ask questions of the girl, the purpose of the film is to ask the viewer about suicide and that dialogue is super important, apart from the fact that Touka works to solve the case of oddities in that world, so this is super plausible  even for the work's fanciful script. which makes the soundtrack quite identifiable.

When show is more chamber-like, portraying the psychological tension between characters it can be very successful,  but also too often falls in pathetic tone and self-indulgence.

This isn't a professional review & is more of a rantview on my disapproval to put it very nicely towards to the first 3 Kara no Kyoukai movies (but in particular the first & second movie which is why I'm pasting it for a review here). Also there's probably spoilers so caution is advisedI'm not someone who usually goes against the grain when it comes to beloved anime. Most of my favorites are acclaimed popular shows & my 2nd favorite anime is Cowboy Bebop. That's not to say I don't have my unpopular opinions...though, I think Toradora is the worst romance anime you can find, Fate/Zero is some of the most unrelentlessly boring garbage I've ever watched &, although I'm not sure how unpopular this take is or not, but the Girls & Panzer series is the bane of my existence. In this blog I'll be ranting what's possibly my most unpopular & disagreeable opinion in that I cannot fucking stand the Kara no Kyoukai movies. I think everything about them is atrocious & an amalgamation of what I don't want out of the anime I watch. To set the record straight I've only seen the first 3 movies, I haven't seen the 5th one (and I never will) because I already hate the first 3 on a level unlike anything else & from what everyone praises about the 5th movie it sounds exactly like the things I hate about this series. I'll also throw out that this isn't going to be professional at all, this is 100% unbiased raging about a series of movies I hate, this hit piece is going to be almost entirely unfair to these movies because I just don't know any other way to put it.To sum up why I hate these movies, I have 3 reasons, the art design, the characters, & the directing. I’ll start off with the art design. Many think these movies look amazing, I think they look absolutely awful personally. The movies are way too dark to a point where I can see my own reflection on my monitor whilst watching these movies. If the response to this is “turn the brightness on your monitor up”. Then I’ll firstly reply with “Thanks, I never thought of that before”. Secondly, even if that did work & didn’t wash out the picture to make it a washed out mess that ironically makes the image harder to look at, I should not under any circumstance have to pause the movie & turn up the brightness because some slacker incompetent on the art design doesn’t know how to light the environments properly. I’ll also need to bring up the color design, which I also find really terrible. Due to the lighting on the environments everything just starts blending together to a point where I have trouble making out main characters in a scene where the camera is placed far away in some vein effort to try & give this world scope. The tone of colors I also find very dreary to look at, taking harsh tones that, in an environment I already don’t like looking at, only adds further to the dark, depressing, dull looking world of these movies. If that was what UFOtable was going for, then I guess they succeeded at it if the colors make the movie even more unbearable to look at than it already was. Before I end this segment, I’ll quickly give that I think the character designs are generic & have with them that exact light novel character design aesthetic that I fucking depise, so there’s that.Next I’ll tackle the characters, which I hate. I find the characters frustratingly uninteresting, which in a story driven series that has huge bouts of character dialogue to try & explain the story which takes itself completely seriously, is not a good thing. Shiki Ryougi in particular is my most hated anime character of all time because she’s just nothing to me. Sure things happen to her, but because a lot of the character growth for her in the 2nd movie comes from character dialogue that I find completely uninteresting because of the flat directing it’s not good & doesn’t make me interesting in learning about Shiki or seeing her succeed. If you were to watch the movies in release order (which I did before giving up after the 3rd one) I also think that movie fails at making me want to learn anything about Shiki because that movie couldn’t of made Shiki more dull a character if she was a brick wall with legs, hell a brick wall with legs would be more interesting that Shiki Ryougi in the first movie. The rest of the characters in these movies are equally as uninteresting as our main heroine there’s the token male, the female information gather, & a whole bunch of nothingness elsewhere. I seriously hate how underwhelming & lame I find all of these characters to be. I also despise the voice acting in these movies. If the voice direction for Maya Sakamoto as Shiki was supposed to be “sound like you give absolutely no fucks at all & are only doing this for a pay-check” than she succeeded alright. But in my opinion this performance from Mrs. Sakamoto is absolutely pathetic. Shiki rarely ever changes her tone of voice (at least from what I saw) so I could never tell if she was supposed to be happy, angry, or whatever. A performance completely devoid of personality the line “I am Bender please insert girder” from that one episode of Futurama in which Bender loses his memory chip & basically becomes a vegetable until he gets it backs has more personality & sounds like it has some character to it. Fucking Rei Ayanami from Evangelion, a character that is supposed to be an emotionless doll (at first glance anyway) brings with her a performance that sounds like it actually has some character behind it, for fucks sake the voice acting in these movies are horrible. The other characters? Pretty much the same as Shiki. Completely uninteresting voice performances that sound like the voice actors only cared about getting a paycheck instead of giving a memorable (for the right reasons) performance to their characters.The final segment I have to talk about is the directing. Which to the surprise of nobody, I absolutely detest. I’ve heard from some fans of KnK (mainly Digibro in his top 27 anime video) that “KnK is more about its atmosphere, characters, & action than the actual story which is pretentious” (his words not mine). As I’ve already established, I hate the characters so 0 for 1 already. But I can actually buy KnK being heavily about the atmosphere, after all, I love Haibane Renmei, Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou, & Aria. All series which, aren’t the strongest when it comes to narrative, but accel at creating an atmosphere, world, & characters I absolutely adore. Hell a lot of my favorites are favorites because the atmosphere does play into them, my favorite anime Maison Ikkoku is my favorite partially because of how well the atmosphere plays off of everything in that series. What I’m getting at here is that I appreciate me a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, because I’ve already established that I hate how bleak the world of Kara no Kyoukai looks, how I don’t like the character designs, I think the world just in general isn’t really interesting, among with everything else I’ve mentioned. I hope you can understand my frustrations with how this movies approach to building atmosphere is to put a slow panning shot over an absolutely disgusting environment that I don’t like looking at in some shitty attempt to mask the exponentially tedious dialogue that KnK loves to spout from time to time. Yuki Kajira’s music, while one of the more tolerable aspects of this series I think is unmemorable & they don’t take enough opportunities to use it for some good atmosphere building. I’ve seen Hunter x Hunter come under fire from people for having expository dialogue, which isn’t exactly wrong. But why Hunter x Hunter gets away with it is quite simple really, Madhouse was able to make amazing use out of that kick ass soundtrack & make the exposition scenes feel more epic than they actually are. Plus Hunter x Hunter will usually have something interesting going on in the background or an environment that isn’t completely disgusting to look at like KnK, so Hunter x Hunter has that going for it. The action directing in these movies admittedly can be great showcases of directing, but because they’re so far between & placed well after I’ve become frustrated & angry at the absolutely piss poor directing elsewhere in the movie, they fail to capture my attention or really leave an impact because once the action scene is over it goes back to showcasing slow panning shots or long landscape shots over disgusting environments that I can’t stand looking at. So the action directing & good sound design can’t even be appreciated.At the end of the day, I just don’t know what to say about these movies anymore. From the unbearable directing, awful voice acting, frustratingly boring characters, & atrocious art design I just don’t know what to say anymore. I am genuinely feeling a 0/10 for these movies. Not even a strong 0 to a light 1. Just a 0, because these movies offer me absolutely no enjoyment, I didn’t even enjoy writing this post because I just hate these movies that much but I must say I do feel better now that this is out there (even though I doubt many will read this). I’ve also made myself a very unpopular guy now but shit, I already claimed Toradora as the worst romance anime ever, at this point, I have nothing else to lose. though, I think Toradora is the worst romance anime you can find, Fate/Zero is some of the most unrelentlessly boring garbage I've ever watched &, although I'm not sure how unpopular this take is or not, but the Girls & Panzer series is the bane of my existence. In this blog I'll be ranting what's possibly my most unpopular & disagreeable opinion in that I cannot fucking stand the Kara no Kyoukai movies. I think everything about them is atrocious & an amalgamation of what I don't want out of the anime I watch. To set the record straight I've only seen the first 3 movies, I haven't seen the 5th one (and I never will) because I already hate the first 3 on a level unlike anything else & from what everyone praises about the 5th movie it sounds exactly like the things I hate about this series. I'll also throw out that this isn't going to be professional at all, this is 100% unbiased raging about a series of movies I hate, this hit piece is going to be almost entirely unfair to these movies because I just don't know any other way to put it.To sum up why I hate these movies, I have 3 reasons, the art design, the characters, & the directing. I’ll start off with the art design. Many think these movies look amazing, I think they look absolutely awful personally. The movies are way too dark to a point where I can see my own reflection on my monitor whilst watching these movies. If the response to this is “turn the brightness on your monitor up”. Then I’ll firstly reply with “Thanks, I never thought of that before”. Secondly, even if that did work & didn’t wash out the picture to make it a washed out mess that ironically makes the image harder to look at, I should not under any circumstance have to pause the movie & turn up the brightness because some slacker incompetent on the art design doesn’t know how to light the environments properly. I’ll also need to bring up the color design, which I also find really terrible. Due to the lighting on the environments everything just starts blending together to a point where I have trouble making out main characters in a scene where the camera is placed far away in some vein effort to try & give this world scope. The tone of colors I also find very dreary to look at, taking harsh tones that, in an environment I already don’t like looking at, only adds further to the dark, depressing, dull looking world of these movies. If that was what UFOtable was going for, then I guess they succeeded at it if the colors make the movie even more unbearable to look at than it already was. Before I end this segment, I’ll quickly give that I think the character designs are generic & have with them that exact light novel character design aesthetic that I fucking depise, so there’s that.Next I’ll tackle the characters, which I hate.

Having finished all the parts, I wanted to share some thoughts. First of all, I watched the anime Garden of Sinners chronologically and not by release date. In my opinion, this is also the best way to watch it to have the proper sequence. The story is set in a real world but with magical abilities.The year is 1998, and news of a series of suicides is spreading through the media. Our two main protagonists, Shiki Ryougi and Mikiya Kokutou, attend the same class and often hang out together on the school roof...during breaks. Both seem interested in these incidents. Shiki appears to be a complex person, making it often difficult for Mikiya to reach her. We soon learn the reason: Shiki has two personalities. One of them is a normal girl, while the other is a cold and very distant person, even driven by thoughts of murder. Mikiya has a contact in the police who updates him on the latest developments in the investigations whenever he visits. We learn that the bodies have been dismembered, so the authorities now suspect murder instead of suicide. As Mikiya begins to suspect that Shiki might be behind these incidents, he starts to watch her. He sits outside her estate every night until morning to ensure she doesn't leave the house. One evening, Shiki has had enough and confronts him, attacking him with a knife and attempting to kill him. Something happens, and she is stopped at the last moment. To avoid spoiling the plot, I’ll leave it at that and encourage you to watch it yourself.The first film begins chronologically with the second episode.Overall, Garden of Sinners has a very dark story, with intentionally rough and dark colors. The atmosphere is intense. With Touko Aozaki, we get another main character who is a magician and now acts as a contractor. Her character seemed serious to me. Nevertheless, she cared a lot about Shiki. When there were new cases, she assigned the missions. She often used Mikiya to gather information, and Shiki's task was to apprehend the murderer.I liked the animation and character design, and the sound was excellent in some scenes.But no review is complete without criticism.The supporting characters in each episode felt like they were only there to be defeated at the end. You knew there was a new murderer to be defeated in each film, making it quickly monotonous and predictable. They were neither interesting nor could you connect with them because you knew little about them. There were also often unnecessary conversations that were quite lengthy, so I had to skip scenes several times. I also felt that Mikiya was merely an instrument to shape Shiki's character. Without him, she would have probably ended up as a murderer. He always reasoned with her. Shiki's character only changed somewhat towards the end of the film series, so I wouldn't talk much about character development here. The film series also had its ups and downs. The episodes were not always exciting enough to captivate you.Here’s how I rated the films (in chronological order)Film 1 (7/10)Films 2-5 (6/10)Film 6 (5/10)Films 7-8 (6/10) during breaks.

So,rather than reviewing it each part as a standalone movie, I would have preferred to review it as a whole. But sadly it isn’t possible, so I will try as best as I can to review the “bizarre” 1st part of the seriesStory: (7/10)The story is bizarre indeed. It starts off normally with the meetings of a normal looking girl Shiki and a guy named Kokutou but then takes a very bizarre turn throwing the viewers into confusion. The whole story felt like something happening in the...middle of an ongoing arc while providing little to no explanations whatsoever. Now, do remember that this is supposed to be part of a long movie series and it may/will get explained in the future movies, so the messed up chronological order is also supposed to be the way the story is to be consumed. Besides, as a sucker for mystery/supernatural, I felt intrigued throughout the whole show albeit knowing nothing but this may generally cause boredom for a causal watcher. Also the plot kind of gets weird at the end and I really can’t explain it without spoiling it. Nevertheless, I genuinely found the story intriguing and engaging and this is really amazing considering I had zero clues about what I was watching throughout the whole movie. Hopefully I will get to understand the world a little bit more in the next part.N.B. Be aware that the story deals with sensitive issues such as suicide. It is basically the “theme” of the first episode in a way. Also it gets dark pretty quick. So, expect much gore and bloodshed.Characters: (7/10)Reviewing this part is the hardest. In a 50 minute movies which is also happens to be in the middle of an arc providing no background information to the viewers, from a general p.o.v I would say pretty weak cast. But then again this is part of a long series and I genuinely found the main trio interesting despite knowing little to nothing about them. So, giving this part benefit of the doubt is probably the right thing to do (or not heh).Art: (8/10)The character designs aren’t something unique but flows well with the overall environment of the story. The mixing of cgi and 2d was done really well especially in the buildings. The animations or the little fight scenes shown were fluid and smooth but nothing praiseworthy. Overall, decent art style and animation as expected from a movie.Sound: (10/10)My favorite part of the show. The studio did a perfect job in blending the sound with the overall environment. One prime example would be the ghost girl’s laughter. Literally gave me chills in the middle of the night. Well done.Enjoyment: (8/10)The movie was short and it was intriguing albeit being kind of confused(expected) and bored sometimes. Give it a try if you are into mystery/supernatural genre.Hope you enjoy the movie! middle of an ongoing arc while providing little to no explanations whatsoever.

It did leave me wondering about each of the characters' stories and personalities which I am guessing will be touched on in the rest of...the movies.The ending was well done with some beautiful metaphors for events that transpired throughout the film.Art/ MusicThe art style and music really went well together helping create a great atmosphere for the story, with it shifting to match the scene. The darker colors and “Grimy” nature help make the world seem more alive in a sense of personality, which also helped ground the story themes. Some parts of the art really stood out to me like the change in eyes in one of the fight scenes, speaking of the fight scene. The choices on how the camera moved and the music that went with it was just fantastic with the little details like the red jacket and the water shifting and even covering the camera at one point.ConclusionWhile not something that I would generally watch, it was a welcome change and I am looking forward to watching the rest of the films.6.5/10 for this filmWould rate higher, but while I enjoyed it the story itself was somewhat lacking. the movies.The ending was well done with some beautiful metaphors for events that transpired throughout the film.Art/ MusicThe art style and music really went well together helping create a great atmosphere for the story, with it shifting to match the scene.

It is, indeed, quite enigmatic and thrilling, setting its supernatural world and metaphysic tone. The story is unique, it has a lot of potential and I'm keen to this genre, so I gave it go.  The art style is amazing. Since this is the first entry the characters were presented, so development is left to do, nonetheless, all of them were smart, especially Shiki.

Naruto: Shippuuden - Sunny Side Battle,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19511/Naruto__Shippuuden_-_Sunny_Side_Battle,"['While Naruto may be ending soon, the creators of this franchise has shown us that it is not afraid to take daring and exciting new risks with this new installment. As a fan of Naruto, any new addition to the story is always welcome and appreciated, so you can imagine my excitement through the 11 minutes of this special. What\'s the 11 minutes comprise of, you say? A fun lil\' beach/fanservice episode? Cool idea, but no. Is it a cool flashback of when everyone other than Shikamaru making Chunnin? Great idea, but NAH. A story of when Minato was Naruto\'s age? Neat idea, but you...know I\'m saying no. Nah, what we got is 11 straight minutes [SPOILER ALERT: CONTINUE READING AT YOUR OWN CAUTION/LIFE] of Itachi cooking eggs. Yes. You heard me right. Eleven. Straight. Minutes. Of Itachi cooking eggs. Needless to say, this is flawless and fucking brilliant. Where can you possibly go wrong with this idea?The story starts off with Itachi cooking eggs (fuck yeah) and him getting frustrated that his eggs are weak as 2 Yamachas fusing into one (fuck no). So progressively he gets more and more frustrated while he has a cooking montage that you can set Joe Esposito\'s ""You\'re The Best Around"" to. And it gets heated (no pun intended), Itachi\'s cracking, simmering, boiling, mixing the fuck out of these eggs, man. All the while to some of the best animation that a regular episode of Naruto rarely sees, sakuga Studio Pierrot, sakuga. Then, out of nowhere, bam Sasuke! That\'s right, mofos, Sasuke, you expecting someone else? Cause it ain\'t. And then Itachi is like ""Ey man, want some eggs?"". And then Sasuke is like ""Sure."" And then Itachi is like ""NO."" And then Sasuke is like ""Dude, there\'s liek a hundred eggs on the floor."" And then Itachi is like ""YOU WON\'T EAT ANY OF THAT... SLOP. YOU WILL EAT ONLY THE FINEST EGG, FROM THE FINEST CHICKEN."" And then Sasuke is like ""k.""And then, in a M. Night Shyamalan twist, every egg gets a sharingan, that\'s right homies, every single one. Meanwhile, Itachi is chanting demon talk and asking the great lord Satan to bestow him the most finely crafted egg ever known to man. He\'s like Uncle from Jackie Chan Adventures going all ""Yu Mo Gwai Gui Fai Di Zao, Yu Mo Gwai Gui Fai Di Zao..."" But then, in another harrowing twist, Itachi ran out of eggs. He\'s absolutely devastated. He checks the fridge, he checks the freezer, he checks where they keep the vegatables. Nothing. Needless to say, all hope is lost. You\'re on the edge of your seat. You\'re just wondering ""AREN\'T THEY EVER GONNA EAT SUM EGGS?!??!?!?!?"" Until Itachi finds a chicken out in the lawn. The day is saved. Oh yeah, meanwhile him and Sasuke are talking about how they\'re not participating in the fourth ninja war cause they got better things to do.Like eating eggs. And do they ever. Itachi uses his ninja skills to craft the best set of sunny-side eggs out in this side of Konoha, a set of eggs that would make Gordon Ramsay declare defeat. And then Sasuke is like ""thanks, i guess."" And then brother and brother share a moment between that will be forgotten, never be destroyed... and then he wakes up. That\'s right, guys.

Nah, what we got is 11 straight minutes [SPOILER ALERT: CONTINUE READING AT YOUR OWN CAUTION/LIFE] of Itachi cooking eggs. Yes. You heard me right. Eleven. Straight. Minutes. Of Itachi cooking eggs. Needless to say, this is flawless and fucking brilliant. Where can you possibly go wrong with this idea?The story starts off with Itachi cooking eggs (fuck yeah) and him getting frustrated that his eggs are weak as 2 Yamachas fusing into one (fuck no). So progressively he gets more and more frustrated while he has a cooking montage that you can set Joe Esposito\'s ""You\'re The Best Around"" to. And it gets heated (no pun intended), Itachi\'s cracking, simmering, boiling, mixing the fuck out of these eggs, man. All the while to some of the best animation that a regular episode of Naruto rarely sees, sakuga Studio Pierrot, sakuga. Then, out of nowhere, bam Sasuke! That\'s right, mofos, Sasuke, you expecting someone else? Cause it ain\'t. And then Itachi is like ""Ey man, want some eggs?"". And then Sasuke is like ""Sure."" And then Itachi is like ""NO."" And then Sasuke is like ""Dude, there\'s liek a hundred eggs on the floor."" And then Itachi is like ""YOU WON\'T EAT ANY OF THAT... SLOP. YOU WILL EAT ONLY THE FINEST EGG, FROM THE FINEST CHICKEN."" And then Sasuke is like ""k.""And then, in a M. Night Shyamalan twist, every egg gets a sharingan, that\'s right homies, every single one. Meanwhile, Itachi is chanting demon talk and asking the great lord Satan to bestow him the most finely crafted egg ever known to man. He\'s like Uncle from Jackie Chan Adventures going all ""Yu Mo Gwai Gui Fai Di Zao, Yu Mo Gwai Gui Fai Di Zao..."" But then, in another harrowing twist, Itachi ran out of eggs. He\'s absolutely devastated. He checks the fridge, he checks the freezer, he checks where they keep the vegatables. Nothing. Needless to say, all hope is lost. You\'re on the edge of your seat. You\'re just wondering ""AREN\'T THEY EVER GONNA EAT SUM EGGS?!??!?!?!?"" Until Itachi finds a chicken out in the lawn. The day is saved. Oh yeah, meanwhile him and Sasuke are talking about how they\'re not participating in the fourth ninja war cause they got better things to do.Like eating eggs. And do they ever. Itachi uses his ninja skills to craft the best set of sunny-side eggs out in this side of Konoha, a set of eggs that would make Gordon Ramsay declare defeat. And then Sasuke is like ""thanks, i guess."" And then brother and brother share a moment between that will be forgotten, never be destroyed... and then he wakes up. That\'s right, guys. There were no eggs. There was no Itachi. Only heartbreak. Only Naruto. And then it turns out that\'s a dream, Naruto and Sasuke are in a boiling pan, and Itachi is literally a god.

Radiant 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39355/Radiant_2nd_Season,"[""If there was anything to redeem this series as a whole, it would be the series' continuation a.k.a Season 2 here, as Season 1 is mainly just relegated to character introductions and development in the beginning arcs of small dosages, and absolutely creamed with fillers (because the story structure just doesn't fit easily to 21 episodes (whereas the standard is 24-26)). If like many people, falling off the bandwagon after the atrocity that is the prequel, I highly implore you to give this series a 2nd chance with the sequel.Season 2 here covers the long-running Caislean Merlin arc of Tony Valente's manfra, and for another...21 episodes, it could not be more fitting than that to show just how massive the divide between the massive character cast is. Without spoiling anything, it was literally an all-out war between regular humans (a.k.a the Inquisition plus a band of people) vs. the sorcerers (a.k.a Seth and his brothers alongside support from Melie, Doc and others), and pick your side of the battle, because this battlefight outrageously affects those who are involved and maligned to the cause of their own calling. Needless to say, there are deaths in battle to fight for what's right, but to the mainstay character cast (Seth, Melie, Doc), endless inquiring about them looking forward to find Radiant once again, just got caught on the wayside with facing the Inquisition again after what happened in the Rumble Town arc in Season 1. All I can say was, it was a battle of epic proportions, and it's a redemption all to itself.To add onto the insanity, if the same production staff and Lerche absolutely bogged the comedy in Season 1, the seriousness in tone is just as goog (not great, mind you) coming into Season 2 with a fleshed-out plot and visuals that still make the manga better than the anime, but where the latter nails it is in the pacing and story restructuring that's better than the former.THIS is what fans of the manfra have been waiting for the series to truly flex its story, just that the beginning journey is more rough to swallow than it is here, and unfortunately having to stomach Season 1 just disappointed both fans and newcomers and this gets shunned immediately. So for Season 2 here to go back to its roots, I've gotta commend the staff for doing such a good job bringing Tony Valente's vision to light, and also to check out the manga as well (besides being an advertisement for the source material DUH).Music aside, the OP/ED pairing is fine, though I'd like Emi Nakamura's song as well on the levels of Season 1's OP and ED.Re-stating the point overall, to either end this show's run or continue with a Season 3 (in the future), it's time to revisit Radiant and binge it for all its pretty good hype and worth.

The new story arc gives the characters much-needed emotional depth and develops the plot with some twists.The first season's first half was mostly filler episodes, although some of the anime original content fleshed out side characters better (and introduced anime-only characters). Arguably, this was necessary since the first two story arcs were not long enough for 21 episodes.The Caislean Merlin arc was more than enough for 21 episodes and, as such, the second season also followed the French manga series by Tony Valente...much more closely.

While the first season was kind of underwhelming, the second season was extremely satisfying.While yes, it did follow many shonen stereotypes, Radiant only picked the good ones and left the boring and annoying one out of the window.This season kept its standart up regarding both the animation and the sound design. It's not out of this world though, it's just sitting comfortably above most animes. A reachable ideal.I'm not much of an OP or ED fan for any kind of show, and I've not...changed my mind with this anime.

The first season set the ground (if I can say so since most of the land is actually suspended in the air) for the characters to flourish. Seth loses some of his brattiness and further the distance between Asta from Black Clover and himself. Many character seemed to have gain 2 years of maturity.

In my opinion, this anime doesn’t get enough credit, or recognition. The art and animation are solid, and the story, is just different enough to give off its own flair, while maintaining a lot of things that are common place in the action/adventure genres.With that being said, let me say that the 2nd season of Radiant did a solid job of delivering in different ways than the first season did. Personally, I think the first season, and the rumble town arc, namely, had better action scenes. However, that doesn’t mean The 2nd season didn’t deliver...its own punch, and in my opinion, it brought a more emotional vibe overall, than the first season did.I think, the first season had a lot of introductory stuff to dig through, and thus, it started pretty slow. It was nice to have the 2nd season just pick up relatively quickly, in comparison. I loved the introductions of the new characters, and the world building is pretty impressive, in the fact that you can see them adding importance to each area that Seth visits, and the potential impacts that those places could have in the future seasons.I rate S2 of Radiant an 8/10. It’s definitely worth the watch if you’ve seen the first season- and if you haven’t- then I do suggest watching both seasons. its own punch, and in my opinion, it brought a more emotional vibe overall, than the first season did.I think, the first season had a lot of introductory stuff to dig through, and thus, it started pretty slow.

This season follows Seth and Co as they get caught up in another adventure. This time, in the city of Cyfandir where sorcerers and humans live harmoniously. So, the characters. It was a criticism I had about the first season that I didn't really get to connect with the characters. Maybe because it's a long running series, in this second season I really got to understand the characters a lot more. Seth feels like a typical Shonen protagonist, but, I think he's a bit more nuanced.As for the world building, I don't think this season...added too much to what I understood from the first season, but that might be because of the plot which I found well woven and nicely tied together. What really struck me about this show is the idea of stakes. See, one of my biggest problems with Shonen is that there never seem to be any stakes. Things happen, bad guys attack, but everything seems to be fixed immediately after with no repercussions.

What really struck me about this show is the idea of stakes. See, one of my biggest problems with Shonen is that there never seem to be any stakes. Things happen, bad guys attack, but everything seems to be fixed immediately after with no repercussions.

Cold things suck. Let\'s play in the snow.""There\'s your one-hour Memory Snow experience condensed into a few seconds. Those expecting the series\' trademark gore, or any character development or backstory will find themselves considerably disappointed by Subaru and co.\'s snow frolicking adventures. Nay, instead we have slice-of-life and comedy, because that\'s what everyone likes Re:Zero for, right?I\'ve had a lot of time to think and chat about the series in the three years since I wrote my original Re:Zero review. Though I was immensely critical at the time, there was something about the series that prevailed, that made it hard for me...to forget or stop thinking about. Re:Zero\'s portrayal of trauma is likely what stuck with me the most, as only a few other anime (Steins;Gate, to name a prominent one) have dealt with that sort of subject matter in a meaningful way. So, I guess, when you take all of that out-- y\'know, everything that made the series interesting-- and have it all smiles and sunshine instead, you\'re left with this... Memory Snow.Let me get one thing out of the way: Re:Zero\'s \'comedy\' is not funny. At all. Nope. I cannot imagine a scenario where anyone, even the most zealous and devoted fans of the series, are laughing at one of Memory Snow\'s gags. A guy is making passes at Subaru and pretending to be gay? Gold. Oh my god, Subaru is speaking in (bad) English at the beginning instead of in Japanese? Absolutely H-Y-S-T-E-R-I-C-A-L! (LOL)Japan, speaking generally, is a pretty straight-faced country that does not really understand a whole lot about humour, and while light novel adaptations have always been especially culpable, boy, oh boy, does Re:Zero\'s jokes feel forced. It\'s as if someone who has not ever told a joke in their life read a \'how to slapstick\' manual and thought it okay to just emulate the same two examples ad infinitum. Overreacting, retorting with a stupid voice-- all focused on the characters delivering the comedy, without there actually being any comedy. It is painfully clear that the people working on the series are there because they want to tell a serious story, and the comedy and light novel tropes are manufactured merely to be more palatable to an audience who don\'t know anything else. Oh, and Rem and Emilia are apparently everybody\'s waifu, or something.Memory Snow, in between its painful attempts at comedy, exists mostly to appease fans of the heroines. Emilia, Rem and Ram get drunk and clingy towards Subaru, and fans can take great joy imagining themselves in Subaru\'s shoes. If not, well, Memory Snow is not something you should spend an hour of your life enduring. Why did I? Good question.Re:Zero, for as many issues as it had, was at least ambitious and entertaining. It swung hard, missing more than it should have, but there was enough value in there to warrant a recommendation. The second season is something I am quite interested in watching--  more than I ever thought I\'d be, three years ago. So until then, we shall wait.

It's refreshing to watch a series that's known for its dark elements to have moments of happiness and relief.STORY:Now, its story is simple and can be...summarized as: Puck has too much mana, and is releasing this excessive mana, thus creating a cold and harsh environment in the mansion. Subaru, unable to tolerate the coldness for two additional days, convinces everyone a create snow festival.While, the OVA is only an hour, it manages to pack many funny moments, (i.e., Emilia and Rem getting drunk, and the Subaru and Roswaal snowman combination), reveal Puck's backstory, add foreshadowing (i.e., Bond of Ice OVA, and Beatrice's mother), and add some references (i.e., KONOSUBA, Statue of Liberty, and Transformers). It's funny, heartwarming, and pleasing to watch Re: Zero without all the gore, violence, and suffering of its main series.ART/CHARACTERS/SOUND:The lighting effects are really well done, especially towards the end when Puck releases some more mana and makes it snow over the entire city. Great use of starry night sky with the green and white effects. Interesting art style during the first couple minutes of the OVA, and the great character design is as pretty as its main series was.

Though I have mixed feelings about the parent show, Re:Zero at least refuses to accept its mediocrity without a fight, and this OVA strips away each of the most potent weapons in the show\'s arsenal.  Kenichiro Suehiro\'s Morricone-influenced score is largely gone, for starters.  Being a laid-back side story means no startling brutality, which means that the ""Return by Death"" mechanic is also ruled out (although it really didn\'t have to be)....Most of all, at some point in the jump between parent series and OVA excursion, the entire cast underwent some rapid Flanderization that reduced them all to a handful of punchlines - most of which aren\'t worth the cost.Ram and Beatrice can always be relied on for a few good put-downs and reactions, but there\'s no sign of the charismatic and dedicated Subaru who carried the series, and the perfunctory relegation of Rem from ""legitimate romantic interest"" to ""the obsessive member of the harem"" feels like nothing more than a shallow mischaracterization for the sake of some dead-weight gags, and that\'s not worth my time.  Emilia suffers from the same problem as in the parent series: she\'s simply out to lunch all the time, and beyond a sweet voice and impeccable dress sense, it\'s difficult to determine why Subaru holds her in such esteem, let alone detect any significant chemistry between the two of them.  This might be the kind of material that ought to have been workshopped and farmed out to Isekai Quartet, if someone wanted to take Re:Zero for a little ride around the glibbest joke formulas in sight.Perhaps it\'s asking too much of an OVA to deliver something on par with the main series, but at an hour in length, it does not seem terribly unreasonable to expect - at the very least - something either more substantially romantic or consistently comedic.  Memory Snow isn\'t equipped to fill out that much time; even with a few different scenarios that are rife with opportunity, so much of the run time drags.  If the creators had simply bitten the bullet and pulled out a hot springs episode somehow, sinking into that familiar register might have explained away the general lack of concern for quality, but an hour\'s worth of promised date time with Emilia amidst a winter wonderland really ought to have delivered more than this.

The series is amazing because it has everything: comedy, drama, violence, action, horror, ... However, this movie only has slice of life elements and for an entire hour without any interesting stuff happening other than ""Emilia-Tan is the best!"" and the other trademark remarks from the main cast, it got boring half-way through.I hated the jap-english in the beginning because it just felt out of place with no plausible reason to be there, the animation is a bit inconsistent and I also do...not like to hear english songs as part of an anime soundtrack.SPOILER: at the end everyone drank alcohol except Beako after she was advised by Subaru that she shouldn\'t drink despite being older than everyone present because she looks like a minor. This makes as much sense as telling someone not to get a driver license because, although they\'re 30 years old, they have a babyface. It\'s so stupid... and then having Beako\'s accept and follow that advice was even more stupid. In fact, the entire drunk scenes between Emilia and Rem were cringe as heck, too.This movie could\'ve been animated in 30 minutes and it would\'ve been fine but 1 hour of this was too much. It gets a 5/10 from me. not like to hear english songs as part of an anime soundtrack.SPOILER: at the end everyone drank alcohol except Beako after she was advised by Subaru that she shouldn\'t drink despite being older than everyone present because she looks like a minor.

As a result, it lacks the underlying darkness, grit and catharsis that defines Re:Zero at its best, the moments that propelled it into a genuine masterpiece, the sense of constant purpose and meaning that made the first season feel like such a complete package. But man, with characters this great, I’ll always appreciate being able to spend more time with them, and I...had a goddamn blast reconnecting with them all. Seriously, it’s become stunningly apparent in the time since I finished Re:Zero just how goddamn good an ensemble cast it features. Everyone plays off each other beautifully, everyone’s camaraderie is an utter delight, and it’s just so freaking endearing to see them relax again after all the trauma and hardship of the show proper.

It\'s just some nice fun and character development with Subaru and co. Very slice of life, a snow festival, and it\'s just very neat. ^^There\'s nothing outstanding about it as far as ""movies"" go (more an OVA or extended episode), but if you enjoyed re:zero, you\'ll probably like this, even with the lack of gore. It doesn\'t always have to be mayhem, sometimes we just want some nice moments with the characters we love! ', 'Re Zero memory snow was a movie created by studio White Fox in October of 2018. However, due to the long period of time it took for good fansubs to surface and some real-world obligations on my part I have only gotten around to watching it now, and might I say... there\'s no rush.Re: Zero Memory Snow or, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Memory Snow has... a murky setting at best, and it\'s unclear to me at what point in the story exactly it is set, or even if it is to be considered in a separate context to that of the regular story...or even in a vacuum. I say this because at this point in the story it is implied that the cast has already been to the capital, but we also see a scene where Petelguise is alive, and for anyone who has seen the first season of the anime they would know that this is quite impossible.Beyond the murky setting, we have a fun, albeit bland story based around Puck\'s need to release energy from his OD, which is making the area surrounding the mansion excessively cold, conveniently facilitating some funny gags and a healthy dose of fanservice from REM and Emilia. As well as this, it serves as the perfect setting for what is essentially a glorified Christmas Special. In all honesty, the story just doesn\'t have much substance and in my eyes is more of a fun filler side story that will help tide fans over before the incredibly belated release of the second season which is airing currently. I give the story a 6, purely because it contextualizes some of the more intricate elements of the world\'s magic system for us anime viewing peasants.The art and sound are about as good as you would expect from white fox, and that\'s pretty good, in my eyes a 7 and and 8 respectively, but what really saves this special from mediocrity is the colourful cast of characters that the story lives and dies by. These are, of course the same set of characters we fell in love with a number of years back in 2016 and during the time since we first met them, Studio White fox and Author Tappei Nagatsuki have learned how to bounce these characters energies off of each other for hilarious results, particularly in the scenes in the banquet after the snow festival at the Roswaal Mansion.Overall Re:Zero memory snow is some solid, feel-good Christmassy filler that served it\'s the purpose as a stopgap between the first and second seasons of the main story, however being outside of the desired season, and with the second season of the main series currently airing I find it difficult to recommend this OVA to anyone apart from the most ardent and dedicated Re: Zero fans, to which I would pose the question ""Why not just read the manga?"". or even in a vacuum.

Beatrice does gets some subtle screentime, what with her being the stoic loner bookworm and Subaru wanting everyone to have fun in the snow festival thus her involvement in this movie, also with some lines within this movie seems Beatrice finally opens up to Subaru and trusting him a bit more because of solving Puck\'s issue and as a result Puck kickstarting this entire movie as LA aforementioned.Now as for the rest of the cast, Roswaal does his usual scthick so not much chaaaaanges from him in this movie, Emilia is also similar but with a bit more emphasis on exposition with Puck as well as getting to know her a bit more with this movie, add in some teasing from her to Subaru as well. Rem on the other hand, well this is just LA but uhhh just LA or did Rem\'s characterization turned her into a caricature of her established character in this movie (and LA says this as a Rem fan!), you know like agreeing with everything Subaru thinks up, clingy to Subaru and doing some ""odd"" things to impress Subaru...like yes LA will say this is a light-hearted slice of life movie but considering this was set before the Capital Inauguration arc her infatuation with Subaru felt a bit touch in cheek but ehhh moe Rem is good Rem, ohh and drunk Rem & Emilia was damn cute...The production value once again done by White Fox as well as the returning voice cast, well the animation is consistent and even for a laid back movie, the animation was nonetheless great especially with the character facial animation being ALOT more expressive and comedic apt for the setting of this movie. As for voice cast, due to Ram, Puck and Beatrice getting alot of focus in this movie, the voice actors got to get a bit hammy with their character roles especially with Rie Murakawa, Yumi Uchiyama and Satomi Arai, heck, Rie Takahashi, Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase as Emilia, Subaru and Rem respectively still went crazy fun with their roles. So yeah the production value was consistent and great as expected like the anime series itself.This movie was wholesome, great comedic moments, sure a bit of flanderization towards some characters *cough* Rem *cough* but nonetheless for a snow festival slice of life movie LA can forgive it as even then Rem got some damn great cute moments in this movie. If you wanna take an icy cold dragon\'s breather from the seriousness and ruthlessness of ReZero and want to see great comedic interactions with the core cast of the Roswaal mansion, then ReZero Memory Snow is a definite watch and for it being a one hour movie at that, the content even being a wholesome slice of life is well worth the watch. comedic characters interactions.The movie has LOTS of focus towards Ram, Beatrice and Puck for the majority of the movie, Ram for her getting a cold for the length of the movie and her quips (LA thinks this is mostly because the anime itself didn\'t give her much attention thus gave it to her here LA suppose).

Though not especially standing out, the story did not feel incoherent in any major way, which is...already much to achieve, and seemed to carry out its purpose: the focus of the movie certainly was characterisation, and the plot elements in their arrangement really could lead a viewer towards feeling a connection with the protagonists.Art (9/10): A harmony existed between the art in this movie, and the visuals from the anime. While the art was not grandiloquent, except maybe two times where the art stood out, and these instants were the flower field and the snow pouring. The art was, however, effective, and its redeeming quality resides in letting a viewership be drawn into the anime. Exemplary for this.Sound (9/10): This movie's surprising potency also resides, as a sprinkled kind of spice, in the musical way. During the snow festival, a song accompanies a few scenes in a much appreciated way. I would like to testify of my appreciation towards the lyrics! In a similar way, the ending song conveyed a feeling and mood in accordance with the rest of the direction this movie followed. Truly a masterpiece of harmony and effectivity.Another distinction could be accorded towards Pack's and Beatrice's voice actors, for they did participate in a special way to create an intimacy between the viewership and the show. For this reason, I would want to thank specially Satomi Arai and Yumi Uchiyama. There was also a consistency in the way the other voice actors played their roles, and they should be revered to for this matter with a grateful appreciation.Character (9/10): Characterisation certainly felt the strongest point of this movie. I would make two remarks about it: firstly, the direction and realisation targetted the endeavour that is conveying familiarity between a viewership and a cast, and carried out such a task in an effective way; secondly, while as I already pointed out, the cast felt the same as in the anime, and such consistency is appreciable for itself, two characters were especially noticeable, giving them a visibility that could, in retrospective, be deemed one of the few anime's shortcomings. However, it is encouraging for the least, to realise this movie actually corrects a flaw of the anime.Indeed, two characters are more developed than others, would I judge. They would be, quite unexpectedly, Beatrice, our favourite bookworm blondish loli, and Pack! of all folks? While developing Beatrice felt more endearing towards her than anything else, Pack's characterisation involved a backstory permitting to develop a bit on the fictitious universe itself, involving how magic functions for some beings. Such a fact baffled me in a positive way, even so slightly.Enjoyment (9/10): Certainly, as others referred to in other reviews, this movie is a better watch for one who already knew each character sufficiently beforehand. For a show to focus on developing characters that were known to an audience previously, the least justice to do it is watching it with enlightenment. It should not be a blind watch.I personally very much liked this movie, because I could bond with the protagonists and their endearing interactions.

It feels like an extended framing device for the second OVA, Hyouketsu no Kizuna, but it doesn't have any plot significance whatsoever.But it's still the same characters and world as in the main TV-series so if you appreciate those this is more of that, only with zero stakes and no drama. I think the saving grace of this OVA is that was released seperately from the main story and so it doesn't ruin the pacing or drama of the TV-anime. "", ""Review in brief:Offering a nice comedic break after the more serious climax of Arc 2, Memory Snow is a well-timed lighthearted departure from Re:Zero’s first season.  Some may take issue with its lack of impact or its goofy, fanservicey nature, but what it accomplishes is something the main anime could have used a bit more of in its later portions.Review in full:The story of Re:Zero is first and foremost a psychological thriller.  Love it or hate it, the subgenre carries itself on overall serious tones and introspective queries into its setup, themes, and most of all its characters.  That said, too much...dreariness can get overwhelming if that’s all a story delivers, and one way to relieve the issue is with comedic breaks.  Re:Zero already had a few in its original run (primarily in its first half as is typical) but the shift from the ultimately positive ending of Arc 2 into the darkest portion of season 1 was too drastic in the minds of some viewers.Enter the Memory Snow side story.  Originally premiered as a movie after season 1, sold as an OVA, and later aired on TV as a part of season 1’s director’s cut rebroadcast in 2020, there’s a good reason why it ended up becoming so prolific.  Taking place in between arcs 2 and 3, it provides that much needed break with a light, comedy-oriented little story and some extra moments with many characters whose roles were mostly locked to Arc 2.  Is it filler?  Yes.  Is it fanservicey?  Fairly.  While such terms often carry a negative connotation, they aren’t inherently bad traits.  In this case, some lighthearted filler makes for an excellent buffer between serious portions, and that’s a sentiment that holds up if one were to watch it later than “intended” as well.With a cleanly simple plot and a happy-go-lucky tone, Memory Snow delivers most of its humor by having the characters bounce off of each other in silly little interactions.  This more character-oriented focus does some interesting things that the main anime struggles with, including adding little sprinkles of character definition via implied intent through their actions and putting them in situations where they can act looser (and therefore more honestly).  The goofiness of the jokes and the ship-bait elements of some of the situations are not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but as what is essentially a collection of connected skits, Memory Snow manages to have a fair share of slice-of-life-esque fuzzy moments thanks to its simplicity and delicacy.The production values of this solitary episode don’t particularly stand out from the rest of the season, which isn’t a bad thing either.  There isn’t a lot of action to encourage grand animation scenes or tense moments to put dramatic music into, yet there are scattered spurts of visual creativity at play and plenty of opportunities happily taken by the vocal cast to act out the characters in ways they rarely got to during the main anime.  Overall, it makes the whole package come off as something of a fun process for the production crew and not just some tacked-on cash grab in the wake of Re:Zero’s popularity.Verdict:Memory Snow is good filler, the sort that holds its own and makes you appreciate the rest of the story more. Unless you seriously hate the characters or Re:Zero’s humor in general, it fits right into its spot in the director’s cut (i.e. after episode 11 of the original broadcast), though one doesn't need to watch it at any particular point after Arc 2 to get the intended effect either. dreariness can get overwhelming if that’s all a story delivers, and one way to relieve the issue is with comedic breaks.  Re:Zero already had a few in its original run (primarily in its first half as is typical) but the shift from the ultimately positive ending of Arc 2 into the darkest portion of season 1 was too drastic in the minds of some viewers.Enter the Memory Snow side story.  Originally premiered as a movie after season 1, sold as an OVA, and later aired on TV as a part of season 1’s director’s cut rebroadcast in 2020, there’s a good reason why it ended up becoming so prolific.  Taking place in between arcs 2 and 3, it provides that much needed break with a light, comedy-oriented little story and some extra moments with many characters whose roles were mostly locked to Arc 2.  Is it filler?  Yes.  Is it fanservicey?  Fairly.  While such terms often carry a negative connotation, they aren’t inherently bad traits.  In this case, some lighthearted filler makes for an excellent buffer between serious portions, and that’s a sentiment that holds up if one were to watch it later than “intended” as well.With a cleanly simple plot and a happy-go-lucky tone, Memory Snow delivers most of its humor by having the characters bounce off of each other in silly little interactions.

This was an hour long OVA apparently aired between episode 5 and 6 of Re:Zero season 1. I watched the show outside of it’s aired season so the existence of this OVA eluded me almost completely and watching it I didn’t really know where it sat in the timeline of the show until after the fact.The OVA sits really well in the timeline of the story and was a fun getaway...from the rest of series. I will say given it’s air date and settling nicely inside the show’s canon. I wonder if the only qualifying factor of being an OVA is being outside a normal runtime?The episode was bland and just mostly cutesy, but a lot of the character interaction felt a bit hollow. Everyone kind of felt like they were boiled down to caricatures of themselves. An episode like this is a chance to see the characters of a shows daily interactions with each other and feeling just sort of “whatever” about what I saw I’m a little worried I never liked Re:Zero as much as I thought initially. We’ll see on my rewatch of season 1, dive into OVA 2, and viewing of Season 2.I liked the episode. It was inoffensive, but really just sort of bland slice of life.

The OVA doesn't really have a direct impact on the events of Re:Zero, although I think it's a welcome addition to the story given Re:Zero's shotgun approach to story-telling.

It\'s funny, but i have a big problem with Rem:In the main story, it is shown that Rem falled in love with Subaru, but it was something more healthy, and she could still think critically over the main character\'s actions.But in this movie, the love of Rem for the main character is way too exaggerated. She\'d always say things like ""You\'re incredible"" when the main character proposes anything, being Ram the only one of the 2 to think critically.Such a personality change doesn\'t make sense at all, since the movie happens around the half of the story, when Rem...was in love for Subaru but not so much.The movie is overall funny, but it\'s not really necessary to watch it since it doesn\'t really brings anything to the plot, and is not very goodly made. was in love for Subaru but not so much.The movie is overall funny, but it\'s not really necessary to watch it since it doesn\'t really brings anything to the plot, and is not very goodly made.', 'Anyone that has seen this anime knows that each episode almost tries to out due the last horrible death than the last. This episode is so much different than the others, it gives Subaru a much needed break from the return by death nightmare he continues to go through. It was nice seeing the people of the mansion interact with the people of the village, with even Beatrice joining in. All that being said, the episode has no true major story moments other than the fact it explains the magical release period. Not to say that is a bad thing though. I would recommend not...skipping this hour episode, I think anyone that loves the anime would love this! skipping this hour episode, I think anyone that loves the anime would love this!', ""This OVA perfectly portrays one of the most appealing parts of the main series: comedy and character interactions. We see the characters acting in a more lighthearted context, between their hilarious attempts to spend together a good snowy day. Visuals are good, more or less on the same level of the main series, with the direction giving much charme to the most heart-warming moments, and as a whole it was more consistent than most of episodes of the series.

There is nothing you will gain from watching this movie other than fan service. You should fully be aware and...have no further expectations.It's just bad. have no further expectations.It's just bad.""]"

Because of this, he does everything he can to avoid being the center of attention. However, because of his master\'s coming tribulation to become an immortal, he is forced to go search for a rare medicinical herb to try to help his master pass the tribulation. Druing this trip, he ends up catching the attention of some...elders, leading them to try to help him make a name for himself (which he does not want). This story is about all the butterfly effect events that happened because he broke his personal covenent to not stand out in anyway.This is the newest released donghua that I have watched, and you can see the quality and time put into it. The animations, character models, fights, effects, everything feels perfect and state of the art. All the choreography is smooth and nothing feels misplaced. To date, this is the best donghua graphically that I have watched (also watched closest to the release date so there is that).The plot is clean an smooth. The transitions for time skips seems natural. As for the story, it balances the comedy , intense fights, and plot development very well. It has just the right mix of all of them. All the comedic moments (both the internal monologues/complaints and the humourous acts) are all greatly done. You\'ll get a good laugh out of this while enjoying the plot.This donghua is a perfect introductary watch for anyone, especially for those who like cultivation and comedy.Review as an adaptation:As an adaptation, this donghua is similar to the novel, but does not completely capture the tone and comedy. Some details were left out, like the fact that our MC Li Changshou is a reincarnator and uses his knowledge of Chinese Myths to understand what is to come (understanding of future events). The show also suggests the possibility that he might also be a time regressor (traveled back in time). While the show does a good job of showing his overly cautious, risk adverse nature. They don\'t present the comedy of this quite as well as the novel. For example, that trip MC made to the northern continent, he prepared for 15, yes 15, years. This detail that was left out really exemplifies the his overly cautious nature. Other than this, the comedy has been toned down to PG level and most of his internal monologues have been left out. The comedy was originally derived from his overpreparedness and from kinks that he didn\'t account for, like Youqin Xuanya\'s  But overall, this is a good adaptation of the novel.Note: this donghua covers the ""prologue"" of the novel, covering everything up until right before our MC\'s tribulation to become an immortal, covering chapters 1-52, though it is a bit of a speed run of the plot, as there are usually years if not decades between major events, like from his master\'s immortality tribulation to his (about 12 years). There were also supposed to be a few years between his master\'s tribulation to the dragon palace competition.Adaptation score(how faithful to source): 7/10 elders, leading them to try to help him make a name for himself (which he does not want).

Terrified with the loss Li Changshou becomes motivated to cultivate to the realm of immortality along with his Master Qi Yuan as soon as possible in order to be prepared for the impending doom. Will their preparations be enough or will the catastrophe swallow them up a second time?Story & Character: 6/10The story of 'My Brother is too steady' does well in building an expansive world with a deep lore from the beginning. We start off...with an interesting hook about the remains of an evil faction lurking in the shadow while the righteous peaks partake in their own affairs oblivious. The story is interesting and I'm sure that there is a lot of potential world building in the works but as it stands now it lacks depth in many fundamental plot elements. The two main arcs that start and end the season feel very lacklustre mainly due to their lack of importance or contribution to the narrative. Conflict is bound to happen but it felt meaningless where a coup is staged and a tournament between species occurred. I was expecting an ease in and maintain a pacing that allowed for better exploration of the world but also at a rate that was comprehensible; In this series new lore is thrown left and right but isn't elaborated on in depth in any way.Characters were enjoyable and developed well throughout the series. Although they are introduced almost as abruptly as the story, they feel organic in terms of interaction with each other and had their own personalities. Characters that you'd expect to be stoic and reserved are shy yet playful; Likewise characters who are young are actually old and old are actually young it throws me off in a good way. The chibi comedy adds a lot to the character's demeanors too and are a fun addition to the series. As for the antagonists, we haven't seen any clear faction pop up beyond what's already been established as characters but I can expect to see a faction or two in opposition of the Duxian like we see in the concluding arc.Art & Sound: 7/10 & 6/10The art is of good quality and textures are clear, in some close ups you can see wrinkles in Li Changshou's fists. The clothes and hair have physics so they are animated and the particle density during many scenes are high. I enjoyed the chibi designs since they had a better effect on the comedy despite it being CGI, I think it worked better than 2D. The battle/sword aura animation and lighting in general were high quality as expected of Sparkly Key Animation Studio. I think a lot of the fight scenes could've had better angles and shot choreography, many of the shots were too wide for immersive action. Some of the character rigging felt very rough and you can tell especially in the smaller actions like moving arms or small head movements.The sound is passable; Voice acting and sound effects were of decent quality. There is a good use of effective music and sound effects for comedic effect but beyond that there wasn't much explorative or extraordinary.Overall & Enjoyment: 6/10I personally enjoyed the series for its shift of focus being on its characters not just the main character. I do wish the main character Li Changshou would be more greedy and focus on his own circumstances but he chooses to put others before himself in many situations; Furthermore he is a very safe character which makes altercations fairly anticlimactic. The events also aren't anything new in terms of the typical donghua with tournaments and disciple missions being the norm in usual martial arts stories.

Strike Witches Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9751/Strike_Witches_Movie,"['Strike Witches the Movie is a refreshing and fitting sequel to the two television series. Those who are not familiar with the Strike Witches franchise receive a brief introduction to the premise of the series, but they may not be able to appreciate the unique personalities of each character fully if they have not watched the preceding works.Strike Witches revolutionized the ""mecha musume"" genre of moe anthropomorphism, especially because of the special attention given to the realistic setting of the series. Compared to the futuristic setting of Shimada Humikane\'s earlier work Sky Girls, Strike Witches employs World War II era technology and personalities as...the basis of its story. In a timeline where Earth\'s history is altered because of the invasion of unknown aliens, the total war we know of is re-imagined as a fight between modern witches and the mysterious alien Neuroi.Following the conclusion of Strike Witches 2, speculation was ripe among fans as to how the story could continue because the series protagonist Miyafuji Yoshika seemed to have lost the major driving force of her character development. It soon became evident that the creators did not intend on taking Miyafuji out of the picture. Strike Witches the Movie opens in August 1945, and the calm that follows the liberation of Venezia (Venice) and Romagna (Italy) mirrors the real world scenario where World War II is nearing its conclusion. Unfortunately for the witches, the Neuroi still remain a formidable enemy, and signs of a new invasion soon begin to appear throughout Europe. In the meantime, Miyafuji travels from her home in the Fuso Empire (Japan) to Helvetia (Switzerland) in order to enroll in a medical school and fulfill her desire to become a doctor.Viewers are introduced to a new protagonist to the franchise. Hattori Shizuka, a newly minted officer with the Fuso Empire who enters the military with the same enthusiasm as Miyafuji did in early 1944. For Hattori, Miyafuji is the hero of the Fuso Empire who is admired throughout the country, yet Miyafuji does not seem to care for the hierarchical structure and formalities of the military and instead willingly takes up work seemingly unrelated to the fight against the Neuroi. This contradiction presents a conflict for the naïve Hattori, who dreams of the glory of battle described in stories of Miyafuji. In this way, it appears as if Hattori was introduced in order to serve as a foil to Miyafuji; however, viewers soon realize that her stubbornness mirrors that of Miyafuji\'s when the latter first entered the military and sought to find her own purpose in the war.Characters from the earlier television series, especially members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, return in numerous cameo appearances throughout the movie, guiding Miyafuji and ensuring her safety in the land journey from Gallia (France) to Helvetia. Viewers are also treated with additional appearances of witches in other units throughout Europe who are called into action by the new Neuroi enemy that caught them off guard. While it initially seems as if there are two separate plots in the movie, viewers are reminded that Miyafuji is indeed the main protagonist as the story begins to converge around her.Strike Witches is known for its impressive mechanical design. Following in the footsteps of the two television series, the movie features World War II military hardware in detail, including the Japanese aircraft carrier Amagi. AIC presents an artistic quality that is above average, and the animation is especially entertaining to watch during aerial combat scenes. Despite the prevalence of low camera angles intended to market its military-girls-in-underwear appeal, these shots are weaved quite well into the combat animation, making them less distracting. If there were any complaints about the art itself, perhaps it is that the theatrical poster does not do enough justice to the quality of the movie.The soundtrack of the movie does not vary from the television series, and viewers can immediately recognize the trumpet fanfare that has become the signature piece of theme music from Strike Witches. While this can become a point of concern, it can also present the viewer with the an atmosphere that unifies the movie with the two television series. Voice acting of returning characters also does not vary in the movie, but the performance of Uchida Aya as Hattori Shizuka is well deserving of an applause as she captured Hattori\'s transformation into a character who begins to understand Miyafuji\'s ideals. This is followed by a special ending song which features Hattori\'s voice actress in its vocal cast.If the viewer enjoyed the two television series, they will find the movie even more enjoyable. On the other hand, if the viewer feels that the franchise has become stale without recent developments, the movie can reinvigorate interest. Pacing of the plot is conducted in a balanced way by breaking it up into scenarios that resolve themselves quickly and maintain viewer interest as if discovering local adventures during a road trip through continental Europe. the basis of its story. In a timeline where Earth\'s history is altered because of the invasion of unknown aliens, the total war we know of is re-imagined as a fight between modern witches and the mysterious alien Neuroi.Following the conclusion of Strike Witches 2, speculation was ripe among fans as to how the story could continue because the series protagonist Miyafuji Yoshika seemed to have lost the major driving force of her character development. It soon became evident that the creators did not intend on taking Miyafuji out of the picture. Strike Witches the Movie opens in August 1945, and the calm that follows the liberation of Venezia (Venice) and Romagna (Italy) mirrors the real world scenario where World War II is nearing its conclusion. Unfortunately for the witches, the Neuroi still remain a formidable enemy, and signs of a new invasion soon begin to appear throughout Europe. In the meantime, Miyafuji travels from her home in the Fuso Empire (Japan) to Helvetia (Switzerland) in order to enroll in a medical school and fulfill her desire to become a doctor.Viewers are introduced to a new protagonist to the franchise. Hattori Shizuka, a newly minted officer with the Fuso Empire who enters the military with the same enthusiasm as Miyafuji did in early 1944. For Hattori, Miyafuji is the hero of the Fuso Empire who is admired throughout the country, yet Miyafuji does not seem to care for the hierarchical structure and formalities of the military and instead willingly takes up work seemingly unrelated to the fight against the Neuroi. This contradiction presents a conflict for the naïve Hattori, who dreams of the glory of battle described in stories of Miyafuji. In this way, it appears as if Hattori was introduced in order to serve as a foil to Miyafuji; however, viewers soon realize that her stubbornness mirrors that of Miyafuji\'s when the latter first entered the military and sought to find her own purpose in the war.Characters from the earlier television series, especially members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, return in numerous cameo appearances throughout the movie, guiding Miyafuji and ensuring her safety in the land journey from Gallia (France) to Helvetia. Viewers are also treated with additional appearances of witches in other units throughout Europe who are called into action by the new Neuroi enemy that caught them off guard.

I originally found the series randomly on Hulu and eventually I watched all of it, besides the one non- victory ova that I didn't know existed until a few weeks ago, in like 4 days.  I love this anime a lot because it's very true to what it is and the movie is the same way.  You get a bunch of cute girls with familiars that can use magic to perform moves and fly, and they also don't wear pants, which I've read is because striker units need almost...direct skin contact to access the magical energy so they can start the propellers that allow the witches to fly.Strike Witches the movie gives you a chance to see all the old characters, the fun interactions that you want to see again, a new type of neuroi, and a new girl who was sent to get Yoshika and take her to a top medical school where she can do study abroad.  The new neuroi causes lots of havoc which is expected and it's nice to see a new kind instead a recycled old type of neuroi.  I don't always like when shows pull this stuff, but Strike Witches is the very definition of friendship is power.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend watching it.  Expect what the series offers you and nothing more.  Hope you enjoy it too!I feel like adding one more thing to my review. This movie also keeps the character driven aspect of the series.  Considering most of the mains series was episodic, being character driven is important to  keep things interesting.   You won't be disappointed by this aspect in the movie either. direct skin contact to access the magical energy so they can start the propellers that allow the witches to fly.Strike Witches the movie gives you a chance to see all the old characters, the fun interactions that you want to see again, a new type of neuroi, and a new girl who was sent to get Yoshika and take her to a top medical school where she can do study abroad.

If you watched it back in 2012 with the order of things all over the place this would be a pretty hard movie to drop in.The story is really well done from start to finish. It is nice to see how it links directly off Operation Victory Arrow. The introduction of Shizuka being very straight-laced from the academy is brilliant as not all witches can be so chilled out as Yoshika. Especially...since this is Fuso a country of absolute dedication.The art is consistent even with the later parts of the show like Victory Arrow which came after it in terms of production It is Ecchi as always and fits perfectly into the narrative. Sanya always so beautifully drawn as best girl.The sound comes with a great opening and an awesome closing song. Generally, the sounds are superb throughout the show and make for a great ride. A few more SFX sounds would have been better but it is from 2012.Characters do a really great expansion on seeing the new girl Shizuka being straight-laced. Also shows how strict Mio must be at the academy. I am always surprised that the military keeps discharging Yoshika and not just taking her in to train as a medical officer. The other witches all show the great admiration they have for Yoshika which is really great to see.The movie itself is enjoyable from start to finish and I would recommend it. It would be best if you watch it in the order it comes with this being the last thing before Road to Berlin that is due this year. I love seeing the Brave Witches inclusion and some newer random witches from other units. Also seeing Michiko is great too since her voice is adorable.The movie when it came out has the issue that confuses the timeline. Yes, season 2 did come out before the movie but having Operation Victory Arrow that leads up to the very start is the best method to watch it. since this is Fuso a country of absolute dedication.The art is consistent even with the later parts of the show like Victory Arrow which came after it in terms of production It is Ecchi as always and fits perfectly into the narrative.

And just like the past seasons from before, the movie of the series delivers a fun ride with a conclusion that just leaves you warm and fuzzy in the end.There isn't much to say about plot as it follows expectations you would have a movie adaptation, and it follows the typical Strike Witches formula. The Neuroi invade Europe, they catch the protagonists and army by surprise, and it's up to the 501st to reunite and save the day. Sounds...familiar? It should sound, as it is the basic conceptual story followed by the past two seasons. A basic problem of the movie's plot is that it offers almost no new information to the storyline; whether it comes to the Neuroi's mysterious presence, Yoshika's father, the plans of the world leaders, etc.  Those looking for something new and refreshing will be disappointed; those that want to re-experience the magic of a past enjoyment will get what they want.The character development that focuses on Miyafujii stays much the same; her typical good character and willingness to help others. It is again the same thing you saw before in the anime, offering nothing new or really innovative. The new addition Hattori Shizuka is focused on as well, but sadly she is regulated to a simple character archetype and does not offer much in the character department. The only real enjoyment of the characters in this movie is seeing the other Strike Witches again, and the many cameos that appear from other Strike Witches doujins, light novels, and mangas. This is good fanservice in a sense, but to fully enjoy it the viewer has to have experienced and delved into the other works, which probably will not hold true for most people who have only gone through the anime.When it comes to the battles, Strike Witches has always been good with the eye-porn of the massive gun fights, lasers, going through enemy fire, and of course the panty shots. The animation during the movie's fights are superb and it makes really hard for someone to take their eyes away once the glorious air fights begin. There is beauty in seeing the Witches charge their way to the Neuroi, all the while giving you glimpses of those underskirts.In the end, Strike Witches The Movie is something made for the fans. It doesn't offer anything new to the brand or takes the one step forward to beyond. It follows the past formulas it has used; and in that sense it may objectively be said to be mediocre and taking advantage of a cash cow. Still, it gives the fans the enjoyable experience that have had in the anime, and there is no reason for someone who enjoyed the past two seasons to skip out on the movie. familiar?

Well, here you can watch the movie first, get an idea of the show, and if you enjoyed it, watch the TV series and OVA. Why? The prologue leading up to the title frame is an excellent primer to the franchise. There was something similar in the first episode of the show, but on a much smaller budget. The prologue in the film takes place (probably) between the two seasons of the show, featuring the cool and yet ahistorical alliance between...the Allies and Germany, er, Karlsland. After showing the joint armies and navies getting shredded by the Neuroi, a fantastic introductory sequence describing the ""history"" of the world and culminating in a typical battle with the ""counterattack"" theme soaring in the background... This is Strike Witches.Well, all right, that\'s not the be-all and end-all of the show. Strike Witches is a ""mecha-musume"" show, sure, but it\'s mainly a fantasy character drama loosely based on 20th century history. Yoshika Miyafuji reprises her role as a young woman from Yokosuka called upon to save Europe, but there\'s this teensy little problem: she lost her Witch powers.I kinda like the solution the production came up with: Shizuka, a straight-laced, by-the-book ""soldier"" Witch who knows the military regs backwards and forwards, and of course idolizes Yoshika, thinking she\'s this soldier hero. I suppose the New Girl (TM) here is an archetype of the ""history nerds"" in the audience. Like the other two ""proper"" soldiers in season 1 (Perinne and Gertrud), Shizuka is dismayed when Yoshika repeatedly and incorrigibly flaunts military protocol, and because of the idol worship angle, she is understandably crushed when Yoshika defies a direct order from a commanding officer. It\'s a simple conflict, it\'s been done before, but it was done very well and really rounded out Shizuka as a foil to Yoshika.Meanwhile, the European Witches (plus Charlotte), while scattered throughout different airbases, have been busy. There\'s a new Neuroi on the loose, and not only is it one helluva dogfighter, it seems to slip past reconnaisance patrols. While still not as interesting as the Neuroi ""Witch"" from season 1, I thought that it was a good way to show how far the 501st have come as a family of sorts and as a fighting force. At the same time, I thought the new Neuroi superpower was a clever one; World War II was a time when militaries rapidly advanced and depended upon technology, and what better way to throw a wrench into a mechanized army than to jam their radios?There\'s one bone I do have to pick with the show, and that\'s Eila and Sanya\'s scene. At first I thought it was a cute little interlude involving the two Witches that tended to be background characters from the beginning. A few years later and having watched Brave Witches, I now realize that the primary reason for that scene was to introduce the 502nd JFW visually and set the stage for their spinoff series. I think Eila/Sanya could\'ve been better utilized here (I\'ve never seen/heard a particularly good reason for moving them to the 502nd temporarily, they weren\'t involved in the major battle of that theater), and it made the impression upon me that the 502nd rides the 501st\'s coattails rather than standing upon their own strengths. I realize that\'s not entirely fair-- if the actresses of Brave Witches were cast at that point and each of them had a speaking line, it would\'ve made the spinoff a bit more approachable for me; however, I doubt that anyone other than Nipa and Sasha were cast when the film\'s dialogue was recorded-- that panning shot of (most of) the rest of the 502nd was probably a polished character design sketch at this point. I don\'t know, that scene felt like the entire Brave Witches series: so much potential, and yet an opportunity missed.The way Yoshika was brought back to the 501st is sappy, overly dramatic, predictably cliche, and yet oddly satisfying-- any fan of the series would\'ve wanted her back in the sky even if it meant breaking a few laws of physics and norms of reality. The reason Mio gave probably should\'ve been sent back for a rewrite, though. The final fight scene is solely to set up the 501st flying in formation to the tune of their fanfare music.Other highlights and wrap up:- A decent nod to the real Battle of the Bulge; I thought tossing in General Eisenhower was a cool touch. Too bad MacArthur, Halsey, or Yamamoto will likely never be seen in this franchise. Patton might make an appearance if they keep this up. Montgomery... who cares, he\'s a jerk.- As always, a solid character drama, though it did feel like a really long episode of the TV show rather than a proper motion picture.- Perinne has to be the best-developed character by the time of the film. In the beginning she was one-dimensional yuri fodder, always picking fights with Yoshika-- it was, frankly, a waste of Miyukichi\'s talents. In the film her character has embraced everything that infuriated her in the TV series, down to the medicinal herbs she was disappointed to find; instead of someone desperately trying to find peace around her, she has realized peace within herself. In the end, she\'s still a Mio fangirl, so that\'s funny too.- The soundtrack got an orchestral makeover (like Girls und Panzer a couple of years later). The new tracks are... all right.

The plot feels appropriate for a war movie and for a feel-good-friendship movie, which I wouldn’t have expected anyone to pull off, let alone Strike Witches. I feel like we're actually at war, which the seasons prior seemed to make feel fake. The movie progresses in such a way that...the pacing feels really good and natural, making the nearly 2 hour movie go by quicker than expected.I think art slipped. There’s particularly a scene where blood is overlaid on clothes and it's clear that the clothes move, but the blood doesn’t. It's fairly  noticeable. Otherwise, art would be on par with the rest of the series. Music and voice acting (English) were both really well done. I have to specifically give a bump in sound due to the scoring. It was really well done, in my opinion and added to the movie.Characters are similar to the series, but several have undergone growth between the series and movie, and that was depicted well in my opinion. Everything felt natural and unforced and the ridiculousness of being pantless became an afterthought with all the action on screen.Overall, I enjoyed the movie and felt it is the best of the main Strike Witches' saga until this point. the pacing feels really good and natural, making the nearly 2 hour movie go by quicker than expected.I think art slipped.

Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42351/Senpai_ga_Uzai_Kouhai_no_Hanashi,"['Wageslave propaganda or wholesome romcom? You decide! On today’s episode of “Get a Job, You Filthy NEET!”Seriously, what should this sub-genre even be called? The Declining Japanese Birthrates Genre? Newcomers may not know what I’m talking about, but over the past few years, we’ve been getting a lot of anime like this where, by contrast to the usual highschool romcom, we get a show that has every tangible element of a highschool romcom, that looks and feels exactly like a highschool romcom, and that features a cast of characters whose behavior and emotional maturity is fundamentally indistinguishable from those in highschool romcoms, but which instead...takes place in an office around allegedly adult characters. The initial thinking was that anime fans were growing up, graduating from highschool, entering the workforce, and would no longer be able to relate to teenage characters in a highschool setting, so the industry decided to give them similarly aged characters to project themselves onto, but it didn’t take long for everyone to realize this genre was most likely manufactured for a much more underhanded reason.Think military recruitment propaganda. They show you strong, capable soldiers engaging in exhilarating heroics, fighting for their country side by side with their trustworthy brothers and sisters in arms. They then say, “That could be you too! Sign up now! GoArmy dot com!” The idea is to romanticize and idealize a position which is actually much more grueling and unsexy than you’re made to believe, so that way you voluntarily sign up and only realize the reality of the situation after you’ve committed and can’t so easily back out. This genre which I’ve elected to call The Declining Japanese Birthrates Genre is functionally military recruitment propaganda, only instead of advertising positions in the military, it’s advertising positions in society as a whole, from which otaku have become increasingly estranged. “You don’t want to work and/or impregnate a girl to further the great Yamato race? You’d rather stay in your room and watch anime? Well, look at this! There’s cute anime girls in the workforce now too! [insert job hunting websites here]”This genre didn’t proliferate as a consequence of otaku entering the workforce. It proliferated as a consequence of them NOT entering the workforce, and when you start viewing these shows through the lens of bait, you simply cannot see them as anything else, and while these undertones don’t necessarily make these shows bad, they’re definitely manipulative. The first episode literally opens with the cute main girl running out her front door like Hirasawa Yui before her yelling, “Let’s go to work!” And it concludes with her looking directly into the camera, pouting, timidly blushing, and saying, “Couldn’t I be your wife?” I mean, is it even fucking possible to get more heavy-handed than that? The show goes so far out of its own way and so far beyond the furthest bounds of reality to paint the salaryman lifestyle in the most nicey-nice, happy-go-lucky, relaxed light it feasibly can, and yet despite having the transparency of a fucking window and despite my attempts to infect you with my cynicism, it nearly redeems itself simply by being a Doga Kobo show.Doga Kobo produces nothing but moe shows, and they’re really damn good at it. While their level of polish is much more modest than Kyoto Animation, for example, their animation is still consistently better than most modern anime, and as is usually the case, they clearly put a lot of effort into this. I personally think some of the character design elements aren’t particularly beautiful, like the main girl Futaba’s swampy green hair or the main guy Takeda’s distractingly bulky proportions, but overall, the artwork and animation is good enough that I quickly got over these minor subjective complains. Of course, the waifu bait isn’t complete unless you have a wide selection of girls, and the side couples the show sets up are at times even more likable than the main duo, whose gimmicky relationship can sometimes honestly overstay its welcome. At the end of the day, if you can look past its obvious intentions and just consume it as a generic, shallow, forgettable, but admittedly cute and fun workplace romcom, then this show is perfectly not bad.Thank you for reading. takes place in an office around allegedly adult characters.

GoArmy dot com!” The idea is to romanticize and idealize a position which is actually much more grueling and unsexy than you’re made to believe, so that way you voluntarily sign up and only realize the reality of the situation after you’ve committed and can’t so easily back out. This genre which I’ve elected to call The Declining Japanese Birthrates Genre is functionally military recruitment propaganda, only instead of advertising positions in the military, it’s advertising positions in society as a whole, from which otaku have become increasingly estranged. “You don’t want to work and/or impregnate a girl to further the great Yamato race? You’d rather stay in your room and watch anime? Well, look at this! There’s cute anime girls in the workforce now too! [insert job hunting websites here]”This genre didn’t proliferate as a consequence of otaku entering the workforce. It proliferated as a consequence of them NOT entering the workforce, and when you start viewing these shows through the lens of bait, you simply cannot see them as anything else, and while these undertones don’t necessarily make these shows bad, they’re definitely manipulative. The first episode literally opens with the cute main girl running out her front door like Hirasawa Yui before her yelling, “Let’s go to work!” And it concludes with her looking directly into the camera, pouting, timidly blushing, and saying, “Couldn’t I be your wife?” I mean, is it even fucking possible to get more heavy-handed than that? The show goes so far out of its own way and so far beyond the furthest bounds of reality to paint the salaryman lifestyle in the most nicey-nice, happy-go-lucky, relaxed light it feasibly can, and yet despite having the transparency of a fucking window and despite my attempts to infect you with my cynicism, it nearly redeems itself simply by being a Doga Kobo show.Doga Kobo produces nothing but moe shows, and they’re really damn good at it. While their level of polish is much more modest than Kyoto Animation, for example, their animation is still consistently better than most modern anime, and as is usually the case, they clearly put a lot of effort into this. I personally think some of the character design elements aren’t particularly beautiful, like the main girl Futaba’s swampy green hair or the main guy Takeda’s distractingly bulky proportions, but overall, the artwork and animation is good enough that I quickly got over these minor subjective complains. Of course, the waifu bait isn’t complete unless you have a wide selection of girls, and the side couples the show sets up are at times even more likable than the main duo, whose gimmicky relationship can sometimes honestly overstay its welcome. At the end of the day, if you can look past its obvious intentions and just consume it as a generic, shallow, forgettable, but admittedly cute and fun workplace romcom, then this show is perfectly not bad.Thank you for reading.', ""Ever wondered what's like to see what the office work environment in a slice of life comedy? Now you can see it with your eyes because My Senpai Is Annoying delivers the satisfaction of entertainment between two unlikely co-workers.At first glance, My Senpai Is Annoying might trigger some red flags due to the appearances of the two main leads. Takeda looks like someone who is old enough to be Futaba's dad. But don't let that fool you. Futaba is a older than she looks despite having the appearance of a teenager. Whenever you see the duo together, it looks like a mismatch because how...different they are. And really, Futaba displays the personality of a child when she's with Takeda. The title of the anime speaks for itself because she finds senpai Takeda annoying. Or does she....?Coming into this show, the expectations should be open minded. Be prepared to watch an anime without a complex plot because the anime has a simple premise. In fact, the anime doesn't even try to hide the fact that Futaba has a crush on Takeda. Everyone seems to know this except for Takeda himself. Nonetheless, Futaba is the one who is often annoyed by Takeda when he teases her. She believes her senpai treats her like a little sister. And indeed, their relationship does feel sibling-like despite the show advertising it as a romantic comedy. The 'will they or won't they?' is a question I'm sure viewers will be asking themselves as each episode progresses. However, I will just say that you should temper expectations if you're expecting an actual love story. This isn't one of those dramatic rom-coms that uses romance as a main selling plot. It relies much more on comedy to highlight our characters' daily lives and how they interact with each other.You may have also noticed on the promotional poster that Futaba and Takeda are surrounded by a small yet colorful supporting cast. Among one of the more interesting pairings in the show is Sakurai and Kazama. In later episodes, we see their inner connection and how they get along with each other both in and out of the office. Sometimes, it's even more appealing than watching Futaba and Takeda. Another noticable pair is Natsumi and Yuuto, with the the latter having a noticable crush on the tomboy. Watching this show will feel like a shipping war at times but honestly, I think that's what makes a rom-com effective. When you start to care about three or more character pairings in a single 12-episode show, then it's done a lot right that earned your attention.As mentioned previously, this isn't some complex anime with a deep story. Characterization is what you see on the surface that doesn't go into in-depth development. The episodes are neatly structured similar to sitcoms where every episode offers something different. From Valentine's Day to an outdoors competition on the basketball court, every episode brings characters together to experience life. So in essence, My Senpai Is Annoying is the type of show that sells you exactly what it advertises.And being a romantic comedy, the show keeps its visual quality simple and adapts them straight ouf of the manga. Now, the most obvious element to point at is the size difference between Futaba and Takeda. It's a running gag that both characters are self-aware of. Other characters such Sakurai makes the male population turn their heads. The anime doesn't make use of fan service much except through the use of ship teases. Overall, it keeps a simple yet effective usage of visual quality with every episode.Looking for something to relax your mind? My Senpai Is Annoying is the right show for you because it keeps everything so simple. And at the end of a stressful day, this show will give you something to smile about. different they are.

Which is just a treat to watch? This is what you'll get when it comes to this show.Set in an office setting, as if it's a normal working company, with working relations with other work people. Sorta like Retsuko in a way. As we watch the work place come alive trough various workers. Mainly through our small protagonist Futaba, who is not only a joy to see, but is also very expressive in her own right. She'll...sometimes hide her feelings, but most of the time, she'll always find a way to let them out. She's cute, she's precious, and honestly feels super relatable.Her senpai though....He's a sigma male honestly. The best kind of senpai anyone could ever want. Trust me, you're going to appreciate the ground he walks on, because he's a fucking gem. The show's title says 'annoying' but if anything, he's a pure hearted gentle giant man with a heart of gold, that can be my senpai any damn day of the week. He not only does his job well, but he also supports all his work colleges, mainly Futaba whom he works with a lot, and doesn't let her size, or any other feature bother him. To him, she's a normal adult like you or I. I honestly think that's so great. He;s a mans man.But the show isn't just about these two, there are also other characters in the mix that we have to talk about. Which range from some of Futaba's childhood friends, whom are quite the characters themselves. To even her grandpa, whom in one certain scene, just had me laughing from ear to ear. Besides those, we have a good focus on two characters in Touko, whom is just an angel, she's a true sweetie, you'll adore her for how she acts, and who she is. Along with Souta, who seems like a good dude overall, a good colourful bunch of characters that will push this show so far, and will make it each and every episode enjoyable from the get go.The art style can be summed up as bright, and detailed. A fitting artstyle that is not only pleasing to the eye, but doesn't look out of place no matter what scene. Along with the sound, the reactions from the characters are just good stuff all round. Nothing to complain about here.My senpai is annoying is just a gem all round. One of the ones to watch this season for sure, you SHOULD be watching it now. The story is just not only wholesome in so many ways, but it's charming, it's sweet, it's funny, it's really good viewing. Give it a go now, don't wait for it to finish in a couple of weeks.

As someone who used to like rom-coms, I can confidently say that My Senpai is Annoying (MSA) is the best rom-com, and probably romance of the year. Yes, you heard me. Now, let’s jump right in!For those unfamiliar with the show, its premise is not too different from rom-coms or sit-coms like The Office, Parks and Rec and Wotakoi. However, MSA is actually a lot less comedy oriented to the point I would actually consider the series to be mostly just a sweet and wholesome romance-slice of life. While shows like The Office and Parks and...Rec focus on comedy hijinks and Wotakoi is more about otaku culture, MSA genuinely wants to just show you who our characters are as people and the really cute ways they interact with each other, particularly with our female lead, Igarashi Futaba. The nice aspect about MSA’s comedy is that it never actually feels forced nor does it ever try to cram it down your throat. There’s actually a sizable amount of build up and a very high pay off for the audience’s ability to remain patient. The way this show actually delivers its jokes is actually to the point I would argue is realistic, which is perfect for an adult comedy, as the characters never overblow their reactions in ugly chibi art, but are genuinely shook by something they’ve seen/heard or have their fair share of embarrassing moments in the workplace/outside. There is never a purposefully inserted straight man and wise guy nor any particular visual gags for the sake of comedy, because the way MSA delivers situational and character-based humor is fairly natural without purposely trying to make a joke, unless it’s part of a character’s intention rather than the writer. I get that situational comedy is not for everyone, but trust me when I say it doesn’t ever feel like a skit. Despite all the positives I’ve said though, I would not recommend this show solely for the romantic comedy aspect as it’s not actually the core selling point, but is definitely in need of a mention.Specifically for the romance, there are 2 noteworthy ships in the show, Igarashi x Takeda and Sakurai x Kazama. I’m part of the uncommon opinion, but I actually believe Sakurai x Kazama is significantly worse. They’re an average ship amongst romance in all media, but given what the anime genre has to offer, they’re decent. First, let me explain who they are as characters. Kazama is the deadpan quiet otaku archetype of a character that helps out his crush, Sakurai while playing small pranks on his other coworkers. He’s actually written in a non-offensive way for the most part. The offensive part is that his eyes tend to have a male gaze…at women’s bodies, which is one of his forms of comedy. It was only funny with a specific gag in ep. 2 but no time else. As for Sakurai, she’s a more outgoing, friendly gal whose main characterization is her rack…She plays a more of a damsel-in-distress type of character but is actually a lot more shy than expected from her surface appearance when it comes to romance. When with her co-workers, she’s a fairly nice, and polite gal. Overall, their characterization is somewhat 3-D which is their strong aspect. However, their relationship is not as nuanced.A lot of their comedy together is borderline ecchi jokes which I feel like is something I’d laugh at in middle school, not as someone in college. A lot of their moments just involve Kazama saving Sakurai from a bad situation, or ‘boy-saves-girl and now boy and girl are in love’, which is not particularly impressive. Though, they do pay attention to each other like people who genuinely care about each other. It’s not like they’re inherently bad for each other, but I personally think Igarashi x Takeda outshines them completely. Sakurai x Kazama romance has at least one nonconsensual romantic moment that I will be vague about to avoid spoilers but just know that it is certainly there, at the end of episode 11; it’s played off for jokes when it’s neither funny nor comfortable to watch. I will admit Sakurai and Kazama do have some particularly sweet moments and sometimes good chemistry, but to call these two a realistic or even good couple…I would not wager more than $5 on that if at all.Before I talk about the main ship, I do want to note that Doga Kobo is the studio which animated MSA, and it’s generally known for very bad portrayal and character designs of its younger female characters, but I genuinely think My Senpai is Annoying is another step in the right direction for them along with Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun and Maojou de Oyasumi in terms of writing. The sakuga for this show is surprising as hell! Just look at the opening for this show, OPENING OF THE SEASON 10,000%. Even though I have 2 qualms about a boob joke and a non-con kiss scene in the opening song, I think it’s the best sound-wise and dynamically.The animation is way more fluid than this show probably deserves but it really opens up a new realm in the slice of life genre. Although the character designs are hard to get used to immediately, the consistency of their character models and the number of frames put into the best animated scenes, like in the subway, in the bar, and Igarashi’s home, are so nice to look at. All of them bring out character facial expressions and actions, I can’t help but gush about the effort put into this show.The soundtrack isn’t phenomenal, but it’s really fitting for this show. It’s just severely out-classed by its opening song, the really pop-out sound fx and the voice actors, so it’s not quite as memorable. As someone who used to sing in acapella, I have a huge love for any singers who use nasal, and I gotta praise Kusunoki Tomori, the seiyuu for Igarashi, for utilizing the beauty of nasally vocals in the opening song because it is so hard to do well. This is the only role of her’s I’ve particularly liked so I’m glad to say she’s showcasing her talent in the seiyuu industry.For the 4 episodes of the dub I watched, it actually felt like a different experience so I would encourage potential viewers to try both. I personally like Igarashi’s sub voice acting more, but drunk Igarashi in the dub is SO FUNNY! The dub is a little weird to get used to initially, but Mona, a less important character, has a dub that is incredibly comedic, even more so than the sub seiyuu who voices Kaguya Shinomiya, one of the best voice acted roles in the last few years! Kudos to the dub on this one. But…if I had to choose between sub and dub though, I’d give a slight win to the sub, only because the dub occasionally uses some weirdly non-casual vocabulary and unnatural laughter in regular chats amongst the cast members, so I think the dub script translations are not as good as the subtitle translations and the voice actors are not quite as experienced.Animation: 8.5/10Art: 6.5/10Soundtrack: 7/10Sound FX: 8/10Opening: 9/10Sub Voice Acting: 8/10Dub Voice Acting: 7.5/10As for Igarashi x Takeda, I genuinely like them a lot. Igarashi’s character design in particular might be an issue for some people and she is LOWKEY a tsundere. I will say though that the way Igarashi is presented is not completely unbelievable the more you watch her as a character. I find myself rooting for her all the time because she genuinely tries her best to be honest about her feelings and be an independent adult.  Ever since she was in middle school, she didn’t want to be a burden to anyone and that feeling was amplified by her lack of physical growth. In fact, because she is so short, Igarashi has an inferiority complex to her co-workers that causes much of the self-confidence issues she has, also why she cannot confess to Takeda. I think what makes Igarashi a strong character is that she’s willing to accept help and work together with others. She’s certainly a flawed character but that’s what makes her so lovable to me! It’s to the point I just want her ship to win! I don’t drink alcohol but I feel drunk with joy seeing her complain about her life at the bar because she is fairly interesting as an adult woman with short people problems (please don’t kill me short readers)!As for Takeda, as much as I like him as a person, he’s actually a fairly weak character overall. He’s too perfect lowkey, since he’s always there to help everyone, always optimistic, and never makes any mistakes. It’s unfortunate since Takeda deserves as much development and flawed characterization as Igarashi. He’s like a teddy bear personality and honestly my type, but there’s not much to him beyond that. He doesn’t get a backstory or any particularly in-depth moments either, until the last episode where he expresses a lack of self-esteem for the first time, so we’ll have to see how he is next season, if we get one. Overall, the romance is one-sided, but their chemistry as friends who care about each other is nice to see in a romance! I don’t particularly mind if they do or don’t get together to be fairly honest, but I hope their friendship at the very least grows stronger.Last 2 things I want to touch off on are Igarashi's gramps and Natsumi. When the most clingy person in an anime is not even someone in love but a grandpa, you knowww they’re being subversive! This guy is hilarious af! He loves his granddaughter to the point where he’s riding a motorcycle cities away just to see Igarashi if she sheds a tear, but to Igarashi herself, he is quite over-bearing and even embarrassing at times, but not necessarily in a bad way! Their relationship is fortunately given more depth in a backstory, so there will be an explanation. If you don’t like romance but like slice of life comedy, I would honestly recommend watching the show for just that one supporting character. Natsumi, Igarashi’s childhood friend, is another character I would like to appreciate because she’s actually characterized and developed as well as Igarashi, a great surprise. Her backstory episode with Igarashi is personally my favorite of the whole series as it gives the audience an under-the-surface perspective of how the characters became who they are today. I don’t want to spoil, so I will leave it there for Natsumi.In conclusion, this is the must-watch romantic-comedy of 2021 that’s not really a romantic-comedy. It’s not even the best thing ever but as someone who had rom-com burnout to the point I actually think I hate rom-coms, this genuinely makes me want to watch more rom-coms which I’ll probably regret. I have My Senpai is Annoying to blame for that *angry face*>:( ♫Ano no noo ano no noo Annoying san san week!!♫Overall: 7.2/10Enjoyment: 8.5/10Happy holidays everyone!

He loves his granddaughter to the point where he’s riding a motorcycle cities away just to see Igarashi if she sheds a tear, but to Igarashi herself, he is quite over-bearing and even embarrassing at times, but not necessarily in a bad way! Their relationship is fortunately given more depth in a backstory, so there will be an explanation. If you don’t like romance but like slice of life comedy, I would honestly recommend watching the show for just that one supporting character. Natsumi, Igarashi’s childhood friend, is another character I would like to appreciate because she’s actually characterized and developed as well as Igarashi, a great surprise. Her backstory episode with Igarashi is personally my favorite of the whole series as it gives the audience an under-the-surface perspective of how the characters became who they are today. I don’t want to spoil, so I will leave it there for Natsumi.In conclusion, this is the must-watch romantic-comedy of 2021 that’s not really a romantic-comedy. It’s not even the best thing ever but as someone who had rom-com burnout to the point I actually think I hate rom-coms, this genuinely makes me want to watch more rom-coms which I’ll probably regret. I have My Senpai is Annoying to blame for that *angry face*>:( ♫Ano no noo ano no noo Annoying san san week!!♫Overall: 7.2/10Enjoyment: 8.5/10Happy holidays everyone!"", ""---*** CONTAINS SPOILERS ***---Contrary to a lot of the other top reviews, I found Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi to be quite... unremarkable?Comedy/Romance/Slice of Life are a genre combination that has been done so, so many times by now, it's hard to even keep track. This has the effect of new shows having to be especially memorable in some way or another, or they will just fade away as the next season comes with a new (possible multiple) Comedy/Romance/Slice of Life anime.Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi does nothing remarkable in terms of the plot. They just threw us into the world of a...cute junior saleswoman and her senior who is comically large compared to her, and then just left viewers to watch the largely predictable plotlines play out. If you know the slightest bit about Japanese working norms, or have watched any slice of life anime that has adult characters living in Japan, you won't ever get surprised by the plotlines or settings that are supposed to drive the story.The characters are nothing to write home about.Futaba is a pretty generic, fiesty loli-type that is secretly caring and kind, we've seen that archetype countless of times over the years.Takeda is a gentle but protective giant that is also pretty clueless, and he has to be those things, because if he were not, the show would not be able to play on the dynamic between him and Futaba at every chance they get. Very stuck in his archetype with little room to be anything else.Sakurai is a basic flawless pretty girl that all the guys have a crush on.Kazama is a basic introverted but capable guy.The most endearing character in this show, to me, is actually Futaba's grandfather. The interactions between him and his granddaughter are some of the most wholesome and heartwarming in the show. It would be a lie to say that it doesn't put a smile on my face when he fawns over her or reminisces about when she was an even smaller girl. The interpersonal issues he has with her are also very believable, understandable and as relatable as a 60 year olds' problems can be to a 20-something guy with no kids.The characters don't have any actual backstory. We get too much context as to why they are the way they are, how their experiences form their choices, how they arrived at where they are in life. The characters just conform to their archetype and don't really get a much of a story.It's really a shame, because to me, complex and imaginative characters are really what drive these sort of anime onto the next level, but it's just not present here.Now, I've made it sound bad, but honestly this is not better or worse than any average, seasonal anime with the same genres. You go in, get your fix of a little bit of cute, predictable lovey-dovey stuff and get out after a quick 12 episodes. Nothing horrible, confusing or deplorable about it, even if it is unoriginal.At best, you get attached to the cute looking characters, the well made art (nicely done, studio), and the quirky dynamic between the two main characters.At worst, you get pretty bored with strict archetypes and unoriginal content. cute junior saleswoman and her senior who is comically large compared to her, and then just left viewers to watch the largely predictable plotlines play out.

The side characters also have their own charm with the main cast as well as with each other .The characters are kind of tropey, yet not so much so that they do not feel like actual people, the Tsundere is nicely balanced and does not get to your nerves (which I feel would set a precedent already).couple of surprise secondary characters who are quite wholesome.This anime has the most unique opening this season, it's really well done and  I absolutely love it. From the OP music, many can tell that this anime has very high production values, the Ed is alright I guess. The Vas do an above-average job especially sakura and Kazuma their VA s are also pretty well known .the Artsyle is unique but really not my type, (that is the only reason I watched this after a few clips were out).The animation however is surprisingly well done at places you would least expect ! The OP also has real fluid animation which really helps add to the already great music.overall a very good show with the very right balance of romance slice of life and comedy. given the high budget it has received I am hopeful that it will be a sleeper hit and recommend it to everyone without hesitation. and easy to follow we have a senpai, we have a kohai they have an interesting dynamic both physically and emotionally .

Then I found out that this was a romance anime and thought I\'d give it a try anyway since I quite like romance anime.Watching this anime in this dry season was a very good choice on my part.What we have here, is a *GOOD* rom-com filled with just about every cliche imaginable. A simple innovation of the common...plot devices, with the selling point being another mutually simple essence of clarity. I\'m sure I don\'t need to iterate for the 42351st time now, having been a fan of down-to-earth material with an abstract waveform of ecstasy radiated from itself, it comes to merely understand a different logical perspective as to why this is simply borderline amazing.This honest piece of work focuses on the life of Futaba and her ""annoying"" senpai. Really and truly, she is the annoying one but people submit to the fact that tsunderes are just tsundere so let them be and do whatever. To me, that\'d kill any kind of wholesomeness aspect. We have people seething over literally any controversial character but won\'t bat an eye when Taiga or some other bitchy tsundere does a 360 headshot on their significant other, I mean, I am not a fan of asshole characters made out to be like some kind of saint. Maybe I am just hating on tsunderes a little too much but this part is relevant so hear me out. My point is here that you won\'t be getting any hardcore tsundere nonsense here. Sure, there are the physical moments that arise every now and then but I believe Futaba isn\'t even the worst of the bunch I\'ve seen in my time in the medium. If you absolutely detest characters like her, that\'s understandable, but for those having similar tolerance to me, I promise that this anime is tame with the premise and tropes it uses.Anyway, the actual wholesomeness would extend from the impeccable relationships in this anime. This is something to endorse for sure, something to truly embrace as you breathe in the oxygen you do today. This right here is *GOOD* relationships presented in a fun and light-hearted manner. I am actually unable to extend this review into madness relative to such a point, because it is that simple of an anime, yet it\'s amazing character pairing, the situations pairs get into, or just the little stories that arise every now and then. Relatively, very *REAL* stuff.I suppose I should actually talk about the characters here, the people who actually make this worthwhile. From what I know, they seem to be very human, or at least, there are those who stick to their trope whilst bouncing around into other genuine behaviour in a way that is neither haphazard nor awkward. As said, cliches here all around, same with character tropes. But I do really believe that these characters have some honesty to them. It\'s weirdly more true for anyone who isn\'t Futaba or Takeda actually. You have Sakurai who has some genuine feelings whilst acting a little smug around those she has no interest in, Kazama that is literally just that dude in the corner with his feelings and what have you, actually having to be dug out from his quiet soul to find out more about him. On that point, Sakurai and Kazama is literally the best ship in this anime and is probably the most pushed forward in terms of growth, yes, the secondary relationship actually gets attention here (ikr, it\'s amazing). There\'s also an elaborate background for Natsumi, and a cool weirdo Mona who brings life to the scene with her superficially dull-looking self. Don\'t get me wrong, the main two are something to stay for too. Whilst Takeda is indeed a dense dude who just doesn\'t seem to understand some obviously irrational feelings of his kouhai, one must note that their time together simply isn\'t null, it is a blissful experience to watch the two do what they do together, something of which shouldn\'t be skipped for sure. The two may not be all original, but it is very honest stuff that isn\'t extrapolated into absurdity for the sake of milking rubbish due to the lack of infinite ideas available.On the production side of things. I will say that, yes, this one surely doesn\'t hit any high marks anywhere. Looks ""generic"" for its time and the OST is indeed something that just subconsciously goes out as fast as it comes in. But again, I don\'t see any reason for that to be a reason to not watch this. I am repeating myself here, an honest piece of work, it doesn\'t necessarily need KyoAni on job for it to be loveable, if anything, it probably would be unfitting. At the very least of ""high-quality"", the OP slaps and is actually something to not skip, so hey, at least try that.Overall, this is a very enjoyable thing to watch, certainly something that I would recommend to all trying to watch some good rom-com. This one will age, and it will age like Monthly Girls\' Nozaki-kun, Wotakoi and the likes. It is just a nice anime to watch without having to fuss too much about any kind of major unnecessary attentive detail, being very serious here. Easy 9/10 stuff.Anyway, I\'ve pulled this review outta my ass as usual, but I thought that I\'d at least try to say more than push off some ""yea this good, go watch it"" type review. So hopefully this actually helped anyone who wants to go watch this anime. Also, it\'s a bit odd to talk about Christmas in real life in a review, since this will age into the future, but for this self-aware instant in time, Merry Christmas :) plot devices, with the selling point being another mutually simple essence of clarity.

Which is why to no ones surprise a plethora of awaited adaptations and sequels came out for this Fall season. One such anime was Senpai ga Urusai Kouhai no Hanashi a cute albeit not entirely original Office romance, Think the likes of Ore Monogatari!! Blended together with Wotakoi; surprisingly up until the a few weeks ago I had never heard of the series and going in...I was expecting a slightly above average run of the mill office romance with a slightly eccentric cast of characters, and I got what I expected.The story follows a short office woman named Igarashi Futaba – she’s commonly made fun of due to her comically childish appearance juxtapose this to her large, burly, bear-like senpai, Takeda Harumi. Majority of the story seems to just be a series of loosely connected events that push the romance further, the story is presented basically like it’s a gag manga. With and episodic format like that it’s always going to be hit or miss with the stories contained in the episodes – with arc based stories momentum from previous episodes can keep you engaged but with episodic stories you generally need a consistent stream of good episodes – so far the episodes are mediocre at worst, decent at best. I understand that the Gag format is a stylistic writing choice on the part of the creator, but I think that for stories like this that a continuous story based format can work better. Not to say that everything is bad here, there are a lot of very cute moments, say for example when Futaba gets drunk, but for the most part the stories lack substance or aren’t the most interesting to watch.But most of that can be forgiven given the episodic format does not yield to the most compelling stories, the characters are usually the driving force behind the personality and the image of the show, this is no different in Senpai ga Urusai Kouhai no Hanashi. The characters are very hit or miss, I don’t particularly dislike any characters but some characters just aren’t the most interesting. Igarashi Futaba is your Titular tsundere loli – She’s cute but terribly stereotypical which does detract from my enjoyment. She’s just not very unique, nothing about her separates her from the other characters of her architype, during the 4 episodes I watched It was this nagging thing in my head “Another tsundere who complains about having a flat chest and being short” it’s almost like a check list at this point. Takeda is the male lead of the story, a strong, stoic definition of Masculinity he is safe to say, refreshing. You don’t see many overly masculine males playing the leading male role in a cutesy romance anime and Takeda is one of my favourites; he’s Wholesome, he’s funny, he’s very likeable. For a the Male lead, he’s solid – if there was any issue I had with him, he’s dense – comically so. Whenever authors write a dense characters it’s almost always to draw out the romance for as long as possible which is just painful to sit through. However the Chemistry between Futaba and Takeda makes for a fun and wholesome relationship. As for the supporting cast; they’re decent Sakurai and Kazama have this cute back and forth and it’s obvious that they both like each other and it makes for a cute side story to any given episode. Natsumi didn’t strike me as a very interesting character, she serves her purpose as the titular friend/wingman character – this is probably the character I would like to see develop the most over the story. Minor supporting characters like Futaba’s grandfather and Tsukishiro are decent comedic relief and I quite enjoyed what little time they had on-screen.As far as Art goes, nothing mind blowing but the animation is definitely slightly above the curve for normal anime. Notably the opening for the anime has some pretty stellar animation – it was oddly reminiscent of the Komi-San opening from this season, but only because of the similar production value and release date. All in all I think the art and animation is fine, some of the characters are certainly easy on the eyes and for the most part – I liked the art style.I think the opening for this anime, is really goddamn cute – starting with the song “Annoying! San San Week!” done by all the VA’s for the show, It’s a lowkey bop, it’s fun, uplifting and it perfectly fits the show, I absolutely adore this song. Some standout moments for me was the cute little interaction between Kazama and Sakurai, I also liked how the whole opening is like a Company video edited by Futaba it’s just a cute world building touch because sometimes you forgot, this is an office romance. The opening is a really catchy song with some nice amusing visuals. The ED ""Niji ga Kakaru Made no Hanashi” by Yui Horie is just another really cute song. It’s shot in this painting frame esc floating panels way and it makes for a nice and simplistic ending – has some nice moments with the ending especially in the final scene of the ED where it’s just two drinks one for Futaba and one for Takeda. As far as the general OST of the Anime, it really wasn’t anything all that impressive, at least none of the tracks I heard. The Voice acting was also fine, they fit the characters well, Igarashi is cute, Takeda is masculine etc. I don’t remember any really stellar performances but what was their I enjoyed.This show is nothing special, It’s cute has decent production and a decent cast fun characters that you can get behind. I don’t see this blowing anyone’s mind with some amazing plot or characters development but for fans of Romance I think it’s worth watching especially if you enjoy that type of Vanilla romance anime. So in conclusion, have fun with this one, but don’t expect anything amazing.

The show has flat character dynamics with repetitive jokes. The main loli girl cries in almost every episode over nonsensical crap. It adds nothing new to the rom com genre. People that are giving this high ratings are people who have never watched a rom com before. Because there are loads of actually good rom coms that at least try to be different. Watching it weekly was fine but if I tried to binge watch this I'd probably get bored right away. "", ""It's a rom-com, I don't know why I expected more. They end the anime by managing to be under the same umbrella together... The anime character archetypes of big strong guy small defenseless girl are kind of annoying but the anime has cute art and char interaction. The story not going farther than the first episode is pretty trash to be honest.This is the section where I spam word count because this review system requires me to meet a minimum requirement while writing. A minimum requirement would force me to talk more about the anime and perhaps give you a better understanding of the work...itself. However, this also encourages me to talk about specific parts of the anime and thus give more spoilers than needed in a review. They're also destroy creative integrity by forcing people to meet minimum requirements they ramble about things not related—or only tangentially related—to the anime for longer than necessary. I could understand barring one or two sentence reviews, but no one cares about anime, especially not a trash rom com, enough to read through a page long review. They desire a short and curt review.

Is that long enough?"", 'The title is misleading. Well, sort of, just not in the way you think.When I first glanced at the promotional picture of My Senpai is Annoying, along with its anime title, I instinctively thought the “annoying” part was applied to the big, muscular guy in the promotion picture: Futaba Igarashi’s senpai, Harumi Takeda. I thought this show was going to center its gags, plot, and moments around Takeda actively teasing and annoying Igarashi to no end. I was proven wrong. The “annoying” part is really from the perspective of Igarashi. In the office space that she has been working in for the past two...years, Igarashi wants to impress her co-workers and her senpai. It’s the natural thing to do. But given her unusually short height, cute, and charming personality, Igarashi’s co-workers and her senpai often make fun of her in a light-hearted demeanor. They, including Takeda, appreciate Igarashi’s driven personality and dedication to her work, of course. So one of the ways they acknowledge Igarashi is by interacting with her in a manner that makes her think they’re just teasing her. And the anime emphasizes this in clever ways. But as the series progresses, Igarashi also realizes this and plays along. The bonding moments between Igarashi, Takeda, Touko Sakurai, and the other co-workers make up the large majority of the wholesome moments.What I like about this show is that the moments of wholesomeness, interactions, and developments feel natural. The chemistry between Igarashi and her supporting cast is just right. Their personalities and quirks play off each other nicely. When all these elements play well together, it makes the romantic pieces between Igarashi and Takeda, Sakurai and Kazama, feel genuine.An anime isn’t complete without a great cast of voice actors who fit the personalities of the characters in their roles. As Japanese voice casting normally goes, the voice castings are more often than not fit the characters up to a T. Take Takeda, for example. Takeda has the voice of a deep, raucous, yet gentle tone. The multi-tone shift that the voice actor of Harumi Takeda can convey gives more liveliness and affection to the big guy that Takeda is. The same goes for Igarashi, Sakurai, Kazama, and so on. Each of the character archetypes is accompanied by the right voices. My Senpai is Annoying is episodic, which adds another positive aspect to this anime because the series utilizes this structure in a crafty way. While each of the episodes is structured individually to continue its episodic entertainment, there are still threads within the narrative that connect one episode to the next. Because of this type of presentation, the characters, and narrative have a feeling of progress rather than being stagnant.My Senpai is Annoying is one of those shows in a season that can’t go wrong. It’s a fairly conventional series that follows the formula of its predecessors, and just like them, it’s a blast to watch this anime.Score: 7/10 years, Igarashi wants to impress her co-workers and her senpai.

I am however very sensitive to anything embarrassing when it comes to romance and social interaction, so there were frequent small breaks while watching, and I really had to man up to get through most episodes. That isn't a bad thing, it's just how I react, and a kind of trigger warning to others who suffer badly from second hand embarrassment! I handle it with taking breaks and watching alone.

And on every week full of stress and problems that this world continuously offers, there\'s at least a day of pure bliss and relaxation that I can sit down and enjoy a slight moment of my life because of Senpai Ga Uzai.Expecting a generic romance full of cliched setups and is targeted to horny teenage males, this anime is truly far from that. What awaits...is a much more mature writing that surely may not be relatable, yet manages to become slightly more realistic and humorous due to the nature of the characters themselves.Spoiler-free review of course — it\'s hilarious that there\'s an anime where the side characters just outshined the main characters because of their chemistry, and it\'s this one. A slightly NEET introverted male and a modest kind-hearted female bombing with sex appeal, these supporting characters hands down carried this whole anime.That\'s not to say the main characters were simply irrelevant. In fact, even if the supporting characters consistently manage to offer sweet, heartwarming moments in each episode, there\'s just these moments where the main characters go full speed and bring moments that are genuinely wacky, wholesome, and really enjoyable.

I chose this over Komi-san to watch weekly, and oh boy did I not regret that. Now I can binge Komi-san though now that it\'s finished.The title is surely a scam. Senpai is really great.

I will be basing my review off of these four episodes.TLDR;I really like this show. While there isn\'t anything that is boundary breaking for this genre, most aspects of ""Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi"" push the boundary. If you enjoy SoL anime in general, you will probably like this show more than your generic SoL. It\'s too early to tell if the romance aspect will turn out great, but there is potential for romance fans to really like this show based...off of the romance factor. Finally, the comedy is fairly funny. I haven\'t found myself laughing out loud yet; however, every one of the 4 episodes released have caused me to smile and laugh under my breath, and that is a welcome thing for someone who is both working and going to graduate school full-time. I need all the laughter I can get *insert pained chuckle*.Story: 7/10So far the story is good. While there is nothing groundbreaking (as it is a SoL), this SoL does a good job of creating a story each episode with an overarching theme. Each episode follows Futaba Igarashi as she goes about her life, trying to get by in the workplace. The story hasn\'t really shown anything from the POV of Harumi Takeda, or ""Senpai"", yet. However, we have seen the POV of other secondary characters. In my experience, SoL genre anime\'s usually are lacking in the story department. I am not a huge fan of SoL in general due to this fact. However, the story isn\'t bad and I haven\'t been bored yet. As long as the show continues on its current trajectory, I do not plan to lower my story rating of 7/10, and I might even raise it to an 8/10.Art: 9/10I absolutely LOVE the art in this show. At first glance, this looks like the generic art found in your modern ""1 season, 12 episodes then dropped"" anime; however, where the artists really shine is in their use of lighting. The artists use subtle angles and reflections to really focus on certain shots, and I love it. Many an anime will use colors and angles to bring attention to certain scenes; however, not many make good use of lighting. ""Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi"" makes use of all three aspects. This might just be my favorite thing about this show honestly.Sound: 9/10What more is there to say, 9/10 on sound. The OP is already in my spotify playlist, I really like it. The ending theme is also really good, and the OST does a good job of filling out the scene but not overtaking it.Character: 8/10I really like the character\'s in this anime. The MC is good, but I wouldn\'t say she\'s great. I think she\'s funny, but sometimes her tsundere personality can be annoying if I\'m being honest. Like, you\'re in your 20\'s, it\'s really not embarrassing to like someone. However, it\'s not such a turnoff to give the character rating anything lower than an 8/10. So far my favorite characters in order are Touko Sakurai, Futaba Igarashi, and Harumi Takeda.Enjoyment: 8/10So far I am really enjoying this show. Honestly, I don\'t know why someone wouldn\'t enjoy this show unless they just aren\'t a fan of SoL in general.Overall: 8/10This show makes me happy, and we all need a little of that in our lives. There is nothing groundbreaking in this anime, but it is on the verge of pushing past the boundary. In an age of anime where most shows barely hit the minimum, ""Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi"" pushes past the minimum and comes just short of being great.

The side characters get equal screen-time and are pretty different from each other, but everyone is a little flat. It can be very slow at times, but the artwork is consistently nice.

Sometimes it can feel a bit slow but the it picks uo the speed again.Main point: It is fun and...calming to watch. calming to watch."", 'Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi is basically a high school rom-com, but in an office setting. What I find weird is that when reading one of the reviews, they said that the office life was  ""Wage slave propaganda.""I think they meant ""romanticized."" Clearly, office work is not fun unless you\'re the 1% that actually like doing their job. Kind of like school? School life in rom-coms suffer the same issue, so I find it weird that this review criticizes one, and not the other. Clearly, school life in anime are extremely exaggerated in how fun/happy every is. Wow, who woulda thought? So...why would it not apply to a light-hearted comedy rom-com set in an office environment? The office setting was basically used to set it apart to the billion high school rom-coms out there. What, if the anime was set in high school, you\'re going to say that it\'s unoriginal and lackluster?Well, funny story: even in an ""office environment,"" if everyone in the office acts like middle to high schoolers, it doesn\'t really matter what the setting is like. So, it really is just an extremely mediocre generic rom-com that could have modified it\'s setting to a high school and nothing would have changed.Would I say characters are bad? No, but they\'re clearly extremely boring and bland, even at episode 6.

If you\'ve read the synopsis on this anime\'s page, you\'d know that this show is set in an urban, business-heavy setting. Most of the characters are fully grown adults with paying jobs, and a decent amount of experience in the real world. So with that, you\'d expect a romantic comedy with seinen-oriented humor, right? Well, that\'s not exactly what you get.I went into this anime thinking the humor and common struggles would be par for the course office life...stuff. In reality, this show mostly just feels like another high school slice of life, despite the separate setting. It doesn\'t exactly go the extra mile to properly use its setting as a driving force for what happens. Most scenes could behave in the exact same way if the characters were high school students rather than office workers. The setting seems less like a drive for the standard antics, and more like an excuse to have scenes where the characters are drinking. Drinking and taking business calls seems to be the only two things even remotely adult in this show aside from the characters\' canonical ages.Genre-wise, this show definitely falls short on the comedy aspect, and a little bit on the romance aspect too. A lot of the jokes in this anime are lacking in comedic timing and some of which don\'t even have punchlines. I will give it credit for choosing not to rely on purely sexual humor, though. That\'s one of the biggest weaknesses with this new genre of ""teasing romances"" like Uzaki chan and Nagatoro. So, good on the writers for mixing it up a bit. As for the romance aspect, it\'s very unbalanced. The two main characters have the typical ""too stupid to understand their own feelings"" trope while their two other coworkers are having a side plot with a decent, mature romance (which is more what I expect from protagonists who are full grown adults). Suffice to say, the most compelling thing that happens between the main couple is the back and forth between the protagonist\'s grandfather and her romantic interest.All in all, this anime is very safe. it sticks to what people like, maybe a little too much, but it also throws in its own cute moments that are more on the original side. I will dock points for not taking advantage of its setting, and a couple more points for the beach episode and the basketball episode which were extremely hard to get through. Also, kind of uncomfortable how they style the main character to look like a child. It\'s not hard to make her short AND look her age. With all of that, it\'s a solid 6/10. stuff.

The difference maybe subtle but it has a significant impact on who this show caters towards. My Senpai is Annoying is primarily directed for those that have a romantic itch. One that front, at least on the surface, there is quite a few things to be had as not only does this series take place in an office setting as opposed to...the more usual school type setting this show has not one but two ongoing romances!Sounds good, well there are some issues that need to be raised. The primary one being this is really a by the numbers type of series which is kinda ironic when you think about the setting being a business. In fact, it is so by the numbers it is almost like someone made a checklist on what a slice-of-life/romantic series should have: Christmas episode? Check! New Year’s episode? Check! Beach episode? Check? There are more typical slice-of-life episodes inserted which I could mention suffice to say you should get the picture. If you have seen any slice-of-life/romantic anime before My Senpai is Annoying is going to cover some very familiar ground which, if you’re a fan is great news on the other hand if you want something original then you have come to the wrong place and should give this a miss.This was unfortunate as I felt it was a missed opportunity considering the office type environment could have provided a unique sense of drama and tension to the show. Still there are the characters and when it comes to romance that is the most important the bit right? Well on this ground I will make a disclaimer and say I am a big fan of tsundere/loli characters so it should come as no surprise my favourite character in the whole show would be Futaba. Not only are her antics amusing but she is so adorable with the way she dresses, behaves and the general hobbies she has. Always amusing especially when you here are denials to the contrary!What’s more her source of affections, Harumi Takeda is also a strong co-lead as his loud, boisterous, honest and open personality made him a person that is fun to watch and easy to root for. At the same time, it was easy to understand how Futaba could like him given his positive traits. The case was made all the stronger when you consider her upbringing which was even hinted at with one of the episodes.The main issues I had was with the secondary romantic partners of Touko Sakurai and Souta Kazama who I felt were much more generic. I felt Touko was the standard hot girl who while pretty, did not have any distinguishing features beyond that to make her stand out. If this was disappointing then I felt Souta was even worse as he just seemed like an emo ultra-reserved person with no personality whatsoever. This lack of defining personality made it hard for me to understand how he could snatch a girl as pretty as Touka. In fact, it almost seemed like Souta’s character was a self-insert for the fans who wanted to live their dreams of getting a nice beautiful girl.Another negative with this show was the lack of character/relationship development. Despite this series following a bunch of adults in many ways they act like kids from a standard school romantic story as EVERYONE has difficulty expressing their emotions. Whilst it can have its amusing moments the lack of progression became a drag to the series. It would have been nice if there was more progress but alas there wasn’t.Animation/music:I found the character designs to My Senpai is Annoying enjoyable. Furthermore, the colour schemes and choices were good and I particularly liked the way Futaba and Natsumi Kurobe where designed but I am sure there would be some fans for Touko! Barring the beach episode fanservice is kept to a minimum so if you are a romantic lover who likes a bit of sauce… Well, you won’t find much sauce here.What was more notable was the opening and ending sequences that had not only good animation sequences (the opening is the shoutout) the songs delivered during these moments were great! The opening song “Annoying! San San Week! was a collaboration effort between the voice actors of Futaba, Touko, Natsumi and Mona Tsukishiro while the ending song was ""Niji ga Kakaru Made no Hanashi"" was done by Yui Horie.Summary:If you are a fan of rom-coms that don’t stray far from the beaten path then My Senpai is Annoying will give you a lot of joy. You get all the classic episodes from Christmas/New year specials, beach episodes and more so if that is your thing then you will enjoy this and better yet know what to expect!Character wise the main pair is actually pretty good and it is enjoyable seeing Futaba and Harumi interact as not only do we get some funny moments but the budding relationship does contain numerous wholesome moments. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the other pairing which seemed a lot blander in comparison. Moreover, if you want high drama or a culmination to the romantic relationships then you are out of luck.At the end of the day this is a largely formulaic series that just goes through the motions in what it expects fans to like. If you are a rom-com/slice-of-life fan, go for this but its formulaic nature means it is unlikely to appeal to others outside this genre particularly if you have a dislike for tsundere/loli characters. In many ways this is a distinctively average series and in terms of romance you get better renditions in even non-romantic animes. For example, Jobless Reincarnation part 2 does a better job of building romance than this show delivers.Story 5.5 – My Senpai is Annoying follows the tried and tested episodes so as such can only be ranked as average. The only unique selling point is the show takes place in an office and not a school. On the positive side the primarily relationship is an endearing affair with a number of comedy moments that will leave you amused. In many ways though the story is largely forgettable.Characters 6.5 – Futaba and Harumi are the standouts that prevent this show from falling into mediocrity. Their characters plus the chemistry they have is good especially if you consider Futaba’s background. This is in large contrast to the secondary relationship which was pretty poor if I am honest. Natsumi and Mona also had their moments but were not significant enough characters to make much of a difference to the overall enjoyment from the cast.Animation 7.5 – The stronger point of the series as the character designs and likeable colouring schemes made this easy on the eyes. More than that however was the musical score with the show boasting above average opening and ending sequences. The opening in particular really gets you into the mood of the series and was something that did not get old.Overall 6 – I couldn’t recommend this series to anyone who isn’t a fan of either slice-of-life, romantic/comedies or big loli lovers. There is simply not enough going on to make this a worthwhile series but if you like those genres (or girls) then it may be worth your time. There are better romantic shows out there though so if you have a backlog probably best to visit those shows first. the more usual school type setting this show has not one but two ongoing romances!Sounds good, well there are some issues that need to be raised.

By the end they’ve all kind of accepted, “I like them, they MIGHT like me but I’m not sure” but then did nothing past that. Kazama gets a leg pillow and Igarashi gets to share an umbrella. I love slice of life with a dash of romance but this just didn’t do it for me.

But if I had to explain it I would go to three points:1: Their simplicity makes the relationship much more relatable with an office environment.2: Their story-line is much...more lighthearted and shows the slower side of life, which is much better in my opinion for a romance & comedy anime.3.

No, shortstack :thumbsup:This is a very real and nice romcom to relax to. It\'s a wholesome slice of life that portrays the everyday life of a kohai and her senpai, the best couple of the season and the oneesan tag.The plot mainly focuses on the 3 things I just listed above, it gives us great character development and brings a wholesome conclusion each episode. The show feels fresh and full of motion in every episode. It\'s just a really good show if you want a relaxing experience that doesn\'t bring much tension or suspense, but still feels natural.The characters are just a treat...to watch, especially when they are together. We have the main couple; Futaba and Takeda (by now their height difference doesn\'t even matter, I just got used to it, and you will to after watching this show), they have a senpai kouhai relationship and it\'s really wholesome to watch, since most of the things he does are similar to things you\'d to when you\'re a couple. The one sided love is pretty funny, it\'s not sad, because he actually cares and respects her, and this is evident throughout the series. Overall, a great experience to watch. Next is where most of the romance tag is shown, Kazama and Sakurai, their development as a couple feels really natural and is given ample time to develop. Honestly, it\'s more fun to watch them as couple, than the main couple (let\'s be honest, the main ""couple"" doesn\'t feel like a couple). Their interactions are so wholesome and give life to the show. The there is the next main cast, Yuuto and Nastumi, they\'re brought together by mutual friends and their relationship is really fun and inspiring. The way they interact and the fact that they don\'t deviate from their personalities, since we are shown their personalities from flashbacks or individual moments, is a really nice touch. Last are all the side characters, Best girl, grandpa and the background boys, the fact that they just appear out of nowhere, is just hilarious. The way they indirectly make the 2 couples closer is done in a very natural way, that\'s good writing!However, this show does have it\'s fair share of flaws, like the imbalance in developments and not just in one hyper-focused episode. All I\'m saying is that there was SO much opportunities to develop the main couple throughout the show, whether it being slight changes in expression or just straight up deeper conversation. Some say that the second couple got all the attention, I agree and disagree. On one hand, yes they did, in their episodes, they could\'ve added a small skit of the main couple doing something. On the other hand, like I said, the second couple are where the romance tag really shines, and it\'s was a bad thing watching such a sweet and wholesome experience. So yeah, I would\'ve wanted the show to balance the emphasis on their development and colleges and as a couple in each episode.So basically, if you want good romance and comedy, look no further, we have it all here: good story, great characters and wholesome interactions. Great anime. Also Mona best girl, SIBERIA RULES to watch, especially when they are together. We have the main couple; Futaba and Takeda (by now their height difference doesn\'t even matter, I just got used to it, and you will to after watching this show), they have a senpai kouhai relationship and it\'s really wholesome to watch, since most of the things he does are similar to things you\'d to when you\'re a couple. The one sided love is pretty funny, it\'s not sad, because he actually cares and respects her, and this is evident throughout the series. Overall, a great experience to watch. Next is where most of the romance tag is shown, Kazama and Sakurai, their development as a couple feels really natural and is given ample time to develop. Honestly, it\'s more fun to watch them as couple, than the main couple (let\'s be honest, the main ""couple"" doesn\'t feel like a couple). Their interactions are so wholesome and give life to the show. The there is the next main cast, Yuuto and Nastumi, they\'re brought together by mutual friends and their relationship is really fun and inspiring. The way they interact and the fact that they don\'t deviate from their personalities, since we are shown their personalities from flashbacks or individual moments, is a really nice touch. Last are all the side characters, Best girl, grandpa and the background boys, the fact that they just appear out of nowhere, is just hilarious. The way they indirectly make the 2 couples closer is done in a very natural way, that\'s good writing!However, this show does have it\'s fair share of flaws, like the imbalance in developments and not just in one hyper-focused episode. All I\'m saying is that there was SO much opportunities to develop the main couple throughout the show, whether it being slight changes in expression or just straight up deeper conversation. Some say that the second couple got all the attention, I agree and disagree. On one hand, yes they did, in their episodes, they could\'ve added a small skit of the main couple doing something.

The part I just said is the comedy part of this anime. The romance part is in the prettiest woman in the office named Sakurai who fell in love with an ordinary man named Kazama. Their behavior is very romantic, so their story is part of the romance in this anime.

There is nothing particularly unique about this story; tsundere\'s are common, himbos are trendy, and even couples with distinct height differences are becoming more common. That being said, I still think this anime is ultimately enjoyable.The characters are charming and believable. In my opinion no one is too annoying or boring and I was consistently interested in following everyone\'s storyline--even the background coworkers who didn\'t have their own featured romances. The main character, Igarashi, could potentially be frustrating to some...as she does act rather childishly. I found this anime while looking for a romance with adult leads and if someone is doing the same, Igarashi may be off-putting. However, I do see her behaviors as part of her character and they feed into her insecurities so I was able to get past it.Ultimately I do wish there was a little more given to us with regards to the development of both relationships; neither is really established so you really just get to watch a bunch of people interact with their crushes and blush about it for 12 episodes. It\'s not necessarily a bad thing but I was hoping for at least one of the couples to smooch.The OP is very cute though, 10/10 for the OP animation. :)I would recommend this for people who don\'t mind tsunderes, enjoy slice-of-life, and want something simple and sweet. as she does act rather childishly.

But when we actually look more closely, its charecter development was not so good, if not poor, this anime or its manga is somewhat like series of short stories with same charecters rather than a complete whole story (you can easily notice this after 1 or 2 ep/chap of manga/anime because they are actually not much related to others). Why I still give it 9 out of 10 because each short stories was really good and they are all absolute...joy to watch.

The bulk of the interactions are mostly honest and clean jokes that are undercut by some romance here and there. Every character has a purpose, little or bigger, and everything just feels genuine in the context the series. None of the cast can be considered unneeded, overbearing...or unlikable. It definitely feels like the time allotted to each character has been thought about. There is a bit of everything for everyone.The romance on the other hand might be the most controversial part of My senpai is annoying. Honestly, it truly is a mix bag ranging from great moments to frustrating decisions. While most would argue the workplace setup could make for some interesting and more mature romance storytelling, this anime really delves into the tropes of romance anime that end up teasing you all the way to the end. Make no mistake, the two couples we follow have good relationships and dynamics. The problem really lies how childish it all feels when everyone just keeps flirting, being oblivious and ultimately no one takes the next step of a relationship (ie. start dating). Some of the frustration is appeased by the pairing of the pairing of Kazama/Sakurai that feels alot more genuine and has more flair and personality. However, the main couple of Igarashi/Takeda ends up being a confusing friendship/kouhai-senpai/romantic relationship that suffers from being taken as a joke from beginning to end. Ultimately, I must say that the romance of the series delivers some heartfelt moments, but could've gone the extra step and make more progress in the relationship.Still. the comedy and relaxing tone of My senpai is annoying keeps everything from crumbling because it takes precedence over the romance. Had it been a serious love story nothing would stick the landing. Thankfully, the friendship and interactions between the main and recurring characters are straightforward and simple in the best possible way. This anime has a way to make you feel good every episode and never tries to be overly complicated or cynical in its presentation. Which is why the comedy/slice of life portion of the series thrives where the romance barely keeps afloat. The situations and gags are nothing unique but My senpai is annoying adds its own personality to it and nothing is boring even in the most mundane situations.All in all, My senpai is annoying is definitely worth the watch and really goes by in a breeze.

This anime has a way to make you feel good every episode and never tries to be overly complicated or cynical in its presentation. Which is why the comedy/slice of life portion of the series thrives where the romance barely keeps afloat. The situations and gags are nothing unique but My senpai is annoying adds its own personality to it and nothing is boring even in the most mundane situations.All in all, My senpai is annoying is definitely worth the watch and really goes by in a breeze. Even though some feel it could've achieved greater heights (me included), this series manages to know what it wants to be and does it pretty well. It might not be an even ride all the way, but this anime delivers an solid watching experience for all."", 'So, I\'ve been growing up watching rom-com anime and I enjoyed most of them. As a teenager, school rom-com were my bread and butter and I felt like I could relate to them. All the insecurities, the pining, the overall sense of not fitting that supposedly falls apart when you meet the ""right person"". I was a late bloomer romantically speaking so fiction was my only way of experiencing romance for quite some time. For the longest time I felt quite satisfied with the anime offer in that department.Growing up though, I started feeling a little disconnected from the school anime scene. Makes sense, right?...I was growing out of the target age. And now I\'m an adult (well, I\'m trying my best to be one) and I\'m in a long term relationship.Watching teenagers making their first attempts at love might be cute to watch sometimes but I would like to have characters to relate to, to see them go trough the same struggles that I\'m going trough. So what do I do? I look for rom-coms with adult protagonists of course.This long prologue was to say that I started this series looking for funny, wholesome and relatable adult interactions and found very little of that. The overall tone of the series including humor, character interactions, relationship progression, feels very high-school like. The only ""grown up"" thing in the show is the setting, but that\'s pretty much it. I find quite ironic that one of the recurring jokes is that the protagonists keeps getting mistaken for a high schooler while the show behaves like a shonen.Overall, my biggest bones to pick are the lack of relatable interactions and the kids level humor (so many oppai jokes...). Also there are other scenarios other than ""the girl gets saved from random tugs"", I swear.Aside from that it wasn\'t all bad. Some jokes did land for me, the voice acting is great and the character design is cute (female characters are sexualized way too often but hey, I don\'t expect much from anime).An OK show, but in my opinion it does not fit its target audience.

The cast of characters is frankly so adorable I'd love to dive into the story and squeeze the cheeks of each one, and the art doesn't help. Unfortunately, when compared to the likes of Wotakoi, I think the character writing just wasn't compelling enough to draw me in for the whole run. And ultimately, character writing is the lifeblood of slice of life shows like this.While on paper, the dynamics of both leading couples appears to be promising, when you watch it actually play out in...the show, the characters are rather bland. Perhaps they're /too/ happy, is the problem? There were no character conflicts that felt high-stakes enough to warrant any proper development, and all issues felt practically solved from the get-go because both Igarashi and Takeda clearly respect and love each other on a deep level from the very beginning. In Wotakoi, both leading characters had some Adult Anxieties that were interesting to really dig into, but because Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi stays fluffy and light throughout its entire runtime, nothing ended up grabbing me.This show has the office dynamics without any of the adult nihilism that comes hand in hand with office romance shows, and the high school romance without any of the fun teenage hijinks.Perhaps I will revisit this in a later time when I desperately need some surface-level fluff to keep me sane, but as of right now, I think a romance SoL with more depth appeals to me more, like Horimiya or Wotakoi. the show, the characters are rather bland.

But quite a fun one at that.""My rating of ""6"" is just base on technicalities. But this is actually an easy-to-watch, wholesome-fun, non-priority Anime... if you\'re not bothered by loads of cheesy lovey-dovey moments that is (there\'s a lot, trust me).But that\'s what this Rom-Com was intended to do in the first place so, can\'t dislike it for what it is specially when it\'s been quite a fun watch.STORY: (5/10)Not much story went on. Initially, it\'s about  a grade-school looking office-worker, Futaba, who just wants to be a proper adult. But don\'t mind that, as it won\'t really matter that much...as it\'s filled with your usual rom-com shenanigan classics such as: Christmas episode, New-year episode, Beach episode, Blush-desu, Oppai-desu, ""Nandemonai""-desu, and many, many more.You know something\'s up when the focus shifts to the side-characters love story instead of the MCs. But that\'s not to say they failed to build-up the main love-story as they still delivered that pretty well by the end.CHARATERS: (5/10)If you\'ve seen the poster, you\'ve seen them all (not counting the 5 extra-chracters). They\'re all pretty straight-forward cliché characters; Tsundere loli MC, Big caring daddy figure MC, Perfect big oppai office-lady, Emotionless man-of-culture average guy, Perfect athletic big oppai woman, Loli-looking lil bro, and under-utilized weird/eccentric side-character.The last one was a personal opinion. I just felt like they could\'ve used the character to set-up most cliché awkward situations instead of the loveteams playing themselves into it. But she barely had screen-time until the last few episodes where she did some comical bits.ART: (6/10)Pretty plain but, credits for atleast having a consitently drawn characters (quite rare even on big-budget Anime nowadays).SOUND: (7/10)OP and ED both fits well with the rom-com theme. VA has been good as well.I think they delivered what they wanted to present to us, which is a basic Rom-Com Anime. I personally had fun with it, but it\'s has undeniably been mostly directionless, and quite redundant. But if you\'re into Rom-Coms, I suggest giving this one a shot. as it\'s filled with your usual rom-com shenanigan classics such as: Christmas episode, New-year episode, Beach episode, Blush-desu, Oppai-desu, ""Nandemonai""-desu, and many, many more.You know something\'s up when the focus shifts to the side-characters love story instead of the MCs.

Futaba Igarashi is an adorable, hard working tsudere who has a very obvious complex about her height and outwardly childish appearance compared to the women around her in the office and especially next her loud, tall, buff, happy-go-lucky senpai Harumi Takeda of whom she...has a crush on. The only problem is that he tends to treat her like a child by tussling her hair and obliviously, but loudly saying things that could be taken out of context if heard by others which annoys Futaba… a lot… hence the anime title.There’s a B plot between two other employees Touko Sakurai a busty, cheerful lady who gets hit on a lot in the office by obnoxious, male colleagues and Souta Kazama, a quiet, man of culture who is basically what Kazama from Konosuba would’ve turned out to be if hadn't died from a heart attack and he grew up to be a mature, normal person of society (sort of).That’s pretty much all there is too My Senpai is Annoying, but it does those things really well. The animation is lively and expressive, the stories are low steaks, but interesting, the side characters are delightful aaaaaaaand… yeah… Look, I know this is a short review, but it’s a really fun office rom-com and if you’re into these sort of shows you’re highly likely to enjoy it. The biggest question the show will ask (whether intended or not) is how would sex between Futaba and Harumi work if they did get together?8/10 Great has a crush on.

Feel free to skip the first part.You know when you find a series that just hits at the right time for you? That every episode makes you smile, lifts you up from a pretty bad situation even if it has nothing to do with it and motivates you to keep going? And that it has wholesomeness in just the perfect level to not feel saturated and annoying nor lacking and bland?That is what this show was for my experience and I can't discredit the impact...it had on me since I can relate to some of the topics it handles. Inferiority complex, self value, reliability, loneliness, among other matters I can mention go way back in my personal life and some do come into surface from time to time. In this sense even though they weren’t the focus of the show at all, the way each of them was tackled and reflected upon on each episode was something noteworthy. I have to say that I didn't really expect to be this touched by the end of it nor while writing this but here we are.Now, for a more non-personal take which others may find more useful, for many this is not the best show of the season, maybe not even very good overall. It does have some problems like the main couple not being as engaging as the secondary one mainly due to neither coming as forward. The latter did have a fair share of lovely moments as well which served as the highest points it had. Also, some members of the cast were kinda there from time to time, but didn’t really serve that much of a purpose in the grand scheme of things, which may lead to them feeling more forgettable. Nonetheless, the main ones did have their proper moments and personalities displayed, some of which you may recognise from different clips going around the net.Animation-wise it was very consistent in its delivery. The gags came off as very cute and hilarious when they needed to be, mainly whenever Igarashi or Sakurai were on frame, and the scenery itself didn’t look half bad. Furthermore, have you watched the opening sequence? It matches up really well with its corresponding song and serves as a way to glance over the cast whose interactions can be quite the selling point. Regarding the ending sequence and the rest of the soundtrack, not much to say about them other than none of them were particularly below average.To sum it up I can safely recommend this as a well produced romcom in an office setting for those into the genre and maybe even to those who are feeling down and looking for something wholesome to pass up the time. Hopefully we'll see more of it in the future. it had on me since I can relate to some of the topics it handles.

But a show like this walks a fine line, and this show very much seems to purposely step over that line.When you have a show where a male character depicted with the body type of adult ends up in a romantic relationship with a character that has the body type of a child, you need to need to need to make sure you do not have any pedophilic elements to your story.  A great example of this is Ore Monogatari, where there's no ero fanservice, no inappropriate relationships, and it's generally...sugary from the top to the bottom.  And this series sets itself up in the same light...at first.  Then like an arrow to the heart they had this ending illustration depicting the young boy character clearly naked and in a very sexualized pose.  Later that young boy character would go on to be pursued by an adult woman in the friend group, to the cheers of everyone around.  They took that clear line they were not supposed to cross in order to make sure this stayed something free from pedophilic overtones, and they stepped right over it, knowing it was there.There are other problems.  While they seldom do direct fanservice of Igarashi, every woman is depicted in constant fanservice lights, with shots always focusing on butts and tits.  The guy characters are all either entirely consumed by their quest for those tits, are the Senpai, or are the little boy who's there to fulfill the sexually inexperienced shota role.  The one character that might have something other to offer is constantly entranced by any tits he sees.  Then there's the Russian woman, who's just....there?  She's not particularly funny and she just sort of exists and shows up at various times, and I have no idea what she's supposed to be adding if anything.Don't get me wrong, it was funny.  The humor was quite good and there were some really cute parts.  This was a tough anime to rate because there were aspects that were very positive but also a lot of negatives balancing them out.  For instance I didn't mind Sakurai's character, but the constant fixation on her tits was ridiculous.  And I was laughing the whole way throughout, and really identifying with Igarashi.  But by the end I felt like I was kinda creeped out by it.Also what the heck was up with those ending illustrations?  Some of them look like they were done by legit hentai artists.  That's not the kind of thing you want on the end of your cutesie series, Doga Kobo.

That's not the kind of thing you want on the end of your cutesie series, Doga Kobo.

Her relationship with her sempai was more like an on and off thing where a one point she hates him for his constant teasing to which she gets treated like a little girl. Now Takeda on the other hand , was just creepy giving that he has lolicon tendency.....Now on to the next romantic couple,  Kazama, Souta X Sakurai, Touko, if you'll look at it they're pretty much an extension of Wotaku, to which there is that passive guy to outgoing girl kind of relationship....Of course how can I forget Kurobe, Natsumi whom has that soutacon thing for Sakurai, Yuuto, well it was good but kinda creepy cu'z it can only mean that Kurobe was a Lolicon.Enjoyment-Decent 4: One part of me likes this , but there was that part of me , to which I hate this thing.Overall-Decent 4: This was just something that you would either like it or hate it, either way watch it a decide for yourself.....Season 2......?
