Wan Jie Fa Shen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/45196/Wan_Jie_Fa_Shen,"[""Wan Jie Fa Shen ReviewGod of Ten thousand realms is a reincarnated-cultivation donghua about a prestigious Wizard/God who succumbs to the fate of an asteroid in his previous life, where being a mage is rare due to cultivation resource exhaustion. He is reincarnated 3000 years into the past to Ye Xuan, a trash magician character of Sith Magic academy. As all reincarnation-cultivation manhua/donghua, his fate is to regain power at a fast rate and prevent tragedies that follow in the future. Along the road of his cultivation, Ye Xuan meets several characters in which he assists in cultivation and enlightenment thus gathering his allies.This...donghua would have been more interesting if this first season didn't focus on small-fry characters like the Lin family and their grudge. Ye Xuan, who is more than capable of anything despite being realms lower than all his peers could have wiped the Lin Family from the map but it's decided that he lays low and endures the grudge which ends up being the main narrative of his first season. The arcs are expected of Chinese cultivation but it would have been more entertaining watching MC fight than watching side characters fight and fail, the story also has a lot of running scenes which uses a lot of the screen time ( can be skipped easily for entertainment )The main character design is bad. His clothes are typical of eastern style MMORPG adventurer clothing. For a cultivation series, it would have been better to dress MC in a more fluent design which could have contributed to his character development arcs in the Magic guild's training room or when he went to refine his physical strength upon first visiting the Magic Academy's potion refinement facilities. The story lacks development which is why the characters feel empty and distant in terms of personality.The art/animation quality is substandard which suggests this is production is of lower value than most donghua. Every few episodes it feels like I'm watching a Mafia City advert with how the characters walk and talk. Even more so, when they turn around and walk away (such as the case when Ye Xuan first meets with the Manager and President of the Magic Guild) it feels like I'm watching a 2005 Barbie film with low poly models and bad character rigging.The Audio is another problem, for some reason the sound designers believe it's okay to use a stock sad music from Audio Library and play it every time the mood gets serious. It was very disturbing listening to the audio, even the door sounds are unnatural.In terms of enjoyment and overall opinion, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. However, the story is at least tolerable for me to complete it and rate it 6/10 overall. I look forward to a season 2 with hopes this series improves. donghua would have been more interesting if this first season didn't focus on small-fry characters like the Lin family and their grudge.

A fireball from heaven made him awaken in the era of the prosperous magic, 3000 years ago. He became a student at the Magic Academy and he is famed for being the weakest.So the story will go on to show how he starts to strengthen himself slowly by cultivation and constant training, make potions, go to the training area, go to the beast forest to fight beasts to get resources to train. Along the way he will help his classmates, teachers and other people.The ladies in this anime are not annoying, unlike many other similar cultivation chinese anime. There is the the teacher that act 任性 (capricious) but I think it\'s adorable, the class monitor that tries to woo the main lead but is annoyed at his denseness and can be jealous when other girls show their fondness for him, and the noble city mayor\'s daughter that knows how to 撒娇 and is quite lively.Main lead can be arrogant but he knows he can handle things. He is quite a cultivation training manic and is quite focus about it, not wanting the female attention.He is quite rude and arrogant to many old and powerful men like the head of the potion association and the school headmaster as he thinks they are quite dumb to not know the basics and have so many easy questions that they do not know the answers to. He do spend time to enlighten them and the old men are quite eager and humble to accept his vast knowledge.Is a 爽 anime with no bad scenerio.A relaxing and cool anime to pass the time. Worth a watch. the town. A fireball from heaven made him awaken in the era of the prosperous magic, 3000 years ago.

Xin Shen Bang: Nezha Chongsheng,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44061/Xin_Shen_Bang__Nezha_Chongsheng,"[""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSBefore you start, know that English is not my original language, so the text may have some typos or things like that.Well, to begin this analysis, I would like to make it clear that much of the film's fantasy is based on Taoism, a philosophical and religious translation from Chinese Buddhist mythology, so it may happen that during the film some pretexts and quotes get a little bit bad explained, with this in mind I recommend that you try to know the basics about to better absorb the experience.We have as protagonist Li Jinxuang, a young man who works in a smuggling...service in a city dominated by a wealthy group that deprives the city of water to control and scold the population. Right away we have a very convincing proposal, it looks more like a generic dystopia show that we find everywhere, but in this case we focus on the protagonist and his journey as a kind of receptacle for Nezha, a protective god of the religion I mentioned previously, but in any case it brings a little repetitive messages in the industry like the way in which greed and hatred are wrong and only attract bad things and that kind of thing, but the real ambition of the film is to be an exhibition of scenes from VERY well produced and directed action, which makes it a lot of fun, but that's it.The film is full of problems in the narrative, random climaxes are inserted in any scenes just to catch the viewer's attention since the characters and the plot lack dramatic load and textual value. Their interactions sound more like stupid pretexts to bring action scenes than relationships themselves, and an example of this is the encounter that triggered everything that happened during history, which was basically the tantrum of a rich man (son of the main antagonist) who wanted to soooo much the protagonist's bike, and that instead of just accepting the denial of selling the bike, he preferred to take it by force because no one should deny anything to a super bad and superior guy like him. The cast of the film is an emotional plot device drawer that works like a color pencil box, whenever we need an emotional catharsis from the protagonist we take a random character that he likes and barely treat him, that way, he gets furious and he can take out all his rage on his enemies as powerful as he (but not as angry) and so we have a Deus ex machina factory and a dramatic appeal sequence that just doesn't work due to the lack of depth of the colored pencils.When I say that the film gives up everything to show its beautiful action to the viewer (let's be honest, that's all he has), I'm not exaggerating, all pacing is very unstable during the film, some scenes are too fast and some transitions are just skip between events that end up without the natural conclusion that each one should. You can see this in a large part of the film, which consists of training our protagonist, who should be a kind of maturity to control Nezha in the best way, when in reality, they are just quick scenes of him learning to fight and building armor, that we barely know how it works.If someone is glad with beautiful action scenes, this film is highly recommended for that person, in my case, I felt seeing a random AMV but with a lot of desire to go beyond that, for this reason I do not recommend the film to anyone who cares about a well-structured, self-respecting story. service in a city dominated by a wealthy group that deprives the city of water to control and scold the population.

The CGI animation was done very well and the action was exciting. The story and characters were alright, but I wouldn't say they were anything too special either. They were serviceable enough to form a cohesive and somewhat interesting plot, but the story definitely took a backseat to the action and the visuals. This is not the type of movie you should watch if you are looking for a riveting plot with deep characters and themes, but even without these it is enjoyable enough. I did appreciate the mythological inspirations included in the movie, these elements were fairly interesting. "", 'Reasons to watch this movie- Cool art- Nicely directed action scenes- cool conceptReasons you can skip this movie- The plot is lacking and badly explained concepts- The conflict is meh and generic with nothing new, and kind of badly executed while it could have been done in a very better way.- Lack of character development (MC hardly changes in his ways till the end)- Forced unneeded climaxes...Now if you are not aware of Nezha and its lore and everything, the plot of the movie will be hard for you to understand as it is very poorly explained in the movie. This one is a one time watch or a skip.

Trinity Seven: Nanatsu no Taizai to Nana Madoushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28285/Trinity_Seven__Nanatsu_no_Taizai_to_Nana_Madoushi,"[""The purpose of this OVA is to give a some brief information about the characters archives and thema along with some eye candy and Arata's perverted acts.Arata needs to write a report on all the Trinity Seven in order to not get expelled from the school. The report aside, the OVA shows Arata at his perverted peak with all the Trinity Seven.And a little romance at the end as well as a hint of a progressing story completes this OVA.I wonder if it will get a sequel, since some new characters are shown in the ending scenes of the OVA. "", 'For an anime that labels itself as ""Trinity Seven"", I never actually believed the substance or quality of the anime itself was ever that of a seven or higher and saw it as a fine anime with cute girls though lacked something very important to be considered a good show. I decided to approach this OVA with mixed opinions and then put the thought ""will this anime impress me""? Well, I can admit at this moment that I strongly believe that this OVA alone surpassed the anime itself in every aspect except the story since this episode was just a way to show off the...bodies of the Trinity Seven women with a small continuation of the current story right at the end which makes me believe a second season is at least in the consideration process so fans at least can be delighted to know a chance of a new season does exist.The sole reason I enjoyed this OVA heaps more than the actual show is because it just felt ""right"". As odd as that may sound, please hear me out~! The show was fine and not anything bad and is better than various other harems, but it felt lackluster in both comedy and this was a case I wanted less story and more ecchi and comedy routines, just as this OVA did really well. The comedy hit home and the characters interested me more for that very reasons. Though, if you aren\'t a fan of ecchi/harems and feel anime boobies ruin anime then skip the series and this. We all have our opinions and you deserve yours!If you\'re a Trinity Seven fan: Watch this.If you\'re an ecchi fan: Watch 1st season and then this.If you hate harems: Skip Trinity Seven bodies of the Trinity Seven women with a small continuation of the current story right at the end which makes me believe a second season is at least in the consideration process so fans at least can be delighted to know a chance of a new season does exist.The sole reason I enjoyed this OVA heaps more than the actual show is because it just felt ""right"".

Executing my Thema: Circumspicio!Trinity Seven was a series that brought something new to the table in the genre of harem.  While sticking with the theme of fantasy with the classic Harem/ecchi combo, it also managed to give off an air of comedy and plot that worked very well due to the characters that this show presented.  So.  What surprises will the OVA give us?Story (7.49/10): In terms of story, the Trinity Seven OVA doesn\'t really have much to offer in terms of actual plot.  Our harem king/lucky pervert/main protagonist, Arata, is essentially told by the administration...at the school that he is failing his classes.  In order to prevent his expulsion, he must learn in-depth the seven archives of magic through help from the Trinity Seven.  And if you\'ve seen this series before, you can probably guess what will happen.In terms of story, this OVA doesn\'t really offer much beyond the synopsis above.  But of course, since this is Trinity Seven, that\'s not really what we\'re looking forward to here.  To make up for its lack of story, this OVA pulls out what Trinity Seven is known for, its own brand of comedy known as Ecchi comedy.  You know those generic ecchi scenes you see in generic harem shows?  Well, take those moments, but add a main protagonist who doesn\'t shy away from the feminine body, rather, acting like any normal guy would with a couple funny lines amplifying his pervertedness.  This is pretty much the entire runtime of this OVA.  Since this is an OVA, story really doesn\'t take a big foothold on the runtime, so Arata being...well, Arata is pretty much all you\'re going to get.  Trust me, it may not seem like much, but it\'s ALL you need for this.Overview:+/-  Rather simplistic story  (This doesn\'t impact much cause OVA\'s only have a 30 min. runtime.)+     Comedic/Perverted antics throughoutCharacter (8.88/10): Cast-wise, the OVA doesn\'t change much.  We still have our harem king, Arata who spends time with the 7-8 girls he\'s associated with, we still have the buzzkill Lilith, Yui, my personal favorite who becomes a lot more thirsty than I thought she would be, and the rest of the Trinity Seven.Likewise to the original series and the manga source material, the characters retain their characteristics and don\'t differ very much.  (Except maybe Yui, cause I don\'t remember her being that thirsty...)  As such, any girl that you may or may not have called as your ""best girl"" or ""waifu"" has retained their likable traits.Overview:+  Great cast still has their original and enjoyable character traits.+  Arata  (honestly, this guy is great.  His existence is a positive to this series.)Art and Sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10): Art for Trinity Seven has always been very consistent with its darker color scheme and ominous feel.  As such, the OVA reflects this and nothing really differs apart from that.  However, there are moments within this OVA that do come off as...odd.For one thing, the art quality did waver in a select few scenes.  The standard animation for some of the characters seemed to dip in quality slightly.  Not a huge difference, but still somewhat prominent.  In addition, the OVA uses some odd artstyles, having a really weird chibi scene that while funny, really didn\'t make sense cause it did clash quite harshly.And since this is an ecchi show, here\'s the obligatory ecchi warning paragraph.  (Yay for continuity...)  Ecchi has been a staple for Trinity Seven since basically minute one where Arata grabs a girl\'s breast upon waking up.  (Just a normal day for the harem king, mind you.)  As such, this OVA follows suit in its first season predecessor by making similar scenes.  However, unlike its original runtime, this OVA feels a bit...racy, at points.  Essentially, this OVA makes an attempt at being somewhat more ecchi than what we were shown in the original 12 episodes.  Since Arata is associating with all seven members of the Trinity seven this time, well, you can probably guess if you\'ve seen this show before.  While not spoiling what actually happens, I can at the very least tell you that the frequency and possibly intensity of the scenes you witness, will be more so than the first season of this show.Soundtrack is still the same, using the ""Seven doors"" opening and the first ending of the series as its choice tracks for this OVA.Overview:+  Decently consistent artwork+  Good soundtrack+/-  Art quality has differed through its runtime+/-  Ecchi.  (This is really a positive or negative depending on your view of ecchi, cause this show while uses a lot of it, uses it in a more comedic sense alongside the standard perverted sense.)Personal Enjoyment (9.00/10): As a curator of the harem genre, I have searched far and wide for a show or manga that would be able to give me what I search for, something new and exciting that would break the reins that the harem genre has been tied down to.  And with Trinity Seven, I believe I have found it.Did I like this OVA?Yes.  Watching it was a bucketload of fun.  This OVA really made use of what Trinity Seven is known for, making into the focal point of the special, which in turn, made this a very enjoyable viewing experience.  Because I\'m some fond of this series, it\'s really hard for me to not like what it\'s trying to do because the comedy works just so well.  It\'s the kind of ecchi that kind of don\'t want to turn away from because it for some reason just feels very natural when you watch it.  It\'s weird.What didn\'t I like about the OVA?Really, the only complaint I have is the art.  Only select scenes really bothered me, so apart from that, there\'s nothing I really didn\'t like.Would I recommend this OVA?If you liked Trinity Seven, and/or fine with ecchi, cause it will show that to you, then I would recommend watching this OVA.  Be warned though, you might want to watch this alone or with a friend who\'s a fan of this series.  Cause even though the ecchi is used for quite well written comedic reasons, it\'s still decently hardcore ecchi nonetheless.

Until then, Magic King candidate Xadon, out!', 'I get baited when i decided to take a peek from this OVA. Actually, what am i thinking? This is Trinity Seven Harem Ecchi Show. What else you can get rather than more perverted scene reveal? All you can eat \'half nude\' art, all girls become your appetizer suit well. And the good thing? Lilith here become so igneous, full of lust, and more wild than the series ever perform! After that, I just can\'t stop giggling myself at last scene. When suddenly Levi, with her ninja ability, appear to \'teach\' some more lesson to those lucky man! What is this all of sudden? The...scene come out of nowhere. Lol.What else you got? Sound like a teaser for me, when suddenly the show summon more strange character. With this point, i just cursed myself: ""Hell no! It can\'t be!"" Then you just know yourself it just a teasing way to lure into skeptism. Read manga for more candy-girl. You should enjoy and keep your body fresh with that continuations. But, is there really continue there? I dont wanna know. Cause it really iritate me and make mind really flustered.Okay, back to the show. Basically, i can\'t hold myself to mix my feeling over my writing style. So here we found this random verses. Do not worry, you can easily understand what i mean. There is no detail since this OVA was too short to make such a full review. So i just wanna express my feeling over those video with more than 3 next paragraph.First, story and character, not to be better than previous batch of episode. Still the same girl, personalisation, feeling, and erotic way to greet the audience needed. What else do you expect from the story progress? Nothing. Story development seems so dull and become too dessert. No details available over such a unique thingy. Like the manuscripts, The magic king itself, the purpose of the mage world and the impact of the myth-magic-over-legend-theory. We just got an archive explanations, where i find it become so boring in my mind. I dont really care much when the seven girls explain it. And what is the strength of this episode over the story and character? Nothing. I just gonna put this to 5 for it. So amusing. I am so desperate.What else? Art and music? All of them still same from the origin season series. So i keep it simple to give score same as the origin. But, with lack of the creativity the studio had. I wanna put minus score at the music this rate. While the art keep it to 8 minimal pointLastly, the enjoyment. Well, you got me at this section. I enjoy this video. Not with the terms of the good story. The ecchi and perverted way, really save this OVA for being trashy anime. Lol. Harem and Ecchi genres really enjoy my mind when you got so stressed. So i just wanna chill out for a momment, leave me enjoy all of those wild scene with your favourite girl, and take my 8 score over this section.At overall, i can\'t help myself, by scoring these show a slightly 7 point at the edge. Not because i rush thing with too stupid way. Hell no. But this is for my highly expectations in the future. I just had a wish to have a continuations over this average anime. And maybe i can enjoy any hot scene later from the future. I really eager with that kind of situations. Then, with one more question, can i? scene come out of nowhere. Lol.What else you got? Sound like a teaser for me, when suddenly the show summon more strange character. With this point, i just cursed myself: ""Hell no! It can\'t be!"" Then you just know yourself it just a teasing way to lure into skeptism. Read manga for more candy-girl. You should enjoy and keep your body fresh with that continuations.

Story development seems so dull and become too dessert. No details available over such a unique thingy. Like the manuscripts, The magic king itself, the purpose of the mage world and the impact of the myth-magic-over-legend-theory. We just got an archive explanations, where i find it become so boring in my mind. I dont really care much when the seven girls explain it. And what is the strength of this episode over the story and character? Nothing. I just gonna put this to 5 for it. So amusing. I am so desperate.What else? Art and music? All of them still same from the origin season series. So i keep it simple to give score same as the origin. But, with lack of the creativity the studio had. I wanna put minus score at the music this rate. While the art keep it to 8 minimal pointLastly, the enjoyment. Well, you got me at this section. I enjoy this video. Not with the terms of the good story. The ecchi and perverted way, really save this OVA for being trashy anime. Lol. Harem and Ecchi genres really enjoy my mind when you got so stressed. So i just wanna chill out for a momment, leave me enjoy all of those wild scene with your favourite girl, and take my 8 score over this section.At overall, i can\'t help myself, by scoring these show a slightly 7 point at the edge. Not because i rush thing with too stupid way. Hell no. But this is for my highly expectations in the future. I just had a wish to have a continuations over this average anime. And maybe i can enjoy any hot scene later from the future. I really eager with that kind of situations. Then, with one more question, can i?']"

Complete and utter garbage, amazed how this even got such a high overall rating.This is no “cultivation” anime, any review that says so is talking nonsense.

The reason why my review is low is exactly because of this, there is a lot of unnecessary character establishment in the beginning that drags into the core of this first season. This might be taboo since I haven't read the source material and it might be canon but it doesn't seem necessary because there isn't much emotional attachment to any of the characters. Eventually, the daughter of that greedy uncle leaves and is discarded from the...character palette in the future but I understand that this is a great opportunity for love conflict to brew especially with the introduction of Yu Jing Qiu. Essentially, without spoiling the plot this narrative and character establishment in the beginning will be the hardest 2 hours watching anything - watching paint dry is more bearable than this ngl.Snow Eagle Lord is an overpowered main character donghua where MC inherits special powers and techniques to complement his beloved spear. Which was influenced by his father before he was abducted in a power struggle between political family relations involving his mother. Later in the season we get to see the devil god's presence at work on our little brother Qin Shi while he is cultivating and our MC is out completing missions.Story : 6/10Character : 6/10The way MC grows is by fighting strong opponents, essentially stimulating his hidden powers to the point where he becomes a big target from everyone and in the final episodes fights the #1 ranker warrior on the human leaderboards. The brutal fight is the climax of this season as it shows Qin Shi's growth to trust in his brother again and stimulate positive relationships with the Longshan Building, informant Si An's information bureau. Xue Ying's relationship with Yu Jing Qiu also strengthens toward the end but it does put a lot of the first few episodes in the bin in terms of content. The next 4 episodes after episode 26 have much more plot and character development than this season because Xue Ying learns and grows from stronger opponents.Art & Sound : 6/10Nothing in particular that piqued my interests or stood out in terms of visual quality or sound effect quality. Xue Ying Ling Zhu appears to be a typical normal budget Donghua project so it doesn't really compete in this aspect with other Donghua like Swallowed Star or Douluo Dalu S9.Enjoyment : 6/10I enjoyed the OPMC battled at the end, and seeing Xue Ying awaken his powers but it was really short lived in season 1. It definitely missed out more fights with the spear wielding martial god Xue Ying. If you enjoy watching OPMC no matter what the visual or audio is like, this is for you. I enjoyed this because it was long and I could sustain the boring parts to an extent but when there are important events (including the future seasons) it is very satisfying. character palette in the future but I understand that this is a great opportunity for love conflict to brew especially with the introduction of Yu Jing Qiu.

The story itself is pretty long, which explains why this 1st season is relatively slow-paced.The story follows Xue Ying, the young lord of a territory after his mother and father has been kidnapped, as well as his attempt to deliver them.Overall I would say the anime is pretty good. The art is not the best I have seen in donghua by any means, but it's still solid.The sound itself isn't amazing either, although I really enjoyed the OP.The fighting is pretty nice to watch,...and the story is enjoyable.There are a few problems however. First, the anime skips a lot of background information and explanations which makes the first few episodes really hard to understand. For anyone interested in the novel, the MC actually doesn't unlock his Qi until he is 14-15 years old while his body is abnormaly strong. He later unlocks his Bloodline which is when he starts developping Qi. And since his body is already so strong, he progresses really rapidly.The second thing, is that Producers really enjoy changing story elements to make them doesn't make sense. It wasn't as bad as in Swallowed star, but I'm afraid of what will happen later. The final enemy at the end is not a demon, but a magical beast which is an important distinction to make because he doesn't come from the abyss. He also wasn't changed by the Sorcerer god blood, but by someone from the Sorcerer Palace. Anyway those are relatively minor, but I'm afraid it's the start of things that absolutely won't make sense as we go into the story. and the story is enjoyable.There are a few problems however.

It takes a lot of patience to get through the earlier episodes because the early episodes is more like slice of life than the combat show you are expecting.Even then the earlier episodes are very confusing since you have no idea why they are fighting other than knowing the parents of the protagonists are held hostage for some unknown reason.If you are able to get past the boring episodes, the rest of the show is actually alright. To summarize it, it would be like an adventure party anime. Some of the lore in the show confuses me and...the ranking system is also not clearly structured to me and I don't think they ever clarified it.Music was non-existent and the animation was inconsistent a few times (like background characters disappearing in different scenes). Main character(s) were not unlikeable, so there's that.Season one ends with a huge cliffhanger and you pretty much have to watch the subsequent OVA to understand the conclusion being moving onto season two. the ranking system is also not clearly structured to me and I don't think they ever clarified it.Music was non-existent and the animation was inconsistent a few times (like background characters disappearing in different scenes).

Uchuu no Stellvia,https://myanimelist.net/anime/113/Uchuu_no_Stellvia,"[""After reading the synopsis for Stellvia of the Universe (Uchuu no Stellvia in Japanese) I immediately had to find and watch it. I love storylines about mankind being brought to near extinction by something that could realistically happen, which in the case of Stellvia is a gamma ray burst from a nearby star going supernova. Surprisingly however, the plot premise was the last thing that drew me into Stellvia while I watched it. At first glance Stellvia doesn't look anything like the post apocalyptic anime it advertises itself as, in fact the Earth and the people on it all look pretty damn good considering 99%...of the population was wiped out less than two hundred years ago. So, I instinctively thought that I became a victim of false advertisement once again--or rather a victim of my own assumptions--but as Stellvia progressed and characters became more developed I realized that there was a lot more to enjoy about this anime than its primary story arc.Stellvia of the Universe reminds me of several different animes. The school life portion of the series gave me some serious Azumanga Daioh vibes. There is actually a lot of charm and humor that comes with watching Shima Katase and Arisa Glennorth bounce comments back and forth, and when you throw in a bunch of other interesting students and instructors it only adds to the fun. The serious portion of the series, which involves space training and combat, reminds me quite a lot of series' like Vandread. While the outer space scenes don't pack nearly as much action as fans of the genre would expect, they aren't boring to watch either. Stellvia is more of a psychological anime than it is an all-out sci-fi action one. Even though there are a few tense and exciting moments of high speed space action, the majority of the series takes place inside of the cockpit where we get to see the emotions of the individual pilots. This was an interesting route to take, and it works greatly to Stellvia's advantage. As the series goes on emotions begin to flare, so unlike Azumanga Daioh, Stellvia of the Universe does get serious, and tears are shed on more than one occasion.Speaking of tears, Shima Katase wins my vote for 'Biggest Drama Queen in the History of Anime.' Shipon (the nickname Shima respectively earns early on in the series) manages to cry more times in the course of Stellvia than I care to count. To be completely honest, I can't remember a single episode where she didn't have tears running down her face at least once, including the very first episode. At first I was able to sympathize with her, but after seeing her pouty face a dozen or more times I felt the urge to leap into my television and repeatedly punch her in the face. While the entire human race is facing the biggest threat they've ever encountered this girl bitches and moans over the littlest of things, which includes not being as good of a pilot as her boyfriend (boo-friggin-hoo). While this sort of angst-ridden lead character is what helped ruin Neon Genesis Evangelion for me, Stellvia of the Universe provides the audience with plenty of characters to fall in love with and enough plot developments to keep the focus off the annoying drama queen. Although it is worth mentioning that the Shipon character does redeem herself towards the very end of the series, thankfully.Stellvia of the Universe is a very character driven series, with well over a dozen different characters all with distinct personalities and agendas. If you don't like one character, there is a good chance you'll like somebody else. This is what made Stellvia so enjoyable to me, that I was able to attach myself onto several different characters in very different ways. Stellvia also doesn't have any true villains, a void that is filled mostly by fierce rivalries between some of the students. I guess it can be said that the real villain of the story is the cosmic disaster mankind is pitted up against; a faceless, mindless, merciless monster that will eradicate the entire solar system without a second's thought unless the genius preparatory students (Shima Katase and her boyfriend Kouta Otoyama) do something about it.Stellvia of the Universe does get a little carried away later on in the series, and goes in a direction I least expected--aliens. Yes, during the latter half of the series aliens are introduced into the storyline. Luckily (or unluckily, depending on your outlook) these aliens remain mostly hidden in the background of things, although there is one major character revealed to have connections with the aliens later on. As some of you may know, I'm a big fan of aliens and alien/human conflict, but the introduction of aliens in the story of Stellvia felt rather unnecessary to me. I guess if we're ever going to see aliens in real life it would be during a time of galactic crisis like the one presented in Stellvia, but going so far as having an alien masquerade as a high ranking human official is stretching things a bit too much for my comfort. In an anime that is otherwise pretty grounded, the aliens of Stellvia might manage to make a few eyes roll.If you're a real die hard science geek you may also find it hard to swallow the plot that Stellvia of the Universe revolves around. The idea that mankind can survive a gamma ray burst from a nearby star is certainly a romantic one, but not very likely. With the ozone layer destroyed it would take many years before people could just walk around the planet as if it were a normal day, and the radiation levels would be so high that even people hiding in shelters would be swiftly killed. Also, a gamma ray isn't going to act like a nuclear bomb and blow buildings down as if they were made of straw. And don't even get me started on the 'cosmic fracture' introduced later in the series. But, they don't call it science FICTION for nothing.I simply loved the audio in Stellvia of the Universe. The OP song, Asu e no Brilliant Road (Brilliant Road to Tomorrow), is one of the best OP songs I've heard in quite some time, and I had trouble bringing myself to skip the opening scene during the start of each episode because of it. The various ED songs, Kirei na Yozora (Beautiful Night Sky), The End of the World, and Dear my best friend are all pretty good as well, with my favorite being Kirei na Yozora; it has that really catchy J-Pop factor, which resulted in me struggling to stop myself from humming it while in the shower. All of the theme music is done by Angela, so I'll be sure to check out her work from now on. The voiceovers in Stellvia are quite good as well, but I can't comment too much on the Japanese audio since I didn't listen to much of it. The English audio is nice though, with all of the voice actors playing their roles respectively. If I decide to ever watch this series again I'll consider watching it in the Japanese audio, since I hear the Japanese voice actors did a truly superb job.The animation in Stellvia is a nice blend of traditional drawings and computer graphics, and it's pleasant to see that an anime like Stellvia can pull off CG without looking too dated or generally awkward. Character and scenery designs are all great, with each character animated to perfection with their corresponding personality traits, and with each location looking distinct from each other. I actually felt like I was aboard the Stellvia myself while watching, as the anime takes you everywhere from the dorms to the air ducts. The only way to see more of the fantasy space station would be to obtain the blueprints. There is a few recycled sequences here and there, but not really enough to take your attention away from the good stuff.Stellvia of the Universe is what I would consider a hidden gem. It's not the kind of anime I would expect my friends to bring up during a conversation, and when asking people online for their opinions on it I constantly got the same reply: 'I've never heard of Stellvia.' This is a real shame, because Stellvia is exactly the kind of anime there isn't enough of. Where are all the sci-fi animes that take themselves seriously without being dull, or having a dull cast of characters? Or for that matter, how many animes have you seen where literally dozens of characters are properly developed, and who are each likable or unlikable for their own reasons? In my experience an anime with such qualities is rare. Stellvia of the Universe isn't perfect by any means, but if I said it wasn't one of the best anime experiences I've had in a while I'd be lying. Overall, Stellvia of the Universe is a well crafted piece of entertainment, one that you shouldn't avoid.My Score: 9.5Version Watched: English Dub of the population was wiped out less than two hundred years ago.

It had a very unique storyline that kept me interested until the end. There was very few fillers, and the characters are realistic (being that they don't have out of proportion body parts, random personalities).It has romance, action, unexpected twists, I think it is definitely worth watching but the first episode explains everything so it might be a little boring for some people.And for those who love space, pretty images of the universe, you'll get a huge dose of it :) "", ""Length: 26 episodesOriginal Airdates: 4/03 - 9/03Demographic: SeinenGenres: Adventure, Drama, Mecha, Romance, Sci-Fi, Post-ApocalypticPlot SynopsisThe year is 2356 A.D. - 189 years after a distant supernova caused a global catastrophe that wiped out 99% of the world population. To keep track on all space activities, mankind has built colossal space stations called &quot;foundations&quot; all over the Solar System. After passing the Space Academy entrance exams, Shima Katase embarks to the Earth-based foundation Stellvia to fulfill her dream of seeing the galaxy and to prevent another interstellar catastrophe from destroying Earth.Personal OpinionSo when I saw the first few episodes of Stellvia, I was thinking... &quot;This is...WAY to cheerful to be a post-apocalyptic anime&quot;.  Well considering the other post-apoc anime I had seen was Evangelion... I wasn't wrong to think so.  So the first 8 episodes do a really good job of establishing the universe that Stellvia was situated in.  By episode 13, here is what i noticed- It had some really interesting characters- A romance that nearly everyone would appreciate- Plenty of character development- A beautiful storyline and animation- Limited by heartpounding actionHad it ended on ep 13... it would probably tied with Gurren Lagann as my favorite anime... Unfortunately... Stellvia took a downturn heading into the 2nd half... the characters that we were interested in suddenly started to get annoying. The romance goes nowhere. And the character development gets muddled in frequent crying outbursts.The only thing that didn't go downhill was the animation and the action. The epilogue was also kind of anti-climactic.Overall.. this anime would've worked really well if it were split into 2, 13 episode seasons.As for my reccomendation... watch it for the first half, expect to be dissapointed by the 2nd half1st half: 10/102nd half 6/10Overall: 8/10Similar to...- Eureka SevenFor the same reasons listed above- Neon Genesis EvangelionPost-apocalytic... and Shima develops a &quot;Shinji-complex&quot; towards the end.

Oh boy,how I was wrong.Story : 9/10The plot is simple: mankind is about to be extincted by a huge electromagnetic wave and humanity should stop it by all means possible. Katase Shima,the main character, is a new student at the Stellvia station that must face the challenges of becoming a pilot and at same time,help humanity in this important mission.What it was only a cliche story about a hero saving mankind became...something much more as it explores the challenges of growing up and undestanding how difficult the world can really be. The mood set in first episodes gradually transforms into something deeper and,sometimes,sad as we see the characters in situations that everybody experiences in life. It isn\'t enemies,amazing actions scenes or boom moments that moves the story,what we see it\'s jealousy,frustrations,broken dreams,achievements,friendship and love.And even though Uchuu no Stellvia shines in human aspects,the physics and actions moments of every Mecha anime appears as well at its best shape. You actually undestands all the physics behind the ""evil"" electromagnetic wave and honestly,a star exploding and destroying Earth?Not something hard to believe. All the other physical elements make sense too,though some of them - like the alien people - are not very explored and could have been better developed.Even though they use a lot of elements,including thoughts of Nietzche later on, the ending lacked on two things that this anime was good about: passing and exploration of some of the facts exposed. What Kouta likes in Katase? What exactly is the commander? And what about Arisa\'s family situation?The story is amazing,but there\'s no conclusive ending that it actually needed in some points.Art : 8/10The art was something I got used after some time. It was childish and not exactly pretty,but it was clear,consistent and neat.There was a background in very single scene,some prettier some more shabby,but still,a background.There was no such a thing as an eye bigger than the other,misconfigured bodies or anything like that. Even the figurants were well executed. They were unique and colourful,the desing team really worked hard to make them look like a human group(different from some anime that they are just faceless or simple sticks).The main cast was good,each had a different design based on their personallity.The only thing that bothered me was that they only had TWO oufits. Like really? Yes,they are in a space station and in a dangerous moment,but when nothing was bad and they were hanging out,they still dressed their school uniforms. This is a seinen,yes,it\'s not usual to have a lot of clothes.But if the show wanted realism at least make them wear something normal for once!Now the CGI. They were bad,but it didn\'t burn my eyes to see it at every space scene.The Ultima spaceship was good and so was the planets design and the rift but only that.However, I have to give points to the programming system. It was creative and artistic to look at. I\'m talking about an 2003 anime,for that time,it was revolutionary.Sound: 8/10Asu e no brilliant road,Kirei na Yozora,The end of the world,Dear my best friend all perfomed by Angela it\'s not was I would call a masterpiece. Ordinary is the first world that comes to my mind. They tried to fit the end of mankind theme but to this anime I don\'t think it worked. If they went with lighter songs it would cause much more impact than this one.I gave a high score to this a anime song mostly because of the OST. I loved the piano arrangements.It was so simple and covered perfectly what was going on. They repeated very little and thus I could listen to a variety of songs to each ambient.The seyuu were suitable and they matched the character. The timid Shima or the mature Yayoi were always being well represented.Though I think characters like Kouta deserved a lower tone,since he actually sounded like a child when he was already 15 to 16.Character: 9/10I love the characters in Uchuu no Stellvia. Katase Shima had a development that is difficult to find. She experienced situations and deal with them in her own way. Shy, modest and conscious were words that described her during the whole series and that\'s okay. She matured,understood things,but still didn\'t change her personality in the end.Various sides are shown of her,from the confident to the jealous one. She was a child but an adult at the same time,dealing with situations that anyone would be confused about.Not only her,the majority of the cast had a background story,a development and I could identify their best qualities and flaws.It\'s difficult for an anime that focus so much in the coming of age of a single character to actually be able to show development of other characters,but I think Uchuu Stellvia did it well. Masaru suprised me a lot, from a character wrote to comic relief,he actually progressed subtely and makes me proud to say that he is,indeed,one of my favorite characters in the show.Still,some of them lacked background or even worst,had plot holes in their progress.What about the Big Four? How did they met? Who are they truly? Even Kent,the guy appeared much more than Najima & Shojin and nothing at all was explained about him or his relationship with Ayaka.Also relationships,an important aspect in the Romance genre,were well established.Be friendship or romance itself,there was something going on with the characters on the anime. Arisa\'s frienship with the whole team is more more complex than the viewer watches superficially.It\'s a consequence to the lack of human relations that she has at home.The same goes to Rina,a little girl that stays home alone because of her parents\' workload.Kouta and Shima\'s relationship is good at the beginning and you can understand why Shima fell in love him.He\'s mysterious,cute and nice with her.As the series goes,their feelings change and situations that were once natural become awkward.This is how things work in real life,mostly when it\'s about your very first love - and Uchuu no Stellva knows that and makes sure to include that at each single step in their relationship.Like a said in the story review,there\'s just one big issue that really bothered me in their relationship: there are too many questions that aren\'t answer in the end.How exactly they deal with what was happening with their love? And Shima\'s inferioty towards Koura? And the biggest issue, why does Kouta like her???? The anime made this question and didn\'t answer it at ANY point.Enjoyment: 10/10I watched Uchuu no Stellva non-stoping.I love it no doubt about it and I couldn\'t wait to watch the next episode.The ending dissapointed me? Yes. Does that make it less enjoyble? Hell no.Some times things are not perfect,and this happens a lot in the anime industry.It did need more episodes,but its time is limited and I don\'t think that it could have done better with the number of episodes that it had. The pacing was great and I really wish that more animes did it at the same velocity that Uchuu no Stellva did.It\'s a anime about growing up more than it\'s about mecha.It\'s about to understand yourself and humanity.We fight together only when we have an enemy in common,we feel jealously towards the people we love and we just hate to be worst than others.Does that makes us bad? And where exactly is the limit to us,humans? I think that\'s what this anime is about. I recommend it to anyone that likes a good slice of life or a more scientific mecha. And of course can take a lot of crying of the characters.Uchuu no Stellva is not a romance tear-jerk anime,it\'s a reflective one about humans relations and progress. something much more as it explores the challenges of growing up and undestanding how difficult the world can really be. The mood set in first episodes gradually transforms into something deeper and,sometimes,sad as we see the characters in situations that everybody experiences in life. It isn\'t enemies,amazing actions scenes or boom moments that moves the story,what we see it\'s jealousy,frustrations,broken dreams,achievements,friendship and love.And even though Uchuu no Stellvia shines in human aspects,the physics and actions moments of every Mecha anime appears as well at its best shape. You actually undestands all the physics behind the ""evil"" electromagnetic wave and honestly,a star exploding and destroying Earth?Not something hard to believe.

That was surprising. I was more expectant of a mediocre show through and through.That\'s about as much as I can give in terms of positive feedback of the show, though.I really only watched the first few episodes, but I got enough of a feel of the anime in those few episodes that it really wasn\'t worth watching at all. This show definitely is one of those classic ""prestigious school"" animes. I\'m not going to lie, there are indeed more than a few anime that have been able to pull this sort of setting off. However,...Stellvia sure as hell was not one of them. Faced with characters that I knew I was going to hate in the very beginning, it isn\'t hard to see why I dropped this show so early. Many of the characters that get acquainted with the MC are very ""unique."" and not in a good way. They don\'t make a lot of sense, and don\'t fit well with the plot and story this anime was going for. You\'d think they\'d at least be good at comedic relief, but no comedic segments showed up. I could also tell that this show was going to be ""slice of life"" sort of style until the last 3 episodes, where a bunch of plot is crammed into the end. So, if you don\'t like the ""slice of life"" part of the show, which to me, was very painful to watch, then you surely will not like it.In conclusion, the characters are bad, story is run of the mill, and animation definitely is not great.

Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/970/Yokoyama_Mitsuteru_Sangokushi,"[""Romance of Three Kingdoms, for those not versed in Asian cultures, is the Illiad of the East, A giant epic set around the fall of the Han dynasty in 189 A.D...This particular version of Three Kingdoms is not a straight adaptation of the novel, but a version based upon Sangokushi, a manga by the famed mangaka Yokoyama Mitsuteru (Gigantor, Little Witch Sally, Giant Robo) in a whopping 60 volumes of tankoban between 1981 and 1987. Despite this, the story remains the same, much to the series' benefit. Yokoyama's designs are generally good, if somewhat 'old-fashioned' in comparison to character designs of the period. The characters...are more archtypes then fully fleshed out people, but this also occurs in the novel. The only bonefide standouts are Cao Cao and Zhuge Liang, who chew screen time with great aplomb. The series becomes a bit of a slog towards the end just before the 'last battle', which hurts on a certain level. Unfortunatly the story is 'unfinished', with  this particular anime series ending around chapter 50 of the novel. Yokoyama never finished his manga version of Three Kingdoms anyway, ending it about three-quarters of the way through the novel. A good series that could have been truely great with better execution, the strength of the source material still stands out nonetheless.An interesting curio for any anime collection, and should be of particular interest to anime fans of Chinese descent. Also provides a distinct cultural flavor as well. are more archtypes then fully fleshed out people, but this also occurs in the novel.

Also provides a distinct cultural flavor as well."", 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms has the deserved reputation as being one of, if not the, greatest historical epics of all time due to it\'s large cast of historical figures, no single side being portrayed as purely good or evil (despite the novel\'s Shu bias) and having some of the most intelligent military tactics. Sangokushi captures many of these, but not completely.To start off, the anime covers the events from the end of the Yellow Turban Rebellion up until the Battle of Chibi, at which point the Three Kingdoms finally became close to formation. In this incomplete manner, a more honest title for the series...would be ""Prelude of the Three Kingdoms"" as it only starts to scratch the surface on the conflict between Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Quan, though what material it adapts of the original novel is fairly well done with it\'s political machinations and military strategies.As for it\'s characters, whilst many are accurate to what historical records and the novel present them as, they and the story suffer from the main flaw of the series, being mediocre presentation. All of the cast only get enough attention to show their core traits, making even some of the more established names fairly one note. The focus it places upon primarily the Shu faction also heavily limits character appeal for the other sides. For instance, the Wu faction becomes absent after the campaign against Dong Zhuo up until their alliance with Shu, leaving a lot of their history and character drama to simply be infodumped. Despite this, I wouldn\'t say their presentation is bad when considering it\'s characters at least remain consistent and logical in their goals (something absent from the majority of most series nowadays), but I have simply seen the same characters be presented better in alternate adaptions.The superficial aspects of art and sound are fine, with the refinement and colourisation of the art allowing it\'s characters to be more recognisable than the manga which lacks distinctive designs for many of it\'s support cast. Voice acting is fairly good with some well known seiyuu in it\'s cast and the music is quite a treat to listen to with it\'s imitation of classical Chinese music to fit the setting of the series. Animation is fairly minimal, however, with limited movement and quite fairly limited imagery for the battles.As for comparing it to the manga, it stands inferior in all but art and some character appeal. The manga covers up until the actual end of the Three Kingdoms era, thus making it a far more complete story. The anime does provide additional character appeal through direction of various emotional moments, whereas the manga focuses primarily on telling the history of the tale rather than providing great character introspection. Still, a complete story is a decisive factor for such a tale, which makes reading the manga a far better alternative.Overall, Sangokushi can at least hold the title of being the best anime adaption of the tale of the Three Kingdoms due to it\'s historical accuracy and consistency, yet it\'s bland presentation and incomplete nature make reading the manga a far better option. Better yet, either watch the 2010 live action series Three Kingdoms or read the original Chinese epic all of these are based on. would be ""Prelude of the Three Kingdoms"" as it only starts to scratch the surface on the conflict between Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Quan, though what material it adapts of the original novel is fairly well done with it\'s political machinations and military strategies.As for it\'s characters, whilst many are accurate to what historical records and the novel present them as, they and the story suffer from the main flaw of the series, being mediocre presentation.

If you don't know the story of RToK before watching this you are definitely not going to appreciate is as much as some who is well knowledgeable is. The accuracy and adaptation quality and pacing all for a anime that came out in the earlier 90s, I can't help but praise the efforts of Studio behind adapting Yokoyama Mitsuteru's manga.Art and Animation (6/10) FineMore Specifically (6.75/10)...Fine+Obviously almost everything back in the 90s that went for over 35+ episode isn't going to look amazing and the art style and animation for the anime is definitely dated and didn't age well. Certain scenes although the art style would drastically increase looking really really nice but majority of of was obviously dated so nothing much can be said when it comes to this, it wasn't ugly just dated and it didn't really bother since I already know what I was getting myself into, I wasn't here for this category.Sound (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.5/10) GoodThe opening, BGM and JP VA all were good in the anime adaptation it fit the Sangoku era really well and I really don't have any complaints about it. It didn't blow my mind but it fit this type of anime well.Characters (10/10) MasterpieceThese are based off of ancient Chinese characters of history and their personality where definitely portrayed perfectly as far as we remembered. Liu Bei is virtuous, Zhang Fei is hot headed and rash, Guan Yu is loyal and strong, Cao Cao is ambitious and courageous, Zhuge Liang is a genius and laid back it's all here. I didn't feel anything wrong, inaccurate or out of place.Enjoyment (8/10) Very GoodAs a fan of the Sangoku era I am glad I took the time to sit down and watch this classical anime right here. It definitely refreshed my memory of have great the story of RoTK is and I wish it continued. It went from the Yellow Turbans Rebellion and to the end of the Chi Bi battle. The version obviously focus majority of it's time on the rise of Shu and I don't mind that because when it came to that aspect I didn't felt they missed anything.Overall (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.45/10) Very GoodThe anime really make me want to just watch a bunch of war related anime which I indeed will. Souten Kuoro and Kingdom are next on my list. Sangoku lore will never get old to me so no matter the time the anime came out I didn't matter because I know if they stayed accurate to it I'll love it and I did. I definitely recommend this anime to any Sangoku fans out there everyone else it depends on if you like War anime because other than that I can't recommend it for it. There's a lot of politics and talking behind this one so if you aren't engrossed or knowledgeable about Sangoku history before diving in you most likely will get bored fast.

Zhe Tian,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51289/Zhe_Tian,"['Beware of rating/dropping this anime too soon. I almost made the mistake of doing so.To be more clear, the first 7-8 episodes are COMPLETELY different from the remaining episodes. Patience is key— they really took their time in the “origin story” or prologue of sorts (the first 7 or 8 episodes). Honestly it might have been a little too much — I bet many watchers would drop and underrate the show before then. I almost did. So basically, in my opinion the first 2-2.5hours are kinda boring, and don’t contribute a ton to the overall story—it also is fairly confusing, I didn’t really connect...the dots—but that’s just me.Heck, maybe I’m the only one who didn’t like the first 7 episodes. (Regardless, the episodes after go up from like 5-6 rating to like an 8, at least for me.) After 1 cour or so it REALLY gets pretty interesting.The art and animation is superb (basically close to 10/10) regardless, but most of us aren’t watching SOLELY for sightseeing (art/animation). the dots—but that’s just me.Heck, maybe I’m the only one who didn’t like the first 7 episodes.

Best donghua in terms of animation so far imo (better than mortal\'s journey to immortality even if they are somewhat alike). There is no stutter in their motions. It\'s very fluid even the way the mouth and body moves. It\'s just that, many people dropped this because of very long prologue/intro that took more or...less than 10 episodes.The story is good. The pacing is slow, especially the first quarter of this season (which is too slow), but it tells you what you need to know about the world our MC currently living and how cultivation works in detail. As usual, there are humans and demons fighting against each other but the demons here are not really that evil unlike other cultivation donghua or anime where the stereotype about demons are ""evil"". I\'m not literate enough to tell you the detailed, well-versed review in terms of its story. You can say that it is a generic cultivation donghua, but it\'s good imo.The visuals are the best in this show as I stated from the beginning. It doesn\'t feel awkward watching their reactions to certain things.  Of course, everything has its improvements but as of the time of writing, from big to small details, it\'s flawless! 10/10The sounds are good but not so extraordinary. It\'s well complemented with how the show change its pace.Don\'t let the rating fool you. I almost dropped this too but good thing I let the time pass to where it is now before I start watching it again. I guess my decision to watch this really pays off. Great job to the production team! I\'m eager to watch more! Whether you take my personal review or not, it\'s up to you. If you have enough patience, even if you are new to this genre, definitely worth a try! If not but still curious, then you might skip or put it in your ""plan to watch"" and let the time decide for you. If not both, skip! less than 10 episodes.The story is good.

You can say that it is a generic cultivation donghua, but it\'s good imo.The visuals are the best in this show as I stated from the beginning. It doesn\'t feel awkward watching their reactions to certain things.  Of course, everything has its improvements but as of the time of writing, from big to small details, it\'s flawless! 10/10The sounds are good but not so extraordinary. It\'s well complemented with how the show change its pace.Don\'t let the rating fool you. I almost dropped this too but good thing I let the time pass to where it is now before I start watching it again. I guess my decision to watch this really pays off. Great job to the production team! I\'m eager to watch more! Whether you take my personal review or not, it\'s up to you. If you have enough patience, even if you are new to this genre, definitely worth a try! If not but still curious, then you might skip or put it in your ""plan to watch"" and let the time decide for you.

Afro Samurai: Resurrection,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4970/Afro_Samurai__Resurrection,"[""When i first saw Afro Samurai back in 2008 I was amazed, to be honest I didn't think a concept like this would work out in the way it did. I mean here you have a black samurai, in an anime, with hip-hop music, unless we're talking Samurai Champloo this shouldn't work. But I really liked Afro Samurai, I thought it was sick and it only increased my respect for Samuel L. Jackson, so when I found out that there was going to be a sequel to the series I was over the moon... However little did I know that this sequel would end up...like this.Afro Samurai: Resurrection takes place after the events of the original series with Afro finding peace in the mountains after killing countless people because of his number 1 headband. It seems that after being on this road for so long, Afro seems to be losing his way and it is at this point when Afro is attacked by his old friend/nemesis Jinno and a mysterious female warrior named Sio, who wishes to have the head of the famous number one warrior because of the death of the people he has killed. And that my friends are basic elements of this story for this film and to be honest it sucks. The best thing about Afro Samurai was its originality and I know it's hard to follow up good material with sequels, but it seems like Resurrection really lost its 'cool' factor here, the story is basic at best and the new characters involved are just ridiculous and for some reason you want to kill Ninja Ninja in this anime. I'm happy to report that the animation and art style is still sick and beautiful and while the music hasn't got the flair of the original it's still pretty nice.Overall Afro Samurai: Resurrection really wasn't the sequel that people wanted, the story is unoriginal and the main female antagonist feels far too simple along with all other new characters. The animation and music however are still pretty good and while it's still watchable one can't help but feel sad for the way this turned out and hope that the third installment rectifies this anime's mistake. like this.Afro Samurai: Resurrection takes place after the events of the original series with Afro finding peace in the mountains after killing countless people because of his number 1 headband.

Honestly that would have been a better title than the insanely overused title ""Resurrection"". However, this is the kind of anime where they probably intentionally used a cliche title to pay homage to early, terrible anime like the infamous ""Ninja Resurrection"". Afro Samurai is NOT an anime that you are supposed to take seriously! It is basically like Kill Bill the anime...or more accurately Kill Bill the 100% anime since Kill Bill Volume 1 was partly done in anime format.Story and Characters-Warning: Spoilers!!!The story begins where the last movie left off. Afro finally got revenge and claimed the...title of World #1 swordsman. However, the #1 headband in addition to granting godlike power and immortality also consumes the sanity and soul of the wearer. ""For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"" Mark 8:36 . This quote isn\'t actually used in this movie, but since Samuel L Jackson is the main character, I feel randomly quoting scripture is appropriate here. Afro is doggedly pursued by several characters who all want revenge on him for killing their friends and family members in pursuit of his own vengeance. The primary message of the movie is that revenge only begets more revenge. That was also going to be the main plot and theme of Kill Bill 3, but unfortunately that movie will never be made now. Since Samuel L Jackson was the executive producer of this anime and close friends with Tarantino , I wonder if he wanted to make this as a sort of spiritual heir to Kill Bill 3? The people who want revenge on Afro decide to create an absolutely ridiculous plan to resurrect Afro\'s father, just to torture him and piss off Afro. Since his father was the only person Afro ever cared about, they figure that the only way to really hurt Afro emotionally is to bring him back and kill him again! Seriously! That\'s the fucking plot in this movie! The antagonists hilariously succeed, only to get killed by an insane cyborg version of Afro\'s father. Afro then must put his own father back to rest, and continue his journey of wandering. Afro never really learns anything or pays for his sins committed in pursuit of revenge, so the theme is rather undermined. The movie ends with a bullshit cliffhanger and a teaser for a sequel that now probably will never be made.Music-The soundtrack is once again performed by RZA and the Wu-Tang Clan. If you love those guys, you will love this soundtrack. If you aren\'t a fan of the Wu-Tang...you will obviously hate this soundtrack. Personally, I rather like the Wu-Tang Clan. Wu-Tang Clan AINT NOTHIN TO FUCK WIT!Animation-The animation is smooth and gorgeous. It is easily the highlight of the entire anime. The fights look spectacular and are just fun as HELL to watch!Overall:If you liked the first Afro Samurai, you will like this one. It has the same awesome fight scenes, beautiful animation, and pulse pounding hip hop soundtrack. Is it a deep, philosophical masterpiece? Hell no! Is the writing and dialogue Shakespearean? Of course not! Is is a fun action series if you feel like rotting your brain for 2 hours? HELL YEAH! I recommend Afro Samurai 2 to anyone who loves mindless action with LOTS of gore and hip hop! title of World #1 swordsman.

It was done by Watanabe in Samurai Champloo rather succesfully. But, afro samurai resurrection (again) is a disaster.Total unoriginal story line, crowded with cheesy cliches.Interestingly the most original? part looked like a scene poped from a Disney movie. A cycle of events are tried to be meshed (which might be actually very pleasing if done correctly), however the unreasonable characters together with the weak connections between events made this attept to fail....There was even a sex scene randomly added inbetween a fighting scene  just to complete the golden ingredients for an action movie, too absurd for my taste...The best thing was the animation needless to say maybe, good fights but since the story could not back them up after while even they became boring.The music was nice but again the scenes and the mood of the music did not matched at all, which in turn just resulted in more distraction.As a final word, if you like samurais, bloody fights, semi nude chicks and have time to spare, go and watch it.

""Kill or be killed, there is no option"". We see Afro in a little hut, accompanied only by a Buddha statue and multiple wooden figurines. Peaceful, but lonely.So, when Jinno appears on a motorcycle and drags Afro by his hair through the tundra, it is appalling. In the previous installment one takes Jinno to be slayed, but he has returned along with is sister Sio who vouches...revenge on Afro for making her family, and herself, suffer. For killing mercilessly. To do this Sio takes Afro\'s father\'s skull and disappears, promising to make Afro tremble by brutally tormenting his father and himself. However, before departing, she takes up Afro\'s number one headband and sends him on a journey to recover the second.The art was similar to the previous episodes, this time portraying Afro as a war-stricken man who seems to have gone through many tumultuous events. The lighting is spectacular, giving you a feel for the scenery and making significant symbols jump as they are supposed to and details are down to a tee. The viewer is never disappointed, the gore assimilating perfectly with every slash and vengeful strike. The sound and music fit the anime down just right. However, it is rather difficult to discern some words that are spoken and takes you a good minute after rewinding the anime to figure out what was said.Some of the characters, like Afro and his imaginary pal are just as awe inspiring as the previous anime. There is substantial character development but some, like Sio, will end up pissing you off in the end. Sio may look ample and plumped up, but her vendetta ends up driving her up the wall. Over and over again she speaks of revenge for the pain Afro caused and it gets really tiring after a while. After an hour into it, honestly, I just wanted to smack the bitch.More characters are presented into the story and reveals a little more into Afro\'s past.Overall [7]:My enjoyment and overall score would have to be rated a 7. There were times when I just wanted the OVA to end, and there were times when I was anticipating what would happen next. The plot is good but a little used up. Certain things will surprise you, especially the events that happen near the end of the animation.

Well for one thing this was much better than the TV Show, we actually have some character development for Afro in the movie, in fact much more then we did in the TV Series. There are some plot holes as other people mentioned like Why does Sio even have a grudge against Afro? Well generally I tend to think that maybe she blames Afro for what happened to her brother, but that's generally what I make of it....I think introducing a character like Shichiguro was a good call, he was for the most part generally a nice guy and you can see why anyone would be reluctant to fight him. But when Afro and him face off, you can tell it's purely business and nothing more. I think we can definitely expect a sequel to finally end the Series once and for all, The ending of the movie definitely indicates that. So overall, it has it's flaws but still it's much better than anything else, I think 8 out of 10 might be generous but I feel it's fair for the movie. Don't anyone deny though, the Art in this show is breathtaking.

While I did somewhat enjoy it, I felt that it was a disappointment compared to the series.The story was pretty weak with this one. And I knew this not even 20 minutes into the film, simply be hearing the antagonists 'plans'. By taking Afro's fathers remains and bringing him back to life... to torture him to death again to make Afro suffer... yeah, it's ridiculous. And really, this just simply felt like a poorly recycled version of the original shows storyline.Granted, there are a few bright moments but not enough to make...the plot really worth anything.The art and animation once again looks beautiful, even better then the original shows. This my friends, is as good as if gets in terms of hand drawn animation. In fact, it earned itself an nomination for an Emmy! And I say it's well deserved. The look and style are easily the films main highlight.The voice acting once again was pretty good, so I have zero complaints about that. The soundtrack is pretty damn good aswell, with a wide range of slow jazz like pieces that fit the anime perfectly.Now on to the characters. Afro is a pretty unlikeable character in this, not giving a crap on who he kills, as long as he moves on ahead. He is incredibly cold and even seems like he should be the villain of the series rather then our hero at some points. Ninja Ninja is even more annoying then he was in the series and he's annoying to the point that I had a hard time enjoying the film at times.The villains are pretty good... all save Sio, whom I couldn't stand. But aside from her, I thought the rest were pretty neat and far more interesting then Afro.Overall, I thought the film was decent. Nothing special or anything I plan to rewatch again, but still it was decent. If you watched the series and enjoyed it, then by all means, watch the film, but don't go in with huge expectations. the plot really worth anything.The art and animation once again looks beautiful, even better then the original shows.

The soundtrack is still good this time around. Once again RZA laces things up with some good tracks and I just might pick up the soundtrack one day because it sounds worth my time.This anime's production values are every bit as outstanding as the original. Studio Gonzo definitely didn't pull any punches here except until the end. The animation is very fluid frame by frame, and...some of my biggest pet peeves such as reused cels and many stills are non existent. The action scenes are still very good and at times imaginative; but my biggest problem with the action is that the pay off really didn't deliver during the end. The final action scene had moments where it dragged, and the ending was too lazily put together.The backgrounds have plenty of beautiful moments from the flowing of water, to the decorations during a festival, and lighting during firework displays. The artwork is also gracefully done, with Lady Sio given a sexy design. I have no issues with the voice work and I think everyone delivered in their roles.Unfortunately for me, that is where the pros end. It seems as though the writers chose to keep it simple and forgot about being the least bit creative. They practically reused the exact same story and plot. To include, they practically ignored character development altogether, and everyone comes off as stereotypes with actions that can be seen light years away.Afro is a cool enough character and deserves better; but too much screen time is given to the ultra irritating Ninja Ninja yet again. He does not shut up ever, EVER, and I don't find him all that funny. The plot is badly paced, and everything that does not contain action was boring to me.I hate almost everything: the character flashbacks, interactions, Ninja Ninja's annoying voice, as well as his boring jokes and punchlines. To include, its one and only meaningful theme on living with the horrors and misery which are caused by the headbands takes a serious beating. The entire plot is amateurish and completely forgettable. I will never watch this again.Now how well does the sequel stack up against the original? Well I wasn't blown away by the first one, in fact I think it's incredibly over-rated, but it's far above this. This sequel is nothing but a copy and paste. It didn't take any new steps to surpass the original at all. In regards to those whom loved the original and can't tolerate anything negative said against it. I recommend not wasting any time and just pick this up. Those whom hated the first really shouldn't even waste their time, because you may hate this one even more for the lazy effort.Afro Samurai: Resurrection could have been a whole lot better, but it needed a writing team with talent to pull that off.Highs: Production valuesLows: Rehashed story, very boring plot development, very annoying side character some of my biggest pet peeves such as reused cels and many stills are non existent.

His hat then breaks open and that\'s when the great soundtrack (made by the RZA, once again) kicks in and your eyes get the treat of a fantastic, albeit short blood fest. We are then taken to Kuma (Jinno) riding a motorcycle and an...older Afro carving statuettes.From there, the story begins to unfold. What I liked about it was the fact it still pertained to his father. The story was much darker at times, what with the sadistic antagonist Sio (voiced by Lucy Liu, who did a damn good job) attempting to resurrect Afro\'s father in order to torture him. Her reasons aren\'t expressed in great detail, but as the movie carries on, if you pay close attention to the three androids Afro fights, you\'ll catch the gist of why she\'s doing this, other than other more obvious reasons.The art/animation in this installment looks polished and far less gritty than the original five episodes of Afro Samurai. The fight scenes are nothing but amazing and intense and most of them carry on with satisfying length. Some parts had me yelling out explicit words at the top of my lungs even.In this, you\'ll also notice that the western style of architecture, culture and style have been merged with the eastern culture, which looks great. I felt a lot of effort went into the process of combining the two and I even took the time to watch the special features. They even went so far to get aid from English speakers just so they could sync the mouths of the characters with their VAs.The characters felt wholesome, as Afro once again assumes the role that he had in the first installment. However, you can tell that all the killing has made him a little softer, as he could have easily killed the men surrounding him in a particular scene, but instead he uses non-lethal methods to dispatch them. This has not made him any less bad-ass than he was in the original, but I feel it portrays his weariness of killing quite well. Jinno also makes a come back and his character\'s parts are awesome. They displayed Jinno\'s love for Afro as a brother and friend so well, most notably at the end of the movie. His character was very well developed, as was Sio\'s. Her drive for vengeance was as powerful as Afro\'s in the first ""movie.""Surprisingly, Ninja-Ninja also made a come back and provides nearly all the comic relief in the movie. There were parts that had me nearly rolling on the floor with laughter and his character actually has a lot more screen time and speaking parts compared to the original.The sound was superb, as the voice cast clearly knew what they were doing. Lucy Liu and Samuel L. Jackson are the big names here and they prove they can dub like veterans. They conveyed emotion well and as Ninja-Ninja\'s VA, Jackson is a riot. On top of the excellent voice acting, not only did the RZA provide the soundtrack for the movie, he even had a speaking part of his own as a DJ near the middle.Speaking of the soundtrack, if you liked the first series, the amount of hip-hop in this installment has been increased, which I thought just made it better. If you\'re a fan of hip-hop, this movie supplies you with all that you need. The music helps build up the fight scenes too and they seemed to sync up together which had me all but overjoyed. These are why I simply had to give the sound a perfect ten.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and if you were a fan of the original, I don\'t feel that this one will disappoint you. I\'ve already re-watched it three times and would be willing to do so a few more times. Overall, I gave this a 9 because while it\'s not perfect, it is close. I do wish it was a little longer, but judging from the popularity of this series, I am willing to wait until the third installment. older Afro carving statuettes.From there, the story begins to unfold.

The movie made the story complete and now we know what the authors wanted to show us. I found the movie more interesting, even though it got the same score of 6.Story: 6The action is even more interesting, but the story covers exactly the same motif: revenge. Now it's pointed at our sole hero who as always has the means to survive the onslaught. His personality changed and the direction in which it moved satisfies me enough to make the review a little longer. After filfilling his duty as a son, he has nothing more...to live for and lives like a hermit, carving wooden sculptures of the ones he killed on the way to the top. Suddenly he is targeted by a strong opponent, and during the movie he faces some old acquaintances. Other than that it's almost the same as the series, with the hero movin onward and regaining his killing intent.Art: 8It looks better and the animation is well made. It doesn't surprise me as it is a movie. I liked the design more and that's the reason the score is higher than when I covered the series.Music: 7I have nothing to add: again not my kind of music, but well mixed up with the action.Characters: 6The characters here feel the same urge to avenge their brethren, but the changes in AF's personality made me raise the score by one notch.Enjoyment: 8I felt more enjoyment than during the series as it was even more packed-up with action.Overall: 6I won't say it's good. The story is complete but shows the same flaws of little mystery and no suspense. I recommend it only to people who like action and don't take the blood and violence in anime seriously.

', 'Afro Samurai: Resurrection is set after the events of the original five episode anime. The premise is simple: the main character Afro is on a quest for revenge to take the life of the man who took his father\'s life for the number 1 headband which is rumored to give the owner godlike power. The movie is about what happens after you get your revenge, and the cycle of vengeance. A new character, Sio is one of the many people who was affected by Afro\'s vengeful path. She take\'s the remains of Afro\'s father in order to bring him back to life, all for the...purpose of inflicting as much pain on him for her revenge, and takes the number one headband from him in order to motivate Afro to come to her. It\'s a lot of words for what is essentially a very simple plot, but this plot is pretty strong for its simplicity. Character motivations are clear, what needs to be done is clear, and it is also clear thematically.Because of the rather unique circumstances that led to the creation of the animated version of Afro Samurai, there\'s a lot of star power behind it. Samuel L. Jackson is the producer and all of his celebrity money and his love for anime (and hentai too!) shows in the final product. I want to start to start with the voice cast first of all. Many are apprehensive when it comes to English voice acting in anime and I want to put those fears aside. This movie was produced for the West first and foremost, so the script and dialogue fit naturally. The main character himself, Afro, is voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. There isn\'t much to say about this performance because it consists mostly of single words and grunts. That doesn\'t mean Afro is uninteresting. On the contrary, because he\'s so quiet, you really wonder whats going on in his head. Jackson really shines in his other role as Ninja Ninja, a wise cracking and fast talking companion for Afro. He acts like an inner voice for him, often questioning Afro\'s motivations and goading him on in some instances. Together they make a very entertaining duo. The other major celebrity role is Lucy Liu of Kill Bill and Charlie\'s Angels fame. She does a good role in the role of Sio, the antagonist of the film, bit the delivery of some of her lines falls flat. This could either be due to direction issues or issues in sound mixing (an issue I\'ll soon be getting to). Mark Hamill also has a role though its for a minor character. Lastly, there are some other big names in the anime English dub sphere: Yuri Lowenthal and Liam O\'Brien. They do what they do best and provide some anime voices to anime characters. They don\'t really deviate too much from what they usually do but its an otherwise solid performance they bring.The other big celebrity name brought in for this project is RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame. Those who are familiar with the Wu-Tang Clan would know that they have a love for anime, so RZA was a natural fit for the his love of anime, and for the fact that he has done the score for other films as well. What you\'ll expect is some authentic old school hip hop beats, complete with boom bap drums, soul samples and rapping (some of which is done by the man himself). The tracks themselves are very well done and are implemented appropriately within the movie. There are issues with the mixing and sound editing however. In some scenes, the music sounds quite muffled and not loud enough, or sometimes, the volume of the voice track is around the same as the music, making it a little hard to appreciate the music in the moment. In other instances, the music fades out in a pretty obvious way, taking you out of the moment. This isn\'t a deal breaker overall, since its only in a few moments, but it can detract from your enjoyment if one of the reasons you want to watch the movie. If you are that kind of person, you were probably going to, or have already listened to the soundtrack in album form.The animation and art are just as strong, if not stronger than the original. With the movie being action oriented, action scenes are going to be the major focus of the animation team. Scenes are still bloody, violent and intense a you would expect. Animation is also really detailed and polished in them thanks to the additional time and money that was poured into it. It\'s a showcase of what studio Gonzo can do at their best despite their reputation for being an inconsistent studio. Character designs are still great, blending together traditional Japanese clothing and design sensibilities with technology. The background art and settings are also quite varied for a two hour long movie. There are wastelands, some locations that feel like they would straight up fit into a western, but replace the saloons with more Japanese flavored houses. A location at the end of movie is particularly stunning because of the strong color choices, the strangeness of background elements like mountains and some overall ""epic"" imagery for that location; you can feel the brutal history of it.So I highly recommend this movie, especially if you\'ve completed the anime. It may be style over substance for sum, but i say to them, the style is the substance for this movie. A small side note: a sequel is teased at the end of this movie, but I wouldn\'t get my hopes up. The movie by itself is complete, so don\'t let that stinger ruin it for you. purpose of inflicting as much pain on him for her revenge, and takes the number one headband from him in order to motivate Afro to come to her.

The hero must defeat said villains cause said villains want said item. Said item belongs to hero and Hero will protect said item until his dying breath. Basically the same played out plot that the original series had, but In a movie adaptation. Which makes it mediocre since we've all seen the anime then why see a repeat from a movie perspective?

It both delivers and falls short of the 5 episode series that was released before it. But that's mostly due to questionable and stupid things that the characters in this movie do towards the end.

Reflecting on Afro's motivations in the first installment prompts considerations of the underlying theme.As always, the forefront is dominated by action, violence, and stylish elements, with a minimalistic plot serving as a backdrop. Fanservice, primarily embodied by the main villain, contributes to the overall experience, creating a parallel with the first installment. The similarities are striking, making them almost indistinguishable peas in a pod."", 'I saw Afro Samurai: Resurrection twice. After seeing it for the first time, it convinced me to watch the Afro Samurai series and the movie with the same name. Then, I re-watched it for a complete view of the story. I found its graphics impressive and better than the series’ or the first movie’s. But I thought the sequel’s story was not as appealing as the original one.Afro Samurai embarks on a new mission. This time he has to recover his father’s stolen head and to punish those who have profaned his grave. However, stealing the head of Afro Samurai’s father is an act of...vengeance. The main idea seems to highlight the circularity of vengeance: Afro has avenged his father’s death, but in the course, he harmed other people. Now these people are seeking revenge, and so on.  But what bothers me is that I find the plot somehow overplayed. The avengers could have just attacked Afro Samurai to kill him. Instead, they challenge him. It seemed to me like trying a remake of the series.Some of the characters are the same, which is explainable. But where we have new characters, part of them mirrors characters from the series, who no longer appear in this movie. For instance, Shichigoro reminds me somehow of the Sword Master, Afro’s childhood mentor.  And little Sio is a perfect twin of little Otsuru. Surprisingly, I find that Shichigoro’s point of view is better defined and his presence more appealing than the Sword Master’s. But when it comes to the main antagonist, I think that Sio’s twisted mind and hatred are annoyingly overemphasized and her character is somewhat artificial. Her past story with Afro and Jinno, doesn’t fit in naturally if you compare it to Afro’s past presented in the series. I also couldn’t help but notice that Ninja Ninja, who was killed in the series, re-appears as if nothing ever happened. But I will not insist on this point because I always felt that Ninja Ninja was not quite a regular human being.The animation and graphics got my attention because, while peculiar, they illustrate so well the message conveyed in the story. The background colors, mostly dark and grey, but also violet or black and red, evoke the end of the world or even hell, while the ugliness of the characters emphasize the decadence of the people. The hair of Afro and Ninja, Ninja; the contrasts between a colorful, bright nature and the grayish, dark people; and the blood with different textures, varying from spray to thick and slimy, all these elements create a strong impression. But what I loved most were those black figures fighting on a white background gradually buried in abundant red stains. They almost seemed like Chinese symbols soaked in red paint – an image both violent and artistic.The soundtrack is very well tuned with the story and the characters: the rhythmed music suits perfectly the appearances of Afro or Ninja Ninja, and also the fighting scenes. And the sad melodies, inserted now and then, emphasize the tragedy of the characters.Perhaps I felt more inspired by the Afro Samurai series than by its sequel, in terms of plot. However, Afro Samurai: Resurrection, in addition to the amazing animation and graphics has also made me dream about a new possibility – forgiveness instead of vengeance. vengeance.

The soundtrack is not as good as the first one. However, there are some good tracks in Resurrection. The animation studio went a little overboard with the blood, especially with the first bridge scene. Could have used some more character development as well, especially with Bin and Tomoe.My favorite scene is probably the final scene where we get to see Lady Sio and Jinno redeem themselves somewhat. The soundtrack for that scene is also probably the best in the movie.Overall, Afro Samurai: Resurrection is something decent to watch if you watched...the original. the original.', ""When I watched the series I thought it was an okay series with nothing really sticking with me, but I still enjoyed myself nonetheless with it. However when I watched this movie I was puzzled with the choices they made with the film and ended up heavily disliking the movie.The story follows Afro and he goes after Sio and Jinno his old childhood friends after they steal both his no1 headband and his father's body. So as a result Afro goes across the land to get his father's body back and his no1 headband back. Without the first half Afro wants to stay his...hands of blood after realising he has only made a cycle of hatred which will repeat. I thought this was a welcome change from the series to give the character something to him, rather than just 'I want revenge so I kill everyone in my way'. However this does not last, as he then starts killing again and this is where the movie lost me. Afro just went back to what he was and gets no development meaning I still don't care about him.The antagonist are by far the worse part of the film. Jinno just shows up and we get no flashback on how him and his sister met u again nor do we get to see what happened at he end of the series, it feels like we're just meant to forget that and just belive Jinno was always this silent character. And Sio is bizarre to me. She has a sympathetic backstory of wanting revenge and it's clear we're meaant to feel bad for her. But then couple scenes later she acts like a crazy lady and getting pleasured by suffering and all that. It makes no sense for how they set her character up so by the end I didn't care for neither antagonists. But the ending was really bad with these two characters making a choice that makes no sense for either of their characters.For me the music was okay it's basically the same as the series with no evolution to it. And the animation was pretty subpar, in moments it was good like in group fights but apart from that most the fights felt the same as the series.Overall I can't understand how so many people like this movie and gave it a good score. Because for me it has so many glaring issues when it comes to the story and character's that I couldn't enjoy the film. hands of blood after realising he has only made a cycle of hatred which will repeat.

The written is even worse in my opinion and has even more plot hole, as well as I don't really like the premise of the story in the first place; I don't like the fact that Afros dad is getting resurrected, and I don't like any of the villains...either, you may be think ok well why did you give it a 7, shouldn't it be lower? Well the reason I gave it a seven was because it still had what I loved so much about the show it had excessive amounts of gore, good comedy, and a badass mc not to mention the top tier animation that studio Gonzo put out reminiscent of Madhouses Red line which I also greatly enjoyed over all I would say 100% watch it if you were a big fan of the original show, if not I would say skip it. either, you may be think ok well why did you give it a 7, shouldn't it be lower?

It has been a while since I watched season 4, so I started to refamiliarize myself with the show. I think it still holds up in terms of entertainment. The flash animation creates good and unique comedic effect (even though it's not traditional animation for anime, but whatever). The characters and their relationships are pretty much the same as they were in the last seasons. There is also just as much plot as there was in the last seasons (which is very little).In terms of comedy writing, I...will admit it is a bit lacking compared to seasons 2 and 3. It had some funny scenes and actions like before, but I feel it is missing the whole escalation of situations. Some of the gags and scenes felt like they could've gone further with the jokes, but it ends before it could get better. What I liked from the previous seasons mentioned was the constant suspense of how much further they can keep doing their shenanigans, or seeing how much worse the situation gets.Overall, there isn't a reason to not watch this season if you like it. It is a short comedy to have fun watching. will admit it is a bit lacking compared to seasons 2 and 3.

Anyways it still gives you funny chuckles, if you watched the previous seasons, you'd know what to expect and yet you'll be unexpected what comes each episodes way at the same time. The animation did look stiff at times like sometimes their mouths were at weird angles LOL!!The voice actors are still good as ever and again, the comedy side of things in this anime does...hit the mark at making you laugh.

For those of you who grew up in the early 90s, it is conceivable that Japanese Anime (JA) such as ""Dragon Ball Z"" were instrumental in \'setting the bar\' for how an Anime should be like. However, if you grew up in Europe during the 80s, it is hard to imagine that Captain Tsubasa wasn\'t within your weekly radar of TV shows. After all, how could a JA series about football not appeal to kids who probably spent their summer break doing the same (i.e. playing football)? At least...for me, this was one of those \'trend setting\' Anime that made football a lot more fun to play; even if it meant grazing my back against the concrete floor after attempting to perform a bicycle kick. Having watched this show several years later, from start to end, I can\'t help but agree that Tom Robbins has it right when he says ""It\'s never too late to have a happy childhood"".The story behind Captain Tsubasa is a simple one, but one that keeps you thoroughly entertained. The heart of the story revolves around an 11-year-old kid known as Tsubasa Oozora, who simply can’t live without football (sorry folks, but I refuse to refer to this sport as “soccer”). However, unlike kids of his age who perceive the sport as a recreational one, the strong bond between Tsubasa and the football was forged when as a toddler, Tsubasa was hit by a car but was miraculously left unscathed because he was holding his football (which absorbed the shock of the impact). Since then, Tsubasa became “friends” with the football. The series begins with Tsubasa and his mother moving to Nankatsu city, where Tsubasa aspires to become part of the famous Shuutetsu School football team. Known for their outstanding talent and led by their genius goalkeeper, “Wakabayashi”, Shuutetsu is a dream for any kid wanting to become pro one day. Nevertheless, shortly after moving to Nankatsu city, Tsubasa becomes friends with members of a rival football club from Nankatsu Public School (NPS). Unlike Shuutetsu, NPS is a disaster waiting to happen. Lacking a single player with a single shred of talent, NPS has a reputation for losing against Shuutetsu without scoring a single goal against them. Through a series of unexpected turn of events, Tsubasa decides to join Nankatsu to play against Wakabayashi. The chemistry between these two rivals is so intense that it makes you want to continue watching the show. Perhaps what adds to the charm is the fact that Wakabayashi is arrogant while Tsubasa is as humble as they come, yet both display incredible talent at the sport. At the risk of mentioning any spoilers, I will stop with the story and let you enjoy it for yourselves.Even if you grew up in the 90s, I can’t think of a reason why you will be put-off by the artwork. Granted, the artwork is not impeccable by any means, but it most definitely suits the theme of the Anime well. The characters have been drawn in such a way that each has its own distinct and recognizable characteristics. Furthermore, with respect to the matches, they are not simply a repeat of previous ones. Each match has its own dynamics, turn of events and level of difficulty, which will keep you from getting bored too quickly.In conclusion, regardless of what generation you are from or where you grew up, I recommend you to give this Anime a chance.

The anime was good up until the ending of the last episode. They completely skipped many important stories from the festival up until where the manga is currently (Chapter 140). Even though I love this anime, I don't want others to watch this and see the terrible ending and thinking that's it. Just go and start the manga from the beginning. It is an amazing read. The rest of the season episodes 1-12 were all fine. But the ending of episode 13 just kills it. If you want to get a good...experience then when you are watching episode 13 you can stop watching after a certain moment.

You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. It doesn’t even try to hide the fact that it is indeed trash. It doesn’t take risks on the narrative, owns up to every typical harem trait ever, and just by watching it my functioning brain cells is halved each minute. Having paid the price of a million brain cells, I can, nevertheless, say without hesitation—I enjoyed this show, and I did so unreservedly.“Why?” You asked in confusion, “why would anyone enjoy trash?” Well, Bokuben has reached a level of honesty only the most courageous can attain. When other trashy shows hide...its true colours behind a curtain of drama, this show truly embraces being a dumpster. In short, I love honest shows.There’s no plot to be spoken of but MC-kun flirting with his harem, albeit unintentionally on a daily basis. The shy classmate, the outspoken childhood friend, the school goddess, the teasing senpai, the clumsy teacher… I wasn’t spouting vague character traits, those are real characters inside this show.They put some effort into the music though, not gonna lie. Both OPs in the first and second season is sung by the female leads of the show. The ED is nothing special though, not bad, but it probably would never get a place in my weeb playlist on Spotify. The character models are fine, but the animation is no good - it\'s literally manga on TV. Luckily, the manga panels flow quite nicely, which is a silver lining in the clouds.But all these serious analyses isn’t why you are here, it’s the second season already! You already know what you are getting into—complete nonsense. And yet, to all you people out there who are still watching, I applaud your wisdom, for you have discovered the true way to enjoy this show. Now, spread that knowledge to those around you, I envision one day where everyone can enjoy any show they watch, where suffering is no more in the land of anime.For those who want to try to get in the show, just leave your mind blank at all times. That’s how I think this series is best appreciated. And if you do so, I can promise it will be the most relaxed 20 minutes you are going to have all week. Just that you most likely won\'t be proud of yourself.As the Buddhist saying goes, ""the source of all pain is attachment."" And this show has offered a first-hand experience on how true that is. Only by detaching ourselves from the chains of human decency and the pride as a tasteful weeb can we truly transcend and be freed of agony and pain - the pain from watching a dumpster in flames.At the end of the day, what makes for a good anime is its ability to inspire.

Well do I have got good news for you then. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is the show for you because it has not only done away with all of those...pesky things but instead has substituted it with such wonderful things as... .... well nothing.I\'m sure many people will try to convince you of this shows many ""positives"" such as cute girls, and..... cute girls, and more importantly.....more cute girls. Fear not though for i\'m hear to tell you this one gleaming positive in this pile of PTSD educing trash. There are in fact (wait for it) CUTE GIRLS. If all you want is cute girls then boy here\'s your show because this show has plenty of those. They might not have you know a personality but hey they\'re cute. Sadly though, this isn\'t like the first season where at the very least each new girl was worked into the story to make sure it didn\'t feel stale, no this time you have all of them from the start and boy just wait to see how long it takes you to want to kill all of them.Maybe this show could have been better. Maybe if the show had desired to grow up and spend the all new 13 episodes of it\'s second season picking it\'s OTP and developing the couple into a relationship we as the audience could have fallen in love with and enjoyed watching grow to a climax and conclusion. Is that what happened? No. Instead as an audience what do we get? We get 13 episodes of ""comedic misunderstandings"" that try to be funny and replace any attempt at actual comedy because hey watching a guy fumble around end up in ""scandalous"" situations with so many of his Hera... i mean friends is what passes as comedy now. We also get the shows most egregious offence IMO which is it simple can\'t pick a couple. At least SAO of all shows established a couple (not that it really mattered) and most other good harem shows establish a couple. Then we as the audience have a reason to watch as we get to see the couple either spend the show becoming a thing (which is overused and boring but at least something to grab on to) or be come a couple and go through actual couple issues (which is harder to find but when found is rewarding). Both of these would have been better then spending 13 episodes in a fight between the main character who has no personality and is severely autistic with girls to the point that the girls could strait up ask him out and he wouldn\'t know what they mean, and the girls who are as interchangeable as the show itself seems to think they are given how much it pretends like the MC will end up with one of them.This show isn\'t for me (if that wasn\'t obvious) but i genuinely mean this. If you found enjoyment in this show, i\'m happy for you. Really i am. It means you still enjoy this type of series.

To save you time, if you liked Bokuben from the start, you will love season 2. If you didn't, you probably won't like this either.Bokuben is really simple in its premise and doesn't try to be something that it's not. It is a Harem Rom-Com. It's not trying to be really profound or thought provoking, it's meant to be an Otaku self escapism mechanism. Simple. However, that doesn't mean there's no story to be found here, and that's where in my opinion, season 2 makes significant improvements over the first...season.Season 1 of Bokuben was more of a flavour of the week type of excursion with Nairyuki being shipped with one of the girls each week with little in the way of actual overarching plot development or advancement. Season 2 improves on that with a very clear and obvious advancement of the plot each week. Each episode does build upon something and lead into the others. In fact, we get a character arc for each of the girls this season that really ads some much needed development for a few like Senpai and Takemoto. Other more established ships like Fumino and Sensei get their screen time as well, but it's with clear purpose. To give an example, there's a Fumino arc which really gives you important background information about her and her family and in my opinion, serves as the highlight of the season.Overall, Bokuben 2 is confident in what it is, doesn't try to be something it's not, builds upon the foundation we got in season 1 and is everything you've come to love or not love from the series. The characters are cute, funny, silly, nervous and most importantly, they can't learn. Bokuben season 2 gets a 10/10 from me. season.Season 1 of Bokuben was more of a flavour of the week type of excursion with Nairyuki being shipped with one of the girls each week with little in the way of actual overarching plot development or advancement.

BUT NOW with Season 2, even the clumsy teacher Mafuyu Kirisu and the teasing Senpai Asumi Kominami wants in too, because ""Why not add unsuspecting characters that could potentially be ""Best Girls"" in the running aside from all those clichés and tropes from earlier""!If you haven\'t watched Season 1, SHAME ON YOU, go watch that first and truly experience the wholesome ""trash"" that is the MC tutor being affectionately unconsciously ""flirting"" on every girl, so that they\'d have a running for his ""indirect kiss"" first and foremost. Now with Season 2, the stakes get higher as the trio of girls and Nariyuki are dead set on making their place in university, something that from the foreshadow of Season 1, Ogata, Fumino and Uruka still has a ways to go if they wanna achieve progress to university in their own right (oh, and claim the title of ""waifu material"" status too)! Along with Kirisu-sensei and the senior that is Kominami, they\'re sure NOT making Yuiga\'s life any better, for good or for worse, but rather getting him constantly into hot water ""thinking of ecchi"" moments.I mean, come on, we\'re already being ""degenerate"" weebs for watching this anime before in the first place, and holy cow, Season 2 ups the ante by a long shot, coming into question the gradual character development of why the trio of girls want to achieve what they wanna be at the beginning of Season 1 (and the manga), not to mention the calling of their lives once university sets in the harsh truth (and the most possible situation, being separate from Nariyuki). This ""red thread of fate"" of the group of 5 Waifus and 1 pure, naïve of a boy won\'t last forever...but Yuiga being Yuiga, his role is like the Buddhist saying: ""In the end, only three things matter: how much you loved, how gently you lived, and how gracefully you let go of things not meant for you.”It\'s truly a godsend message down from Heaven how Nariyuki shapes everyone\'s lives without knowing his impact of simple help and kindness that extends the range of his heartfelt desires to push people further and accomplish the best of them. How can you not afford to love the hell out of this MC?While nothing has changed in terms of visuals and animation, Silver and Arvo Animation did use Season 2 to improve and refine the mistakes of Season 1, which are always a welcome when it\'s literally the same artstyles and good fluid animation spliced in comedic gag moments which still manages to pace its timings well. The biggest change would always come from the musical side of things with the entirely new OST. While Season 1\'s OST is helmed by the female lead VAs, the same here can be said for the OP which is still quality, except Halca\'s ED, which is quite decent and OK (though honestly I\'d love to listen to another ED by them as well).My only minor gripe with Season 2 is that with Season 1\'s pacing of the first 40 chapters (which are a great introduction), the latter season just went haywire on its own with choosing which chapters and mini arcs to adapt this time. To someone who is tracking both the anime and manga at the same time, it nerves me to say that while the episodic theme is pretty much what the anime adaptation is gunning for, and the mini arcs are quite the welcome when it comes to people wanting to know what materials are adapted (coz it\'s a genuine thing now).To end this series on a high note, this quote sums it all well from Henry David Thoreau: ""If we will be quiet and ready enough, we shall find compensation in every disappointment."" And that\'s what I can say about We Never Learn: BokuBen as a whole: It\'s a mindless, trashy, all-knowing harem, but with never-ending delicacies on the wayside that you cannot afford to ignore that\'s all good.

Like the amount of time I would watch different type of harem is ridiculous.But as the time passed I got bored of it, I think manly because of the fact I don\'t like tsundere anymore. I mean I don\'t mind if they makes the tsundere character in the joking way, but for the super aggressive ""imma chop you head off, even though I love you"" tsundere just not sit well for me anymore.There\'s always that one character that I don\'t like in harem...and everytime their faces is on the screen I went ""Ugh"" but for some reason it never happened for BokuBen, Rizu, Fumino, Uruka, Senpai, Sensei, I love every single of them.Even though at first I thought Sensei is always gonna be a bit ""B*tchy"". But as the time pass she ended up becoming my favourite character on the show. Even though she never show it, she actually cared about her student. She just trying to tell them that chasing after your dream that you not 100% guarantee for succeeding is not worth it, and it\'s going to risked your future. Just like what she went through with her dream sport. But oh well.The story itself is pretty good. The show is based around Romance so you should expected this to play a main role here. So, we got Rizu and Uruka who is in love with Nariyuki(He still didn\'t catch it. Standard) And Fumino knowing this, trying to help these two get close to him. Lil did she know that shes in the harem aswell. Because she trying to help these peoples getting closer, she ended up getting closer to Nariyuki aswell.As for Senpai she might have a lil feeling for Nariyuki. People say if you tease someone it means that you liked them. But for Senpai I\'m not 100% sure. She might just being thankful for what Nariyuki did for her.But her aim right now.. Well I should say all of the student aim right now is what they\'re studying for. Long story short:Rizu trying to understand more about people emotions.Uruka trying to go to the Uni she aiming for because of her swimming capability.Senpai trying to take over her father on becoming a doctor.Fumino is looking for her ""mother\'s star"" and wanting her life to have a connection to the stars. And for that she need to pass Science exam and learn astronomy.So to put romantic feeling in between of these is going to be difficult.So far the things above didn\'t put enough impact on the show for people to care. But these things is going to play a big role in the future. On what will they do about their feeling combining with the thing they been study for.I can\'t wait for that.So far I enjoyed this show, the story is good, the characters is fantastic, the screen-time for each character is also good. It\'s a well balanced harem anime, I enjoyed it.If you want lovable characters and some good romcom harem, I recommended this show.Sidenote: This show so far is nothing serious, it\'s just a pure RomCom Harem.

And those are elements that I never touched when I watched and reviewed an anime. But in this case they connect perfectly with the funny and romantic moments. Also, even I was...not a fan of the opening, the background music in every single episode was perfect, because fit in the comic animation and the ridiculous situations so well. The voices were great too, the seiyus add more personality to every character. So yeah I really liked the first season, so going into this new season I was expecting the next phase of the anime, maybe maturity in the characters, a little change in the premise, or at least more funny and memorable moments. And what does this new season leave us?In general, I really enjoy this season too, for almost all the reasons I liked the first season, especially the first part of the anime (episode 1 to 5), in a moment I thought that I was watching some extra material of the first season, but then present us the maturity of some characters taking their future seriously and the last leg is when they make what they want it to do. It’s a good body of work and they presented different emotions through the anime, many of them meet their goal, but other ones, not really; I’m going to explain why thought his review, but let’s start with:Story:The introduction in the first episode reflects that the order of the things remains completely the same: A poor guy of high school who needs to teach three girls of his same high school the subjects they need to study to go to the college and achieve their goal. And they show us a little summary of how the girls improved in the subjects that they found difficult; and after that the story continues without further interruption.Development of the story:I really liked the little and quick summary of the main theme of the anime, because they weren’t redundant and boring explaining every single detail of the first season. And after that, they show through this first leg of the anime the same qualities of the first season: The ridiculous but funny situations, the charismatic and entertaining characters, the exaggerated but hilarious reactions and animations of every comic or romantic moments and the humorous background music of the situations, and that’s why I thought for a moment that his season would be the rest of the first season; like I if I was watching the episode 14 to 26, but I wasn’t upset or disappointed about it.  All the elements that I already mentioned were enough to had a funny or good moment in the anime. Some scenes were so ridiculous and funny that I couldn't stop seeing them and laughing about it, at least they were completing their goal of entertaining. But in the middle (episode 6) the things start to get serious because we found that the characters start to took serious their future. This part of the anime is really interesting because we found the difficult decisions that the characters need to do to realize their dreams and what they want to do with their life (Specially in Nariyuki). I found the story of Fumino and her relationship with her father the best moment in the anime, the drama is good well done, the performances feel real and hard and the romantic and comic touches complement very well. But unfortunately, we found some boring and uninteresting moments, and this is because the redundancy of some of the goals or romantic moments of the girls (Ogata and Uruka) and the uninteresting parts of the development of their future, particularly in Uruka. And the last leg of this, is kind of cliché and predictable, but at least is funny how all the things are randomly ejected. But I was really surprised at the finale of the anime, it was little hurried and confusing like why they made it look like it was the final goodbye I don’t know. Maybe they are planning something more about the anime, but who knows. I’m not going to deny that watched the grown versions of the characters were great. In general, although some forgettable things and boring moments, the development is enjoyable and funny enough to have a good time laughing at some of the ridiculous things presented or the comic reactions and performances of every character.Characters:They were okay, I don’t have many complaints about them, maybe a few. Almost the same qualities and personality that they presented in the first season it’s showed in this season too. Nariyuki Yuiga, the main role, is one of the best in my opinion. As always, is the guy who has the typical misunderstandings with the girls, but almost all of them are so dumb that are entertaining, for example in the first episode. But I really liked how the story focuses on him and his future, how he has a difficult time finding what he wants to do. Also it remains his worrying of the future of the girls, but also how he helps to solve their life problems. His maturity is the best part of him in this season, his role is nice and complete, but is not the best of all. In my opinion Fumino Furuhashi is the best character. Not only she remains her comic, funny, lovely and cute personality, but we see more in depth in her childhood, how hard is the relationship with her father, and how her decision of study Astronomy complicate the things more. Her comic reactions in my opinion are the best, because how exaggeratedly laughable are, is the reason why the episode 5 is one of the best. Her relationship with Yuiga is cute and funny, their moments together are the best romantic moments of all the season. So yeah, Fumino is not only the best of the three girls, in my opinion is the best of the entire season.Ogata Rizu has her funny moments too, and sincerely, is the most mature character of all, how she transforms of a serious, angry and graciously expressionless to a funnier, cute, lovely, and especially expressive girl. In the episodes 1, 4 and 5 it looks clearer this. But not all her moments are like this, because what slow Rizu for been one of the best is that her dramatic moments are fulfilled of the redundancy of what she wants to study, also it feels a little boring and predictable, the best example of this in the episode 7. But at least I can say she is not that boring as Uruka Takemoto, which is in my opinion, the least interesting character. She remains her energetic, cute and shy personality, and through the anime has her funny moments (especially in the episode 5), but her romantic moments with Yuiga are forgettable, predictable and a little lackluster, the moments where they talked about her future feel boring and easy to ignore and sometimes her attitude feels overreacted. So yeah, I wasn’t a fan of her in this season.I really enjoyed the participation of Sawako Sekijo, the moments where she is in the spotlight feels fresh and interesting, I liked how her relationship with Ogata has grown a little bit and the moments where she wants to connect Rizu and Yuiga are funny and well done, also her story is nice too; I really liked his secondary role. With the sensei Mafuyu Kirisu, when she helps and advice Yuiga of his future and she mentions his qualities, I loved that, because she plays perfectly the role of what she is: a teacher. But the rest of her moments they felt a little repetitive and uninteresting, especially the comic moments; I enjoyed more his role in the first season than this. I don’t have complaints about Asumi, she acts normally like in the first season, and it’s funny and hilarious when she has the spotlight in the series. And I don’t have much to say about the rest, they just feel normal: The Furuhashi friends that wants to Fumino and Yuiga had romance moments, the Uruka friends that push Uruka to have moments with Nariyuki and the Nariyuki’s sister, Mizuki: She has her funny moments, I don’t have any complaint about her.Development of the genre:As the first season, the comedy moments complement very well with the situations that are presented, and yeah, maybe some of these moments are cliché but the way that the animation and production works in them, just fits perfectly. Many of the romantic moments feels cute and entertaining, as I said before the moments where Fumino and Nariyuki are together are the best, but in general at least they tried to maintain the same vibes of the first season. The drama moments are great too, how they associate with the future or goals of the characters, even if sometimes feels a little boring but I’ll take it. The ecchi moments, like the first season, feel fresh, comical and laughable. The development here convinces in general.Music:I wasn’t a fan of the opening of the first season, but now with this new opening, this is probably one of the best openings I heard this year: The funny, happy and sunny instrumentation is perfect, the chorus is addictively good, every vocalist of the group Study is great and the moments where they sing together are amazing under this sweet melody. I loved this. I like the ending too, it has a more comical vibe, but the instrumentation and that funny chorus complement well. But been honest I prefer the ending of the first season. But the background music, as the first season, is amazing, complements very well with every situation presented, there are sweet and sunny melodies in the romantic moments and there are funny and laughable melodies in the comedy moments. I really liked the music in this season, maybe one of the strongest points in the series.And I don’t want to go without give it a shout to the amazing animation, production and the seiyuus of this season, especially when they use little heads most of the time in the comedy moments and when the expressions are exuberantly hilarious as the anime goes. And the voices fit perfect with the attitude of every character, when they shout (especially Nariyuki) or talk in a funny tone are just wonderful.Overall:Despite the moments where the situations feel repetitive and some attitudes of the characters feel a little boring, in general, Bokutachi II is a funny, fresh and entertaining follow-up of the first season and where the animation, production, music and the seiyuus stole the show. And we can’t forget about the good performances of the characters, at least every one had one funny and memorable moment that I’m going to remember maybe for the rest of my life. I’m sure that this wasn’t the final of the anime, they just can’t finish this good piece of work in this way; and apparently an OVA is on the way, so we just need to wait what this anime offer us in the future.I give this an 8 out of 10. I have high hopes for this anime, for me this season was another win and I just hope the better for this story and their characters in a closer upcoming. not a fan of the opening, the background music in every single episode was perfect, because fit in the comic animation and the ridiculous situations so well. The voices were great too, the seiyus add more personality to every character. So yeah I really liked the first season, so going into this new season I was expecting the next phase of the anime, maybe maturity in the characters, a little change in the premise, or at least more funny and memorable moments. And what does this new season leave us?In general, I really enjoy this season too, for almost all the reasons I liked the first season, especially the first part of the anime (episode 1 to 5), in a moment I thought that I was watching some extra material of the first season, but then present us the maturity of some characters taking their future seriously and the last leg is when they make what they want it to do.

Don\'t get LA wrong when LA watched the first season, LA went with it and it was somewhat refreshing but now with Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai building it\'s foundation, Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is now continuously building to the point it\'s leaning to the point of collapse now, it\'s arc fatigue whilst trying to give your favourite girl that screentime, but if everyone gets it, no one will most probably steps up and that is Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! biggest problem. The other problem LA will say is that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! tends to bring in the whole ""misunderstanding"" situation that Nariyuki and one of his harem members goes through as well thus spinning it\'s wheels as well.BUUUT...On the flip-side, LA is still thankful that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! does give each girl equal screentime and sure giving some VERY coincidental situations where all 5 members being in the same place at the same time as Nariyuki is but LA gets what Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is doing nonetheless at the end of it. Heck to be honest, the best character to actually step up for the first half at least was Sawako Sekijou voiced by Saori Oonishi, the ""rival"" of Rizu and we actually see their friendship grow and thanks to Nariyuki as well that it grows as well so there is that as some sense of growth and for LA\'s most relatable character, it\'s also good to see that it\'s Sawako to get the development in saying to open up, instead of the stoic-tsundere anti social Rizu, so a twist on that trope.To this end, as this season DID spin it\'s wheels for half the season, it\'s the second half where any good character development comes in and of course from most of the harem especially Furuhashi and Uruka\'s episodes and arcs. Uruka\'s gave us a fresh take on the childhood friend trope mixed in with her maybe leaving for a better school and this obviously affecting Uruka\'s feelings for Nariyuki. Furuhashi\'s arc is a solid effort in developing her and as to why she wants to be an astronomer and that has to with her maths obsessed father that was shown in the first half at one point. Yes the entire neglected father tropes does come into play with Furuhashi but her development is more like a reformation of her family through broken ties and beliefs, something Mafuyu told Furuhashi to do, but quite obviously Nariyuki helps Furuhashi both in her academic endevours but this time, helping with her family issues. Quite honestly she was immensely developed with her arc making finding best girl that much harder, well she has one of the better character developments this season at the very least. The final few episodes were an ensemble piece with Nariyuki again this time with the school festival and oddly enough the anime changes focus to not the harem members BUT to Nariyuki himself, something LA didn\'t think about (kinda funny seeing the second season poster not having him reflects how LA thought of Nariyuki even with his good points about him as a protagonist) and as much as Nariyuki helps his harem out academically, he himself doesn\'t know where he\'s headed and plot wise it goes in a nice direction, coinciding with Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! typical harem hijinks in a school festival setting with it\'s ensemble cast flavour.The animation done once again by Silver and Arvo Animation is pretty much the same as it\'s first season right down to do comical reactions to the pretty solid character designs, can\'t really say much about the animation besides that it\'s the same as the first season right down to the little detail and consistency.The voice cast is back and LA will give some MVP\'s out due to the more serious drama side it takes, that of Haruka Shiriashi as Fumino Furuhashi and Lynn as Mafuyu Kirisu gets LA\'s MVP with Sayumi Suzushiro getting a close third for the voice cast.Due to how equal the harem gets in terms of screentime, LA\'s stance on LA\'s favourite character hasn\'t really changed that much, LA is still more or less rooting for Mafuyu and her screentime was great, Fumino and Asumi closely following and Rizu being even more relatable to LA.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! sure spun it\'s wheels for the first half with it\'s only problem being that this season suffered heavily from arc fatigue and contrived coincidences but on the offset developed minor characters especially Sawako, but once the latter half starts, Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! really brings what LA wanted it to be like, with major character development from the harem, taking things in new directions for a harem anime, not too serious but great character development for the harem AND the main protagonist. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! has a slow twiddling it\'s fingers for the first half, but it gets better in the latter half thankfully from it\'s character development episodes/arcs.Ultimately...for LA at least.Mafuyu is best girlFumino has best character developmentRizu best relatableUruka best childhood friend turnAsumi is best chaotic factorWhat are the chances that any romantic resolution with Nariyuki will NEVER come with this harem anime though?...just LA?... everything is nice especially in giving us equal screentime to the harem of 5 but besides the good equal screentime to the harem to Nariyuki, nothing much happens besides that which is a shame as it could shake things up in giving us something, ANYTHING to give us what the first season did. Don\'t get LA wrong when LA watched the first season, LA went with it and it was somewhat refreshing but now with Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai building it\'s foundation, Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is now continuously building to the point it\'s leaning to the point of collapse now, it\'s arc fatigue whilst trying to give your favourite girl that screentime, but if everyone gets it, no one will most probably steps up and that is Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! biggest problem. The other problem LA will say is that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! tends to bring in the whole ""misunderstanding"" situation that Nariyuki and one of his harem members goes through as well thus spinning it\'s wheels as well.BUUUT...On the flip-side, LA is still thankful that Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! does give each girl equal screentime and sure giving some VERY coincidental situations where all 5 members being in the same place at the same time as Nariyuki is but LA gets what Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is doing nonetheless at the end of it. Heck to be honest, the best character to actually step up for the first half at least was Sawako Sekijou voiced by Saori Oonishi, the ""rival"" of Rizu and we actually see their friendship grow and thanks to Nariyuki as well that it grows as well so there is that as some sense of growth and for LA\'s most relatable character, it\'s also good to see that it\'s Sawako to get the development in saying to open up, instead of the stoic-tsundere anti social Rizu, so a twist on that trope.To this end, as this season DID spin it\'s wheels for half the season, it\'s the second half where any good character development comes in and of course from most of the harem especially Furuhashi and Uruka\'s episodes and arcs. Uruka\'s gave us a fresh take on the childhood friend trope mixed in with her maybe leaving for a better school and this obviously affecting Uruka\'s feelings for Nariyuki. Furuhashi\'s arc is a solid effort in developing her and as to why she wants to be an astronomer and that has to with her maths obsessed father that was shown in the first half at one point. Yes the entire neglected father tropes does come into play with Furuhashi but her development is more like a reformation of her family through broken ties and beliefs, something Mafuyu told Furuhashi to do, but quite obviously Nariyuki helps Furuhashi both in her academic endevours but this time, helping with her family issues.

With the second season I have to say that it is a fairly similar case, it is still a romantic comedy with harem elements in appearance of the bunch, but with enough charisma to remind me why I like...this kind of series even with its small flaws, that its honesty in what it is feels comfortingly familiar among so many other works that try to play around with the metanarrative or the clever twists but fail in the attempt.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai, also called We Never Learn or simply shortened as Bokuben, this review is dedicated to the second animated adaptation of the eponymous romantic comedy manga written and illustrated by Taishi Tsutsui.This second season continues to introduce us to Nariyuki\'s efforts to support the girls he studies with even if he ends up in occasional misunderstandings with them, as he begins to decide what he wants for his future.Following the simple but always effective formula of episodes dedicated by segments to the different girls and their interactions with Nariyuki with the occasional detail of character development, this is a series that does not go down the most dramatic path of romantic comedies, focusing usually more in the more comical and occasionally fanservice section of this kind of series, giving a greater focus of attention to the misunderstandings that make us think that the city and school where the whole series takes place has a very small population. In general I have to say that although it looks like your typical romcom from the heap, it has a solid enough execution to be an entertaining show. Unfortunately I must admit that despite everything I have a small problem, the series in order to reach certain most emblematic arcs of the manga skips quite fillers which is not necessarily a bad thing, but by the nature of this work small details of the development of its characters were lost at the same time. Nothing too serious, but I recommend that those who have only seen the anime give a reading to the manga, although the addition of an original ending to the series gives something of added value to the viewing.As for the technical work, I must say that it is still functional although nothing particularly wonderful. With everything and its occasional fanservice we are facing a series that is pleasant to see with its colorful settings and characters, although it shows when they try to save on small details such as when they ignore many of the hairstyle changes that Fumino has throughout the manga but that does not spoil the show. At times punctual yet corny the direction manages to bring more produced scenes to life, while offering compelling settings and easy-to-recognize characters including the quirky CGI dance scene that resulted in something worthy of any idol anime.As with its first season the soundtrack is similar to what animation is, nothing to complain about but nothing particularly surprising. The work on the voices of the characters is satisfactory and the soundtrack is energetic, retaining several of the already characteristic instrumental themes that the first season gave us. For its part, the opening of this season is the cheerful ""Can now, Can now"" performed by the series seiyuus under the group name of Study, meanwhile the ending is ""Houkago no Liberty"" performed by the singer Halca.The second season of Bokuben is something that I enjoy a lot week by week, but I really have nothing more to say that I have not written in this review. This is an honest series in its simplicity as a romantic comedy that connected with me by how familiar it is with all the early series I watched more than a decade ago.

At this rate, if you've watched the first season or other harem in general, you knew what you were getting with this. Time for my review of the second season of We Never Learn.Story-Our story of course, is the continuation of a harem series that debuted in the Spring season of this year. It's your typical harem, characters get set up in awkward predicaments, misunderstandings happen, humor ensues. While it serves its purpose, its by far nothing new or exhilarating. Face it, we watch this genre...for one thing: to turn our brains off and cheer for our favorite ship.Art-As a whole the art won't blow you away. The girls look cute and adorable, Nariyuki still looks your run of the mill MC, not much to cover here. Again, if you watched the first season, nothing has changed worth noting.Characters-With the genre we're dealing with, this is the pivotal aspect when deciding how much you're actually going to endorse into this series. Thankfully, with We Never Learn I feel like all the girls at least bring something positive to the table, especially Fumino. Her arc involving her dad was easily the most entertaining aspect of this second season.Enjoyment-Overall, eh. Season wasn't all that good, but it wasn't frustratingly irritating for a second season like Nisekoi was. This genre will always fall more into the guilty pleasure for people despite most of them having glaring issues. I guess we never learn.Recommendations: Quintessential Quintuplets and Ore suki(Future note for my later reviews: I'm probably just going to end up skipping the sound grading because they usually tend to say the same thing on all of them, so i'll only comment on it if it made an impact on me)Thanks again for reading my reviews, I know this one isn't the greatest but I still appreciate any feedback you guys give me and as always I hope my opinions help. for one thing: to turn our brains off and cheer for our favorite ship.Art-As a whole the art won't blow you away.

(2019)I will now and always remain firmly on the Fumino ship in the hopes it is fulfilled one day. That is my reason to soon binge up to date the Manga.The show continues off with our cast from before and is a great season. The ending is slightly rushed and not the direction I wanted but that is what makes the show great. Just when you think it goes your way it takes a curve into a different direction. Although nothing is set in stone yet!The art as before is really good. It builds on the comedic values greatly....The girls are all cute as before and the over the top expressions work really well.The sister towards the final episode is just hilarious.The OP and ED are great and work really well. The JP voice actors are perfect for the roles and hopefully won't change through the show.Characters get much more development. Whilst still building on their academic dreams the show does so much more for the love and affection than before. This brings a really nice show. In the end, everyone receives more and we see characters in a different light than before. People are much more honest as it goes on, a sign of growing up.The show is still a masterpiece of enjoyment in its genre for me personally. I would like to have seen the ending as two episodes to make it less compacted.Hopefully, the show will return.

I am getting tired of watching anime where nothing changes from episode to episode. I liked the first season, when meating new characters it is hard to get bored by the daily life, but season 2 brought nothing special, just the same old story I was starting to get tired of.The first 9 episodes made literally no difference in the plot progression. The same daily life is boring now and I struggled to went through the beggining of the series. With almost no character development it seemed like I was watching...the same episode lots of times.All the interactions and events that happened seemed to have already happened in the first season and it was very frustrating to see everything be forgotten by the main cast on the next episode. Nevertheless the second season brought and ending to We Never Learn, and because of the 4 last episodes which in fact made difference in the story progression it deserves a 6. The school festival arc managed to be funny and different, the ending of the Fumino arc with her father was also nice. Concluding, there were unique situations but the majority of them were just birds of a feather.The art was pretty much the same. It is a nice character design but in the end it made the second season look the same as the first one.The ost opening and ending where regular again.This season made all the characters but Furuhashi to seem underdeveloped. Their feelings didn´t change and the interactions that felt fluid at first now are boring. Ogata´s reason for wanting to study psychology is so weak and it makes no sense to me, why would someone pursuit a dream based on the will of winning tabletop games. Somewhere in the anime they showed that now Ogata wants to understand people on top of wanting to win in games. However it is unbelievable that after several tries and lots of people telling her to give up she kept pursuit her first objective which was winning games.Uruka and Kirisu are still the same but now the sensei got more screentime and that was terrible. Such boring character took part on boring episodes where all Nariyuki and Kirisu did was the same as they had already done. I am sorry to repeat myself so many times but the daily life killed the second season. As for Kominami, she made the anime a bit more interesting with some unexpected situations but she wasn´t enough to make it interesting.I can´t say I enjoyed the We Never Learn 2 but I don´t hate it. It was boring but the last episodes were great, I just wish there were more unexplored scenarios and situations. It deserves a mediocre rate.Sorry for all my english mistakes, my mothertongue is Portuguese and I write these reviews as practise.

And you thought it was impossible.No plot for the first 7 episodes. just disconnected stories with strange coincidences, no new development or anything, just boobs. Small, big, from ""inadvertently exposed"", to the point of ""if you want to touch them, I don\'t mind"". And that little sister going a little too far, it\'s just uncomfortable.Then 2 episodes about family, and 3 about the usual school festival, nothing really original, actually not that bad, but not enough to save the rest of the show.It looks like the author ran out of ideas, and the studio had to fill...in with very little material for most of the season. in with very little material for most of the season.', ""I really wanted to enjoy this show. I found the premise of it really fun for a harem where it was about studying and getting better at a specific subject as that' relatable for students but I guess the story forgot that for the sake of mindless generic rom-com situations. If the story had actual progression and character development I would've liked it.At the beginning of season one, I found the premise really good. It had a nice initial hook but for some reason, the story stopped being interesting and it devolved into something very generic.I can't really pinpoint why I started disliking...this series but I'm just more disappointed at it at this point. I think the openings of both seasons is a valid enough explanation for me. I loved season one's opening because it had a kind of narrative. The visuals are really nice and the part where they're just studying is really nice for some reason. Everyday things such as studying is something that's always at the background for most animes set in high school so I thought maybe this anime would bring it to the forefront and make it interesting. In season two the amazing visuals are gone for the opening credits. Sure there are some good implementations of the credits but nothing more.

While browsing the seasonal chart, picking up shows that I caught my interest until I ended up with an odd number. I love my numbers, but even more so, the even ones, so Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai was the pick that balanced up my seasonal collection of the time, hoping I would grow fond of it, episodes by episode, it turned up to be even better than the shows I was especially hyped about.Eventually, the season ended, and the show left a noticeable void that I was only able to overcome when...I knew about the second season's announcement, and it was in the same year. Sweet.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! was just the continuation I was waiting for; a sequel that lives up to your expectation, airing relatively shortly after its prequel when the anticipation is still present, and the community is still engaging.Story (7.5/10):The classic Harem trope embracing, mondegreen centered waifu driven slice of life continues in a manner that does not discard its identity. It doesn't attempt to bringing anything new to the table, risking throwing off devoted fans, it does not innovate and encloses on what made it so loveable. It only gifts back what we've grown to love about it, almost as both seasons were no more than just a cour that went together back to back with no chronological shifts in-between. Naryuki's season one on the last night was the same Naryuki the next morning in season two, and so were the other girls.Following the direct events of the first season, Naryuki continues to help the main trio, Ogata, Furahashi, and Uruka while also keeping his acquaintance with Kirisu sensei and Kiminami.As the school year comes to a close, and everyone is forced to make their life-changing decision, they each learn to overcome their differences and strengthen their bonds further so that the inevitable parting is never too harsh on any of them.The pacing and linear plot progression kept up the semi-episodic serialization which works perfectly with the short character arcs that occupy the greater part of the series, escaping from the enclosing dead-line that was the end of the school year.Art (7.6/10):I would say that the premise of Harem shows lies within the characters and plot interactions rather than the visual notes. However, the power of the visual is an important aspect that gives or takes points from a Waifu candidate.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! keeps up a generic visual facade, with clunky designs that can easily mistake the main characters from background crowds. That is if it wasn't for the clever and assertive use of vibrant colors to highlight them apart.It's arguably the standard in the Harem blueprint that the visual quality and attention to details always shifts towards the Waifus, the main selling point of this type of shows, the protagonist always settles with probably the most generic and boring design as a way of making him or her relatable to the viewer; as the protagonist's sole purpose is to link the Waifu gang, with the Waifus themselves are there to gain the audience's praise.Sound (8/10):If there was anything that stuck with me after finishing the first season, it was the opening and ending bundle it featured throughout its run. The second season inherited the same fidelity when it came to the vocals. Both the opening and ending theme songs were great, very considering to the mood and atmosphere that goes with the show.The voice acting is as good as the first season, great audible performances that encapsulated the frequent comedic inserts so well that the tone of voices delivered alone was able to draw out some laughter.Characters (8.5/10):I've talked about this before, I'll assert it more again. Characters are the single most important aspect that makes a Harem stand out, without it, a Harem is just a sorry excuse for one. Characters with no personality or likable, relatable, or interesting traits can easily affect and downgrade everything else that the show has going for it.Another season, more character development for everyone.What I really appreciate about this season over the last one is how drastically Nariyuki grows as both a mentor, a big brother, and a person as a whole, not just the main girls, but the protagonist as well shows a lot to be developed. He's no saint, he makes mistake, and he works hard to correct them and improve himself as he does helping others improving themselves as well that it goes full circle in the greater scale of things.Another great example of good character development shows on Furuhashi's sake. I never really invested in her, I never genuinely cheered for her, but this season made me do just that without even realizing it, I went from a firm believer in the Uruka x Naryuki ship to having a respectful consideration to Furuhashi all in a couple of episodes. Sadly the Ogata bandwagon wasn't as strong in this one, and that was my first ship when I started the show, however, the Uruka ship keeps sailing, hoping that in the third season (Please give it to us) she would take the lead once again.Enjoyment (8.5/10):I knew I wanted to watch more ever since I finished the first season.The spectacle that grew on me at the start of the year has only grown even more by the end of it, week after week following these high schoolers ' hilarious, dramatic, and emotional ordeals, cheering for different ships every now and then. Signing along with the theme songs and engaging in fan Waifu discussions. It was priceless, and only fueling my need for the third season.Overall (8.02/10):Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! is a shining gem in a genre that has gained a toxic cult following that throws off newcomers. It is such a simple premise that gains your back tons of enjoyment, and this Anime shows that by example. Great characters, frequent hilarity, and Mary Sue Waifus. If you've already made it passed the first season and are hungry for more, don't hesitate, just WATCH! I knew about the second season's announcement, and it was in the same year. Sweet.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! was just the continuation I was waiting for; a sequel that lives up to your expectation, airing relatively shortly after its prequel when the anticipation is still present, and the community is still engaging.Story (7.5/10):The classic Harem trope embracing, mondegreen centered waifu driven slice of life continues in a manner that does not discard its identity. It doesn't attempt to bringing anything new to the table, risking throwing off devoted fans, it does not innovate and encloses on what made it so loveable. It only gifts back what we've grown to love about it, almost as both seasons were no more than just a cour that went together back to back with no chronological shifts in-between. Naryuki's season one on the last night was the same Naryuki the next morning in season two, and so were the other girls.Following the direct events of the first season, Naryuki continues to help the main trio, Ogata, Furahashi, and Uruka while also keeping his acquaintance with Kirisu sensei and Kiminami.As the school year comes to a close, and everyone is forced to make their life-changing decision, they each learn to overcome their differences and strengthen their bonds further so that the inevitable parting is never too harsh on any of them.The pacing and linear plot progression kept up the semi-episodic serialization which works perfectly with the short character arcs that occupy the greater part of the series, escaping from the enclosing dead-line that was the end of the school year.Art (7.6/10):I would say that the premise of Harem shows lies within the characters and plot interactions rather than the visual notes. However, the power of the visual is an important aspect that gives or takes points from a Waifu candidate.Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai! keeps up a generic visual facade, with clunky designs that can easily mistake the main characters from background crowds. That is if it wasn't for the clever and assertive use of vibrant colors to highlight them apart.It's arguably the standard in the Harem blueprint that the visual quality and attention to details always shifts towards the Waifus, the main selling point of this type of shows, the protagonist always settles with probably the most generic and boring design as a way of making him or her relatable to the viewer; as the protagonist's sole purpose is to link the Waifu gang, with the Waifus themselves are there to gain the audience's praise.Sound (8/10):If there was anything that stuck with me after finishing the first season, it was the opening and ending bundle it featured throughout its run. The second season inherited the same fidelity when it came to the vocals. Both the opening and ending theme songs were great, very considering to the mood and atmosphere that goes with the show.The voice acting is as good as the first season, great audible performances that encapsulated the frequent comedic inserts so well that the tone of voices delivered alone was able to draw out some laughter.Characters (8.5/10):I've talked about this before, I'll assert it more again. Characters are the single most important aspect that makes a Harem stand out, without it, a Harem is just a sorry excuse for one. Characters with no personality or likable, relatable, or interesting traits can easily affect and downgrade everything else that the show has going for it.Another season, more character development for everyone.What I really appreciate about this season over the last one is how drastically Nariyuki grows as both a mentor, a big brother, and a person as a whole, not just the main girls, but the protagonist as well shows a lot to be developed.

It showed us development between the MC and the girls each having such romantic exhilarating and cute moments. Animation was also somewhat beautiful.

They are all the same anyway"". In some cases it would be the case. However, I think that ""Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai!"" still stands out among them.So, first question would likely be: ""Why do you think it\'s special?"". It\'s simple. It\'s special because it focuses on studying itself. Ok, let me explain. Many anime series that are set in school do not focus on learning and studying itself, but on other things, such as sports, club activities, etc. That\'s why ""We never...learn"" is somewhat unique: it develops its characters and their relationships with each other via studying.Now, more about the characters.

I really like anime that focus on the education journey for entrance exams, because I went through that myself. So, it's the reason why I have a soft spot for this anime.BOKUBEN is pretty good, in my opinion. The characters are fun and have their own little quirks which are fun to explore, although they don't really have any developments in character other than a love for the oh so perfect MC.The MC is pretty basic, nothing too outstanding although I like how they show that he too has dirty thoughts and is not this perfect being of innocence. I couldn't...hate him though.The OST is also super nice to listen to. I really loved the soundtracks. They're worth a listen on their own, I'd say.Coming to the art style, I.. really like it.

Enjoy!Personal Enjoyment: Not much to review. It's ur average slice of life harem school anime. It's a fun show to watch if u don't mind the cliches. Although the 1 arc in this season was very tasteful.Read Manga: If ur planning to read the Manga, make sure to either start from chapter 70 or from the beginning. The ending to the show is completely anime original, the Manga is still ongoing. The anime orginal ending is fine for these type of shows I personally did not mind.Sound/music: I enjoyed the opening and ending, both are...super catchy. My favorite ost however goes to the character songs. I do prefer S1 opening more.  As for ost in the show, it's pretty typical for these types of shows.Animation/Art: The animation is fine, expect for the cgi driving parts (ew leave it to polygon or Orange studio for cgi animation pls). The character designs are pretty well done, liked more then the actual art Manga art.Overall 7/10 for my enjoyment. Hey 1 point higher then S1.P.S The arc that I'm talking about (which u should know snice u probably finish watching both seasons). Is after the the festival arc, which means they skipped the festival arc to do her arc first and left the festival arc to conclude the show.Are u happy now MAL? I wrote a longer review super catchy.

I wrote a longer review"", 'tl;dr: A sequel season that while mostly the same gets significantly better towards the end, though then goes out really weakly.The second season of Bokuben starts off incredibly similar to the first. It’s a series of short stories, most taking up half an episode, just showing off Nariyuki and the girls studying and such with a strong emphasis on comedy and fluff. Things never get overtly dramatic. There’s not really any sort of progression. It’s just some light fun. The issues with that also persist, such as that it can feel like it’s getting kind of stale at times if multiple episodes are watched at...once. Thus, for better or worse, it’s just a continuation of what came before.Things start changing about two thirds into the season. There’s actually some long term progression with one of the heroines, though only somewhat and mostly in the background. And then it proceeds into an arc focused on another one of the heroines that takes up multiple episodes and is quite a bit more intense than the series had been up to that point. That still isn’t that intense mind you, but the contrast with how this went all in on forced melodrama despite how the rest of the series had seemed to have been trying to avoid such melodrama results in it standing out, and ultimately I think as a result the heroine focused in that arc ultimately got the best development of all the heroines in the series.It then proceeds into the three episode finale. This isn’t intense like the arc before it, but it still differs tremendously from the rest of the series in that instead of having a short story focused mainly on only one or a couple of the heroines, it’s an extended story that focuses on all of the heroines essentially equally and a decent amount on the related side characters as well. This is a pretty refreshing change, and thus despite the core comedy and fluff still being pretty similar to everything before it, due to the changes to the pacing in terms of how quickly it was jumping around and the extra element of how interesting things were in how all the various plot threads fit together, it was quite interesting to watch from beginning to end and didn’t feel like it was getting stale or repetitive in the slightest.The problems become apparent once the post credit epilogue rolls. The final arc was really good in and of itself, but it resolved nothing. It didn’t even progress anything really. At the point when it reached the final credit roll, no heroine had “won”, there wasn’t even any heroine that felt like she had an especially stronger bond with Nariyuki. The heroine focused on the arc before the finale I felt was somewhat ahead because she got the best arc in the series and it occurred right before the finale, but that turned out to not really matter. That would be perfectly fine if this wasn’t the end of the series, but it very much is. It was clearly stated that Nariyuki wouldn’t think about romance until after they had taken their exams, which very strongly implied that it would be taken into consideration after the exams. And the epilogue ends far after the exams, which means he likely did make a choice and the romance was resolved.And from that perspective, it feels like it is very strongly hinting that one of the girls did win, but it’s so subtle it feels like they might as well have not have bothered and just ended the series before he picked someone and left things completely ambiguous. As it is, I don’t think the people that wanted the heroine hinted at to have won would be satisfied as it just glosses over it, and I think the people that wanted other heroines to have won, which includes me, would be even more unsatisfied, as it feels like there was absolutely zero point in showing that the other heroines lost. Beyond that the epilogue is mostly fine in that it shows everyone getting the happy endings they had been working for, though in an incredibly rushed format, and shows that Nariyuki finally got the character development that had been hinted at pretty strongly since pretty much the beginning, though this was also pretty rushed. But as this is a rom-com, the fact that things were left unsatisfying in terms of the romantic aspect is a pretty major issue.In terms of art and animation it’s still incredibly solid. I wasn’t all that fond of the art style and character designs in the first season but they’ve really grown on me and I’d have to say I like them quite a bit at this point. There’s a single dance sequence that has very visible use of CG that isn’t all that great, but it’s essentially one scene that overall is still pretty good so I don’t think it’s too much of an issue. The OP was pretty solid in terms of audio and visuals. The ED I didn’t particularly like much in terms of either. The soundtrack I think is still noticeably good for the genre, though as far as I can tell it’s pretty much just a repeat of the first season’s. once.

The soundtrack I think is still noticeably good for the genre, though as far as I can tell it’s pretty much just a repeat of the first season’s.', ""the anime is good but the ending in manga is more satisfying than in this seasonand after this any other season is not coming out (not to my knowledge )if you like to give a short to read manga than go for it, it will be enjoyablebutif you don't have the time to read and still curious about the satisfying ending  than you can read the ending summary below what happen in manga.end of mangain manga , Takemoto  Uruka confers her love to Yuiga  Nariyuki  after graduation exams , nariyuki took his time and  understands...how important she has been in her life after his father passed away she was his motivation when he relies how he actually feel of her on graduation day on school when uruka about to leave japan nariyuki rush airport  with the help of all the girls and catch uruka before she leaves and tell her how he feel and that he love her and kiss her in the end it was a happy ending .,... after few years when she came back to japan after winning her swimming championship , Yuiga, Nariyuki purpose to Takemoto  Uruka to marry her and than its a happy ending. how important she has been in her life after his father passed away she was his motivation when he relies how he actually feel of her on graduation day on school when uruka about to leave japan nariyuki rush airport  with the help of all the girls and catch uruka before she leaves and tell her how he feel and that he love her and kiss her in the end it was a happy ending .,... after few years when she came back to japan after winning her swimming championship , Yuiga, Nariyuki purpose to Takemoto  Uruka to marry her and than its a happy ending."", 'So I will start with the story. Its pretty generic for a harem tbh. Similar to the Gotoubun series. Tutor who is an all rounder for all his subjects needs money or more of a scholarship reccommendation so he teaches the girls who are pretty bad in alot of subjects but in this case, each of them is specialized in a certain subject but wants to learn the other subjects that they suck in. Season 1 was very much on this storyline approach but I felt Season 2 strayed away with minimal focus given to the original plot. It was more on their relationships rather...than the studies. They all like him because he is a nice guy and all. Overall it is an enjoyable harem.Art was a 9/10 cos it is the type that appeals to me and I really liked it. I give it 9 because in one of the episodes, they used pretty bad CGI for what could have been a real good performance. Other than that, all good.Sound, well the songs are nice. Cheerful and enjoyable without being cringy. I couldnt complain.Now for characters, I do think they did a great job in this area. Each of the girls had their own arc which really I think would invest their audience into the character greatly. The arcs bring out each of their personalites really well. None of them are similar in anyway making each girl their own unique self and having a shot at taking the spot for best girl. I am TeamFuruhashi btw but that doesnt matter.For enjoyment, I gave it a 8/10 that factors in 2 things. One, solid harem. Enjoyable and hard to pick a best girl tbh. This itself has earned it a 10/10 for a harem anime imo. Very enjoyable and nothing was left out or lackluster. Each girl well defined and boundaries between relationships properly set. I then gave it -2 points because of how it ended. The ending was really out of nowhere and they added a time skip at the end kicking out the chance of a potential Season 3. The ending aftercthe time skip was as unsatisfactory cos for one, my best girl didnt win and two, it was kinda outta nowhere since this girl wasnt really focused on in the majority of season 2. I could have never seen it coming.Overall, without any bias, it was pretty enjoyable and I am quite sad that it has come to an end. Worth the watch for sure. than the studies.

You are going to laugh a lot, that's for sure.The only thing...that really pissed me off was the 3 or 4 chapters that were about mafuyu's booty, yes, you got a laugh or two, but I really got angry, I don't know if they are filler or whatever because after those horrific episodes they went back to normal and being awesome, those episodes could've used in knowing more about Mafuyu and Asumi instead of dedicating them to full fan service. I have nothing against fan service, I like it, but sometimes too much is just too much.I really enjoyed this season a lot, except for the fact explained before, really fun situations which we all have been there before, because all of us have been 16 at some point, really hillarious jokes at some points.Totally recommended imo. that really pissed me off was the 3 or 4 chapters that were about mafuyu's booty, yes, you got a laugh or two, but I really got angry, I don't know if they are filler or whatever because after those horrific episodes they went back to normal and being awesome, those episodes could've used in knowing more about Mafuyu and Asumi instead of dedicating them to full fan service.

The plot...seems to not really go anywhere this season? But the characters themselves are so damn good it's still worthwhile. Maybe we were just spoiled by how good the first season was and we fell in love so quickly- but man sometimes this show felt like trudging through mud. My main complaint is the lack of interactions between the girls- whereas last season it was plentiful and kept the plot interesting. S2 here you'll get one episode pretty much dedicated to 1 or 2 girls, and it's rare any one...else shows up. Over all though, it's probably top 6 or 7 in my harem genre anime list. else shows up.

I thought season 1 was mid at best, however, season 2 wasn't much better. The jokes didn't land for me and while the story was a lot better, especially the second half, it didn't do much for it overall. Ogata was the only character I really liked and to be fair she received a fair bit of development (they all did), but beyond that, I didn't care much about the rest. I felt Nariyuki was made to be some sort of Mary Sue character as...he could do just about anything.Nariyuki felt a bit like a cardboard cutout and there was little else to go on. The animation was decent for the most part but really went downhill towards the end with the dodgy CGI and the static animation (maybe they were rushing.) The end was okay I guess and it closed things out as much as you'd expect from an anime like this. The romantic aspect wasn't really fun for me and the anime failed to get me invested in any of the ships.

Thus, it can be conclusively said that this anime is about laughing alongside our quirky cast instead of coming to appreciate the more subtle parts of story writing.StoryOverall, we get a relatively smooth flow of things. We begin right where the previous season left...off, and engage right into the shenanigans of our characters. As the year progressed, the plot takes a few ups and downs, but overall remains relatively bland and tasteless. That\'s what you\'d get from a typical high school SOL anime so nothing new there.CharactersFor the sake of simplicity, I will list over each main character from the core four to better talk about character development from this studio.Nariyuki Yuiga is your typical harem protagonist: Capable, Kind, and ever-so stupidly dense. Unfortunately, while other harem protagonists shine, this one\'s dull as a rock. Yuiga is so immensely dense that somehow he doesn\'t pick up any hints whatsoever. ""That is a classic thing about harem protagonists"", you might say. But this anime goes out of its way to drop these hints and for some hilarious reason Yuiga doesn\'t pick up at all. Even where his two little siblings, his brother-complex younger sister, and his own freaking mom can pick up these hints, this guy can\'t. On top of that, the guy\'s a coward. There will be multiple moments in this anime that could\'ve glossed over so much smoother if he just sucked it up and said the right things instead of keeping them to himself. Instead, he doesn\'t, and just leaves us readers and watchers with this feeling of innate dissatisfaction.Fumino Furuhashi is arguably the best written girl in the series. Kind, smart, and the world\'s best wingwoman, its not that hard to see why the fandom\'s so crazy about her. In this season we got a deep peek into her background. And although it is revealed she suffers from stereotypical issues we have definitely seen in other anime (trying not to spoil here so bear with me). However, the fact that she eventually didn\'t even need Yuiga\'s help to deal with her troubles shows to me that she is the most well developed character of this series and ultimately the one who will win the Waifu Wars for this series.Uruka Takemoto suffers from the same faults that Yuiga does. She\'s unfortunately shy, yet she hides it behind her athleticism and tomboyish nature. While we do get a good look at why she admires Yuiga so much. It\'s not that she couldn\'t muster enough courage to do so, either. Because throughout the whole series her fellow swim team teammates and even Ace Wingwoman Furuhashi has been giving her love advice. It\'s just that unfortunately, once she realizes that she has once again failed to break through Yuiga\'s dense barrier, she straight up gives up. Despite being told so many times to not to. An unfortunate downfall for a more interesting heroine.Lastly, Rizu Ogata, blessed with academic intuition within the maths, she may seem like your typical know-it-all cold girl, but it glees me to say that the writers wrung her away from that trope and literally gave her emotion. Unfortunately, she was then promptly tossed aside, to be forgotten with the Senpai and the Sensei as a shadow of a harem member. That was what it felt like, at least, as she only remained somewhat significant after her character arc, which was unfortunately at the start and lasted about an episode or two. While the other two girls repeatedly barged themselves in on others\' character arcs, Ogata doesn\'t, and its this neglect that ultimately becomes her downfall in relevance.Sound and ArtI often like to group these two together because they\'re the bread and butter of a series and are often partners in crimeRegarding sound in general, the OPs are nicely done as always, showing the bright side of school that many of us unfortunately was not able to witness. it\'s cheerful, bubbly, and demonstrates all we need to know about our characters. The ED was good, too, with the girls in Chibi-style doing random shenanigans bound to get a laugh out of the watcher. In terms of ambient music, it really works wonders in this anime. The music in the study sessions is calming yet upbeat, for night its peaceful and romantic, and during each character arc it demonstrates the best of our characters\' interests. Takemoto\'s Athleticism, Furuhashi\'s Astronomy, and Ogata\'s Business adaptability.Regtarding Art, it is easy to tell where most of the budget was spent, right at the final festival arc. But overall, the simplified expressions as well as the ""ghost reactions"" that appear whenever the character\'s faces aren\'t in scene are spartan yet splendid. And in moments where a character is peaking, the art focuses on them, exaggerating details and showing just why they are a worthy love interest to Yuiga. Well done, it was absolutely fantastic.Overall, this is a great anime to watch when you\'ve got a moment for hilarity, it never ceases to amaze just how many situations our main character can get in and its heartwarming to see our characters grow off, and engage right into the shenanigans of our characters.

(though it\'s the same idea).The main, Yuiga, is a know it all, what subject does he lack in? Love. But that\'s about to get fixed real quick.Rizu is pretty much Shizune from Katawa Shoujo, very similar face, very similar personality, just different hair. In fact, I was waiting for her to start signing in the beginning.Furuhashi is the cute one with blue hair. They label her as ""Sleeping...Beauty"" because she sleeps in class. I like that, a blue haired princess. But she doesn\'t have a tired personality at all, she\'s quite vibrant and is one of the ones that I think helps Yuiga the most. It is kind of crazy that these two want to go to schools for subjects that they\'re bad at, I could see one breaking the mold as an idea for character but two?Takemoto is charming, she\'s the childhood friend but surprisingly not tsundere. She\'s a swimmer so her main problem is her attention to her studies rather than specific areas.And I\'ll conceal the rest of the gils because they aren\'t introduced until later so they ""might"" be spoilers.So let\'s rank them, for fun. I\'ll just name the other two as colors (I mean, they\'re on the cover anyway). Furu > Takemoto > Pink > Rizu > PurplePurple isn\'t even a bad character, just one I thought could\'ve been better because Pink isn\'t even a student. Isn\'t even being tutored. I like ""love interests"" that actually have varying reasons to like this guy but I felt that purple should\'ve been that way too, especially being introduced that late in the game. Don\'t get me wrong, I think it was best not to introduce them all at once but instead, I propose that the character be kept, everything in tact EXCEPT her tutoring because she actually helps tutor the others at times. What if Yuiga was losing his own studies and needed a little bit of help, another insider to pick up slack or something. That\'s who she could be.Back to Yuiga, he actually has a family so we see them and his personality through them. In fact, his family is poor so he gets good grades so that he can get a scholarship. Then we actually SEE that he\'s poor, making makeshift candles and talking about how he has to do that all the time and uses them to keep studying. This man doesn\'t half-ass. Tutoring isn\'t for money though, it\'s for a recommendation that the principal holds over his head like a carrot on a stick. He doesn\'t really have friends because he spends all his time studying but there are two kids that he gets along with. In fact, they each have their own friends aside from each other which I think is something a bit different than what I\'ve seen with other anime but it\'s a bit more real and balances it so they aren\'t taking up too much time like what I asked for the future of Quintessential.It\'s a hassle to tutor 5 kids all struggling in different areas, a major weight, but he thinks of pretty creative ways to teach them. Then he is faced with the choice of what he should do as a career and what college to go to in order to pursue it. He spends all this time helping the others with their studies, not to mention keeping up with his own work that he didn\'t really consider that. So does he go after the profitable option because he\'s poor? Does he go somewhere where one of the girls is at? Season 2 begs those questions, he\'s an actual protagonist instead of your average harem stud.They even dive into the topic itself. Yuiga is obviously the one these girls fall for which in a way motivates their grades, but what happens if one gets too close? Their grades go down, the teacher even calls him out to not date his students. It\'s looked at as a bad thing, as it probably should but I think it could\'ve went further with that idea and actually broke the trope and meta that it was using. So I don\'t necessarily think that it\'s out to ""rip off"" Quintessential, in fact the manga\'s first issue actually predates QQ\'s by just a few months. And in some ways, I think it\'s better but in some ways I don\'t, they both have their problems here and there.With Season 2, I couldn\'t help but notice that it has similar episodes now and then. It doesn\'t dip in quality, a good skit is a good skit and you can sometimes build off of that or use the same setting to good effect but if there were to be a season 3, I would hope they could expand horizons a little more rather than just revisiting the onsen. It also does a similar thing to Quintessential where I felt like S2 had a clear winner, so it was Rizu getting most of the attention but I think maybe Furuhashi had the most meaningful moments.Sekijo would make a good replacement should there be another OVA or something but it seems unlikely we\'ll get a S3 since the manga\'s over (it goes well past where S2 ended but it no longer promotes its source material) but I can say that it was successful in making me want to go read it.

So I don\'t necessarily think that it\'s out to ""rip off"" Quintessential, in fact the manga\'s first issue actually predates QQ\'s by just a few months. And in some ways, I think it\'s better but in some ways I don\'t, they both have their problems here and there.With Season 2, I couldn\'t help but notice that it has similar episodes now and then. It doesn\'t dip in quality, a good skit is a good skit and you can sometimes build off of that or use the same setting to good effect but if there were to be a season 3, I would hope they could expand horizons a little more rather than just revisiting the onsen. It also does a similar thing to Quintessential where I felt like S2 had a clear winner, so it was Rizu getting most of the attention but I think maybe Furuhashi had the most meaningful moments.Sekijo would make a good replacement should there be another OVA or something but it seems unlikely we\'ll get a S3 since the manga\'s over (it goes well past where S2 ended but it no longer promotes its source material) but I can say that it was successful in making me want to go read it. A really fun series overall, one of the funniest I\'ve seen.', ""I thought this season was good but it got boring during episodes 6-10, i thought everything else was pretty good, but i will say this, season 1 was better.  I think the series is very unique, for a romcom anime and that its worth checking out, i started reading the manga after the anime, and i can say that, this anime for the most part sticks to the original source material, and doesn't cut out important details.Something i really like about this anime, is that the author, Tsutsui Taishi, makes all the girls likable. Throughout the whole series i have found it hard to...hate any of the female leads. Usually in Harem animes there is a best girl and a girl you hate or you dont really like, but in this series i found my self liking them all. Of course i had my best girl (Furuhashi Fumino) but i found my self not caring who won.This Anime is more on the romance side of romcoms, so if your looking for comedy you might find a little something but not much. In conclusion, this Anime is good, it has an interesting premise and good characters, If you like the Quintessential Quintuplets then you will like this anime. But if your trying to get the the best experience from this series, Then i suggest you read the manga. I don't want to be one of those fans, who say just read the manga. But the manga will make you love the series even more. especially with the alternate endings, watch the anime then read the manga, you wont regret it. hate any of the female leads.

Skipping important moments like the intruduction of Miharu (which they could have put her in a season 3, but NOPE), the sheer fact of the director being a hige Fumino fanboy, who jumped into straight into S3 material (the Fumino mini arc, episode 9-10) and jumped backed to S2 material (the festival arc, episode 11-13) just so have more Fumino screentime.Also, that ending was not only awful, but it was a manga spoiler too.

They adapted a single route, a good one in my opinion although not the best, and yet they did not even adapt it well, much less completely. This anime needs a third season and OVAs to adapt each route. I did enjoy it, but those last two chapters frustrated me. I could see what they were doing, but it was still disappointing. The manga, (the original work) definitely...won, and by a lot! won, and by a lot!', ""Sadly the truth is it's much of the same as the first season, a fine typically sweet anime, that adds a few extra social and relationship issues, that try to show bumps along the way.The comedy is nice enough as the anime goes, and the development of how comfortable characters become with each other shows the development and deepening of their friendships as pretty much 5 people compete for one guy.What subsided a bit is any tension expected between friends where me may get jealous of another, almost as if they trust the MC more, or each other not to make moves due to...how socially awkward each is.What i liked about this compared to other harems, is it pretty much inferred who he would end up with from the ending, unlike many harems, where the guy remains clueless or has no one in his life.What I didn't like really was the additional push of fan service which seemed more prevalent in this season than in the first, which also had its own fan service.    It seemed a desperate way to keep people watching who got bored of the typical harem storyThe story overall is a nice one, and most of us who have dated in high school or middle school equivalents has been here, choosing who we like best, or why, is why it is relatable, and the difficulty of knowing we could be hundreds of miles apart at college/university level.    Also, the teacher continues to show she is not the cold-hearted character many expect, resonates with some not wanting to waste a talent they have, especially when it is easy to look back after at a teacher who pushed you as someone who got more out of you.Again art was great, the sound was good, the characters developed a bit more with more on the background, but was an enjoyable anime, even if was generic as a story. how socially awkward each is.What i liked about this compared to other harems, is it pretty much inferred who he would end up with from the ending, unlike many harems, where the guy remains clueless or has no one in his life.What I didn't like really was the additional push of fan service which seemed more prevalent in this season than in the first, which also had its own fan service.

Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova,https://myanimelist.net/anime/18893/Aoki_Hagane_no_Arpeggio__Ars_Nova,"['Before deciding if you should watch Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, you should probably ask yourself if military science fiction is your type of anime. Military science fiction often takes the idea of military but also fuses it with supernatural themes with flavors of science and artificial warfare. There are a lot of ideas that plays around with military sci-fi including alien invasions, mecha, or space wars. So what happens when you take a bunch of mental models that resembles the characteristics of female characters and puts them into total warfare? Simple. You get Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Arsa Nova.The series itself is based...off of the manga of the same name written by Ark Performance. The premise sets takes place in a setting of an alternate history although there are many similar paths crossed. For one, that path involves the Japanese attempting to recover their nation through engaging trades. Unfortunately, its enemy forces have powerful weapons of war known as the “Fleet of the Flog”. These are essentially weapons that has turned the tides in battle and pushed back its adversaries to the brink of despair. Luckily, there is some hope because of a certain naval group that is capable of dealing with this threat. They are called the Blue Steel and this series chronicles their journey.Arpeggio of Blue Steel might be a series that people would sway their heads away at first. The idea is hardly original as demonstrated in previous sci-fi war theme series such as Strike Witches, Tactical Roar, Blue Submarine No. 6, and Full Metal Panic. Potential viewers for the series might also sway their heads away as lead director Seiji Kishi is in charge of this adaptation. His mediocre direction of recent anime series based on adaptations such as Devil Survivor 2: The Animation and Persona 4 had numerous problems. Therefore, this show might initially be met with some controversy. For me, the series has its ups and downs. To call it a scientific masterpiece would be over exaggerating but it’s also not a waste of time to watch either. Because of its premise, this show itself does set itself differently with its cast of characters and brings the military science fiction theme in a different light.Taking place in the future of 2056, technology has far advanced than our modern world. Just imagine in over 40 years what our world would be like. For the characters in this series, they’re not living at home relaxing but are on the war zone to carry out an important mission. That mission is no walk in the park because of the obstacles ahead. Taken from an objective standards, the obstacles comes into two forms. The most obvious involves the ‘Fleet of Fog’, fictional avatars named after non-fictional battleships. The other obstacle involves also dealing with humans and corrupt governments that wants to achieve various goals with their own deeds. It’s a bloody revolution and no one wants to play nice.The main characters from this series includes the captain of the Blue Steel, Chihaya Gonzou. He can be described as a serious man with tactical mind of a leader with the ability to lead his crew through obstacles. However, he can’t do this alone without the help of his crew members. Among this group is a prominent avatar with code name 104 that also goes by the name “Iona”. Throughout the series, she describes herself as a weapon born to fight with no other purpose. Ever since she joined the human side, the government and various factions has their eyes set on her. Iona can be easily described as a giant killer. She may be have a small body structure but Iona’s abilities shines in battle many times thanks to her initiate ability to eradicate emotions and fight. This is proven early on when the crew takes on Takao, another human avatar of a Fog cruiser. Unfortunately, there’s hardly anything we can bring out from Iona. She’s a character that is surrounded in mystery with her stoic behavior. Her relationship with Gonzou and the crew can be described as professional although throughout the series, she questions herself exactly who or what she is.And that also brings another point. The concept of more human behaviors.Later on in the series, other Fog Ships are introduced that becomes a threatening factor to Blue Steel. Their purpose is set on destroying the privateers. However, it’s noticeable that they later on question their own purpose. This doesn’t just include Iona but also other Fog ships especially after they encounter a human girl. The encounter brings out a variety of human behavior including responsibility, guardianship, and even friendship. It’s questionable whether the characters in this series can truly establish a bond between Fog Ships and humans. Humans seems to fear Fog Battleships while the latter seems to despise humans for weaknesses. On the other hand, some of them clearly demonstrates human behavior ranging from love, care, jealousy, and even betrayal.The plot itself follows the premise well with its journey but does derive from the manga quite a bit with certain omitted scenes. It cuts out parts with this adaptation involving some of the comedic dialogues/scenes. Most importantly though is perhaps character development during the journey that is minimized in this series. Being a one-cour show, this anime suffers problems with rushing. Therefore, expect certain factors that might not match up in the end. There’s also a lack of exploration in terms of characters’ backgrounds. Most of them are vaguely expressed by whom they are presently. The lack of background histories can become a problem as viewers might have more questions with no concrete answers. The main protagonists (crews of the Blue Steel) are also difficult to get attached because they hardly get any development. In fact, most of the Fog ships gets more development than Gonzou and his crew which is a down factor for Blue Steel. However, one certain main character also has a highlight purpose because of who she is. In fact, it brings out the human vs Fog ships’ personality that tests new boundaries of these artificial weapons of war. For the Fog ships, some of them learns from these behaviors and demonstrates their own ideologies.Action wise, the series makes sense although the CGI might take awhile to get used to. As the series takes mostly in a naval environment, most of the battle takes place at sea. The battleships themselves are modeled after real life naval ships. Hence, they are designed with devastating firepower that proves itself in battle. Most of the Fog ships possesses different personalities that reflects their designs. The weapons used throughout the series often includes missiles, force shields and wave motion cannons that clearly outshines our modern world’s technology. The spectacular results of these weapons bring can be pleasing to the eye especially when the Fog ships themselves becomes what they are designed for - annihilation.On the other hand, there is also comedy present throughout the series whether it’s obsessive love, yuri-like fantasies, or the awkwardness in the form of a stuffed animal. Some dialogues are also mixed with words that can bring out laughter with its implications of suggestive factors involving “engines” and little misunderstandings.What isn’t pleasing though should again be addressed to the overall adaptation. The way it is constructed omits very important details involving Gonzou. The lack of exploration involving his parents or past is a serious drawback that is hard to redeem itself. Most characters from the original Blue Steel barely get any of their own spotlights. It turns out that Iona would be the ace despite her soulless personality. But without a clear background or exploration of her past, Iona also becomes a poorly constructed character. It’s a shame that our main characters just doesn’t shine as much as one would hope...Judging by art standards, Arpeggio of Blue Steel matches well by science fiction means. The way most of the characters are designed given them an impression that they are weapons of war (Fog Ships) or humans whom stands up against what comes at them. (Blue Steel) The animation studio SANZIGEN is not well known though in the anime industry. They are known for only a few science fiction theme series including 009: RE: Cyborg and Black Rock Shooter; the latter that received very mixed reactions. Fortunately, the background of the series redeems itself with glorious naval features, explosive battles, and science fiction aesthetics. The drawback would be the CGI that makes the show itself less powerful with its computer generated graphics. There’s also some fan service usually featuring the Fog Ships that might generate some reactions of eye rolling especially with the way camera angles are pointed at.The soundtrack is pretty well done by OST standards. Most battle scenes are accompanied with a dynamic beat and dominant intensity. It brings out the intense environment that exists in this alternate historical world. The OP song “Savior of Song” is well performed by Nano (Btooom!, Phi Brain: Puzzle of God 2, Ark IX) with vibrations of energy. The ED song on the other hand provides feedback of a more calm atmosphere similar to some of the comedic scenes in the series.All in all, this show can be a mixed bag depending on your experience with science fiction anime. The idea of a scientific mission sounds engaging but the plot itself is unimpressive as result of its poor adaptation. This is mentioned before because the way it cuts itself out that omits several important factors. It destroys the development of our main characters and where they came from. However, there are themes that are explored that can be interesting to take note of. The problem might be that the answer is for viewers to decide in the end with its ambiguous nature. Luckily, the action, powerful OST, and comedy will definitely leave you with impressions. Some characters (especially the Fog ships) do get development so expect moments where you’ll get to like them more.

The fact remains ultimately is that military science fiction anime can take different turns and angles. For Arppegio of Blue Steel, it steered in a path that defines warfare in its own way.', ""In the year 2039, the combined naval forces of humanity suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of a military force with weapons technology that far surpasses their own. The fearsome assailants? A group of heavy warships, termed “The Fleet of Fog,” who are commanded by “mental models,” robot-like representations of the minds of the battleships that take the physical form of little girls dressed in frilly clothing. Fast-forward seventeen years, and one of these mental models, named Iona, approaches a human naval cadet named Gunzou out of the blue, offering herself (and, by extension, the advanced Fog submarine she represents) to Gunzou to command....Gunzou accepts the offer, and embarks on a mission, piloting the Fog submarine to defend humanity using the very weapons that almost brought about its end. Meanwhile, Iona and several of the other Fog mental models appear to be warming up to Gunzou and developing emotions, which mental models are not supposed to possess. It's almost impossible to not note that this entire premise seems like a very elaborate way of creating a scenario in which scantily-clad girls say things along the lines of “you're my captain, please pilot me.” Judging a book by its cover is, of course, wrong, but having thought about Arpeggio of Blue Steel for longer than I ever really wanted to, I don't feel too bad about saying that that initial impression was ultimately pretty close to the money.Perhaps fitting for a story that's partially about machines coming to terms with life, the world of Arpeggio seems to be constructed from the ground up using pure CGI. Everything about it, from characters to ships, bears the obvious stamp of computer generation, and this, unfortunately, is CG of a cheap-looking and ugly breed. If there's one thing the show consistently gets right, it's light—explosions, lasers, computer displays and the like look good more often than not, but that's about the only visual aspect that I can genuinely compliment, and I'm reaching pretty far for that one. Backgrounds and other such niceties don't look so nice, with the ocean in particular often being rendered as a noxious purple-black cloud which bears shockingly little resemblance to a body of water. The design and color choices are poor—the characters all have the same pale, waxy complexion and widely spaced eyes. Add some otherworldly hair and wardrobe malfunctions, and everyone starts to look pretty ridiculous. Add some extraordinarily stiff animation (all characters move with an awkward, jerking hobble, all ships move at a stuttering crawl), and, frankly, you'd be hard-pressed to tell who is supposed to be a human and who is supposed to be a member of the more robotic Fog; they all look equally like paste-colored marionettes. This condition is only worsened by the show's repeated attempts to force its decidedly mechanical characters to do something sexy; it's like watching aliens awkwardly attempt to imitate aspects of human sex appeal, and something about it is strangely disquieting. The core of the show's aesthetic is thoroughly repulsive to no real artistic or thematic end.The music, mostly a mix of cheesy techno and uninspired string/horn compositions that seem tailored to fit the seafaring nature of the series, soars to mediocre heights. Okay, cheesy techno aside, some of it actually isn't too bad, but variety is an issue; this is one of those shows that have two or three songs for battle, two or three songs for dramatic moments, and a few minutes' worth of atmospheric noises that get recycled over and over again. The music direction is sub-par, with tracks often starting too late to have any impact on a given scene, or starting too early and overriding dialogue. Sound certainly isn't the show's worst department—actually, by simple process of elimination, it might be the best—but suffice to say it doesn't excel or help cover the show's weaknesses, as good music sometimes can.Looking at Arpeggio's story in a “big picture” light reveals interesting results in that, at the end of the day, there's really no detail to it whatsoever. The world-building is virtually nonexistent, to the point where I'd venture to say there's little that you couldn't learn about the world of Arpeggio from reading a three-sentence plot synopsis. The show proffers a fairly elaborate premise, but it stubbornly refuses to answer any questions about its overarching plot or setting—not the ones that will naturally occur to you, and, perhaps worse, not even the ones that it explicitly raises. Among the former will be perfectly logical ponderings, the answers to which would be required to achieve a minimum amount of richness in the setting, like: In a war where both sides have advanced futuristic technology, why aren't there any airplanes? If the Fog mental models are nearly indestructible and visually indistinguishable from human beings, why don't the Fog just send them ashore to covertly destroy vital targets? And so on. Among the latter will be vital, should-really-be-answered queries along the lines of “what are the Fog?”No, seriously, they never even attempt to address that. The Fog battleships repeatedly refer to themselves as “just weapons” that are “programmed to obey the Admirality Code” (the Admirality Code being an ill-defined set of rules, first mentioned three-quarters of the way into the show, that governs the actions of the battleships). This leads to the assumption that the Fleet of Fog are just tools, and the true masterminds behind the Fog invasion lie elsewhere; weapons require weapons designers, and programs require programmers. The show hints at human interactions with the Fog—it's suggested that the main character's father defected to the side of the Fog—but the idea lies abandoned and utterly unexplored. The mysteries are never solved. Much of the show is spent fighting a shadow enemy whose nature, origin, and motivations remain completely veiled. Several episodes of the series even have the audacity to end with a taunting overlay of text which reads (presumably referring to the Fog): “Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?” Even after the credits rolled at the end of the final episode, I could still only answer all three with “I don't know,” which spells trouble.All of that might be forgivable if the setting and war were only a backdrop used to stimulate some excellent characterization—such tactics have been known to work. And, honestly, that might be what the series is going for. Whatever else might be wrong with it, it does expend a fair bit of effort (largely wasted effort, but genuine effort nonetheless) trying to explore its characters. Sometimes it comes within arm's reach of the right notes. Like Haruna, an especially cold and vicious Fog mental model, forming a bond with a perceptive young girl who emotionally disarms her, or Iona's struggle to obey Gunzou's orders while knowing that obeying could potentially cause his death. Those aren't bad ideas at all. The show wants, desperately, to have characters who change, and change they do. It's telegraphed at us, and not very subtle, but it's there.The problem is that the impetus for change is missing. The series has flawed internal logic—it presents the Fog mental models as thoughtless machines, explicitly stating that they are governed by programs that cannot learn from past mistakes, adapt, or feel. There is never a convincing reason given regarding why they suddenly adopt emotions and human values. And that's kind of a big deal. I don't care how heartwarming the story of a little girl is, or how charismatic a sailor is—if you put robots who have no capacity for emotion next to them, the robots will not suddenly be moved to tears and love. No amount of emotion can overwhelm something that is literally incapable of feeling emotion. Talk to a wall for a little while and you're likely to notice that, no matter how much and how loud you talk, the wall does not respond. This is because your voice's volume does not alter the complete and utter inability of the wall to comprehend and reproduce your language of choice. Same difference here; the presence of emotion in the outside world can't simply inspire emotion in the void of a computer. That's deeply flawed thinking which would require a workaround within the context of the series. If there were some sort of external explanation provided, even a cheap one like “turns out there was a hidden emotion switch in the Fog after all,” some sense might be made of the situation, but, predictably, there's nothing. Which sucks, because that means that half of the equation is missing. If a character changes, I'd like to know why it's happening, or it's just as bad as having a character who is static and unmoving. If you present characters as machines, and then they suddenly sprout the mindset of normal human beings for no real reason, it defeats the entire narrative purpose of presenting them as machines in the first place. It essentially strips the characters of their distinguishing features, and adds a big tint of insincerity to everything that they go through.The last thing that might have saved Arpeggio would be the battles. It sounds next to impossible to screw up “giant sentient battleships blow each other to hell,” and while good execution of that concept would not necessarily result in a good series, it would at least provide an audience with one reason, lacking any others, to watch it. But even this somehow manages to go awry. Never has large-scale warfare been so boring. The battles, though sometimes as long as ten or fifteen minutes, are dreadfully uneventful, usually consisting of a lot of technobabble about force fields and gravitron cannons and the like. The more strategy-focused crowd will be glad to know that our fearless captain, Gunzou, is the proud creator of such novel naval warfare tactics as “wait for the enemy to fire a bunch of torpedoes at us, then dodge them, then fire back and hope it works.” Battles are regularly concluded with routine and anticlimactic solutions, such as the above, or solutions that appear out of nowhere, such as Gunzou realizing that he can just use some weapon or defensive feature of the submarine that the audience didn't even know existed. Even when things do get dire for all of those aboard, the lack of emotional resonance in the writing assures that the tension level remains at zero.What I'm getting at is that this show consists of misstep after misstep, and they often work together to form seamless spans of pointlessness which would be a waste of time for anyone to endure of their own free will. The lack of world-building and knowledge about the Fog coincides nicely with the characterization issues to form a gaping hole where the compelling internals should be. The dreadful animation and boring battles sync up all too well, affording the audience a chance to stare at a low-stakes game of chicken that isn't even produced well enough to serve as an eye-candy distraction. When all was said and done, I came away with the impression that I had basically watched a show about things who look like girls that do stuff for some reason. And I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone. Gunzou accepts the offer, and embarks on a mission, piloting the Fog submarine to defend humanity using the very weapons that almost brought about its end. Meanwhile, Iona and several of the other Fog mental models appear to be warming up to Gunzou and developing emotions, which mental models are not supposed to possess. It's almost impossible to not note that this entire premise seems like a very elaborate way of creating a scenario in which scantily-clad girls say things along the lines of “you're my captain, please pilot me.” Judging a book by its cover is, of course, wrong, but having thought about Arpeggio of Blue Steel for longer than I ever really wanted to, I don't feel too bad about saying that that initial impression was ultimately pretty close to the money.Perhaps fitting for a story that's partially about machines coming to terms with life, the world of Arpeggio seems to be constructed from the ground up using pure CGI. Everything about it, from characters to ships, bears the obvious stamp of computer generation, and this, unfortunately, is CG of a cheap-looking and ugly breed. If there's one thing the show consistently gets right, it's light—explosions, lasers, computer displays and the like look good more often than not, but that's about the only visual aspect that I can genuinely compliment, and I'm reaching pretty far for that one. Backgrounds and other such niceties don't look so nice, with the ocean in particular often being rendered as a noxious purple-black cloud which bears shockingly little resemblance to a body of water. The design and color choices are poor—the characters all have the same pale, waxy complexion and widely spaced eyes. Add some otherworldly hair and wardrobe malfunctions, and everyone starts to look pretty ridiculous. Add some extraordinarily stiff animation (all characters move with an awkward, jerking hobble, all ships move at a stuttering crawl), and, frankly, you'd be hard-pressed to tell who is supposed to be a human and who is supposed to be a member of the more robotic Fog; they all look equally like paste-colored marionettes. This condition is only worsened by the show's repeated attempts to force its decidedly mechanical characters to do something sexy; it's like watching aliens awkwardly attempt to imitate aspects of human sex appeal, and something about it is strangely disquieting. The core of the show's aesthetic is thoroughly repulsive to no real artistic or thematic end.The music, mostly a mix of cheesy techno and uninspired string/horn compositions that seem tailored to fit the seafaring nature of the series, soars to mediocre heights. Okay, cheesy techno aside, some of it actually isn't too bad, but variety is an issue; this is one of those shows that have two or three songs for battle, two or three songs for dramatic moments, and a few minutes' worth of atmospheric noises that get recycled over and over again. The music direction is sub-par, with tracks often starting too late to have any impact on a given scene, or starting too early and overriding dialogue. Sound certainly isn't the show's worst department—actually, by simple process of elimination, it might be the best—but suffice to say it doesn't excel or help cover the show's weaknesses, as good music sometimes can.Looking at Arpeggio's story in a “big picture” light reveals interesting results in that, at the end of the day, there's really no detail to it whatsoever. The world-building is virtually nonexistent, to the point where I'd venture to say there's little that you couldn't learn about the world of Arpeggio from reading a three-sentence plot synopsis. The show proffers a fairly elaborate premise, but it stubbornly refuses to answer any questions about its overarching plot or setting—not the ones that will naturally occur to you, and, perhaps worse, not even the ones that it explicitly raises. Among the former will be perfectly logical ponderings, the answers to which would be required to achieve a minimum amount of richness in the setting, like: In a war where both sides have advanced futuristic technology, why aren't there any airplanes? If the Fog mental models are nearly indestructible and visually indistinguishable from human beings, why don't the Fog just send them ashore to covertly destroy vital targets? And so on. Among the latter will be vital, should-really-be-answered queries along the lines of “what are the Fog?”No, seriously, they never even attempt to address that. The Fog battleships repeatedly refer to themselves as “just weapons” that are “programmed to obey the Admirality Code” (the Admirality Code being an ill-defined set of rules, first mentioned three-quarters of the way into the show, that governs the actions of the battleships). This leads to the assumption that the Fleet of Fog are just tools, and the true masterminds behind the Fog invasion lie elsewhere; weapons require weapons designers, and programs require programmers. The show hints at human interactions with the Fog—it's suggested that the main character's father defected to the side of the Fog—but the idea lies abandoned and utterly unexplored. The mysteries are never solved. Much of the show is spent fighting a shadow enemy whose nature, origin, and motivations remain completely veiled. Several episodes of the series even have the audacity to end with a taunting overlay of text which reads (presumably referring to the Fog): “Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?” Even after the credits rolled at the end of the final episode, I could still only answer all three with “I don't know,” which spells trouble.All of that might be forgivable if the setting and war were only a backdrop used to stimulate some excellent characterization—such tactics have been known to work.

And I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone."", 'On the surface Arpeggio has a few detractors but if you allow people to finish airing their subjective complaints about how CG never blends well with anime, the harem genre is overused and how they don’t want to be made to remember complicated words like Super gravity Cannon and Klein’s field, you’ll find that Arpeggio has a decent story, a setting with rich possibilities heavily untapped by the anime world, interesting characters and an all but obvious moral lesson at the end.For 7 years the Fleet of Fog, an armada of highly advance naval vessels have taken over earthly waters, with every attempt to reclaim...back the waters by humanity crushed. Chihaya Gunzou is a student at a naval academy who one day is approached by a girl named Iona who introduces herself as a member of the Fog. The first episode isn’t kind to those looking for a subtle introduction as it is packed full of content, the series sense of immediacy may overwhelm some as in only the first episode it entails storyline, introductions, info dumps and even flash backs, all this equals to the series greatest weakness, its length, which I’ll talk about later. Chihaya Gunzou’s fleet is tasked with delivering a new weapon to America soon after with the Fog in his path leading to naval confrontations. The series can also be praised for its sound sense of tactical warfare as the battles take a balanced approach between stratagem and action orientation, the chemistry of Gunzo and his crewmates also deserve praise as everybody is well aware of their objectives and every line a character speaks out deserves just cause and not just for the sake of a seiyuu getting lines, however this is only in combat.The fleet of the Fog being all AIs have a set of logical reasoning they follow called the Admiralty code, which a few of the fog members later on start to question, the series takes a very nice new dimension when this new plot element comes into play that suddenly give these formerly one dimensional characters a lot of depth, all of a sudden characters who one might think were nothing more than opponents the main cast might hurdle over, suddenly are given meaning and purpose, and the storyline sees a vast change mostly for the better. Although some people might complain about the existence of the mental models, the way the battleships take human form, keep in mind that without this the members of the fog would be nothing more than your casual unknown evil group trying to take over the world, their presentation to the physical gives Arpeggio much room to express itself as something much more than a simple war story, the mental model may seem to translate to a light hearted and subtle theme but Arpeggio is quite serious and even takes darker routes towards its conclusion, but as to why the fog members decided to all pick up female archetypes is still something up for debate.A lot of Arpeggio’s issues can be traced back to its length, 12 episodes was not enough for it to truly present itself, the result of this is several holes in explanations and lack of enough back story to keep the series standing firm. A very obvious element that the series should definitely have covered was the origins of the fog, because as it stands “sudden appearance” is not enough a reason to justify their existence, but as its source material is still ongoing, this might be something we can willingly forgive. The presentation of the fog can also be considered underwhelming, a regiment vast enough to conquer all of earth’s waters should at least number in the ten thousands’, the anime does very little to reflect the fog as the dominant force it should be and unfortunately only concentrates on 9 members, larger numbers would have gone a long way in stating the anime’s intent as something to be taken very seriously.The only thing to say about the art style is, CG and cute girls were made for each other, haters be damned. As opposed to most CG you see in anime these days, Arpeggio boasts some extremely high quality rendering, the coloring blends well and they hit the brightness level just perfectly and that’s not even counting in the outstanding character designs. The CG actually compliments the world of Arpeggio so well that it’s honestly hard to imagine the series without it. Also given the ease CG gives animators they rightfully ‘flexed their muscles’, colorful sceneries, radical movements and flamboyant naval combats are all present and executed fluidly. The opening theme ‘Savior of Song’ by Nano is nothing short of sublime, an absolutely riveting and exciting high beat Pop-rock that highly deserves more than one viewing an episode, the part with character montages striking the most interest. The ending ‘Blue Field’ by Trident is an ever so alluring slow and somber beat that melded well with the slow animation of its sequence.The approach the author did in characterization here was actually presenting characters with several diverse personalities, enough personalities that viewers would undoubtedly find a favorite quite easily. The MC Chihaya Gunzou really impresses when in his Command Center, even though you hold no military knowledge watching the way he assesses situations and gives out orders accordingly with commanding presence makes the naval battles so much more interesting, his leadership skills and tactical know how are one of Arpeggio’s brightest aspects, however outside of his CC he’s kind of a dud. Iona on the other hand has very little to give to the viewer, from start to finish all she does is receive, process and carry out her captain’s orders, her apathic nature although going perfectly with the nature of the series still made her hard to like and the show of ‘will’ she performs at the end did very little to refute her. The real joy however you’ll find are with the different Girls of the Fog, AI or not, how they chose to present themselves was both alluring and dazzling and their interactions are a joy to watch, most of this will stem from your initial knowledge of how strict the workings of the fog is but seeing how their characters change really brings a great sense of joy for them.The vast possibilities Arpeggio could have produced or explored if it wasn’t rushed are nearly endless, however Arpeggio should not be viewed as a simple tale of Man Vs. Machine as it incorporates so much more, it is a battle to find out and discovers one true self and meaning of existence, searching for answers to the all-important questions, how coexistence is an important value and Sentient is more than enough of a reason for us all to live together in peace. back the waters by humanity crushed.

Not many people watched it, maybe because they didn’t like the art style or maybe just the idea behind battleships. So, is this a worthy investment of your time? Let’s take a look!Note: There will be minor spoilers.Story (9/10):The story of Aoki Hagane is broken up into two parts. First, is the battle between humans and the forces of the Fog. This is basically the universe it is set in, and our hero, Chihaya Gunzou, somehow manages to obtain the power...of one of the Fog’s submarine, Iona 401, which turns the tide of the battle. What’s great about this is that it Gunzou and Iona are sort of the neutral party. Yes, they are fighting against the Fog, but the army is also hostile towards them because they are afraid Gunzou would use Iona’s power against them, or that Iona might go berserk and attack them instead. This brings about a much more interesting storyline and more tension. Imagine the whole world is against you, and just how intense that would be?Second part of the story is how members of the Fog with Mental Models develop human characteristics such as emotions, logical thinking and relationships, and these lead to them questioning the basis of their actions. It’s this internal struggle between to do what you’re made to do (as weapons), or to follow your heart’s desire. While the development in this aspect is a little cliche, it’s still an awesome story device that makes the story filled with so much more depth, rather than just battles between ships.Let me discuss a little about the battles. These battles are one of the most intense and well made scenes I’ve ever seen, and it thoroughly reminds me of Code Geass, such that battles are not won with sheer power and might, but with logic and strategic thinking to outsmart the enemy. Aoki Hagane does this extremely well, immersing the viewers in that amazing experience. If you liked the battles in Code Geass, expect to find the same epicness here.Characters (8/10)Aoki Hagane is weird such that its supporting characters (with the exception of Iona) get plenty of development. In which case, we see the Mental Models of the fog undergo character developments as they are more exposed to humans. No longer are they just weapons, but more... Human. It is interesting to see how each of them transforms based on different reasons and experiences. The issue here is that some of their transformations, or rather, developments, are not as justified or too sudden.Though, it was really interesting to see these characters interact, because they are not your typical stereotypes such as Tsundere or Kuudere or whatever other deres, as such, their personalities were different.What I would’ve liked to see was perhaps even more development for them. While they did have developments, it felt a little lacking when the story was centered on them.Chihaya Gunzou pretty much remains the same throughout the show. That doesn’t make him bad in anyway, though. He’s an extremely interesting character with the wit of Lelouch and the nobility of the other characters such as Kamijou Touma(putting others before himself).  In other words, you get a character that is smart, witty and puts others before him. What more can you want?The only problem I have with the characters is perhaps of the other crew members. They have so little screentime and development that I can’t even remember what their names are. What is their purpose of joining Gunzou, or what is their personality like, it’s really hard to tell. It’s as if they were there for the sole purpose of operating Iona 401. However, this is not that big of an issue because it doesn’t really hurt the story that much.Sound (9/10)The soundtrack for this anime is amazing. Special credits to nano’s Saviour of Song, the opening for this anime. Not only is it catchy, but every time you listen to it, it is as if you’re ready for a naval battle. The instrumental just fits the anime so well. The ending song, Blue Field, also has that “sea feel” if you get what I’m going at.Additionally, the instruments played especially during the battle scenes fits it so well. Adding so much more tension that really makes you feel as if you’re in that battle itself.Animation (9/10)The animation for this anime is interesting such that it’s done with CGI. As such, you would notice that the characters movements look a bit as though it’s a game. It’s the first time an anime has applied this technique, and I must say it was done quite well. It might put you off at first, but once you get used to it, you’ll notice just how good it actually looks.The animations for the battle scenes are especially well done. Throughout the entire scene, the battles flow smoothly. The explosions are especially well done. It can be split into two parts, Corrosion Impact and High Explosive. Both look just as beautiful when they impact the target.Enjoyment (9.5/10)Initially I dropped this anime because of the art style, but I’m very glad I picked it up again. I absolutely loved Code Geass, as an anime that is not just about battles. Aoki Hagane manages to do the same thing, though not as well as Code Geass (due to lack of episodes) but I’m able to feel that same type of enjoyment. I think I could’ve found a new love for battleships because of this anime... Anyway, every episode is interesting because of the battles and the characters.I especially enjoyed the opening theme, having always listen to it and sing along just because its that catchy.Overall (8.5/10)As much as I like Aoki Hagane, from a reviewer’s standpoint, I would have to give it an 8.5/10. Characters could definitely been developed a little bit more. If that was the case, I would defintely give it a 9/10 or even a 10/10. That being said, I still highly recommend Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio; you will not be disappointed. of one of the Fog’s submarine, Iona 401, which turns the tide of the battle. What’s great about this is that it Gunzou and Iona are sort of the neutral party. Yes, they are fighting against the Fog, but the army is also hostile towards them because they are afraid Gunzou would use Iona’s power against them, or that Iona might go berserk and attack them instead. This brings about a much more interesting storyline and more tension. Imagine the whole world is against you, and just how intense that would be?Second part of the story is how members of the Fog with Mental Models develop human characteristics such as emotions, logical thinking and relationships, and these lead to them questioning the basis of their actions. It’s this internal struggle between to do what you’re made to do (as weapons), or to follow your heart’s desire. While the development in this aspect is a little cliche, it’s still an awesome story device that makes the story filled with so much more depth, rather than just battles between ships.Let me discuss a little about the battles. These battles are one of the most intense and well made scenes I’ve ever seen, and it thoroughly reminds me of Code Geass, such that battles are not won with sheer power and might, but with logic and strategic thinking to outsmart the enemy. Aoki Hagane does this extremely well, immersing the viewers in that amazing experience. If you liked the battles in Code Geass, expect to find the same epicness here.Characters (8/10)Aoki Hagane is weird such that its supporting characters (with the exception of Iona) get plenty of development. In which case, we see the Mental Models of the fog undergo character developments as they are more exposed to humans. No longer are they just weapons, but more... Human. It is interesting to see how each of them transforms based on different reasons and experiences. The issue here is that some of their transformations, or rather, developments, are not as justified or too sudden.Though, it was really interesting to see these characters interact, because they are not your typical stereotypes such as Tsundere or Kuudere or whatever other deres, as such, their personalities were different.What I would’ve liked to see was perhaps even more development for them. While they did have developments, it felt a little lacking when the story was centered on them.Chihaya Gunzou pretty much remains the same throughout the show. That doesn’t make him bad in anyway, though. He’s an extremely interesting character with the wit of Lelouch and the nobility of the other characters such as Kamijou Touma(putting others before himself).  In other words, you get a character that is smart, witty and puts others before him. What more can you want?The only problem I have with the characters is perhaps of the other crew members. They have so little screentime and development that I can’t even remember what their names are. What is their purpose of joining Gunzou, or what is their personality like, it’s really hard to tell. It’s as if they were there for the sole purpose of operating Iona 401. However, this is not that big of an issue because it doesn’t really hurt the story that much.Sound (9/10)The soundtrack for this anime is amazing. Special credits to nano’s Saviour of Song, the opening for this anime. Not only is it catchy, but every time you listen to it, it is as if you’re ready for a naval battle. The instrumental just fits the anime so well. The ending song, Blue Field, also has that “sea feel” if you get what I’m going at.Additionally, the instruments played especially during the battle scenes fits it so well. Adding so much more tension that really makes you feel as if you’re in that battle itself.Animation (9/10)The animation for this anime is interesting such that it’s done with CGI. As such, you would notice that the characters movements look a bit as though it’s a game. It’s the first time an anime has applied this technique, and I must say it was done quite well. It might put you off at first, but once you get used to it, you’ll notice just how good it actually looks.The animations for the battle scenes are especially well done. Throughout the entire scene, the battles flow smoothly. The explosions are especially well done. It can be split into two parts, Corrosion Impact and High Explosive. Both look just as beautiful when they impact the target.Enjoyment (9.5/10)Initially I dropped this anime because of the art style, but I’m very glad I picked it up again. I absolutely loved Code Geass, as an anime that is not just about battles. Aoki Hagane manages to do the same thing, though not as well as Code Geass (due to lack of episodes) but I’m able to feel that same type of enjoyment. I think I could’ve found a new love for battleships because of this anime... Anyway, every episode is interesting because of the battles and the characters.I especially enjoyed the opening theme, having always listen to it and sing along just because its that catchy.Overall (8.5/10)As much as I like Aoki Hagane, from a reviewer’s standpoint, I would have to give it an 8.5/10. Characters could definitely been developed a little bit more. If that was the case, I would defintely give it a 9/10 or even a 10/10. That being said, I still highly recommend Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio; you will not be disappointed.', 'Note:  this review of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: ARS Nova contains minor spoilers.So, how did I like the series?  Well, let me take it by parts:Story:  8/10There were both positives and negatives to the story.On the positive side, I felt the story was very entertaining and brought back memories of Space Opera.  Space Opera is one of the genres of anime that I have lamented seeing very little of over the last few years.  It was a staple of the early years of anime, but is almost gone now.  ARS Nova isn’t space...opera, as it takes place at sea, but it has a similar feel to it (i.e. Outlaw Star).The human race has been isolated due to the ‘Fleet of Fog’, an enigmatic fleet of battleships with awesome weapons that wiped out the human naval forces seven years ago and then… nothing.  So, who are the crew of the Fleet of Fog?  What type of eerie alien creatures inhabit the ships?  Or, since this is an anime, what type of uber-beautiful humanoids females crew the ships?  As it turns out, there are no crew, as the ships are sentient.  Aww, so no pretty girls \uf04c.  Not to worry, the ships sentience can manifest themselves into ‘Mental Models’ that, of course, are uber-beautiful females.Another thing I liked is how the story slowly morphed into a Harem without it really affecting the base story.  Yes, there was the ubiquitous beach scene, and yes, there were several girls liking the main character.  But at least he’s a cool main character.There were a few negatives to the story, however.  First, the idea of alien beings taking the form of humans and then essentially being reprogrammed by those pesky human emotions is not an original idea.  While I won’t state that it is a rip-off of the underlying theme of Robotech, it is still the exact same premise.  The second issue I had with the story is the lack of a back-story.  I think there was about 5 minutes of the was seven years prior.  Where did the Fog come from, how did the rest of the crew get onboard 401, and what actually happened after Hyuuga was sank, just to name a few.Art/Visuals – 10/10For me, the art and visuals is one of the best things about the whole series.  Yes, yes, I know all the naysayers out there who’ve complained about the CG aspect of the ships.  I do not agree.  The CG, as it was used only for the ships, was a major enhancer to the series, rather than a detractor.Sound – 7/10Quite possibly the least favorable part of the series was the soundtrack.  Don’t get me wrong, the opening, “Savior of Song"", is performed by Nano and is quite good.  The endings, as well as the score during the battles scenes are also are also good.  However, the remainder of the series had very minimal sound accompaniment, which is quite possibly the only detractor in the series for me.Characters – 9/10With a few exception, the character development was quite good for the series.  The main character and the fog girls were detailed pretty meticulously, which is something that I appreciate.I like strong, unpredictable main characters.  Gunzou Chihaya was the perfect captain for the 401.  He’s unpredictable, doesn’t say much, but is always is one step ahead of the enemy.   While he is no Marko Ramius (Hunt For Red October) when it comes to submarine battles, he was able to use unpredictable tactics, like the remote launchers to keep defeating the Fog ships.  His style and his composure brought me glimpses of David Weber’s Honor Harrington.I had an issue with some of his crew, however.  What’s the deal with mask-man?  If they’re going to do a mask, at least make it aesthetically pleasing.  He looked like Abe the fish-man from Hellboy.  I did hear one subtle mention about allergies, but I don’t buy it.  The rest of the crew were OK (the engine room girl (don’t know her name) is quite possibly the cutest girl in the whole series) and the black guy with the pony-tail was also really cool.I did like the Fog girls.  Iona is just so darn cute.  I personally like small girls, and she fit the bill nicely.  None of the girls had big knockers, which would have been a real detractor in my mind.  Takeo is funny and cute, but Kirishima seemed to be cut from the same cloth as her, which is most likely why they kept her as a teddy bear.  However, the true jewel, of course, was Haruna.  While not the prettiest face, and her coat is a sick joke, but outside of the coat, she is hot.  Maya was adorable, and I actually liked Kongou – brought back memories of another alien who nearly went insane from emotions:  Khyron.  Somewhat ambivalent about Hyuuga, then again, I personally don’t really see a need for a yuri aspect.Enjoyment – 10/10I really enjoyed the series, and it is currently the best series of the season for me.  Of course I still have a few more to go.  The battle scenes were good, almost reminiscent of Hunt for Red October mixed with an Outlaw Star type of Space Opera, and the non battle scenes were not filler.  They were actually useful to move the series along.Overall – 9/10Overall I give this a 9/10, and I definitely hope that there will be a second season. opera, as it takes place at sea, but it has a similar feel to it (i.e. Outlaw Star).The human race has been isolated due to the ‘Fleet of Fog’, an enigmatic fleet of battleships with awesome weapons that wiped out the human naval forces seven years ago and then… nothing.

Probably, but that's not the case with Ars Nova because it sucks for its other merits.The story is simple. We have bunch of lolis who are secretly battleships, yellow submarines and nice boats. Then there is something about warstuff and tactics and politics and other wise stuff which is presented pseudo. There is apparently a plot in this series too, but I have no idea what it is about so I can't really tell if it is bad or not, but I don't think it matters either.I would say something about the characters, but I...have nothing to add past overwhelming female to male ration.The art is terribad and the animation is about some CGI protocol powered by a b class pu process. Whatever that means.I don't know much about the sounds since I've been watching this series with 4 times speed after episode 3 happened.

I remember some loli making computer noises, so I can't complain."", ""Ars Nova is a pathetic, delusional, self-insert fantasy written by and for people who would be much better off aiming low. Here's the story line from a similar series: an ugly, boring, stinking gamer finds himself no longer having to concern himself with the tedious things in life (such as bathing) and is forced to spend every second of every day playing a computer game. In so doing he becomes everyone's hero and gets all the chicks. Like that series, whilst watching Ars Nova you are expected to supplant your own boring and probably depressing existence with the lead character's. Gunzou Chihaya is a skinny...and completely uninteresting teenage boy who finds himself as the only human being able to control an alien battleship that for some reason is also a (barely pubescent) hot chick. This gives him the power to defy all authority and basically do whatever he wants. What he wishes to do is become a hero of all the girls who dry-wretched at his odour back in highschool, so he goes off to fight the armada of alien battleships that is currently attacking Earth. It is of no surprise that each of these ships is also a hot chick, some being unable to resist him.There is little point discussing details such as animation quality and sound because the basic premise of someone like that being given that kind of power and acting in that sort of way is so absurd that it is hard to watch without wanting to defenestrate your TV. And everything is geared towards selling this fap. The alien ships have artificial intelligence and are designed to function on their own, yet they want him as their captain to order them around. And there's even a crew added to his ship whose only purpose is to gasp at his courage, be awed by his tactical genius, and basically boost him up to being some kind of Captain fucking Stupendous. And this is all done without him doing a single thing even remotely interesting or likeable, let alone endearing to the point of obsession.Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova seems to be nothing more than a loser's desperate wish to gain admiration and respect.

New-generation graphic of rendering character\'s animations was used in this anime which still imperfect but it\'s really shows the contrast of how better it is between old-generation and the new one. The background and the effects also very good, as well as how they adjust the light and flares effects. And I\'m impressed by the camera angle and composition adjusting of this anime which be able to show the meanings and stories out of it. Not just the sound and the context shows the story but the camera angle and scenes compositioning as well.Sound: 10/10Yes, this anime got music composer from the DMC series. Made out perfect soundtracks. Made almost all the scenes more emotional. As well as the opening theme, ending theme and inserted songs by Nano which absolutely perfect. I really love the song ""Silver Sky"", the violin sounds really nice.Character: 9/10Very good characters design and planning. All of them looks nice and implementing with the new-generation graphics, it\'s perfect. Characters\' personality and acting is good.

They always seemed to want to head straight into the action, but this is where they excelled, which I will explain more about in the art section.The biggest problem I had with this story was the fact that nothing was carried through all the way.  What seemed to almost start a political war was quickly ignored by action.  What was about to be an answer to questions that we may never get an answer too (possibly if there is a season two?).Art: 8CG art is starting to pick up in anime, and it has it\'s ups and downs.  Outside of action scenes, the CG art looked great!  I had no problem with the way the series looked, but then things started getting animated, and it the movement looked so forced.  Things such as hair, hands, arms, legs, all moved awkwardly.Action scenes on the other hand were amazing, the CG art promoted the sci-fi feel of the anime as well as the animation looking more smooth and not as awkward.  The final fight blew me away, the art was amazing to look at and the way it was animated... eyegasm.Character designs were great, enjoyed the designs of all the characters.  The only complaint on character designs were to make I-400 and I-402 a more unique.  Their designs were already based on Iona, since they are sisters, but they only added few unique things and the colors they chose for both of them, a pale green and a pale purple, weren\'t too distinguishing.Sound: 6The OP, Savior of Song, is a rock techno mix that works well with the anime, since it is an action sci-fi series.  For some reason though, this OP wasn\'t my cup of tea and didn\'t really stick in my head like most OPs do.  The anime had four EDs, one being the OP, and the other three being Blue Field, Innocent Blue and Our Story.  The EDs weren\'t that bad, I didn\'t mind listening to them, but not that amazing either.  An average OP and average EDs.The background music was few and between, and I wished they had used it more, as it would have helped set the moods at times.  The times they had background music, it was used really well, if they had more, i\'m sure they would have done a great job with that as well.Character: 7Outside of the Fog characters and the main character, all the other characters didn\'t have enough depth to make the memorable.  Who was the one Japanese politician?  Who was the engineer of the ship?  Names easily forgotten on characters that seemed more important than just a side character.  The Fog characters were amazing, and I wish I could see more of them.  More Haruna, more Hyuga, just MORE FOG PLEASE.Character development was nice, since it was a primary theme of this anime.  Seeing the captain, Iona and the other Fog ships develop was nice to see.Enjoyment: 10+Even though the subcategories scored low, this anime was very enjoyable to watch.  The action scenes were great, and the characters that were the main character and Fog were very enjoyable.

Another thing I loved is that this has the set up to be a harem (1 guy, tons of powerful, attractive girls) but doesn't turn into one. There's only 1 love triangle and all the other mental model girls have their own motivations.  The mental model characters are fleshed out very well and think is one of the best female supporting casts I've seen. Iona is probably the best character, with all of the ship mental models following closely second.On the downside,...the actual human cast is rather one dimensional. I don't understand everyone's fascination with the MC Gunzo, except Iona.  This is probably due to only having half a season, but that doesn't excuse it.Also, you have to give this the 3 episode test, because it really doesn't hook until ep 3, IMO. the actual human cast is rather one dimensional.

Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, or just Ars Nova for short is basically an ""Annihilate the ultra-malicious sentient A.I while politicking and surviving at the same time"" story revolving around a small group of naval cadets who came into contact with one of the \'sentient A.I\', went A.W.O.L., sailed off into the horizon in their souped-up alien sub, torpedoing enemy ships into the deep depths and basically gathering more intel throughout their mission.If that...kinda story doesn\'t make you go ""OH MAI GADD, that is SOOOO what-EVVAR"", and that it excites you as you see things \'blow up\', then this might just wanna make you shout out into the dark sky DEMANDING more.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~First off, the story\'s premise is actually pretty interesting to those who fancy these kinda stories, though I must admit that premises such as these are getting increasingly saturated in fictional media. Nevertheless, what manages to salvage this particular one from being ""just another one a\' those"" stories is in the manner it actually keeps steady the element of mystery surrounding the sentient A.Is\' origins and motives for their mass invasion of Earth. The steady introduction of plot elements that explore the nuances of the sentient nature of the A.Is, the political landscape of the remaining human survivors, as well as the goals of the primary protagonist allows depth in the storytelling, which would be lost if the story was just about BOOM-BOOM-KABOOM-BOOMs 24/7, ala. Michael Bay.But, there are a few misconducts here and there, in particular the lack of exploration in the primary protagonist\'s back story (which was implied and stated to carry great significance in the plot), as well as the utilizing of some rather odd (read: \'tropey\') directions in the development of the sentient A.I characters\' personalities, and a very debatable Deus ex Machina scene as the series nears its end.Story Rating: 8~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Artistically speaking, this series is a stunner. Buuuut, it might just not appeal to everyone due to its use of 3D-CGI graphics as its main animation style. The series bleeds with rich, vibrant and vivid coloring at almost all points throughout its run time and the 3D animation frame rate doesn\'t experience any considerable, or noticeable drops. Also, the sheer detail put into the backgrounds, the naval war vessels, the numerous action scenes, the opening and ending sequences, character design variety, ship transformation sequences and so on and so forth is astounding! But best of all, for an anime that greatly utilizes water as the primary background setting for much of its course, the depiction of water in this anime is a downright pleasure to look at, as it just leaves one in a state of awe and admiration at times.And yes, very few to zero animation hick-ups or inconsistencies. So rest easy on that.Art Rating: 10~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~If the art and animation themselves are great enough, then the sound-based aspects of this show are equally as great, for they are nothing short of meticulous and very well-produced. The sound effects are truly a pleasure to listen to, highly nuanced, and very accurate to what actually happens -or might happen- when the conditions are right and the chances for occurrence are high.Notwithstanding that, even the voice acting in this show is definitely up to par, especially with the show\'s main A.I antagonist, the primary protagonist, and several of the side characters. The VAs really bring forth the life and personality of each character and no scene felt stale, amateurish or over/under-acted. One particular standout scene appears as the series nears its end, though figuring out which scene that was is up to you to watch the show till its conclusion.Sound Rating: 10~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Riiiight... Even though the VAs really breathe life and personality into their roles, unfortunately the characters themselves are rather lacking, as many of them -in particular the sentient A.I characters- are based off well-worn tropes in the Japanese anime/manga/gaming spectrum. The main A.I antagonist gets more complex character development later on, but the conclusion to that antagonist\'s character development is rather stale and standard, unfortunately. Despite all that though, there were several scenes that show the willingness of these characters to become more serious as the situation arises accordingly, even though their motives during such situations are still very tropey in nature. Overall, this is easily the weakest part of the series.Character Rating: 6~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Frankly, I enjoyed the heck outta this series. Not only is it intellectually stimulating at times due to the addition of political and philosophical elements, it also excites the more militaristic and battle-oriented side of me as I just simply love to get to know more, or see anything related to the military get referenced in a piece of fiction. Action scenes are everywhere, but nowhere are they gratuitous, as the battles that take place in this story actually impact the story line and help steer it towards its conclusion.And ah yes, THAT OPENING THEME! Easily ONE OF THE MOST EPIC ones that I\'ve seen last year. Woah, just woah. Greatly excites me anytime of the day, save for when I\'m really, really down in the dumps.Enjoyment Rating: 9~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Hah, should I recommend you this? Why, OF COURSE! But, then again, it really does depend on whether you actually like these kinds of stories, and that yes, the tropeyness of some of the characters really does leave one with second thoughts on whether this thing is really something that one can dedicate time to.And now, the final verdict:[9 For Personal Rating]And[8 For Critical Rating]I bid all of you farewell, till next time then. kinda story doesn\'t make you go ""OH MAI GADD, that is SOOOO what-EVVAR"", and that it excites you as you see things \'blow up\', then this might just wanna make you shout out into the dark sky DEMANDING more.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~First off, the story\'s premise is actually pretty interesting to those who fancy these kinda stories, though I must admit that premises such as these are getting increasingly saturated in fictional media.

It looks really nice (in my opinion, although I know that the CG style is not everyone's favourite, it's easy on the eyes and I personally enjoy the art quite a lot) and it has plenty of amazing moments (no spoilers, of course).I won't write a detailed summary of the story, but I will say that the story line of Aoki Hagane is not exactly new - mysterious non-human battleships overpowering all of mankind, except for Chihaya...Gunzou and the rest of the crew of the Fog submarine I-401, Iona, who are attempting to cross the Pacific in one last attempt to save humanity. It's not a huge leap from, to name an anime at random, Strike Witches, especially with the common idea of certain individuals of the Fog joining the heroes.The actual story itself is fairly simple, but generally remains sensible and within the bounds of its own rules (outside of a few plot holes which only arise in hindsight). Instead, the anime tends to focus more on the Fog and their interactions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the Fog (the 'mental models' of the enemy warships) are interesting enough characters by themselves. Even so, the ships are quite obviously the main characters of the anime, bar a handful of episodes which show the human politics which are going on in the background.By and large, however, the humans - and most noticeably, Iona's crew - take a backseat to the other characters. We are barely given a few seconds in the first episode which hint that Gunzou may actually have a backstory, but not even the slightest attempt is made to explore this - and even less so for the other members of his crew, most of whom have less lines than a certain teddy bear. This is a shame, because initially I had the impression that Aoki Hagane was going to be an anime about Gunzou rebelling against the government as much as it was about fighting the Fog.Putting aside the fact that Gunzou and his crew have badly (if at all) explained motivation for their part in the story, I feel that Aoki Hagane does a good job of building those characters which it chooses to build. The ships are distinctive and it's interesting to watch their characters grow over the course of their dialogues.So, in summary: Aoki Hagane is a very good anime, that gives a new meaning to the phrase 'nice boat'. There are many things which it does well, as well as things that it does not do so well. Personally, I find this anime is very enjoyable in spite of the main drawback (which is the lack of character building for any of the human characters), but I can see how it would simply be far too irritating to have so many unanswered questions. So, I will give this anime a tentative 8, because I feel that what it does do is done very well.

The story is very interesting and engaging. While it's not exactly a philosophical deep dive or an intense character study, I did still enjoy it a ton. So for that it gets an 8 from me, purely for being as engaging as it is.The art is full 3D animation. Now though that turns off a lot of people I can confidently say that, once you push aside the gut reaction the visuals are very...good. I think there's certainly room for improvement, but it still stands as one of the only examples of amazing 3D animation in anime.The sound design, especially for the warships themselves is very well done. It's hard to ask for more, so it sits at a 9 for me.Overall enjoyment... I really loved this anime and still do, however with some years of reflection and a bigger repertoire of media under my belt this score has dropped a little since then. It's still a very good overall anime, one that I enjoyed a lot at the time. Buuuuuuut I've enjoyed other forms of media a lot more so this has dropped to a 7 for me.It's worth a shot. good.

Do not watch this anime until you\'re ready to set a new rival on your top 10 best anime list.Aoki Hagane, or sometimes just called as Arpeggio, is a whole new level of anime, simply because of the daring, unique concept. Even in hindsight, it set difference among many other anime, also because of that difference. And that difference itself... is from the heart of anime itself; on its animation. Hence, anime is an animation.Arpeggio of Blue Steel choose a risky yet audacious decision to uses 3D instead of conventional 2D animation....At first, you might ask... Why it\'s that good? The visual isn\'t even that smooth? Definitely not as smooth as some next-gen video games or more high budget Hollywood animation movie...But right on the first episode, you\'ll get shocked. You wouldn\'t expect THIS level of visual when you watch an anime.Aoki Hagane brings you a total jawdrop and mindblown by just showing off their visual effect alone. The visual effect of this anime is superior than pretty much 98% of anime that exist out there. And no, don\'t try to compare the visual to SAO and alike. The visual of Aoki Hagane are STRONG and deliver it in full force, like a powerful shockwave, more impactful than any other visual effect than what (most) 2D animation can bring.With the sheer difference of dimension alone, Aoki Hagane set a whole new level of visual.True that it\'s not as artistic as some other anime, as there\'s actually MANY anime with some gorgeous, majestic 2D visual....However, when you ask any 2D animator to makes missile explosion and laser cannon looks as epic as Aoki Hagane, they can\'t. This is where 3D really send you its impact... Because they looks real. The impact is real.Now, not like I\'m saying the 3D of Aoki Hagane is flawless. It\'s far from that.It\'s great for sure, though there\'s many rough patches and stiff, awkward, weird 3D rendering that looks less smooth than the rest, and sometimes, the 3D kind of fails. However, overall, the visual of this anime still above what many other anime can achieve, and it will definitely going to blows you.Now, to more specific points...._______________________________________________STORY: 8/10Alright... I praise this anime a lot, but I also very critical when it comes to plot, because I highly value plot of any stories....And Aoki Hagane isn\'t the best when it comes to that.Hold on the tomato, people. I\'m not saying it\'s bad. It\'s still pretty good, but really lacking in development.Aoki Hagane start out with simple premise.... Humanity is in brink of destruction when mysterious futuristic OP af ships known as Fleet of Fog attacks us. No one can stops them, and we\'re powerless. Not the most original of premise. We heard many that are similar to this.Our protagonist, Chihaya Gunzou (you\'ll hear people calls him with his full name A LOT more later), lacks a proper backstory. The only backstory that he got is when he meets his ship, Iona. That\'s all.The crew of his ship also.... well, they got no backstory at all. They do appear on the flashback of Chihaya Gunzou. So they\'re basically just exist for battle strategy purposes.The real plot is all about the Fleet of Fog, because surprisingly, even themselves didn\'t know who they truly are and why they exist. Unlike trying to search for the actual plot such as the Admiralty Code, we spend most our time with character developments.Now, I\'m saying that the character developments of this anime is beyond excellent. It\'s really, really good, but we\'re talking about the plot here. And the plot is really that simple... Go to America, they said. It will be fun, they said.The adventure and the battle really brings many enjoyment, hype and tension, and they mostly executed well done. However, the plot are mostly that simple. They just want to attacks or stop our protagonist.So the strong point of this anime, is on it\'s character development... And this is where the plot gets twisted. Because when everything meant to go according to rules, but they get whacked with mysteries and new development, it means the plot thickens.There\'s many ""superstitious"" aspect in the story in contrary that this is a total science fiction. The concept of Mental Mode developing human hearts, gaining ideology and free will? They\'re amazing.But what makes the plot good? It\'s when all of this happens for reason.And that reason stays as mystery, despite the fact that they cover up lots of screen time revolving around this plot. And they did it very well. Simple plot, but all the characters developments are what to bring the twist.The real shocker is really not just from the plot, but how the story goes. You may summarized the plot in simple words, but the actual execution of the story is truly, truly epic. It\'s honestly an amazing experience.So, despite the fact that this anime lacks more complex plot, the story still developed in some wonderfully unusual method._______________________________________________ART: 10/10If you follows up from the beginning, you should know how this section would goes....The art? Absolutely gorgeous.No, not saying it\'s ""gorgeous"" in a way, like, Yuri on Ice or such anime.Aoki Hagane did not practice artistic flattery such as those anime that pays so much attention to their visual. Instead, Aoki Hagane wins from its visual effect.There\'s no additional ""cosmetic"" glittery or any filter or alike, unlike anime such as No Game No Life, which uses such cosmetic filter A LOT and in literally everywhere.Instead, Aoki Hagane wins from raw visual effect. Very raw. It\'s like those that you\'ll expect when you see a totally brilliant colorful sci-fi energy blaster. It\'s nothing cosmetic. It\'s as vivid, sparkling colorful as it meant to actually shows if this happens in real life.I already write about this a lot, but let me put this in emphasis....In term of visual effect, Aoki Hagane wins easily against almost any anime, and can roughly win against 98% of anime that exist out there.There\'s little of anime that can win from their visual effect. It\'s just so strong. The impact, the shockwave, everything felt so real. It\'s truly overwhelming, makes your jaw drop, and your mind melting, exploding into shards of nanomaterial.And that\'s just from the special effect.In character design, Aoki Hagane also did an excellent job. All the Mental Mode are uniquely designed. There\'s EVEN an update to the opening animation during the ""Savior of Song"" that shows that some of the characters actually got a new appearance!But what makes their art truly outstanding? Of course, the battleship.Not saying that those ships, which looks like a pacific naval battleship looks visually appealing, but with all the visual effect? They\'re glorious. What truly makes them looks good is how the animator turn these old overused ships into an original, epic futuristic battleship. It\'s hard to blend these old ships with a sci-fi visual, but they did great on this one.And you\'ll see how truly great they are when they shows up their futuristic power. Oh, expect to be in total awe when you first seen a Super-Graviton Cannon. When the ships transform to some alternate forms, they also looks seriously dang spectacular.Going back to the visual....This anime already knock you right from the first episode with how the Corrosive Warhead Torpedo works.Then the second episode with the Super Gravity Cannon.And the fourth episode will outright break your jaws with... No spoiler, just see it by yourself.I was in total awe-struck when I watched it long ago with my friend, who already finished the anime. He then said that ""Oh, Kongou will going to be far worse...""I stops watching the anime because I only watch it while borrowing his computer...Years later, in 2017, I rewatched it, and this time I watched it until the end....And that final episode successfully destroyed all my expectation. It exceed my my standard. It\'s like that you knows the final episode going to be epic, but oh boi that exceed my everything.Being in complete honest, I just finished the final episode, and I write this immediately as I finished it. So all those epic battle is still fresh in my head.All in all, Aoki Hagane is an art of itself, coming from how all the visual gets far beyond epic in compared to many, many more anime._______________________________________________SOUND: 9/10Alright, this section will be shorter than the rest.The music of Arpeggio (no pun intended) is good. The opening is really nice and fitting to represent the whole series, meanwhile all the other soundtrack are all epic in their own way.Now, I\'m actually being picky. Some of the soundtrack sounds ungodly epic to me, but some are mediocre or not that good. However it pretty much covered by some more superior, notable and epic soundtrack that really brings out the atmosphere alive.The ending song by itself is not the best thing ever, but they exude much ""mood"" of the story. What this anime did, what we can compliment, is how there\'s TWO ending song, but they didn\'t uses it the way they meant to be. It\'s not the typical one-for-half-first-and-one-for-the-half-end of the anime. Instead, they\'re being really fluid (again, no pun intended) on using the music. They uses it depend on how the episode ends, because one portrays more happy, excited and hopeful theme, but the other one portrays something deeper, more emotional and sappy mood.Really, this anime did a good job on utilizing their sound, and it\'s not just from the music. Even the sound effects are great.Wait, why?By themselves, they\'re not that nice. But by looking up again, this anime got one of the best visual effect that didn\'t only looks visually nice, but all the impact felt realistic. You can really feel the strong blows on them. This, paired with a good sound effect, will makes them insane. After all, sound effect IS a must to bring such epic impact comes alive.And honestly, they did great on bringing all the battles alive with their music and sound effect.Sure the music wouldn\'t be as emotional as ""Glassy Sky"" played in Tokyo Ghoul, but really, it\'s not everyday to see an anime did a great job at bringing a naval battlefield alive._______________________________________________CHARACTER: 10/10If I didn\'t hold myself, this section would be the longest of all section. However I\'m trying not to brings in any spoiler here.... Which is virtually impossible, because I need to tells you just how great some of the characters are, and they only get that great after the plot twist.Still, I\'ll keep this spoiler free. Or at least, I wouldn\'t imply it directly.Not every characters in Aoki Hagane are great. Most of the humans are less significant to the story and lacks any meaningful development, even for the main guy himself. There\'s definitely only few times when Chihaya Gunzou really gets a development.However, for the non-human? I honestly didn\'t expect much, but then boom, this anime blast through that expectation barrier.All the Mental Mode of the Fog are so unique, so colorfully diverse, that it\'s so ironic, coming from those who claim (and insist) themselves to only be weapons, no more and no less.Really... At first, you\'ll only sees them as machine, as enemies, as target to beat. But halfway down the series, you\'ll gain such strong emotional attachment, that you don\'t want ANY of them to die.And this coming from a person who watches lots of anime, and often not bothered by the dead of the characters. I mean, sure seeing an important characters died would be a shame, but hey, it\'s all for plot progression!....Then Aoki Hagane hits you like a train, wrecking you whole. Even for me, it\'s really hard to ever sees them as weapons anymore. This anime did far better job at ""humanizing"" the non-human than many popular bestseller novels.You see so many emotions, from those who suppose to be away from emotions. There\'s this SOMETHING that makes you felt happy about them. It\'s like seeing someone grows, opens up, and it just felt so real. It felt so meaningful. It felt so important.It then goes to the point where you don\'t mind if they skewer the plot, as long as you can keeps on seeing these characters. And remember, I\'m someone who always and always focus on the plot. To makes me able to reach this point... I don\'t think any anime ever successfully did.And going back to characters development....Honestly, I want to review each Mental Mode of the Fog because each got their own strong point in character development. But I\'ll keeps this spoiler free.At first, you\'ll see the sudden changes of Takao to be forced. But after you sees more of her, you can\'t help but to support her feeling more than even the main girls. Her ultimate character development is truly eyes-bawling, as she brings you one of the most beautiful scene in the whole anime.Kirishima and Haruna are those who you thought to be ""dang their character development looks so nice, I wish they last for more than just one episode"" and the grants that. They\'re the first to truly be human, truly be kind, which is a big thing to see on this anime.Hyuuga is the first to appear in... well, different format than the other Mental Mode. It\'s not even about difference in her Mental Mode, but it based on her role and her... current ship\'s condition. Her personality makes us can\'t help but feel that she\'s those who actually truly understand human psychology and emotions worked, even to point of fully functional in her ego as well.Maya... You wouldn\'t see it coming when they reveal her true role.The twin ""sister"" of Iona also surprisingly get important near later end of the anime. At first we thought they\'ll be just a plain, ordinary spy ship, but even them shows character development as well.Then Kongou.... I can\'t help but to speak this a lot; Kongou is great. She\'s among many characters that truly brings you attachment to this anime.No spoiler, of course, but you really wouldn\'t expect Kongou to turned the way she is. You\'ll expect her to be just like those badass evil big bad guy character archetype, but nope, you\'re all wrong. This anime do MORE than humanizing her. This anime hits you with gigatons of feels train.In my opinion, I think she got one of the best personality. This is mainly because I can relate with her so much, and it\'s VERY rare for me to ever relate to the villain. Really, I sympathize and empathize with her so quickly, it amaze me. This anime do it in no way ever to call it predictable. Her character development is like a sharp sword that hits from nowhere, but it felt just so natural and... you just care for it so much.Okay but seriously, Kongou is great. You\'ll reached to a point where you\'ll feel bad for her more than to any other characters around.Anyway, to our heroine... Iona got quite of development, and it begins from where she start to shows her free will, then her emotions develops too.What makes her development rivals on Kongou because she originally so robotic, so much sounds not human. She sounds artificial. And to see this anime brings her ""alive"" felt like no other. Her development never forced, and she still sounds emotionless at many time, but if you think with your heart, you\'ll see many times when her heart begins to develops, and again, what amazing is that none of her development ever forced. It\'s subtle and really smooth.All in all, anyway, the character development of the Mental Mode of Fog covers the failure of this anime to brings a prominent human character.Normally we\'ll go with 9/10 since the crew of Chihaya Gunzou seriously lacks a development, but the greatness of many of the non-human adds one bonus point here, as it exceed our maximum expectation._______________________________________________ENJOYMENT: 10/10I\'ll be brief here. Aoki Hagane is truly enjoyable.If I can say, Aoki Hagane is an outstanding experience like no others. It\'s really eye opening, inspiring, changing. There\'s just some emotional hook that makes you really attached, that makes you really appreciate and love this anime, the characters, the battles, everything.For those who loves shonen anime, Aoki Hagane wouldn\'t disappoint you. It\'s not like some boring realistic naval battles, but it also not goes to point of unrealistic shonen physic woosh woosh. It balance things nicely and still manage to makes it looks epic as heck.Truly, the battle is amazing. The design also remarkable. The characters are outstanding and they really did excellent job at some of them. The plot is simple but you just really wouldn\'t expect many of the twist, as the main plot is so plain, but HOW to reached that destination brings you so much unexpected outcomes.Aoki Hagane can be said as one of the greatest anime, and while it\'s definitely not the greatest, it still got so much quality in many aspect that you\'ll enjoy. It\'s really an entertainment that worth your time.There\'s no slight regret after watching this anime. There\'s not even that ""empty void"" that happens after watching many great shows. Aoki Hagane somehow manage to keeps up your hype until the end, makes you demand a second season, but it didn\'t makes you felt down. It makes you attached but you didn\'t feel like losing something after you finished it.And that\'s a big plus point on this anime, in factor of enjoyment.Though of course, taste vary. Some of you might dislike those futuristic battleship, or the characters, or the actions. However generally, all of them got such high quality, so if you got some nice taste, you\'ll enjoy this anime._______________________________________________OVERALL: 10/10Aoki Hagane is a masterpiece. A hidden masterpiece among anime. Its so underrated, that it really shouldn\'t happen. It really didn\'t makes sense how Kancolle can be more popular than this super epic anime. Aoki Hagane got way more quality in everything. It\'s so to see this anime get little attention. It\'s really an underrated gem.If you think on watching Aoki Hagane, you should try to watch the first episode. You think it\'s epic enough? Go to the second episode. Get blown by that? Keeps on until the fourth episode. If the fourth episode completely melt your brain with awesomeness, then continue until the end.All in all, Aoki Hagane is not flawlessly perfect. While I see that many people praise this anime with good review, it\'s not a perfect gem. There\'s many flaws, even on its strong points. However, the overall greatness, quality, and uniqueness keeps on making this anime stays on high rank, and makes it more special than hundreds other anime around.For me myself, I honor this anime as one of the best anime ever. It definitely won\'t reach the top 5, but it\'s good enough to reach the top 10.After watching Arpeggio of Blue Steel, arguably, ALMOST any anime becomes pale in comparison. The only anime that can surpass Aoki Hagane in level of epic-ness is of course Gurren Lagann. But not even Gurren Lagann can reach the visual quality of Aoki Hagane.Still, Aoki Hagane wouldn\'t beat world top tier anime such as FMA Brotherhood that already hailed as one of the best anime. Still, Arpeggio got the epic awesomeness and super fantastic sci-fi battle that lacks in more serious anime such as FMA, so that\'s a strong point in different sector.The visual of Aoki Hagane honestly can only be rivaled by few, such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica. However this is simply because Madoka Magica is such an artistic anime that really focus on vibrant visual. Meanwhile Aoki Hagane shows just how epic all the energy blast goes.So, there does many anime that can go around or even surpassed Aoki Hagane, but I still stand on my opinion to nominate this anime as one of the best anime ever, and that\'s final. At first, you might ask... Why it\'s that good? The visual isn\'t even that smooth? Definitely not as smooth as some next-gen video games or more high budget Hollywood animation movie...But right on the first episode, you\'ll get shocked. You wouldn\'t expect THIS level of visual when you watch an anime.Aoki Hagane brings you a total jawdrop and mindblown by just showing off their visual effect alone. The visual effect of this anime is superior than pretty much 98% of anime that exist out there. And no, don\'t try to compare the visual to SAO and alike. The visual of Aoki Hagane are STRONG and deliver it in full force, like a powerful shockwave, more impactful than any other visual effect than what (most) 2D animation can bring.With the sheer difference of dimension alone, Aoki Hagane set a whole new level of visual.True that it\'s not as artistic as some other anime, as there\'s actually MANY anime with some gorgeous, majestic 2D visual....However, when you ask any 2D animator to makes missile explosion and laser cannon looks as epic as Aoki Hagane, they can\'t. This is where 3D really send you its impact... Because they looks real. The impact is real.Now, not like I\'m saying the 3D of Aoki Hagane is flawless. It\'s far from that.It\'s great for sure, though there\'s many rough patches and stiff, awkward, weird 3D rendering that looks less smooth than the rest, and sometimes, the 3D kind of fails. However, overall, the visual of this anime still above what many other anime can achieve, and it will definitely going to blows you.Now, to more specific points...._______________________________________________STORY: 8/10Alright... I praise this anime a lot, but I also very critical when it comes to plot, because I highly value plot of any stories....And Aoki Hagane isn\'t the best when it comes to that.Hold on the tomato, people. I\'m not saying it\'s bad. It\'s still pretty good, but really lacking in development.Aoki Hagane start out with simple premise.... Humanity is in brink of destruction when mysterious futuristic OP af ships known as Fleet of Fog attacks us. No one can stops them, and we\'re powerless. Not the most original of premise. We heard many that are similar to this.Our protagonist, Chihaya Gunzou (you\'ll hear people calls him with his full name A LOT more later), lacks a proper backstory. The only backstory that he got is when he meets his ship, Iona. That\'s all.The crew of his ship also.... well, they got no backstory at all. They do appear on the flashback of Chihaya Gunzou. So they\'re basically just exist for battle strategy purposes.The real plot is all about the Fleet of Fog, because surprisingly, even themselves didn\'t know who they truly are and why they exist. Unlike trying to search for the actual plot such as the Admiralty Code, we spend most our time with character developments.Now, I\'m saying that the character developments of this anime is beyond excellent. It\'s really, really good, but we\'re talking about the plot here. And the plot is really that simple... Go to America, they said. It will be fun, they said.The adventure and the battle really brings many enjoyment, hype and tension, and they mostly executed well done. However, the plot are mostly that simple. They just want to attacks or stop our protagonist.So the strong point of this anime, is on it\'s character development... And this is where the plot gets twisted. Because when everything meant to go according to rules, but they get whacked with mysteries and new development, it means the plot thickens.There\'s many ""superstitious"" aspect in the story in contrary that this is a total science fiction. The concept of Mental Mode developing human hearts, gaining ideology and free will? They\'re amazing.But what makes the plot good? It\'s when all of this happens for reason.And that reason stays as mystery, despite the fact that they cover up lots of screen time revolving around this plot. And they did it very well. Simple plot, but all the characters developments are what to bring the twist.The real shocker is really not just from the plot, but how the story goes. You may summarized the plot in simple words, but the actual execution of the story is truly, truly epic. It\'s honestly an amazing experience.So, despite the fact that this anime lacks more complex plot, the story still developed in some wonderfully unusual method._______________________________________________ART: 10/10If you follows up from the beginning, you should know how this section would goes....The art? Absolutely gorgeous.No, not saying it\'s ""gorgeous"" in a way, like, Yuri on Ice or such anime.Aoki Hagane did not practice artistic flattery such as those anime that pays so much attention to their visual. Instead, Aoki Hagane wins from its visual effect.There\'s no additional ""cosmetic"" glittery or any filter or alike, unlike anime such as No Game No Life, which uses such cosmetic filter A LOT and in literally everywhere.Instead, Aoki Hagane wins from raw visual effect. Very raw. It\'s like those that you\'ll expect when you see a totally brilliant colorful sci-fi energy blaster. It\'s nothing cosmetic. It\'s as vivid, sparkling colorful as it meant to actually shows if this happens in real life.I already write about this a lot, but let me put this in emphasis....In term of visual effect, Aoki Hagane wins easily against almost any anime, and can roughly win against 98% of anime that exist out there.There\'s little of anime that can win from their visual effect. It\'s just so strong. The impact, the shockwave, everything felt so real. It\'s truly overwhelming, makes your jaw drop, and your mind melting, exploding into shards of nanomaterial.And that\'s just from the special effect.In character design, Aoki Hagane also did an excellent job. All the Mental Mode are uniquely designed. There\'s EVEN an update to the opening animation during the ""Savior of Song"" that shows that some of the characters actually got a new appearance!But what makes their art truly outstanding? Of course, the battleship.Not saying that those ships, which looks like a pacific naval battleship looks visually appealing, but with all the visual effect? They\'re glorious. What truly makes them looks good is how the animator turn these old overused ships into an original, epic futuristic battleship. It\'s hard to blend these old ships with a sci-fi visual, but they did great on this one.And you\'ll see how truly great they are when they shows up their futuristic power. Oh, expect to be in total awe when you first seen a Super-Graviton Cannon. When the ships transform to some alternate forms, they also looks seriously dang spectacular.Going back to the visual....This anime already knock you right from the first episode with how the Corrosive Warhead Torpedo works.Then the second episode with the Super Gravity Cannon.And the fourth episode will outright break your jaws with... No spoiler, just see it by yourself.I was in total awe-struck when I watched it long ago with my friend, who already finished the anime. He then said that ""Oh, Kongou will going to be far worse...""I stops watching the anime because I only watch it while borrowing his computer...Years later, in 2017, I rewatched it, and this time I watched it until the end....And that final episode successfully destroyed all my expectation. It exceed my my standard. It\'s like that you knows the final episode going to be epic, but oh boi that exceed my everything.Being in complete honest, I just finished the final episode, and I write this immediately as I finished it. So all those epic battle is still fresh in my head.All in all, Aoki Hagane is an art of itself, coming from how all the visual gets far beyond epic in compared to many, many more anime._______________________________________________SOUND: 9/10Alright, this section will be shorter than the rest.The music of Arpeggio (no pun intended) is good. The opening is really nice and fitting to represent the whole series, meanwhile all the other soundtrack are all epic in their own way.Now, I\'m actually being picky. Some of the soundtrack sounds ungodly epic to me, but some are mediocre or not that good. However it pretty much covered by some more superior, notable and epic soundtrack that really brings out the atmosphere alive.The ending song by itself is not the best thing ever, but they exude much ""mood"" of the story. What this anime did, what we can compliment, is how there\'s TWO ending song, but they didn\'t uses it the way they meant to be. It\'s not the typical one-for-half-first-and-one-for-the-half-end of the anime. Instead, they\'re being really fluid (again, no pun intended) on using the music. They uses it depend on how the episode ends, because one portrays more happy, excited and hopeful theme, but the other one portrays something deeper, more emotional and sappy mood.Really, this anime did a good job on utilizing their sound, and it\'s not just from the music. Even the sound effects are great.Wait, why?By themselves, they\'re not that nice. But by looking up again, this anime got one of the best visual effect that didn\'t only looks visually nice, but all the impact felt realistic. You can really feel the strong blows on them. This, paired with a good sound effect, will makes them insane. After all, sound effect IS a must to bring such epic impact comes alive.And honestly, they did great on bringing all the battles alive with their music and sound effect.Sure the music wouldn\'t be as emotional as ""Glassy Sky"" played in Tokyo Ghoul, but really, it\'s not everyday to see an anime did a great job at bringing a naval battlefield alive._______________________________________________CHARACTER: 10/10If I didn\'t hold myself, this section would be the longest of all section. However I\'m trying not to brings in any spoiler here.... Which is virtually impossible, because I need to tells you just how great some of the characters are, and they only get that great after the plot twist.Still, I\'ll keep this spoiler free. Or at least, I wouldn\'t imply it directly.Not every characters in Aoki Hagane are great. Most of the humans are less significant to the story and lacks any meaningful development, even for the main guy himself. There\'s definitely only few times when Chihaya Gunzou really gets a development.However, for the non-human? I honestly didn\'t expect much, but then boom, this anime blast through that expectation barrier.All the Mental Mode of the Fog are so unique, so colorfully diverse, that it\'s so ironic, coming from those who claim (and insist) themselves to only be weapons, no more and no less.Really... At first, you\'ll only sees them as machine, as enemies, as target to beat. But halfway down the series, you\'ll gain such strong emotional attachment, that you don\'t want ANY of them to die.And this coming from a person who watches lots of anime, and often not bothered by the dead of the characters. I mean, sure seeing an important characters died would be a shame, but hey, it\'s all for plot progression!....Then Aoki Hagane hits you like a train, wrecking you whole. Even for me, it\'s really hard to ever sees them as weapons anymore. This anime did far better job at ""humanizing"" the non-human than many popular bestseller novels.You see so many emotions, from those who suppose to be away from emotions. There\'s this SOMETHING that makes you felt happy about them. It\'s like seeing someone grows, opens up, and it just felt so real. It felt so meaningful. It felt so important.It then goes to the point where you don\'t mind if they skewer the plot, as long as you can keeps on seeing these characters. And remember, I\'m someone who always and always focus on the plot. To makes me able to reach this point... I don\'t think any anime ever successfully did.And going back to characters development....Honestly, I want to review each Mental Mode of the Fog because each got their own strong point in character development. But I\'ll keeps this spoiler free.At first, you\'ll see the sudden changes of Takao to be forced. But after you sees more of her, you can\'t help but to support her feeling more than even the main girls. Her ultimate character development is truly eyes-bawling, as she brings you one of the most beautiful scene in the whole anime.Kirishima and Haruna are those who you thought to be ""dang their character development looks so nice, I wish they last for more than just one episode"" and the grants that. They\'re the first to truly be human, truly be kind, which is a big thing to see on this anime.Hyuuga is the first to appear in... well, different format than the other Mental Mode. It\'s not even about difference in her Mental Mode, but it based on her role and her... current ship\'s condition. Her personality makes us can\'t help but feel that she\'s those who actually truly understand human psychology and emotions worked, even to point of fully functional in her ego as well.Maya... You wouldn\'t see it coming when they reveal her true role.The twin ""sister"" of Iona also surprisingly get important near later end of the anime. At first we thought they\'ll be just a plain, ordinary spy ship, but even them shows character development as well.Then Kongou.... I can\'t help but to speak this a lot; Kongou is great. She\'s among many characters that truly brings you attachment to this anime.No spoiler, of course, but you really wouldn\'t expect Kongou to turned the way she is. You\'ll expect her to be just like those badass evil big bad guy character archetype, but nope, you\'re all wrong. This anime do MORE than humanizing her. This anime hits you with gigatons of feels train.In my opinion, I think she got one of the best personality.

This anime do it in no way ever to call it predictable. Her character development is like a sharp sword that hits from nowhere, but it felt just so natural and... you just care for it so much.Okay but seriously, Kongou is great. You\'ll reached to a point where you\'ll feel bad for her more than to any other characters around.Anyway, to our heroine...

It has something for everyone:- I cannot think of a subject matter better suited for CG than battle with large naval vessels (see ""The Red Star"" comic books for the parallel of this in print).  And the naval tactics are very clever and entertaining.  I was reminded of how I feel watching Hunt for Red October!- Meanwhile, like the deft and crafty maneuvers of Captain Gunzou, this series effortlessly laces in some shameless and saucy fan service and sexual humor in a way that does not detract at all from the overall story.  Some of the...more sympathetic of fans might even say it is integral to the story, helping us feel the awakening of these new female warship AI\'s.- The story itself isn\'t groundbreaking, but it all fits together and keeps moving well enough to propel the experience forward.- They did not overdo the contemplative, existential stuff.  Which is why when they threw it in it had some effect, bolstered by beautiful art in those scenes and great timing.- And lastly, it is innocent, cute and funny enough that even the lady of the house (who does not get this otaku stuff at all) was into it.  So props to the skills involved, when a show can appeal to two polar opposite tastes.To me this show is a SOLID 9.  Highly entertaining, with a level of execution sophisticated enough that I think even demanding viewers will appreciate it. more sympathetic of fans might even say it is integral to the story, helping us feel the awakening of these new female warship AI\'s.- The story itself isn\'t groundbreaking, but it all fits together and keeps moving well enough to propel the experience forward.- They did not overdo the contemplative, existential stuff.

As it is criminally under rated here on myanimelist, I decided to round up rather than down.I'm going to cut the book report/essay style of reviewing and cut to the chase.Arpeggio is a series that sneaks up on you.  At first, you think you are watching a typical pew-pew style anime with naval ships taking the place of giant robots or spaceships.  But then, when you least expect it, the series does a terrific job of exploring what it means to be human.  As the characters evolve and develop they begin...to grow on you and by the time you feel the series was too short and you don't want to say goodbye.There are a couple of weak spots.  The actual human characters are somewhat underdeveloped, largely because the series focuses on what most of its audience cares about, the ship-program girls.  The male lead largely serves as a foil for the female lead.  Considering the terrific job the writers did, however, this seems like more of a product of only having 12 episodes to work with and the need to keep the action and tensions up, so these are minor complaints.Art is excellent.  I don't get why so many people trash it because it implements some CGI.  CGI, when done right as here, blends well with traditional styles.  Why does everything have to become politicized?So if you're looking for something cool to watch give this series a try.  It's only 12 episodes so you won't waste much time if it turns out to not be for you. to grow on you and by the time you feel the series was too short and you don't want to say goodbye.There are a couple of weak spots.

It's only 12 episodes so you won't waste much time if it turns out to not be for you."", 'Arpeggio of Blue Steel -Ars Nova- surprised me. At first, I wasn’t sure if I would like it given its very apparent use of CGI which I’m generally not a fan of. However my worries were quickly cast aside as the show offers a lot beneath its exterior.The series opens in the year 2039, in which humanity makes its last stand against the mysterious Fleet of Fog. The Fog demonstrates a tremendous advantage in naval warfare and dominates human forces on the sea. This ultimately leads to a severe restriction in communications and commerce by sea, effectively isolating nations on an international level. Some years...later, the vessel I-401 and its crew embark on operations to change the tide of battle. The I-401 crew, referred to as Blue Steel, consists of captain Gunzou Chihaya and his friends, along with Fleet of Fog “Mental Model” Iona; basically, a Mental Model is the essence of a ship with human characteristics: think warships given human form. Iona is an anomaly among the Fog in that she takes the side of humanity, obeying Gunzou above all else.While the premise of Arpeggio of Blue Steel isn’t entirely new, its execution of plot among other developments is where it really shines. Before diving into this anime I was interested in seeing how the battles and conflicts would play out, and boy did they deliver. The show puts a good amount of focus on the naval warfare aspect especially on a tactical angle. You’d be hard-pressed to find moments in which the main cast overpowers their adversaries through pure firepower and strength alone. Most often, they make use of minute calculations and carefully planned attacks to turn battles around. I found this to be a refreshing change of pace compared to other similar series.When it comes to main characters, there is a lot of focus on the main duo of Gunzou and Iona. A young man with a checkered family history, Gunzou is calm and calculating but also has a compassionate side to him. Meanwhile, Iona starts off with little emotion and is more inclined to follow direct orders. The Blue Steel crew, other Mental Models, and some military personnel make up the bulk of the remaining cast. Alongside the tactical battles mentioned above, another major focus of the series is the character development of Iona and the other Mental Models present in the series, which is handled very well as the series progresses. All in all, I can’t say the entire cast is well-rounded: Gunzou’s friends from the naval academy are explored very minimally for instance. But the show does a good job where it truly counts in developing major characters. All the while, there is a focus on the Blue Steel crew’s overarching mission which ties in well to the other elements. As a side note, there are some fanservicey moments here and there which may be off-putting to some, but they personally didn’t bother me much. At any rate, they’re not common enough to really detract from the experience.As far as soundtrack goes, the anime does a good job with the music and has a good number of fitting tunes. Tracks often consist of rock and electronic styles to accompany battles. There are also some orchestral tracks and related tones that show up occasionally. The series offers a good variety of genres to match the mood and intensity of the scenes in the moment; honestly the soundtrack is good enough that I’d like to listen to it on its own. Considering the opening, it is also rock and electronic focused, and it really does a great job at drumming up hype. The endings are much more lowkey but are suitable in their own right; I particularly enjoy the calmness of the second. I feel the voice acting work was of good quality all around, especially for those voicing the Mental Models who really captured the emotional developments of those characters. Also shoutout to Gunzou’s voice actor, his voice is so pleasant to listen to. It baffles me as to why he has so few leading roles even to this day!Now here comes the main point of contention: the heavy use of CGI in the show. It may be a deterrent to some, but personally I didn’t find it to be much of an issue at all. In fact, I think it’s among the best use of CGI and 3D rendering I’ve seen in an anime series, both inside and outside of the action sequences. That aside, the visual effects make battles an absolute spectacle to watch. It impressed me a ton given the techniques that were used.Overall, I enjoyed Arpeggio of Blue Steel immensely. The show isn’t one that has a single defining point at the expense of other aspects, rather it has many strong points: good action, engaging battle sequences, intriguing character developments, and a coherent and reasonable plot to name some. It also has some of the best final episodes I’ve seen in an anime, and a satisfying conclusion given it’s merely 12 episodes. With all that in mind, I consider this show to be a hidden gem that just isn’t watched enough. If one can simply look past the surface presentation and use of CGI there is a lot to appreciate about this series. later, the vessel I-401 and its crew embark on operations to change the tide of battle. The I-401 crew, referred to as Blue Steel, consists of captain Gunzou Chihaya and his friends, along with Fleet of Fog “Mental Model” Iona; basically, a Mental Model is the essence of a ship with human characteristics: think warships given human form. Iona is an anomaly among the Fog in that she takes the side of humanity, obeying Gunzou above all else.While the premise of Arpeggio of Blue Steel isn’t entirely new, its execution of plot among other developments is where it really shines. Before diving into this anime I was interested in seeing how the battles and conflicts would play out, and boy did they deliver. The show puts a good amount of focus on the naval warfare aspect especially on a tactical angle. You’d be hard-pressed to find moments in which the main cast overpowers their adversaries through pure firepower and strength alone. Most often, they make use of minute calculations and carefully planned attacks to turn battles around. I found this to be a refreshing change of pace compared to other similar series.When it comes to main characters, there is a lot of focus on the main duo of Gunzou and Iona. A young man with a checkered family history, Gunzou is calm and calculating but also has a compassionate side to him. Meanwhile, Iona starts off with little emotion and is more inclined to follow direct orders. The Blue Steel crew, other Mental Models, and some military personnel make up the bulk of the remaining cast.

Então, as forças armadas de maior poder, é a marinha. O personagem principal, como capitão de sua tripulação. Realiza certos serviços, para a marinha, e o anime, vai desenrolando-se basicamente nisso. Mas, por quê, Hagane consegue ser tão bom? Primeiro:...o personagem principal, é um gênio estrategista.

Story itself is so far interesting in no way is the anime accurate to them manga so if you were turned off by the anime give the manga a chance there are a few detail that were missed. Art style was a bit hard at time to watch with the blending of Cg effects in with animation. Movements of characters at times did seem fluid and you could tell off the bat that...it was cg. I enjoyed the opening theme a lot and the ending theme the over all sound quality of this anime was decent enough a lot of the voice overs I did enjoy a lot. Character development was a bit wonky but once again not compared to the manga. Overall it was an enjoyable anime that had interesting points and also a good story to boot the idea that this also considered an harem  anime is far from it. The female mental models are not after the main character or even after Iona but they are what the AI thought that ships would look like due to the fact that humans humanize things like cars, boats and planes we generally refer to those items as ""she"" so I give the creator an extra point for that idea alone and my final verdict would be 7.1 score for this anime. Please do give the manga a shot its a lot better than the anime. it was cg.

You see all the people complaining about unanswered questions? The movies answer them.Alright, now for my review.Art style is great. While people complain about CGI in anime, the CGI in here is great. It is not like some anime where CGI kills it. The amount of detail is amazing. Since the show takes place mostly at sea, not much detail to see in the background. However, the foreground has lots of detail. For instance, the ships seen in the story are based off real...ships. Every detail is there from a ladder to the anti-aircraft armament. to a chip in the paint. Even when it shows characters in the foreground and lets say an information panel is the background, you can clearly read the information on that panel. The art is not mind-blowingly amazing, but it fits the shows well and is not an eye sore.Plot is great. People say the plot is non-existent, they are wrong. To be honest, it is a bit weak when you watch the anime alone, but when you tie in the movies it becomes really strong. Character development is strong. People say that the crew of the I-401 gets no backstory or character development while the Ships of the fog get more even though they are side characters. They say that is a bad thing. In reality, the show is not just about the crew of the I-401 saving humanity, but it has a Philosophical twist. The Ships of the fogs are basically sentient beings that can express emotion, but don't understand it. Since they don't understand it, they look down upon it. The Characters develop as they learn about emotions, and each character finds peace in a different emotion. The human characters, on the other hand, get very subtle changes, mainly with their view of the ships of the fog. If you like subtle character development this is a good one to watch.Music fit the anime pretty well no complaintsThe anime was a joy to watch, it always remained interesting and the battles always had unique tactics. By that I mean they didn't reuse the same trump card to defeat every enemy.I should warn you, if you don't like having a show give you only the barebones backstory to just tell you what got you here, then you will be frustrated with this. If it isn't important, you don't know the backstory. What matters in the anime is the present and future, the past is not important. All you need to know is who this character is and if they are friend or foe.While the idea is not exactly unique, it is executed well, but only if you watch the series and both movies. Even the first one, which shows highlights from the anime series for the first half with a small prequel scene, and then takes place where the anime left off when you reach the second half of the film.All in all, if you like anime with some philosophical twist, character development that you actually have to think about and dissect, and don't mind watching this 12 episode series and  two 110 minute movies, you will like this. ships.

Though as watch more this will bother you less and less till the point you don't notice anything wrong with it. The Main characters have been developed...well, the supporting cast is really strong and may as well be mains.An anime that at first glance may seem like it would become a harem but it doesn't and though this may seem disappointing for some it actually develops quite nicely all the characters have their reasons for their actions and they are'nt all after our protagonist.The sound has been done well all the voice acting is great, the sound effects for all the naval battles meet 'quality standards' as to say, I'm sure you would have heard them elsewhere.I personally enjoyed the anime and personally feel there is room for a season 2 but the season closed in a way where it is not needed, Looking forward to the movie.=============================================Review done in my usual category type: (for those who prefer it that way)Story : The story played out in this anime may not be unique but it has been executed very well, Lots of ups and downs and very little down time from the action. So if your looking for advance tech naval strategies this is the anime for you.Art : The art style is essentially 3D Characters, 3D Ships, 2D backgrounds (it seems to be I'm quite sure it is). The 3D characters threw me off a bit during the first episode as the characters movements seemed stiff and not fluent. Though its like they changed artists after the first episode and the art feels better after the first episode. 3D ships well personally I feel this may be the only way to get some really cool naval battle action and its very well done.Indoors and basically when they are not on the ship the backgrounds are 2D the characters may seem 2D during these scenes as well. Messy start but works well as you continue to watch.Sound : Great voice acting, Good sound effects. The sounds reach 'quality standards' as per say. Done really well I'm sure you heard some of the effects used in other things.Characters : The Main characters have been developed well and the supporting cast is also quite developed and strong, They may as well all be main characters in this. Happy to say there is only one love triangle and the other girls have their own reasons for their actions.Enjoyment : Personally enjoyed watching our protagonists solve problems and how all the naval action is done, The story was enjoyable to watch and I'm looking forward to watching the upcoming movie. well, the supporting cast is really strong and may as well be mains.An anime that at first glance may seem like it would become a harem but it doesn't and though this may seem disappointing for some it actually develops quite nicely all the characters have their reasons for their actions and they are'nt all after our protagonist.The sound has been done well all the voice acting is great, the sound effects for all the naval battles meet 'quality standards' as to say, I'm sure you would have heard them elsewhere.I personally enjoyed the anime and personally feel there is room for a season 2 but the season closed in a way where it is not needed, Looking forward to the movie.=============================================Review done in my usual category type: (for those who prefer it that way)Story : The story played out in this anime may not be unique but it has been executed very well, Lots of ups and downs and very little down time from the action.

Although the storyline isn't terrible, it doesn't progress much and there are some things that should have been included in it. So the anime is pretty much about a boy commanding a submarine and a few warships and defeating a group of enemy ships known as the 'Fog Fleet' that have been attacking human ships. One of the things that really should have been included in the anime is the origins of the fog fleet. The only things we really know about the...fog fleet are that they are pretty much a group of super warships armed with weapons that surpass human technology that aim to destroy human ships at sea and the fact that they are given orders from an unknown authority that controls them. Other 'holes' in the storyline include what happens to maya after kongo is defeated and even more important, the fate of the fog fleet. Do they eventually come under the control of Gunzo or do they all get destroyed, wiping out their threat? Regarding Maya after Kongo absorbed her, how come she doesn't reappear after Kongo's defeat from Iona? Furthermore, we don't even see Gunzo successfully delivering the torpedo that has the potential to defeat the fog fleet to USA. The storyline is quite shallow and it lacks some important things, lowering the score down.Art 10/10  The animation in arpeggio of blue steel is outstanding. CGI effects during the battles are especially stunning. It looks boss when the lasers and missiles explode or hit on impact. Character design is also excellent.Sound 10/10 The sound track is great in the anime. The opening song suits this anime very well. The sound for the battles is also done well and it mixes well with the stunning animation.Characters 4/10 I don't really like the characters much in this anime. Most of the time, the characters are really one-dimensional and you don't see much about them because they don't spend much time on the screen. Another thing I find doesn't make much sense is why the characters (except Iona) choose to follow Gunzo instead of staying with the fog fleet.Enjoyment 7/10 Arpeggio of blue steel is a reasonably good anime if you like anime that has superb animation and sound mixed with battle scenes for more interest although it could have been better had it been longer so that there would be more development.Recommendation: Would recommend it, however not as a must-watch anime. fog fleet are that they are pretty much a group of super warships armed with weapons that surpass human technology that aim to destroy human ships at sea and the fact that they are given orders from an unknown authority that controls them.

Post-Apocalyptic fighting for earth against an not very known enemy (Neon Genesis) but with cute girls on battleships and submarines instead of giant frightening monsters (Angels). For the sake of a fair review I won't compare the two series any longer. This series does art fairly well with CG (Considering I myself don't like CG too much). The action scenes seem fluent and the battles seem well made but some times it can be off disservice (When they are talking 1 on 1 it seems a little bit rough with the animation). The soundtrack wasn't that...exciting but did some of its job but other times I completely forgot this anime had a soundtrack. The opening song Savior of Song sung by the YouTube singer Nano who did an excellent work on this track. The characters are quite stereotype like with Iona who is the typical Kuudere and Takao who feels like the typical Tsundere. The main character Chihaya Gunzou is actually some what useful in this story and I feel I like him more then normal male protagonists in this genre.Overall the series can be given a watch considering its episodes only go up to 12 but do not come into this anime expecting something new because most of this show has been done before. I can give it credit for making underwater naval combat intense. exciting but did some of its job but other times I completely forgot this anime had a soundtrack.

Not to mention it is also apart of the action genre to make it much more of a power house. This is definitely one of the animes of the Fall line up you do not want to miss out on for an array of notable reasons. Intriguing story filled with mystery, action packed episodes that will literally glue your eyes to the screen in an amazement, incredible, yet refreshing art & animation and more. One could possibly argue it has the whole package, aside from few little kinks.Story...- 8.5There is definitely a nod to the older generations of sci-fi with all its glory of futuristic advanced war ships with laser beams and catastrophic missiles. Ars Nova is equipped with all of this. The series has a very intriguing setting to say the least, with many questions and  mysteries shrouding the plot of the story. As the synopsis mentions the world, of course humanity, is essentially underseige by an unknown enemy later known as ""The Fleet of Fog,"" which are futuristic,technologically advanced warships, that totally outclass the humans races cruisers. The protagonist is the last hope against these mysterious foes that inhabit the waters all over the world. As for plot progression and overall pace of the anime is very exceptional, not too fast and not too slow. No complaints here and it should very well stay like that.Art & Animation - 9Probably the most notable thing about this series is the art style and animation. The whole anime is rendered out in CGI as mentioned in my blog post about my first impression about the Ars Nova. This can be a hate it or love it type of deal to many, however in my opinion this type of style looks fantastic and sometimes can hardly tell once involved and engrossed in the story & visuals. This gives off a new level of perception and how we view anime. How often do we get to see full CGI episodes? Some usual methods that anime today try to incorporate CGI for example are, slide of the camera in a battle scene (EX: Attack on Titan last episode), aerial view of an army (Kingdom 2, pretty horrible, yes I know), simple cars passing by (Golden Time), mechas in battle (Valrave) and so on. Battle scenes between these vessels of mass destruction are phenomenally done and are extremely exciting and engaging to watch. The color choice and vibrancy or radiance from the ships and missiles are beautiful and visually stunning.Characters - 7.5There are a variety of characters on this show, however the obvious highlight and focus here is between the protagonist and his companion. This type of connection reminds me of a variety of animes in the past that delve in the same type of scenarios. The duo certainly makes itself one of the more notable batman and robin type roles in today\'s anime. One that quickly comes to mind is Outlaw Star and perhaps even one of the more recent animes, Suisei no Gargantia, however it doesn\'t nearly reach as much depth as the for-mentioned predecessors . Character development makes an appearance ever so subtly which is good. Slow and steady wins the race. One thing in this section that hopefully gets addressed as the series progresses is making more time for back stories of the other cast members, rather than the spot light being on the two main characters the entire time. Getting familiar with each character and by adding depth to them really makes for a good supporting cast that can shine and be more memorable.Wow Factor - 9Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio is definitely a thrill ride worth experiencing whether your a fan of sci-fi or action. Each episode thus far is perfectly done and has a good mesh of different genres and elements. Watching intelligently, well thought out strategies unfold and take action really makes the action scenes very suspenseful to watch and literally being absorbed or for a lack of a better term, immersed in the action. Absolutely one of the better animes of Fall 2013.Final Grade - 8.5 -> 8 (AnimeList)+ Intense action+ Stunning animation and refreshing art direction/styleDo I recommend this series to watch? Yes, if you like sci-fi shows with battle ships, high powered lasers, war, enthralling action, refreshing art style, and with an intriguing story.

This gives off a new level of perception and how we view anime. How often do we get to see full CGI episodes? Some usual methods that anime today try to incorporate CGI for example are, slide of the camera in a battle scene (EX: Attack on Titan last episode), aerial view of an army (Kingdom 2, pretty horrible, yes I know), simple cars passing by (Golden Time), mechas in battle (Valrave) and so on. Battle scenes between these vessels of mass destruction are phenomenally done and are extremely exciting and engaging to watch. The color choice and vibrancy or radiance from the ships and missiles are beautiful and visually stunning.Characters - 7.5There are a variety of characters on this show, however the obvious highlight and focus here is between the protagonist and his companion. This type of connection reminds me of a variety of animes in the past that delve in the same type of scenarios. The duo certainly makes itself one of the more notable batman and robin type roles in today\'s anime. One that quickly comes to mind is Outlaw Star and perhaps even one of the more recent animes, Suisei no Gargantia, however it doesn\'t nearly reach as much depth as the for-mentioned predecessors . Character development makes an appearance ever so subtly which is good. Slow and steady wins the race. One thing in this section that hopefully gets addressed as the series progresses is making more time for back stories of the other cast members, rather than the spot light being on the two main characters the entire time. Getting familiar with each character and by adding depth to them really makes for a good supporting cast that can shine and be more memorable.Wow Factor - 9Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio is definitely a thrill ride worth experiencing whether your a fan of sci-fi or action. Each episode thus far is perfectly done and has a good mesh of different genres and elements. Watching intelligently, well thought out strategies unfold and take action really makes the action scenes very suspenseful to watch and literally being absorbed or for a lack of a better term, immersed in the action. Absolutely one of the better animes of Fall 2013.Final Grade - 8.5 -> 8 (AnimeList)+ Intense action+ Stunning animation and refreshing art direction/styleDo I recommend this series to watch? Yes, if you like sci-fi shows with battle ships, high powered lasers, war, enthralling action, refreshing art style, and with an intriguing story. Aoki Hagane no Apreggio: Ars Nova is definitely the one for you.- Azure Sky of AniRaters', 'Ah, Ars Nova. One of my favorite show in Fall 2013 anime\'s lineup and definitely my favorite anime in the field of action genre. Despite the CG animation, which I really don\'t mind, it is one of the anime with good story even though it became somehow less serious after Makie\'s episode (e.g. Hyuuga being dere on Iona) but regained seriousness before it ended. And being a nano fan, I enjoyed Ars Nova\'s opening as well as its other OSTs. You can say it\'s a horrible anime maybe because of the CG animation and/or the story but one thing I can say is that Ars...Nova is unique in its own way and that what makes it special.Now, going to the story..So what\'s Ars Nova is about? Well, you can say it\'s like Code Geass which has a protagonist that came to meet a not-your-normal-girl type and has gone to become like fugitives who is an enemy of both government and ""Fleet of Fog"" and encountered other Mental Models in the series. Besides that, another story in Ars Nova is how Mental Models, take Takao for example, have started to have emotions and feelings for humans like Chihaya Gunzou and with those traits, caused them to be ""defective Mental Models"" and become an enemy of the Fog.Those said, one might think the story is boring and bland but it is not. Well, there\'s few non-serious scenes like the Hyuuga thing but overall, it\'s as great as it gets. The battles, which the series is full of, are top-tier action in Ars Nova way because obviously, it is not like Reborn or Fairy Tail which have constant clashing and fighting everytime whenever there\'s battle but Ars Nova is more of a Code Geass type that has strategies in between battles. Regarding the being defective Mental Models part, there\'s nothing much I could say but as we know, things are developing and most of the time, copes with the environment they are on and that said, I think it\'s normal to them to develop such traits and be defective. And lastly, the ending. Like most endings, what happens after is short but well done. Overall, Ars Nova\'s story makes it worth a watch and clearly deserves a high rating.For the art... Like what I said before, Ars Nova is full CG animation and probably many people would find it bad but in my opinion, it actually suits the anime well. That said, because it\'s a CG anime, the emotions of the characters are overall not that good as there were many times when they are emotionless and doesn\'t fit the scene but aside from that, the ships, the battles, the designs, all were superb and that\'s why I gave it a rating of eight.Moving on to soundtracks..As what you can see on my profile, nano is one of my favorite people and she\'s one of my favorite singers due to her capability of singing in both English and Japanese and with that, obviously I would say the opening as well as the fourth ending was great but seriously, it is great. The background music during battles were doing what exactly their job is and it is to give the action scenes more intensity and make it more exciting and great. Other background music is also as great as others and they compliment the scene well.For the characters, basically, the supporting characters like Kongou and Takao did get the most changes. I\'m not going to say what change they had throughout the show but I guess those changes made the story flow. For our main characters, Chihaya Gunzou and Iona, there\'s not much development except for Iona understanding the humans and that\'s it. They pretty much stayed the same as well as their colleagues which didn\'t have that much screentime. With those said, I guess you can conclude that antagonist got more changes and Mental Models are one of the focus of the story (like what I said).So overall, Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Ars Nova is one good action sci-fi anime. The CG art should suffice and this aspect is the one to decide whether you\'ll watch it or drop it but look at other aspects first before doing so. There are less serious scenes which make them breather scenes if you are having a hard time because of the actions that are happening throughout the show. The show was enjoyable at the very least. It couldn\'t be entertaining like other anime for it being only a 12-episode anime but I think it can be enought to show how good and enjoyable this show is. So if you are looking for an action/sci-fi anime, why not try Ars Nova? Trust me, it\'s worth as it is unique in its own way. Nova is unique in its own way and that what makes it special.Now, going to the story..So what\'s Ars Nova is about?

Arpeggio can be described as a naval anime with a dash of harem thrown in. The characters and storyline are terribly undeveloped. The sentient AI are empty dolls and most of their conversations are abstract musings about free will, love, altruism, etc. Even the human characters are totally one-dimensional, including the protagonist captain. There are only a few rare scenes where the characters are allowed to be eccentric enough to be amusing or interesting; otherwise everyone is almost always emotionless. It doesn't help that the characters are...also computer-modelled. Their movement looks stiffer and more boring than regular 2-d animation.The question of the origin of the aliens and their purpose are not answered in this season so there's no satisfaction of solving that mystery. The CG animation is often flashy and occasionally pretty cool looking and the naval tactics are sometimes clever, but aside from those two points, there isn't much of interest about this show. also computer-modelled.

Would they eventually obtain personalities based on their surroundings and experiences, or would they remain the emotionless brains they were developed to be?The story behind Ars Nova is unknown setting. We don't know where they came from, what they want, who made them or why some are helping while others are destroying. The story played however is no so much the journey that they make but is more so based around how the actions of humans, peak curiosity in supposed, emotionless  sentient machines. It plays itself out really well without itself predictable outside...of some action/battle scenes.Art styles seem to be that of an experiment. CGI out the wazoo. Characters, large object, just about everything that isn't scenery or background is made with CGI. It makes everything animated run incredibly smooth but still lacks in a few places when trying to add emotion to the characters faces. However with the addition of cell shading, only on characters while everything else uses full shades, tones and gradients, they have pulled of the 3D visual effect really well without it looking like the whole thing was made in a simple program like MMD.Sounds here and there can be picked out from common stock model sounds but with the vast majority sounding new, they take action scenes to a whole new level of excitement when combined with the animation style. Music is no let down either with the addition of music in some scenes makes them peak over the rest of the anime through its form of captivating its viewers with how well its placed and used throughout. Opening and ending themes are as well, like the animation style, seem to come across as experiments as seldom do you hear a large amount of both English and Japanese lyrics mixed together. It has three ending themes that it rotates through depending on how the ending of the episode played through which adds to elongated sorrow or enjoyment of the viewer.Character development, or rather for this anime it wouldn't be incorrect to call it, machine development, seems to be the main focus of this anime as their mission is quickly forgotten to the viewers and the emotional factors between the ships and the humans quickly takes over in the spotlight. Some jump forward far too quick for comfort while others progress as a nice pace which makes for many pieces of humor when the two personality types collide outside of battle. Each character's rate of emotional development is played out precisely as it should however, so while you do have your token over dramatizers, tsundere's, etc. They all have specific roles to suit their own personalitiesThe  enjoyment factor for the anime can sometimes vary greatly in some episodes while in others will maintain steady, whether it be high or low, for a couple episodes at a time. Feels from light to heavy, can be found in some episodes and despite them being machines, make for really dramatic and emotional deaths.

Basically, a show that\'s done amazingly and has a huge following is taken, altered every so slightly, and spit out by another person as their own. In some situations, it\'s blatantly obvious when a show is being copied. However, when done right, two shows can have very similar concepts and plot lines, yet still be vastly different. As is the case with Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: ARS Nova, or as it may be more commonly known, Arpeggio of Blue Steel.I mentioned...how this show was similar to another show I watched. In fact, it had only been a month or so since I finished that show that I began Arpeggio of Blue Steel. The show in question is one you may have heard of known as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. Now, how are these shows similar? Well, that\'s as clear as day and it was the one thing that kept nagging me when I was watching Blue Steel:1) Main character is a dark-haired youth who spends his time at the start of the show moping about the current status of the world2) The aforementioned current status of the world is bad, as some outside force is oppressing humanity3) The main character is bestowed a gift or power that helps him combat the tyranny of this outside force4) The main character rallies a group of teenagers to fight alongside him with him as their fearless leader5) The main character uses their superb strategical skills to overcome forces that are far more powerful than heThere are other similarities as well, but those are the main ones that appear in just the first few episodes. And yet, for all the similarities they share, Arpeggio of Blue Steel is not just a carbon copy of Code Geass. For one, Arpeggio of Blue Steel focuses on the naval aspect of war, seeing as how the antagonists are battleships. Also, where Code Geass was a fairly dark show at times, Arpeggio of Blue Steel is much more light hearted, with violence being reduced to ship v. ship combat and blood being virtually nonexistent. However, there are also many negative differences. First, Arpeggio has little to no character development at all. There are some people that seem relatively important, but barely make an appearance. The show focuses more of the development of the antagonists than anything, leaving the actual crew of the protagonist\'s vessel to just be stand-ins and do whatever the captain commands. Secondly, the plot armor for the main character and his crew and any other protagonist is hugely overused. There is almost no concept of danger because the main character is just \'that good\' with strategy. The last big thing that bugged me was that the fan-service was very, very overdone. I always say that fan-service can be a good thing, but when you have butt- and breast-shots of almost every female character in just the opening alone, it detracts from the serious atmosphere the show seems to be aiming for.Overall, Arpeggio of Blue Steel is a good show. It may be similar to other shows to the point where my friends and I call it ""Submarine Geass"", but it remains a strong show that can stand on its own. With a very unique 3D-ish art style and a FANTASTIC opening theme, Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio is a good show to watch if you\'re looking for a break from something more intense, like Attack on Titan or Tokyo Ghoul.Positives:+""Savior of Song"" is a great opening theme+Plot is interesting and easy to understand+Good amounts of comedy, action, and emotion+Animation is colorful, unique, and mostly well done+Music is very goodNegatives:-Only 12 episodes in length (though there are a couple movies)-Character development is minimal-The 3D effect of the animation sometimes makes the show feel as if it were lagging-The show is for the most part boring and uninspired for the first 5 episodes, though it does quickly pick upThis show is nothing special and is nowhere near a masterpiece, but it is an enjoyable ride that will keep you entertained for a short time.And that is why Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: ARS Nova gets a rating of 7/10 how this show was similar to another show I watched.

What happens to an island nation like Japan when they are forced to live local again?  What happens to a nation like China that still relies heavily on seafood?  What about a super far flung nation like Australia?I was expecting an interesting story, but what I got was, unfortunately, a magic...girl harem anime.  You see, in Arpeggio, each ship has its own ""mental model,"" a physical manifestation of the ships AI.  As these mental models come in contact with humans, they begin to question their purpose.  Even this could be a good setup, but it is heavily reduced to just another bland harem anime.Don\'t get me wrong, I like some harem anime.  I enjoyed Highschool of the Dead, I loved Gate, and Princess Lover also had amazing characters.  But Arpeggio is just bland overall.  The interesting backstory is never explained.  The characters are never developed.  And everyone has like one personality trait, even the humans, that they never go beyond.The animation is similarly bad.  The entire anime is CGI, and not good CGI.  The CGI is similar to the low-budget Netflix anime Knights of Sidonia.  But where Knights of Sidonia overcame is poor animation with superior storytelling, Arpeggio does not, leaving the entire experience as an overall disappointment.Do I regret watching Arpeggio?  Not really.  It was only 12 episodes long, and while boring, it was not excruciating to endure.  However, had I known what I know now about the story, I\'d have skipped this altogether.  I want them to develop the world more, but I could take a pass on the characters featured in this particular outing into the world of Arpeggio. girl harem anime.

The director of the anime knows pretty well about all military weapons and also about ships as well. Thereby the story is also one of the only and the best Ship-War animes i have ever seen till knowConsidering the graphics and art of the anime. I must say that it is pretty amazing and request all watchers of this anime to watch it in Blu-Ray 720P quality...or 1080P which will give you the best experience. THe character designs have been dealt with the emotioality of the character, considering tako who is a girl with a shy behavior but represents a kind heart, the character design suits her very well, my only comment would be that if Haruhharu's character design would have been a little more different but then again its my opinion only and the other character have been dealt with properlyNext coming to the voice acting and sounds of the anime i must say that this contains one of my favourite ending songs and the theme song is also great, the animations which make up for the anime is also great. Coming onto the voice acting it is also good, not the best of the best but it is good, the sound effects are pretty impressive as well condsidering the missile sounds and gun sounds.Overall there my final conclusion on this would be a great anime which all fans of military and ships would definitely like and also when you are watching make sure to grab some of your favourite food and sit back and out on your headphones and watch all the episodes in one go, your sure to like this or 1080P which will give you the best experience.

(if there is and i haven't heard of it yet please let me know.) season in the works to remedy that and show humanity fighting back.

Did the Fleet of the mist cause it? Fleet of the mist...what are they? were did they come from? what are they doing? nothing is explained. Some touching moments if it was not already known that the Fleet of the mist were basically invincible.The CG graphics were fine some of the time, but looked clunky too often to say it was well done.The characters are fun to watch, though sometimes over the top. A bit annoying that one second they are trying to...destroy i-401, then the next they are friends.I did end up watching this over a 3 day span, so I would admit I enjoyed watching it.

But I found too many negatives to rate it very high', ""Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Ars Nova is an interesting show in almost every way, even though that interesting nature does not always translate into being particularly good.The most quickly noticable way that Ars Nova is radically different from most anime is the animation. It is entirely animated using cg, a decision that makes it sometimes feel less like a show and more like an unusually complicated tech demo. This is a very subjective parameter, it didn't really bother me much, but some people might find it distracting or off-putting. Watch a trailer, watch one of the trailers for RWBY (they share animation styles), and you...should be able to tell whether you'll like the animation for Ars Nova.The character designs range from uninspired, in the case of the main character or the female lead, to very evocative designs that succeed in instantly giving you a sense of who the character is, like the design for Kongou, one of the primary antagonists. A minor character, Sou Oribe, really stands out thanks to the iron-man style mask he wears, but besides a throwaway line about it being for allergies, it seems pretty clear that it was really just put in to remind us that it's the future. The rest of the characters in the harem (and make no mistake, there is a harem in this show) are not especially interesting, but they certainly don't hurt the show any, especially a character that not long after her first appearance ends up in the body of a teddy bear, which is used for laughs just enough that it stays funny.Normally, vehicle and world design in a non-mecha show is fairly unimportant, but in Ars Nova, we have warships coming out of our nostrils. The design is proficient and very fun to watch in action, where the full cg really shines. It is a huge credit to the production crew that they could get the animation of the people to the level that it didn't bother me, because it meant that there was no uncomfortable moment where things suddenly become cg. The warships seemed a little over-armed, given the hundreds of missiles that get fired on top of the massive WWII style cannons mounted on the ships, but given that the cannons were firing laser beams, it wasn't hard to shut up and enjoy the ride, and my suspension of disbelief stayed firmly in place. The world design beyond the ships themselves wasn't particularly interesting, but it didn't need to be. Maybe a little bit more to emphasize how stretched an island nation like Japan would get if completely cut off from the sea, but again, the show simply isn't interested in a gritty world, so I can get behind the aesthetic decisions.The sound is average to good, with the OP being a highlight. None of the voice actors stood out in any real way to me, with minor exceptions to Manami Numakura as Takao and Yukana as Kongou, with Maya (by Mako)'s “It's a carnival” being a painfully cute earworm. The performances are somewhat hamstrung by the fact that the female lead is clearly being directed towards a very robotic, emotionless performance for most of the show, which makes the moments where she was trying to break out of that difficult to take seriously or value as highly as they deserved. The term “proficient” seems fitting, while no-one sparkled, there was no member of the cast that dragged the show down either. Sound effects during battles were great, although I would have liked the filters messed with a little more to make it feel more like we were listening through layers of water. Also, missing out on a tense scene with an enemy pinging with sonar searching for the cast seems like a true whiff on the part of the writing staff, and a sad opportunity lost. The insert music is all good, with nothing standing out a great deal nor was there a moment where I wished there was music when there was none.The writing and story direction is sadly the weakest part of the show. The overarching theme of the show is the question of if the Mental Models (AI that are both part of the ships and independent from them) are, or even should be, human. It's well-trodden ground, and Ars Nova stays carefully within the path blazed for them by Ghost in the Shell in anime, Battlestar Galactica in television, and tremendously done in literature by The Bicentennial Man, by Isaac Asimov. The high themes are somewhat underwhelming as a result. The story is a rollercoaster of quality, with a strong beginning and a strong end, but a middle-section that both drags, and involves characters and storylines that are sadly extraneous. I liked the characters of Haruna and Kirishima, but their adventure is an unecessary sideline that would have been better spent giving more development to the main characters. Spend more time on the main characters, make the show as a whole better, and give Haruna and Kirishima (and their subplot) their own subplot, with room to grow and really matter in the overall narrative, instead of going and having their adventure and then going back to the main characters without really letting what they just did have any impact on the story as a whole.The show is begging to have massive fleet engagements, but sadly we are teased by the beginning of the show, which has several battles that promise much more, especially given the increasing size of the cast on the protagonist's side, but we never get a fleet on fleet battle, and I felt a little bit cheated by that. If I want to watch powerful teenage girls smack each other around, the mahou shoujou genre is perfect for that, giving me warships and then yanking them away is just cruel.The romantic arc (such as it is) fell a little flat for me, especially given the harem setup that really goes absolutely nowhere. The main character barely seems to have emotions, and given how busy everyone is with the plot, I can't blame him for not having time to manage a harem of warship AI, but again it felt a little bit like the viewers were being cheated by a clear setup without any dramatic payoff. The strength of anime over western television is the ability to have conclusive endings and characters that really grow and change, and the main character did not do this, nor did his romantic arc really have closure.The miscellaneous parts of the writing, like the comedy, went over fairly well, the jokes were well timed and rarely were driven into the ground (shakiin!). There were no cultural references that I found overly difficult to understand, and the subs I used (Horriblesubs) gave me what I needed to enjoy the show.Overall, I thought the show was pretty good, even if it didn't quite live up to its potential. Cut out some unecessary arcs and replace them with more development for the main cast (and more fleet battles) and you have an exceptional show, but as is it's “merely” good. A 7/10, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to turn their brain off and simply have a good time. should be able to tell whether you'll like the animation for Ars Nova.The character designs range from uninspired, in the case of the main character or the female lead, to very evocative designs that succeed in instantly giving you a sense of who the character is, like the design for Kongou, one of the primary antagonists.

When this concerns cute girls that can control powerful battleships this makes it even more enjoyable to watch :) However, for all the consciousness they seem to possess, they can\'t get further than blushing next to the person they have a crush on. What they really are and where they are coming from is not answered in this show, which is a shame. Maybe this is shown in the manga, but since I believe that an anime should be able to stand on its own,...I really feel that there are too many unanswered questions.Character (6):I had the feeling they wanted to imitate the ""genius"" of Lelouche of Code Geass without actually giving him any real motivation for doing what he does. He happens to stumble upon this awesome weapon that decides she wants to follow his orders. He is simply a above average smart boy who wants change (who wouldn\'t want this in this world?!)There was near to none background on most the characters, their motivation and except a bit for the harem girls there is not much character development. So in this area this anime seriously lets down. However, on positive note, I did enjoy the interaction between the (stereotypical) characters and I thought the dialogs were sometimes very funny.Spoiler!!-------------------------------------------The best character of the show was in my opinion Takao. But as I could have seen it coming, these type of girls always end up as some sacrifice for the main character while having their love unrequited. Who in real life would ever chose the motherly, quiet, shy, weak, simple girl over the strong, intelligent, tsundere, feminine, independent woman?! Really, I don\'t know what\'s wrong with the Japanese men\'s taste of women :P-------------------------------------------Spoiler end!!Art (8):The battles were very nicely animated and it was quite exciting to find out what plan (read: awesome animation) the crew would use to defeat the enemy. However I\'m really not a fan of using CG to animate the characters. It looked as if the characters were simply lifeless dolls that can be controlled in computer games.Sound (6):Was ok, nothing special, nothing memorable.

However, unlike most any other, the battles in this anime are done almost exclusively on futuristic Star Wars-esque battleships. And that\'s really pretty much all this anime has going for it. Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, also known in English as Arpeggio of Blue Steel, is a very unique show, at least from a first glance.Story 6/10I\'m not going to lie, the story in and of itself is very interesting. However, the way the plot unfolded was absolutely ridiculous. Twelve episodes was simply not enough time...to properly let the plot run it\'s course. There are so many things left unexplained at the end of the series that I felt almost no compassion despite the very well put-together final episode. Another problem I had with the story was our overall enemy the Fog Fleet. I like unique plots, but I really need a clear enemy, which the story does not do well. It tries to make us understand things from their perspective, but really it made me care much less about defeating them, which is the only real plot of the show.Art/Animation 8/10If this show has anything going for it, it\'s the art. the character designs are very detailed and unique. The main thing you will notice is that the show is done entirely in CG animation. This could have ended very badly, but the CG is done effectively enough that it is not as noticeable as you might think. While the movements of most of the characters look kind of awkward, it\'s the battle scenes where they really make use of the capabilities of CG animation. The Super Gravity Cannon, the decomposing missiles, and even the regular missiles were very detailed and fantastic to watch.Sound 7/10The sound for the most part is pretty generic, and sometimes a little distracting from what\'s going on. The opening theme, however, is very good, and for some reason does not appear in every episode.Characters 5/10This to me is really the breaking point of the anime. It could have been a pretty good series if the characters had been more engaging and realistic. Don\'t get me wrong, there was a lot of what they claim was character development, just not to literally anyone in the main crew. The Mental Models from The Fog change quite a bit, but the development feels very, very forced to the point that it seems they are becoming insanely irrational and emotional simply by being around humans for approximately five minutes. There was almost no development for the main crew, especially our apparently main protagonist Chihaya Gunzo, who doesn\'t change the slightest bit throughout the series. Another problem is not directly related to the characters, but the CG animation, though looks very good, does not allow for much in the way of facial expressions, which takes away from many of the most critical emotional moments.Enjoyment 7/10Enjoyment is a big factor for me, and while there were times I struggled to keep watching, Haruna grabbing her cloak and exclaiming ""Shakeem!"" (Shazam!) kept me pushing through. If you watch this anime without worrying about the plot much, it can be very entertaining when it wants to be, with the love-struck Takao and the energetic Hyuuga keeping things funny and interesting.Overall, I would recommend you watch this anime for at least the humor, and the CG animation. It is also on Netflix, which is very convenient, and also 12 episodes long, so it wouldn\'t take much time. to properly let the plot run it\'s course.

The battles are what kept me watching it, because I know even though it is CGI, the graviton animations were lit.Aoki Hagane tried a few things and failed at it, like trying to be seinen. This show is not seinen. It tried to introduce complex factors (like psychology and long debates over what constitutes human logic) and frankly, failed terribly. But that's not the reason I started watching this show.What it does best is what Kantai Collection failed at. Yes, actual ships fighting each other. The reason I upped my rating for this...anime from a 6 to a 8 is because the beginning of the final battle left that good of an impression on me.The characters are clique in a way, but there are some irregularities in their behavior that don't adhere to their cliques that its not really clique. These types of irregularities are what makes a human a human, and actually did it well enough to be the first anime where I liked all of the cast. And I mean all of them, even that basic too-high-for-you nemesis that stalks the main character and his troupe throughout the series. Yes I hated her, but the ending of the show was good enough to make me like her just as much as any of the other cast.Sadly, the animation is CGI. If it would have been reg 2D I would have been so biased I would have given this show a 10/10. There just would have been so much potential for warping the images just a bit to emphasize immense power. However, the CGI goes well with the ship battles. CGI works well only if it doesn't have to animate people. But at least this anime did it better than Berserk 2016/2017.In the end, a review is only a review and only so much can be said through words. I will personally recommend it just for the effects when the ships are firing the gravitons.

When I watched it a second time I enjoyed it even more.Story - 6:The story is probably the worst thing about this anime, that being said it\'s not bad, just nothing special. The main character has to deliver some sort of ship part to america or something, I honestly forget because it\'s not really that important. They don\'t exactly do a good job explaining why this is important, but I\'m fine with just accepting that it is.The world building is decent, I like the flooded dystopia they made, but...the viewer is expected to just accept that super advanced sentient ships just kina appeared. One of the things I like is how this show explains some of the details of the world. Questions like ""Why are all the ship\'s mental models female?"" or ""Why does Oribe Sou wear a mask?"" are all given 1 sentence responses that felt humorous or sufficient.Other times questions that are pretty important never get answered, most of these have to do with the fog. Where they come from, why they exist, and how they function are left a mystery for the most part.Not every episode is amazing, but more often than not there is something to like, and when an episode is good it really hits it out of the park.When you understand more of what the fog are it kinda takes away the impact from some scenes later in the series, and this is definitely a flaw with the way they set those scenes up.Art - 9:They use 3d models, this looks weird at first, but it allows them to get scenes where the effects and models blend together beautifully. It\'s not perfect, especially with the characters, but I think it\'s a nice to see something different once and awhile.Sound - 10:The opening is one of my favorite songs. The OST has some great tracks on it, and the sound effects for the fight scenes are great as well.Character - 8:Some of the characters feel kinda generic and overdone, but there are a handful of really special characters that are written beautifully, particularly the main antagonist of the series. The side characters are also enjoyable and have enough depth to them to not feel flat without too much focus needing to be put on fleshing out their character.One of the problems the show does face is having a generic teenage main character who is fawned over by many of the other characters. The way they explain it is decent, but that doesn\'t mean that it isn\'t an overused character trope.One of the things I feel is overdone the most is probably the whole ""human emotions are pointless"" thing that the fog deal with, but they handle it really well, and it works for the story, which is why this section isn\'t rated lower.Enjoyment - 9:Like I said before, I liked it the first time I watched it and liked it even more the second time I watched it. The final battle is also one of the better fight scenes I\'ve seen. It\'s beautiful to look at and the build up to it is done really well. The twist that really sets it in motion is also one of my favorite scenes in anime.

Good hooks are established, such as ""What is the Fog?"", ""What happened to the world"", ""What is the government hiding?"". At the risk of spoilers, you never get to find out because these concepts are all hucked out the window promptly to facilitate a cringe-worthy harem fantasy.

It\'s tempting to give the story a 2 or 3, since it did establish some intrigue for me, but honestly, I\'d rather it didn\'t since it delivered on NONE of it, so it gets a 1. There\'s no reason for anything that happens other than wetting anthro-battleship panties for Gunzou, and god knows he needs the help since he has the personality of uncooked rice. Which brings us to...CharacterPathetic. 1. Lets start with the main characters. Gunzou is an obvious insert-self nobody who is chosen by destiny for no reason with no personality whatsoever. He grows tiresome in the first episode and unfortunately spends the entire rest of the show on screen, boring the viewer to death. Go to hell, Gunzou. Iona is an AI loli. Even current day ""AI""\'s like Siri have more personality than her. She says everything in a monotone and, like Gunzou, every time she comes on screen, you can\'t wait until she goes away, and, like Gunzou, she never does. The rest of the cast... is actually characters who could have redeemed a 1 score if we didn\'t have to spend the whole show watching Gunzou and Iona do impressions of used dish towels. Kongou and Maya are a passable villain duo. Haruna and Hyuuga are actually a little bit funny. Takao is an obnoxious stereotype whose motivations make no sense whatsoever but HEY at least she\'s got SOMETHING compared to literal personality-free robots like Iona and her sub sisters and figurative personality-free robots like Gunzou.ArtPeople rag on the CGI of this show, and all I have to say is that if that\'s the best you can come up with to roast this awful show with, you clearly weren\'t paying attention. In fairness, though, the awkward smoothness of the CGI motions really emphasizes how gut-wrenchingly bland and robotic Gunzou and Iona are to create the perfect storm of get these two inanimate pieces of detritus off my screen. I actually found myself enjoying the detail on a lot of the battleship mechanisms and the art made some of the battle scenes actually enjoyable.SoundJP VA work was actually pretty decent. Gunzou and the 3 submarine girls all deliver like monotone robots with no emotions, but frankly that\'s exactly what they all are, so spot on job by the VA crew. OP is a little bit catchy. ED is forgettable. Explosions and other sound effects are actually decent. I\'ll let it off with a 6.EnjoymentAfter you realize the main plot is going nowhere and you\'re going to have to stare at Gunzou and Iona being as boring as possible for the rest of the show, the show rapidly becomes tedium punctuated by a couple panties and some actual decent battles. I don\'t hate panties or explosions, but also demand more out of my entertainment, so I\'ll give it a 3. Maybe if every appearance of Gunzou and Iona was replaced by panties and explosions it could get a 4 but the show would still be pretty bad. My recommendation would be to just look for cuts of the battles from this show and images of the characters in their underwear and you\'ve pretty much absorbed everything of value from it.Overall, this show was a waste of time. The plot is a con and the show should have simply not even set it up if there was no intent to follow through with it. Even as an awful lowest common denominator harem fantasy it fails by forcing you to endure hours of boring pieces of paper Gunzou and Iona decomposing on screen instead of focusing on characters that, I don\'t know, are actually characters. prop up this circus act and have no actual pertinence to the larger questions of the world.

Overall I\'d say this anime is above average overall, but isn\'t really special in any department. The show is visually average, I\'d never describe it as gorgeous but for a show heavily...CGI it\'s not grotesque either. For a show with musical terms in it\'s title I\'m happy to say that the soundtrack was one of the show\'s stronger points imo. The battle themes used were really good especially the ones with a chorus, and I really enjoyed the opening. The central theme was executed well but it\'s offset by a rather disappointing plot. Finally there were a few characters that shined in this show, but for the most part I found most of the cast uninspired or uninteresting. I\'d recommend this show if you have a personal interest in naval battles as some of the sequences were really nice in detail or if you happen to really enjoy stories that center around robots(replace robots with anthropomorphized battleships) discovering their  humanity. However if neither of those reasons are enough for you then you can skip this show without having any regrets.Art:Use of CGI isn\'t the prettiest but is definitely serviceable, and each of the Fleet of Fog ship characters are rather distinct with their designs which is nice. That being said there is never really a moment in the anime that stunned me with visuals or revealed a beautiful background or setting. To be fair most of the time there just at sea/under the sea anyways but this isn\'t an anime to be watched for visually artistic merits.Sound:Some of the battle themes definitely feel they have an epic gravitas to them, especially the songs that contain a chorus of voices. I also enjoyed the opening which was energetic while containing an appropriate message for the show.Story:I was sold on the adventure the first episode described. I expected to discover the mystery between Iona who has come to meet and obey the MC Chihaya Gunzou, I wanted to know why Chihaya\'s father was suspected of defecting to the Fleet of Fog even though he was declared dead. I wanted to know who or what exactly the Fleet of Fog is and what was the Admirality Code for the Fleet of Fog. There is also a potential story to be told in how Chihaya\'s classmates were convinced to join him and Iona as crew members on a fugitive ship that wasn\'t truly at home with either humans or the Fleet of Fog. It\'s mentioned that traveling by land is impossible due to the civil strife, but it ends up just being a one line excuse to keep the setting on the sea rather then ever being seriously addressed. Unfortunately the main plot is considerably sized down in the actual anime, with barely any of the above being explained aside from a few parts of the Admiralty Code. Thematically the story revolves around the value of humanity using primarily the different egos the Fleet of Fog develops as they interact with humanity. While all of the battleships agree that the human capacity to anticipate the future (allowing them the use of more sophisticated tactics) is useful, there is disagreement and friction that arises due to the human emotions they are exposed to. While I was disappointed in quite a few story elements being completely glossed over I did enjoy the message of the anime.Characters:Honestly most of the characters are throwaways. Chihaya Gunzou is a perfect male protagonist with discernible faults that I could find except perhaps that he\'s a bit on the cynical side ""politics are mere sophistry"" (really had to dig for that). The last episode has Iona say to him that he looked pathetic when they first met, but nothing in the anime really reflected that, when it comes to Chihaya there is virtually no development that takes place. None of the other human crew really get any love either. I really wanted to like Iona a bit more but  had a hard time doing that since the only explanation they gave for her being there is that her only order is to follow Gunzou\'s orders. At least her character feels a lot better than Takao who\'s sole motivation for falling into a perverted lust for Chihaya is being beaten in naval battle. Hyuuga is equally pitiful except that her character falls for Iona instead of Chihay. To add insult to injury Hyuuga\'s ravaging happens off screen.But that\'s enough about some of the characters I didn\'t like, I felt that some of the other characters were the bright spot of the show. Kongo was alright as the main antagonist, and was used effectively to move the plot along as well as deliver the shows most powerful themes. I understand this is fantasy but she was definitely demonstrated the main conflict of a weapon acquiring human emotions, understandably rejecting the change she was experiencing while simultaneously feeling anguish and confusion as her comrades abandoned the Admiralty Code and fell into Chihaya\'s camp. I also really enjoyed the humanization of Haruna and Kirishima and their interactions with Makie Osakabe and felt that the episodes dealing with that relationship were done very well.Enjoyment:I definitely enjoyed the show when it came to the action sequences. For the most part the show definitely favors brain over brawn, acknowledging that while the Fog won war due to better firepower/technology, they\'d definitely lose if technology levels were equal due to humans tactical prowess and adaptability. I felt the final action sequence was kinda of a shame because while most battles seemed to be dependent on tactics and risky gambles, the last battle kinda hand-waved its way to explaining the victory of the protagonists. It\'s also amusing how most of the time a fleet of enemy ships comes, everyone but the main actors gets kame hame ha\'d out of existence. I found myself really only enjoying a few characters which seemed a shame. The theme of the story, robots (battleships) becoming human isn\'t original but it was definitely executed above average. I found some of the ecchi scenes a bit off-putting (refer to the scene of Hyuuga humping Iona) but that\'s just my own personal preference speaking. CGI it\'s not grotesque either.

It doesn't have a ton of strengths, nor does it have any really notable failure.  It shows up, does its thing, and then departs, so it's really more a question of whether or not that 'thing' will be up your alley.I can say, in that, it was a good deal better than it had to be, or even then it might have appeared to be.  This show really could have coasted with some CG action and cute ship girls and...found an audience, it didn't really need to reach for anything resembling quality.  But it did.  The writers took it seriously and for that at least I must give the show my respect.The story is, in a sense, fairly basic.  The entire running time is dedicated to a single mission (albeit a very harrowing one with a lot of roadblocks along the way): In a world where the seas have been taken over by hyper-advanced AI entities based on the templates of WWII warships (just go with it) called the Fleet of Fog, Japan needs to send the prototype of a new weapon that could change humanity's fortunes in the ongoing conflict across the Pacific to America, since the Japanese don't have the industrial capacity to mass-produce it.  The team that will be pulling this massive blockade run has a very singular advantage: Iona, aka I-401, a submarine who has defected from the Fog to serve a particular human (just go with that too, it's never explained).The human characters are also pretty bare bones.  I-401's crew has some distinctive visual designs, but one personality trait each at best and no real characterization.  Aside from Gunzo, the male lead, I don't know what they like or dislike or what really motivates them as people.  They're just there to crew the ship and look kind of cool doing it.  Honestly, given Iona's own capabilities I'm not sure they couldn't have been cut entirely from the story without losing anything.The ship characters, on the other hand, are pretty interesting and well studied.  Each of them has at least one good note of personality and a distinct identity, while they also grapple to lesser or greater degrees with the nonhuman nature of their psychology, an issue that actually gets addressed with far more grace than I would have expected.Because, when you get down to it, the conflict that carries Arpeggio of Blue Steel, that makes the show worth watching rather than automatically worth forgetting, is not the conflict between landlocked humanity and the Fleet of Fog – it's the conflict of the members of the Fleet of Fog against their own changing natures.  We understand, fairly shortly into the show, that the Fog ships used to just be ships, operating under the poorly defined Admiralty Code that dictated their actions.  However, something in the fog acknowledged their weakness – an inability to innovate, especially tactically, the way humans do – and some Fog ships spawned human avatars and more individual consciousnesses in order to hopefully gain that.  But, in becoming more like humans, they've also increasingly become prey to human foibles, things that didn't affect them or cloud their judgment before they began their evolution.Every Fog character reacts differently to the, for lack of a better word, humanity growing in them and the other members of the Fog.  Iona, Takao, Haruna, Kirishima, Hyuuga, Kongou, I-400, and I-402 all have responses that differ on fundamental levels, and what they choose to do with their possibly free will as opposed to the dictates of the Admiralty Code is a nearly constant question.For a sci-fi nerd, the questions that Arpeggio raises on the growth and evolution of intellect and ego make the show more than worth its running time, especially since they're handled in a subtle way without a hamfisted answer being rammed down the viewer's throat.  More casual viewers will also probably appreciate the fact that Arpeggio doesn't make this theme and a resolution to it blindingly obvious from frame 1, because let's face it, nobody likes it when we get dull message fiction.And no matter what side of that divide you come down on, it helps that the show is held together with some straightforward goals and, frequently, some good action.  For the most part, the ship battles in this show are great, displays of both visual wonder as ultra-tech weaponry fires everywhere and cat-and-mouse games as Gunzo and his opponents attempt to outmaneuver each other.  It's not exactly realistic, so hardcore military buffs could be put off, but for most viewers that's not going to matter when it's all presented and sold well.The show also has some occasional moments of goofy comedy (especially once Hyuuga enters the picture) and they're pretty welcome.  This isn't an all serious all the time sort of work with a dark tone or oppressive atmosphere, it's mostly optimistic and adventurous.  And when it does go for a serious moment, it's given the buildup and payoff that's needed, so neither comedy nor tragedy spoil each other in this one.That said, keeping a middle-of-the-road stand may ensure that Arpeggio remains watchable for everybody, but it is also probably what keeps the show from hitting true greatness.  Like I said at the start, it's not amazingly memorable.  For me, at least, Arpeggio of Blue Steel passed through without leaving much of an impact, despite both its strengths and its faults.  It does cut corners in a lot of areas, like the overarching plot or the human characters, and it doesn't exactly go all the way with either the craziness of its theme or the high concept of its ideas... it strives to maintain a broad appeal, and I think it does, but it does it at least somewhat at the cost of depth.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 6Character: 8Art: 7Sound: 7Enjoyment: 8Total: 7 (7.2)Verdict: If you want some naval/sci-fi action with themes that are far smarter in concept and more intelligently addressed than they have any right to be, Arpeggio of Blue Steel is the show for you.

So, does that mean this show is good? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryArpeggio of Blue Steel tells the story of Gunzou Chihaya, a young captain that gets unexpectedly placed in charge of the I-401, a sentient submarine that he affectionally calls ""Iona."" Gathering a small crew around them, Gunzou and Iona attempt to survive in a world ravaged by war between humanity and a fleet of sentient ships known only as the Fog.In their own way, Gunzou and Iona attempt to promote peace...between humans and the fog, not by directly intervening in their battles, but by proving that they can live together as friends. While the story of machines that slowly become human is something that has been done over and over and over again, it can still be interesting if the people in charge of the show know what they\'re doing and this show makes the viewers care for the story by putting the characters at the heart of the story. (7/10)CharactersWhat really fascinates me about Arpeggio of Blue Steel is the character development of the ships. In order to facilitate the viewers\' emotional investment in the ships, the story gives them the ability to assume a human form called a mental model, which allows the ships to act as humans without arousing suspicion. However, the more time they spend in human form, the more human they become and they begin to experience human thoughts and emotions.Like I said before, this story has been done a million times in fiction, but I really grew to care for the characters, such as Iona, Haruna, Kirishima, Takao and even Kongou, as they seek to reconcile their newfound humanity with their previous lives as weapons. (8/10)ArtI\'m just gonna tell it to you straight: Arpeggio of Blue Steel is a visual masterpiece. Everything from the character designs, the ships designs, the fight scenes and the explosions is beautiful to look at. Seriously, the visual quality of this show is downright cinematic. (9/10)SoundThe soundtrack of Arpeggio of Blue Steel is something that wouldn\'t be a out-of-place in a high-value Hollywood production. The vocal performances aren\'t so bad to listen to. While the performances of Kazuyuki Okitsu (Gunzou), Hibiku Yamamura (Haruna) and Manami Numakura (Takao) are certainly appreciated, my personal favorite has to be that of Mai Fuchigami (Iona). I think this was the first TV show I\'ve watched with Mai as the female protagonist. Enough praise cannot be given to Mai for her efforts. (9/10)OverallArpeggio of Blue Steel is, both visually and narratively, a masterpiece. While its story is predictable and clichéd, the show makes up for it with excellent character writing, beautiful visuals and incredible music.

(9/10)SoundThe soundtrack of Arpeggio of Blue Steel is something that wouldn\'t be a out-of-place in a high-value Hollywood production. The vocal performances aren\'t so bad to listen to. While the performances of Kazuyuki Okitsu (Gunzou), Hibiku Yamamura (Haruna) and Manami Numakura (Takao) are certainly appreciated, my personal favorite has to be that of Mai Fuchigami (Iona). I think this was the first TV show I\'ve watched with Mai as the female protagonist. Enough praise cannot be given to Mai for her efforts. (9/10)OverallArpeggio of Blue Steel is, both visually and narratively, a masterpiece. While its story is predictable and clichéd, the show makes up for it with excellent character writing, beautiful visuals and incredible music. I definitely recommend it.', 'Arpeggio is one of those shows which will forever be remembered as “that bad CGI anime with the battleships turning to girls”. Well, there obviously are far more things going on in it but who cares; you will remember it just for that, since it is ensnared in the middle of the uncanny valley effect. This is what it boils down to; and in case it went over your head the first time, allow me to repeat it once again: A show with bad CGI and battleships that are in fact cute girls. We live in the post Avatar era, fed up with schools and...moe and THIS is what some create in an attempt to make us give a damn? What were the creators trying to do; spend money for the heck of it? Burning them in a fireplace would have the same effect and would also keep some poor orphans warm. It sure as hell ain’t entertaining, so why not make a few poor children happy?… What? What is that you say? Some people liked it? It has lots of cool stuff in it? It’s very entertaining? Oh, that’s right, silly me, I was talking about myself all this time while writing a review that is aimed at everybody; I should take both ends of the spectrum if I am supposed to be objective. Even though objectivity does not exist. Anyways, let’s go over the several amazing traits of this show which apparently managed to mesmerize thousands of people.1) The manga is good.Well, I guess that is good for the manga. This though is a review about the anime, so it doesn’t really manage to prove anything to its favor, especially when they omitted a lot of scenes during the adaptation. Plus, it’s bad CGI.2) The premise is interesting.You don’t say; the premise is interesting, let’s give it an 11/10 then. And here I thought you are supposed to DO something with it, aside from making it interesting. Wait, what is the premise again? Mankind is prevented from traveling through the seas because magical evil girls which turn to battleships are shooting at them. Since Japan is an island nation, they are trapped there, until a bunch of teenagers with hax powers save the day. Well, that’s interesting if you are still 10yo I guess. If you aren’t, well, it’s completely retarded. Not to mention, a rehash of Attack On Titan, which aired a few months prior to this, so it can’t even be considered an uncommon premise. Furthermore, we get so little exploration of the setting the story takes place in, that it doesn’t even manage to excuse its silliness. A ton of technobabble may have made the whole concept of magic girl battleships more plausible, and it turn would allow better immersion to whatever else there is in it. And nope, there isn’t any. Instead of that you get lots of badly fitting comedy and fan service, which makes it impossible to take seriously a story about humanity being annihilated by doomsday devises in the form of cute girl battleships. So no, besides a couple of interesting ideas you get nothing else.3) The battles are tactical.They sort of are. They don’t simply use raw force but occasionally head for stealth and deception. Until you realize it’s only the lead ship, controlled by a cooldere schoolgirl, that is the only powerful enough to defeat the other evil ships, which are controlled by stereotypical girls of all fetishes. That sort of renders everybody else in the world completely useless. Tactics mean nothing if they are used only by a handful of people and work only against a handful of girly personifications of battleships, only to be proven worthless in the longrun. You are left watching hax superpowers versus other hax superpowers with the illusion of brain power thrown in. Sort of how Code Geass is plain retarded and just pretends it is smart and full of tactics. And of course let’s not forget how bad the CGI looks, which makes the battles even harder to like.4) The characters have internal struggles.Both the human military and the evil battleship waifus occasionally argue and worry about each another. That manages to make the cast 2-dimensional at times. Emphasis on “at times” since they follow the stereotypes pretty close and even their supposed development is predictable. It’s not like they are gray, or complicating, or something more than just not autistic to their surroundings. This detail is hardly enough to make them worthy to remember, especially when there is very little character development to back it up. Heck, the evil waifus get more development than the main crew, which remains as a barely explored bunch of teenagers throughout the series. You have a main character who boasts being super smart, and a main heroine who is an emotionless girl battleship, and that is pretty much all you get. The rest of the human characters offer you even less to remember them about something. So yes, the villains get the entire spotlight, and even then it is hard to like them when the show treats them as sluts in need of a psychiatrist. Plus, ugly CGI.There you have it, a show which did everything wrong and ends up being bad. Have fun not watching it. moe and THIS is what some create in an attempt to make us give a damn?

I was drawn in by the premise--in the future, sea levels have risen dramatically, resulting in large losses of land for the human population. A mysterious army of sentient warships, the Fleet of Fog, emerges and establishes domination over the seas and sets up naval and aerial blockades, effectively cutting off communication between all landmasses separated by water. However, a certain Fog submarine, I-401, has defected to the humans for unknown reasons--the only command in its memory is to locate Chihaya Gunzou and obey him. Gunzou gathers a crew and vows...to defeat the Fog, becoming a kind of Batman-like figure: His actions are technically illegal, but nobody is stopping him.Fundamentally, the story doesn\'t really bring anything new to the table: the future of the human species is in jeopardy, they are fighting against seemingly impossible odds, etc. Despite this, you can\'t deny that it makes for good entertainment. Plus, the submarines provide for dazzling visuals and marvelous battle sequences.That brings me to the art--I know there are a lot of complaints about the CG, and I am a bit opposed to it as well. At times it just didn\'t look...right. It didn\'t look bad, but I feel that traditional animation would have suited this series much better than CG. Having said that, don\'t let the CG deter you--to be honest, most of the time it\'s not that noticeable.I\'d say that Arpeggio\'s weakest link is its characters. We are presented with a rather generic hero: Gunzou is bold, morally righteous, and will always sacrifice himself for the sake of his comrades, yada yada yada. His only real motivation is to defeat the Fog, as for why he is so driven, we still don\'t know. The real pleasure in the character department is the ""mental models"" of the Fog ships--manifestations of the ships\' consciousness in a human body (they also happen to all be female). The Fog ships have personality quirks that don\'t wander too far from generic action anime tropes, but nevertheless it\'s amusing to watch their personalities develop over the course of the series.Overall, Arpeggio was probably one of the most entertaining viewing experiences I\'ve had in recent memory. The story is paced remarkably well, considering it only has 12 episodes. It features a very likable cast of characters that you can empathize with, despite their lack of development. The final episode sets the stage perfectly for a second season, which will hopefully expand upon the characters and story. I\'m looking forward to it! to defeat the Fog, becoming a kind of Batman-like figure: His actions are technically illegal, but nobody is stopping him.Fundamentally, the story doesn\'t really bring anything new to the table: the future of the human species is in jeopardy, they are fighting against seemingly impossible odds, etc. Despite this, you can\'t deny that it makes for good entertainment.

Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 1 - Yokuryuu wa Maiorita,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8888/Code_Geass__Boukoku_no_Akito_1_-_Yokuryuu_wa_Maiorita,"[""September 7 2012 update: For the past few weeks, I have gotten countless messages asking me how I saw this movie online. If you look at my profile, it clearly says I live in Japan and it is easy to conclude that  by living in Japan, I have instant access to anime releases whether DVD release or theater showing.So far I have only watched the first episode and will expand upon this review as more episodes are released.This movie takes place within the timeline of the series . Despite that, at this point, I don't think any familiarity with the TV series...is 95% at all necessary to get into this. References to events in the TV series are not at all referenced to. But due to the distinct geo-political geography of the world of Code Geass it would help a lot. If you watch this without any exposure, you will have some trouble putting some things into perspective in that context. But what is also great is that this movie/oav series touches upon something that wasn't really touched upon in the TV series in that much elaborate detail to begin with which was the EU.The movie starts by briefly summarizing that in 2010CE, the Holy Britannian Empire invaded Japan, took over in a month, and renamed it Area 11. Then it cuts to what is going on in Europe, or EU, one of three super powers along with Britannia and the Chinese Federation. The story centers around two characters, Reira and Akito, two junior officers in the EU. Reira is a command room officer who gives the orders type while Akito is an exiled Japanese knightmare pilot who happens to have elite skills and together, they are fighting the complications that surround them.The reason why this series is distinct from the original TV series not because of the setting, but because of these characters. The characters are very different from the cast and will make it easier for newcomers who no experience with the TV series to ease into. But I felt Akito and Reira lacked the charms of the original cast and don't feel any distinct from any other standard mech character. Akito to me is very cliched and stereotypical mech pilot for most of the movie.  No, he's not the whiny type, but he is the quiet and anti-social homocidial type. For most of the movie, he is a mystery and hard to relate to and understand. By the time the first episode ends, they really start to flesh out his character. The only praise I can give Akito as a character in episode 1 is that he is super ballsy and will take wicked risks to get his mission done. Reira is strong, but she still lacks experience and understanding. By the time the movie ends, you do feel that these characters do have potential to grow and develop.The movie also shows that after 2010CE, the Japanese also struggeled trying to live outside of Japan and were also discriminated against in the EU as well. Even though this was briefly touched upon in the movie for just a brief moment, I felt those scenes really stood out since you have a better idea of how the Japanese were not suffering not just inside in Japan, but all over the world as well, and how far some individuals were willing to go for their freedom. Also, Akito will have problems with other people because of his ethnic background.The art is still in consistent to the TV series designs. The Britannian uniforms still appropriately reflect French and British imperial culture while the EU uniforms had something of a Nazi feel to it with the pants, the coats, the ties, and the hats. It's very hard to tell who is the bad guy in my opinion due to these particular designs.What really shines here are the mech battles. In the TV series, the mech battles were more secondary, while the mech battles are more of the highlight. They are well grounded, strategic, violent, exciting and balls to the walls. I say in terms of action, I say it is equal to the quality of Gundam 08th MS Team so far.The environment equally captures a futuristic look and at the same time also keeps in tune with the European background. You will see traditional French buildings like the Eifell Tower and the Arc De Triumph and the construction is excellent as well.The music works well with the intensity and the dark mood, but isn't really as explosive as the TV series with songs like Colors.I got no complaints about the voice acting. All the actors do a good job of capturing their characters. I don't have any familiraity with Akito's voice actor but he does a good job of being homocidal and anti-social and secretivie all at the same time.In the end, it is just a first episode. It is introducing things and the trailer shows a lot of promise that things will be expanded upon and will be in for a few surprises. I think as a first episode, it is ok and should be open to anybody whether you're a fan or not. At this point, this Code Geass feels more like a mech anime as a opposed to a political thriller like the TV series. I felt what made Code Geass attractive to me wasn't really that well present in this installment so far but as a fan of mech, it pleases me enough. is 95% at all necessary to get into this. References to events in the TV series are not at all referenced to. But due to the distinct geo-political geography of the world of Code Geass it would help a lot. If you watch this without any exposure, you will have some trouble putting some things into perspective in that context. But what is also great is that this movie/oav series touches upon something that wasn't really touched upon in the TV series in that much elaborate detail to begin with which was the EU.The movie starts by briefly summarizing that in 2010CE, the Holy Britannian Empire invaded Japan, took over in a month, and renamed it Area 11. Then it cuts to what is going on in Europe, or EU, one of three super powers along with Britannia and the Chinese Federation. The story centers around two characters, Reira and Akito, two junior officers in the EU. Reira is a command room officer who gives the orders type while Akito is an exiled Japanese knightmare pilot who happens to have elite skills and together, they are fighting the complications that surround them.The reason why this series is distinct from the original TV series not because of the setting, but because of these characters. The characters are very different from the cast and will make it easier for newcomers who no experience with the TV series to ease into. But I felt Akito and Reira lacked the charms of the original cast and don't feel any distinct from any other standard mech character. Akito to me is very cliched and stereotypical mech pilot for most of the movie.  No, he's not the whiny type, but he is the quiet and anti-social homocidial type. For most of the movie, he is a mystery and hard to relate to and understand. By the time the first episode ends, they really start to flesh out his character. The only praise I can give Akito as a character in episode 1 is that he is super ballsy and will take wicked risks to get his mission done. Reira is strong, but she still lacks experience and understanding. By the time the movie ends, you do feel that these characters do have potential to grow and develop.The movie also shows that after 2010CE, the Japanese also struggeled trying to live outside of Japan and were also discriminated against in the EU as well. Even though this was briefly touched upon in the movie for just a brief moment, I felt those scenes really stood out since you have a better idea of how the Japanese were not suffering not just inside in Japan, but all over the world as well, and how far some individuals were willing to go for their freedom.

I felt what made Code Geass attractive to me wasn't really that well present in this installment so far but as a fan of mech, it pleases me enough."", 'This is my First review on MAL so I decided to review the latest Code Geass.This is the first episode of a 4 part movies spin-offs based on the Code Geass series and so far it shows that it is a very promising spin-off that will hopfully do the Code Geass franchise justice.Art and Animation – 10The animation in this anime is just pure gorgeous eye candy by far exceeding that of the original series, the CGI animation in the mech battles are just incredible, the mecha’s truly feel like metal clashing together and the camera angles give an amazing presentation of balls to the...walls violence while still strategic just like you expect from Code Geass. The art also does an incredible job presenting a futuristic look while still holding a certain European culture around it. Overall the animation is just flawless.Story and presentation – 9Despite that this is a spin-off, you don’t actually have to watch the main series to follow it. It is very well explained how the brittanian empire has taken over Japan renaming it as the colony area 11 and how the empire is now at warr with the E.U, what this anime does a great job at presenting is how the E.U is nothing better than the brittanian empire. Even there Eleven’s are being discriminated and stuggle to life there, the hierarchy between the Europeans and elevens is very well presented and a great starting point to build up. So overall the story and presentation are very well managed and easy to get into.Characters – 6This is where I feel this spin-off is very lacking in, the code geass series is very well known for it’s extremely iconic and indepth characters from Lelouch, Suzaku, Kallen to Jeremiah, Euphie and Anya.Most of the characters in Akito the Exiled just lack the charisma that the original cast had, especially Akito for that matter. While Lelouch was an extremely deep and charismatic individual Akito barely seems to have any kind of personality, he feels like a very cliché strong but silent type character, Reira doesn’t really feel that unique either and rather just…standard. However considering this was still the first part I am pretty sure that there will be a lot of character development in the future episodes especially for Akito because despite Akito being a character without personality he has something psychological and suicidal behind him that could be interesting to build up on in the future.The characters I did really enjoy tho where the three anarchistic elevens Ryo, Ayano and Yukiya. Especially Yukiya is my favorite character so far, a very devious, sly and intelligent villain.Overall – 8This anime is a good first impression for future episodes, the animation is beautifull, the storyline is very well presented and it overall looks like a spin-off that can match the series, however I am very disappointed with the lackluster characters and hope that they get more development in the future. walls violence while still strategic just like you expect from Code Geass.

Season 1 remains my favorite television series to date, and R2 was still pretty fun and equally ambitious. You can imagine how intrigued I was when I heard that it got a sub-series that was meant to explore some new territory in the lore of the franchise. After all, there is so much we don't know, like the origins of geass or what exactly happened between the 1-year gap between the events of R1 and R2, or even delving into the EU, which was never actually shown...in the main series. Unfortunately, as you will see throughout this review, I was disappointed by it, in part due to one reason: Akito the Exiled has no ambition.This film has no drive. It simply feels like an addition to a franchise rather than a brand new installment that explores uncharted territory. Whether or not you liked the original series, you have to admit that it had a lot of ambition. It tried to be fun, humorous, and nuanced at the same time, and it balanced each part well. Whether or not you think the attempt worked is up to interpretation. This doesn't have that, and it shows given how boring this slop is.If there's anything I can compliment about Akito, it's that it treats the franchise with respect. It never does anything to jeopardize the continuity of the main series, and it expands on one key thing I wanted to know about: the EU. Also, the first half doesn't have many story issues. Simply, after a battle in which the only survivor is Akito, he needs up with one of his superiors, Leila (the one in charge of her main crew and the operation), and they head to a party in which he threatens a scumbag who was mistreating the one he is meant to guard (Lelia). Little goes on here aside from an action scene but that's alright; it's just the first 24 minutes.The second half is what really killed the story. There’s this rebel trio who blows up their douchey superiors for seemingly no reason. I mean it, we don't know why they did that aside from possibly not wanting to take orders. Then, they attack or protagonists for seemingly no reason. Did they believe they were defenseless officials? Did they know those guys were armed and ready? We sure don't know what was going through their heads. They get captured by Leila (she never explains why she spared them), and then a guy killing his boss and potentially becoming an antagonist in the future. He grasses him, but we don't know what it does aside from the boss killing himself afterward. The lines of taking a trip don't help matters either. We end on Akito being edgy and saying “I died once” and that's a wrap. I know you can't really get much out of 50 minutes, no can you always put a lot into it, especially when it's introductory, but that's hardly an excuse for what happened here.Let’s start with Leila since she’s the first MC we see. She's a bland “righteous princess and poor people activist” archetype that happens to know some self-defense techniques. Conversely, Akito is surprisingly malevolent, even by Code Geass standards, with his first scene showing him in a bloodthirsty rampage and many subsequent scenes having him sport the most wicked of evil grins. Other than that, he’s pretty standard, and the last scene really paints him as edgy. Neither of these two really have much to them, but they're better than the other characters who are literally archetypes as nothing else, like Leila’s older “brother” or the geass guy towards the end who makes his master kill himself. There’s also the heavily enteric rebel trio who apparently want a place to belong, but their actions are clearly not indicative of that. What a dimensionless bunch.As for the character art, while it is missing the shine that the characters in the original do, making these guys more akin to what comes out of Light Novels, their designs feel strictly “Code Geass” with the even more exaggerated version of the already exaggerative CLAMP style. Unfortunately, unless someone is disarming someone hand-to-hand, don't expect much to any movement with these characters. The most you'll usually get is a little bit of walking. Calling this animated is a formality at this point, at least for the characters.Now for the elephant in the room: the CGI. The CGI Knightmares tend to look terrible here, and are equally poor in terms of integration; some of the background vehicles aren't an exception either. The mecha designs mostly remain the same, but the new ones from the first battle are awful, especially the eyes that make the Knightmare that Akito pilots look non-threatening. I appreciate the detail that went into the mechs of the first battle, but it doesn't work that well. The mechs in the second battle look like they were ripped from a cel-shaded GameCube game from 2003, and it is also poorly integrated, chief among them being what one of the rebels fights to take out most of the soldiers surrounding Leila before Akito steps in. The CGI explosions look hideous as well. Hopefully, the subsequent films improve the CGI integration and Knightmare designs.The directing in this film is also pretty terrible, especially for the action scenes. The camera looks like it was operated by a schizophrenic cameraman, which makes it difficult to process what's going on at times. Even outside of battle, sometimes the camera doesn't keep up that well, notably in one instance in the beginning before we heard back to the first battle. However, I do like the cockpit screens. Still, all in all, whenever there is actual animation, it's done with poorly integrated CGI mechs that we can't properly see fighting due to the camera, unlike in the original series. In fact, you'd think they'd be able to make even better fights on a 50-minute film than on a 25 episode television series (applied to either season of Geass) but I guess not.The music was not done by Kotaro Nakagawa this time around, and it honestly shows. Someone else was in charge, and while the music does feel reminiscent of the feel of the amazing tracks of the main series, it's shockingly bland. There's this one piece with the crazy trumpets used in an action scene, but it doesn't fit well at all with either the action of the scene or the atmosphere surrounding it. The ED theme is also pretty bland, but EDs aren't really the franchise’s strong suit, unlike the OPs and OSTs, so I guess that's to be expected.Ultimately, this was an unremarkable and poorly executed project, and I desperately hope this sub-series doesn't get much worse. Its characters are as dull and lifeless as its narrative, the action is terribly handled, and overall I'm left without a reason to care. Say what you will about the original series (and I have), but it always tried its damnedest to give you a reason to be engaged, whilst this right here is the epitome, nay, the embodiment of being sub-par! in the main series.

The staffs are all European (as far as we know) but the pilots are all Japanese. Their Knightmare Frame is solely comprised of Alexander, a state of the art KF. In addition of full range of arsenals capable of either melee or long range battles, this KF also has feature to transform from quadrupedal to bipedal to allows mobility in all terrains. This...amazing KF are entrusted to the hands of ""lowly elevens"" pilot, so it\'s safe to assume that they are quite competent or even elite pilots. But then the battle unfolded and somehow rather than fully utilizing their KF abilities, they preferred to suicide bombed themselves one after another. Just when we thought they would lose, the scene shifted to our protagonist Akito, he easily demolished several enemy squads all by himself with other worldly ninja and acrobatic skills.Going any further would spoil the story, so let\'s begin scoring- Art : 8Supposed to be 9 if they didn\'t CG the KF- Story : 2There\'s nothing important going on (or explained) as far as the Geass universe considered. Plot inconsistencies are numerous. There\'s racism and discrimination against elevens for no apparent purposes (the enemy of my enemy is my ally logic doesn\'t work here). These elevens took refuge in a land some 10000 km away (awesome, how did they manage such travel) from their homeland just to receive the same treatments they got under Britania occupation, making it pointless.- Sound : 6It was okay- Character : 2One of the most important factor of Geass was the characters. Just throwing random characters and Knightmare Frame won\'t make it as good as Geass. At this moment I can only score it 2 for characters random behaviors.- Enjoyment : 4Honestly speaking, it was a waste of time. I suggest to watch it in batch when more episodes are released.- Overall : 5scores are subject to change when more episodes are released amazing KF are entrusted to the hands of ""lowly elevens"" pilot, so it\'s safe to assume that they are quite competent or even elite pilots.

And who would i rather marry, Leila or C.C? Will i find more stupid clickbait-questions? I probably could, but let\'s start by saying that yes, Akito the exiled does indeed improve on some aspects and gets weaker in some others.Story: The story is not much worth mentioning, at least in this first installment. These 50 minutes are mostly spend on setting up the plot, the characters, introductions and the sort and then it ends pretty abruptly. That said, it was still interesting to me, seeing the conflict that takes place...in Europe, something that was only mentioned in the show. But again, not much happens, first there is a fight, then we get introduced to our main characters, they meet and in the end we get a glimpse of our main antagonist. It\'s a set up for the next movies. I guess i liked it, it was good, so it gets a 7.Art: Now here is something to be said. I think, as is tradition for a movie, the art improved. Not only the quality in general, but also the style. The characters don\'t look quite that ridiculous anymore, but it\'s still visibly ""Clamp"". Leila looks amazing, jesus! Then on the other hand, all the mechs are suddenly CGI. That is a weird one, especially since they move a little odd and look generally not as good as the drawn mechs. The upside however: The fights are amazing, so fast-paced and full of energy, they always grabbed my full attention. I really look forward to see more of that. I really can\'t give the art section a poor score this time, it think it\'s very good at least, which is a huge improvement to lelouchs rebellion.Sound: Also slightly improved, though to be fair, the ost didn\'t really stand out to me. I mean, it\'s still better then the show-soundtrack, that one actually annoyed me from time to time. However, it had it\'s great moments, while the Akito one is kinda just...there. Same goes for the ending-song, didn\'t resonate with me at all, but i also didn\'t mind it. I\'ll give it a five, nothing note-worthy.Character: As i said, the movie is a set-up, the same goes for the characters. We don\'t really learn all that much about them. There is the title-character, Akito, who is a really cool guy with a dark past. You probably know the trope, i just want to avoid calling him edgy, cause this is just a meme by now. But yeah, pretty much that. He is also a little crazy, but they didn\'t delve into that too much yet. Leila, the female lead, is great however. Very attractive, very smart and can absolutely hold her own with some martial arts. Definitely my favorite one so far.Other then that we have three thugs and they are all pretty generic so far, the tough leader, the cocky smart guy and the beautiful, female assassin/ninja. The antagonist is a samurai, at least he looks like one and he is stone cold, not much more is known yet. They are other supporting characters, but they didn\'t do anything noteworthy as of now. The characters are good, Leila adds a whole point, i\'ll be honest.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it, the time flew by, though i did space out from time to time, mostly when they were having a conversation. That didn\'t really caught my attention. For a first movie, for the introduction i liked it. If it was anything else though, then i wouldn\'t really like it that much. But as it stands, an 8 is what it gets.I think i managed to drag this review out as long as the reviews to the show. That\'s incredible. It\'s also a major flaw, but i am still learning, bear with me. Anyway, i look forward to see what fate has in store for Akito and leila, because i actually don\'t remember what happens in the second movie. The only image i have is leila slipping into the tight pilot-suit, that stuck with me. It\'s, um, a nice scene, from an artistic standpoint. Yeah... in Europe, something that was only mentioned in the show. But again, not much happens, first there is a fight, then we get introduced to our main characters, they meet and in the end we get a glimpse of our main antagonist.

The characters are good, Leila adds a whole point, i\'ll be honest.Enjoyment: I enjoyed it, the time flew by, though i did space out from time to time, mostly when they were having a conversation. That didn\'t really caught my attention. For a first movie, for the introduction i liked it. If it was anything else though, then i wouldn\'t really like it that much. But as it stands, an 8 is what it gets.I think i managed to drag this review out as long as the reviews to the show. That\'s incredible. It\'s also a major flaw, but i am still learning, bear with me. Anyway, i look forward to see what fate has in store for Akito and leila, because i actually don\'t remember what happens in the second movie. The only image i have is leila slipping into the tight pilot-suit, that stuck with me. It\'s, um, a nice scene, from an artistic standpoint. Yeah...', 'Slowpoke Code Geass fan here, who just got to watch the new OVA. I was in total hype for this when I finished R2 around December, so I kind of went into this with unrealistic expectations. That being said, the following review is neither a rant of disappointment, nor is it a blind praising of Geass fanboyism.I get that it\'s supposed to be an introductory episode, but what\'s with all the characters they introduced!? With the exception of the main heroine, EVERY character is a freekin\' sociopath. There\'s a fine line between badassery and being a total sadist, but almost all of the new...cast falls under the latter. I mean, it\'s not great that Akito himself is introduced in the first 10 minutes of action shouting nothing but, ""DIE! DIE! DIE!"" Moreover, it’s difficult to justify Akito’s homicidal ravings when he himself acknowledges that there’s little explanation for his enlistment in the war. While he was able to show glimpses of empathy while (sort of) mourning his fallen Eleven comrades, Akito’s odd bloodlust and general lack of charisma makes him seem like a watered-down Lelouch (oh, like fans of Code Geass didn’t see that coming!) He’s not a revolutionary, he’s not a genius tactician, and he’s certainly not a revered leader. Rather, Akito’s just an overly vicious, “strong yet silent” soldier. Albeit, an unnaturally talented pilot that’s conforming to the Jesus Yamato archetype.As for the rest of the Eleven knightmare unit, we’ve somehow managed to round up a group of equally nihilistic soldiers: Ayano (a katana wielding, pseudo-Yandere), Yukiyo (an “evil-genius” tech-wiz), and Ryo (the group’s brash leader with fairly noble ideals). They aren’t really more than their clichéd descriptions sell them as, but what the Eleven squad represents is an interesting theme that really anchors down the OVA’s conflict: the assimilation/discrimination of Elevens and their role as conscripts in the European Union’s army. In the opening sequence, the unit’s original commander used an interesting tactic to match Britannia’s overwhelming numerical and technological advantage - self destructing knightmares. To morally rationalize the use of Eleven suicide bombers, he brings up the following cultural prejudice: “It’s okay if the Elevens are dying for us - it’s in their blood. With ethos like “kamikaze” and “seppuku”, they’re descendants of a race that loves to die.” For the most part, dialogue in Akito the Exiled doesn’t stand out compared to the original series, being somewhat tacky in how bold the characters are trying to sound. However, what the series succeeds in doing is the way they’re depicting the dehumanization of Elevens, mainly through the way our protagonists and the characters surrounding them perceive the treatment of Eleven refugees.The aforementioned heroine, newly appointed commander Leila Malcal, is reasonably likeable in that she\'s rational, collected, and a decently competent commander, despite her inexperience. Although, with how Code Geass is building up certain knightmare units to be one-man armies, that isn\'t saying much. Strategy has long since lost its place as the deciding factor of battles, and while mecha confrontations aren\'t as exciting without the psychological interplay behind them, the way knightmares have become exceedingly mobile makes the OVA\'s battles seem much more fast paced. However, the revamped action of the OVA is a bit of a double-edged sword, bringing us to the next issue...Realism and the mecha genre seems like a massive oxymoron, but the attempts of R1 to make knightmares conceptually viable have been completely thrown out the window. Now drawn in CG (which, to my surprise, I didn’t gripe over as much as I did before), the knightmares of Akito the Exiled have experienced a complete overhaul. With heavier usage of their roller-blade mechanics, even early-generation knightmares (such as the Glasgow and the Sutherland) show a ridiculous amount of acrobatic nimbleness. This makes combat much more quick-paced, but the newfound sense of choreography in the way these unrealistically agile mechs move is a love-hate affair. It’s completely detrimental to the continuity of the parent story in that their knightmare counterparts are nowhere near as fast and powerful, but the action itself (while lacking a strategic overtone) is a bit more fun to watch.On to the art, animation, and sound.The most noticeable change is that mechs are now rendered in CGI, which caused a lot of commotion for die-hard fans. With it though, the animation quality’s certainly improved (which shouldn’t be a surprise, seeing that Code Geass originally aired more than half a decade ago). While most of the action in the original series took place in Area 11 (Japan), the OVA introduces a new setting: the European front. The posh Parisian designs that the EU’s architecture takes after is a nice addition to the CG universe, and scenes taking place in Eleven ghettos provide a fantastic contrast. They’re two different worlds that exist in the same setting - a representation of the growing divide between the oppressed Elevens and the nation they’re seeking refuge in.The voice acting is surprisingly standard, despite featuring a cast of well-known VAs. This is mostly attributed to the fact that the OVA’s characters aren’t outstanding themselves, but the vocal work isn’t anything to be praised. The biggest change to sound, however, is its change in musical direction. The pieces themselves were fine, but I’m not sure if jazzy tunes are the best fit for large-scale, heart-pumping mech battles. The background music is something that you’d expect in Cowboy Bebop’s OST, but it doesn’t quite fit in to the explosive nature of Code Geass.Luckily, with this introductory episode out of the way, Akito the Exiled is now able to move on to the thick of its story. I was completely ecstatic to see glimpses of some beloved returning characters in the preview, but I\'m hoping that the OVA continues to play on its strengths - visceral action, throwbacks to the original series, and exploration into the conflict of the Elevens.As for whether knowledge of the parent series is necessary, I\'d say it\'s highly recommended (but then again, who HASN\'T seen Code Geass?) It’ll help in understanding the struggles of Japan as a conquered colony, but I can also see someone new to the series starting on the OVA as well. In that case, the disappointment from initially watching the parent series can be avoided. I may take this back with the release of the following films, but until then, I’m holding firm that it’s near-impossible to accomplish the same epic that Code Geass was so loved for in six hour-long movies. At the very least, fans of Code Geass can’t really complain. I can definitely say that we were much more deserving of this OVA than the Nunnally in Wonderland special. cast falls under the latter.

Are they going to be artificial Geass like Jeremiahs who knows similarly the story seemingly has appeared out of nowhere in my opinion and could of had a bit more introduction however it isn\'t too bad considering they are technically Movies where after...all 4 are made will total around 3-4 hours of story which may later be filled in.The Art (9) is the same as from the original and that made me so happy and this art style suits the atmosphere perfectly. Similarly the soundtrack (8) is amazing however it is rated lower than art purely because I don\'t focus massively on the music especially during big battles where i\'m too focused on the action.Characters (8-9) are very good, Malcal is sympathetic towards the Japanese (elevens) even though she is an exiled Britainian and in a land where they dislike the japanese and send to battle with near to no care for there safety one general said something along the line of ""they have seppoku and kamikaze what is wrong with sending a nation of death to die"" (not exact quote). Akito is still mysterious to me, at one point being called the ghost hannibal and he seemingly has a geass or is under the effect on one at this time (unknown as to which it is though) and Shin who I believe will be the main antagonist for the rest of the series simillarly has a Geass and this is unique as in the original over than Mao and at one point Charles and Bismark later on it was very rare for Lelouch to be in direct conflict with someone who had a Geass and that was what gave him an advantage.Enjoyment in my opinion is the personal rating of the show and i gave it a nine purely because I loved this episode and it just got my mind pumping with Ideas as to what will happen next.Overall it got an 8 but if I wasn\'t trying to be slightly professional I would give it a 1000000000000000 (whatever number that may be) all 4 are made will total around 3-4 hours of story which may later be filled in.The Art (9) is the same as from the original and that made me so happy and this art style suits the atmosphere perfectly.

Trying desperately to stick to the successes of the original series, it simply is a weaker version in the every aspect.-The storyAkito basically has everything code geass had: A tyraniccal nation (2 now), a bunch of terrorists, geass, racial shmuck and a bunch of teenagers changing a war. Sadly, it all seems forced. The EU, featured very little in the original series, has been revamped to look like a clone of britannia, with...hardly any difference. Somehow, they\'re also completely racist, referring to the japanese as elevens, just as the britannians do, and lock them into compounds. Being an enemy of the empire, you\'d imagine they would hail the japanese as allies, even if just to spite the britannians. The ploy of japanese soldiers fighting for the EU is fairly weak, as simply enlisting them into the army should work too, seeing as their homeland has been destroyed by Britannia. Then there\'s the issue of the age of the characters. This didn\'t make much more sense in the original, but at least a big part of the cast was not actually employed by an official government, or were there in the position due to polical heritage (kaguya and tianzi). There\'s many more issues, such as Napoleon being a revolutionary (he came right after) and the fact that a Britannian force decided to retreat at the moment there was only one remaining enemy unit standing. Utter stupidity seems to occur when the Britannians begin closely circling enemies which they know use self-destruct tactics.-The charactersIt really seems like they needed a Lelouch figure. Perhaps they were right, the fanbase is expecting it, but they really did make a character way too similar to him in Akito. Listing traits they share would make a long list, and the only great difference may be that Akito is a soldier, not a general. He seems to have inherited the same traits of perceived moral superiority that Lelouch has. The other characters are not very original either. Leila is probably the only Britannian born, Eleven leading, 17 year old luitenant commander you ever see in the EU army, and she\'s already established as a damsel in distress, due to her forced marriage. Speaking of her, what was up with the self-destructing Alexanders? She claimed that she should\'ve removed Auno earlier, does that mean she could\'ve prevented the (very effective) self-destruction? That would mean she didn\'t care too much about the pilots, but she later expresses regret about their deaths. All EU characters are either dumb or just plain evil, but we already knew the series would center on Japan and Britannia, regardless of the actual location, because Japanese entertainment only seems to acknowledge two countries as significant.-The mechaA small issue, but an important one: why do the alexander knightmares move faster than anything else in the entire original series? One of the strengths of CG season one was the viability of knightmares as tactical weapons, but these streetfighting robots just don\'t seem to fit into the universe\'s technology. While there\'s some resemblance to the lancelot, these are far more atlethic, aside from being mass-production units.-Sound and artBoth are simply solid. The sound is consistent with the theme of the original series, but with a new flair. The art is mostly the same, but i personally don\'t enjoy the CG knightmares, but that\'s just a personal preference.-OverallIt\'s just trying too hard to be similar to the original series, without offering anything new. We\'ve seen all of it before, but with more depth. There\'s resemblances to the original series everywhere, but if the series will be able to offer anything new, we\'ll have to see. hardly any difference.

The plot was engaging right from the start and the various key character threads were introduced seamlessly. Gradually the personality clues and plot hints draw you deeper into the story and desperately make you want to know more while still giving you a good feel of who these characters are essentially. This of course doesn't apply to some throwaway characters, but they were clearly not very important to furthering the main storyline. Still, it would have been nice if they were less obviously 'throwaway' used to...move the plot forward or for showing the audience how key characters react. In fact, if there is one minor complaint it would be that there were TOO many characters introduced. Probably the thing I loved the most though was how faithful this was to the FEEL of Code Geass. It really captured the (admittedly sometimes over dramatic) Geass style. It didn't hurt that a large number of the characters are reminiscent of old ones in personality and design. Considering this, they managed a satisfactory job making them unique and distinctly marking them to be new characters for future development. Obviously the animation and choreography were mind-bogglingly fantastic and mecha-fans should watch this for that alone. Props must also be given to those that designed the detailed E.U Code Geass backdrop for this story and an enjoyable choice of ED song. The discordant classical BGM was an interesting albeit nontraditional choice but I feel it suites the actual OVA better then the previews and gives Boukoku no Akito its own special tone. Its growing on me. Overall, a great first installment and I can't wait for the next part. For those who haven't watched the Code Geass series, it isn't necessary but makes grasping the context easier and will probably add to your enjoyment of it. move the plot forward or for showing the audience how key characters react.

The art is a step above Rebellion, which is to say that it's phenomenal, but that is really the only good thing I can say about this series so far. Akito is basically just Lelouch, Suzaku, and Gino combined into one character. I was bored from the start and just couldn't go on.It's a pity because I love Code Geass, but I really have no interest in this series. "", 'Plot and Story LineI\'ll start right away with the first reason I loved Boukoku no Akito. The story of the exiled Akito is set in between the two seasons of Code: Geass and everything is happening in Europe. It shows us what is happening on the other side of World when in Japan the ""Black Knights"" are fighting Holy Britannian Empire and Zero appears to be dead. So, you have the year 2017 and the Europia United (E.U.) are being invaded by the strong Britannia. The E.U. forms a special unit with the name ""W-0"" and one of the members of the team is Akito...Hyuga, our protagonist. Beside Akito, the story gives us one more protagonist, the main female, Leila Malcal. (Yes, she has a similar name to mine Leila-Lejla (It\'s pronounced Leyla). She is a former Britannian aristocrat, who comes to help out as the commander of the Wyvern Knightmare corps that consists of Japanese teenagers. Those teenagers fled along with their families from ""Area 11"" to Europe in hope to survive the war. Our story begins when the Wyvern K. unit is sent to the battlefield with a 5% chance of survival. Their mission: rescue an allied unit that was left behind on the European war front.When it comes to the story line I want to say that it is really amazing. True, it\'s not as good as the original Code: Geass but it\'s still a good anime. It\'s intriguing, the story is catchy and the story line is smooth with a couple of amazing background stories. A great thing about it, there are almost no plot holes (I\'ll come to the almost later) and the anime length is just right. All the happenings fit perfectly into those 5 hours.I don\'t want to say who it is, but Boukoku no Akito shows us two very familiar characters from the original Code:Geass. It was great to see them again and to actually find out about what is happening to them between season 1 and 2. So be excited.Boukoku no Akito has, as mentioned before, a great background story. The story tells us the history of the Hyuga family. A story about Akito, his brother and his parents. It\'s an interesting story that found its place in the anime trough a couple of flashbacks.Boukoku no Akito introduces also more geass powers, but some of them are rather different than the usual ones. True, we have already seen geass powers, yet they kinda just contribute to the story making it a pinch more interesting and awesome than it already is.I said before ""there are almost no plot holes"" and with almost I only have one plot hole in the whole story that left me with a little question mark above my head. The end of the last episode got a little bit complicated explaining all the  supernatural geass stuff. The end is a bit rushed leaving not enough time to get across the things that were happening at that moment.But on the whole, there are no significant flaws in the anime. Intriguing, catchy, amazing. And this would be it about the plot and story line. Off to the characters!CharactersWhen it comes to the characters of this anime, I need to say that they are quiet good. I won\'t talk about them one by one, so I\'ll just talk about them in general.The thing that makes the characters in Boukoku no Akito special are actually their background stories. That\'s why I, at least, loved them. When we talk about personality, I can surely say that two characters took my attention. Akito, of course, but not because he was the protagonist. It\'s more his quiet and calm behavior that I loved about him. He always had a clear mind even in the most dangerous of situations. Not to mention his combat skills and strength...The second character is also a male. I don\'t have a particular reason for that, but Ashley  Ashra is one of my favorites. It\'s just his temper and the way he acts that made me like his character. When it comes to Leila, she is the strong and overly perfect main female character. A bit cliche but I can\'t deny it, I loved her. As for the overall character impression, thumbs up!Animation and StyleThe animation of this anime is just amazing. Bright colors, smooth, fast movements... Everything is just as it should be and especially in the last episode. I did expect a great animation because even the original Code:Geass had an amazing animation despite being produced in the years 2006-2007.The style is typically Code: Geass. The unique character looks really stick out when it comes to anime. Some anime did uniqueness extremely wrong and just ruined an anime, but the Sunrise studios did their job right.ConclusionBoukoku no Akito is a 5-episode-long side story of the masterpiece widely knows as Code: Geass. I\'ll make it short for you. The 5 hours I spent watching it were worth every single second. True it isn\'t the original Code: Geass and it is not as good as the original but it\'s still great. And don\'t worry it won\'t ruin your impression on Code: Geass in any way because this comes as a side story, so it doesn\'t affect the happenings in Code: Geass. So if I were you, I wouldn\'t miss it. Hyuga, our protagonist. Beside Akito, the story gives us one more protagonist, the main female, Leila Malcal. (Yes, she has a similar name to mine Leila-Lejla (It\'s pronounced Leyla). She is a former Britannian aristocrat, who comes to help out as the commander of the Wyvern Knightmare corps that consists of Japanese teenagers.

True, it\'s not as good as the original Code: Geass but it\'s still a good anime. It\'s intriguing, the story is catchy and the story line is smooth with a couple of amazing background stories. A great thing about it, there are almost no plot holes (I\'ll come to the almost later) and the anime length is just right. All the happenings fit perfectly into those 5 hours.I don\'t want to say who it is, but Boukoku no Akito shows us two very familiar characters from the original Code:Geass. It was great to see them again and to actually find out about what is happening to them between season 1 and 2. So be excited.Boukoku no Akito has, as mentioned before, a great background story. The story tells us the history of the Hyuga family. A story about Akito, his brother and his parents. It\'s an interesting story that found its place in the anime trough a couple of flashbacks.Boukoku no Akito introduces also more geass powers, but some of them are rather different than the usual ones. True, we have already seen geass powers, yet they kinda just contribute to the story making it a pinch more interesting and awesome than it already is.I said before ""there are almost no plot holes"" and with almost I only have one plot hole in the whole story that left me with a little question mark above my head. The end of the last episode got a little bit complicated explaining all the  supernatural geass stuff. The end is a bit rushed leaving not enough time to get across the things that were happening at that moment.But on the whole, there are no significant flaws in the anime. Intriguing, catchy, amazing. And this would be it about the plot and story line. Off to the characters!CharactersWhen it comes to the characters of this anime, I need to say that they are quiet good. I won\'t talk about them one by one, so I\'ll just talk about them in general.The thing that makes the characters in Boukoku no Akito special are actually their background stories. That\'s why I, at least, loved them. When we talk about personality, I can surely say that two characters took my attention. Akito, of course, but not because he was the protagonist. It\'s more his quiet and calm behavior that I loved about him. He always had a clear mind even in the most dangerous of situations. Not to mention his combat skills and strength...The second character is also a male. I don\'t have a particular reason for that, but Ashley  Ashra is one of my favorites. It\'s just his temper and the way he acts that made me like his character. When it comes to Leila, she is the strong and overly perfect main female character. A bit cliche but I can\'t deny it, I loved her. As for the overall character impression, thumbs up!Animation and StyleThe animation of this anime is just amazing. Bright colors, smooth, fast movements... Everything is just as it should be and especially in the last episode. I did expect a great animation because even the original Code:Geass had an amazing animation despite being produced in the years 2006-2007.The style is typically Code: Geass. The unique character looks really stick out when it comes to anime. Some anime did uniqueness extremely wrong and just ruined an anime, but the Sunrise studios did their job right.ConclusionBoukoku no Akito is a 5-episode-long side story of the masterpiece widely knows as Code: Geass. I\'ll make it short for you. The 5 hours I spent watching it were worth every single second. True it isn\'t the original Code: Geass and it is not as good as the original but it\'s still great. And don\'t worry it won\'t ruin your impression on Code: Geass in any way because this comes as a side story, so it doesn\'t affect the happenings in Code: Geass. So if I were you, I wouldn\'t miss it.', ""I'll begin by stating that if anybody has the patience to wait until the entire serious or at least episode 2 is released, they should do so... I know that for anybody to be reading this around the time of submition however, it is most likely they are a huge fan of the series as am I, and will jump at the first opportunity they have to watch this episode. The overall purpose of this OVA was to set the political context of this separate storyline, since it is held in a different timeline and geographical location to the series. I should also state that...I am a fairly lenient reviewer.Story: 6For a 50 minute OVA which introduced a plethora of main storyline characters, the story wasn't awful, but it seems that it links too strongly to the next episode and as a result seemed unfinished.The score for 'story' was given to the episode in isolation.Art: 10The art, as usual, was amazing. 10 does not mean perfect, but 'outstanding'. I was skeptical as to the use of CG Knightmare frames and maintain the previous ones looked better individually, but the use of CG gave way for an amazing new style of movement and animation for the frames so the mecha battles scenes were amazing. As a result of the increased enjoyment in the mecha battles, I refrained from taking a point off Art for the use of CG, especially since I was accustomed to it by the end anyway.Sound: 7The sound was.. good. Not great. The soundtrack for the original series was amazing and obviously with the equivalent of 2.5 episodes there was no way it could live up to the series music-wise. The sound effects were of course great, but the music during seemed out of place at times. I specifically disliked the playful music at the beginning of Akito's first mecha-fight. The voice-actors (or seiyū if you prefer) were great as well, but for such a high quality show as Code Geass, this is to be expected.Character: 7Elaboration on the characters' traits was lacking, however it is important to remember that 4 x 50 minute OVAs is not much, especially for a series with all new characters (except for one who it seems will be revealed later and will remain unnamed as a result of possible spoilers), and the secrets of the characters will still be included into the final episodes. I gave a fairly generous score due to at least adequate character development for the two main characters at the moment, while piquing interest in several other characters. The first episode will set your opinions on characters very well with some characters you will despise and others who you love.Enjoyment: 9Overall, I thought the OVA was great. The episode was unfinished, but obviously it will continue directly to the next so I will not punish the show for providing what it stated; the first episode of a 4 part series. This was obviously going to be the 'worse' of the episodes since it had to introduce everyone and everything. Keeping this in mind while watching, I was able to enjoy the episode. For anybody yet to watch it, watch through to the preview to the next episode. It will leave you pulling your hair out waiting for the next episode.If the episode was considered in complete isolation, the enjoyment would have received an overall 7Overall: 8The episode provided what it said it would.  It was enjoyable and I thought the characters were like-able. Despite Akito being possibly the most mysterious character as to what his Geass is exactly or whether he actually has a Geass at all, he is at this point my favourite character, aligning most similarly to Lelouch and seems to have developed the most while still maintaining his mysterious nature.If the episode was considered in complete isolation, it would have received an overall 6.OTHER:I will begin to say that this part has... possible spoilers, depending upon your definition of spoiler. The number of Geass users confirmed from this episode and features of new Knightmares are included, so read on if you choose to do so.Geass: So far, only one character is confirmed to have a Geass. The show eludes to Akito possibly having Geass during the first Mecha battle, but the sigma is never shown, so he will remain not counted. The name or clues as to the confirmed Geass-user will remain unsaid, so as to avoid spoiling anything. I will say that his specific Geass remains a mystery, but seems at the moment to be similar to Lelcouh's to an extent (although I have some theories which state otherwise).Knightmares: Looking different (since they are CG and use cell shading now). There is currently one new form of Knightmare, as well as different non-Knightmare mechanical vehicles (non-humanoid) introduced which were not seen in the original show.

While it says \'Code Geass\' in there, after watching, I\'m pretty sure it isn\'t Code Geass.It sure looks a lot like Code Geass.Britannia has conquered everything in it.Japanese people are also called elevens in it.There\'s machines that look like Gundams in it.There\'s even hints that a certain dude has a geass.But nope. It aint Code Geass.For one thing, you don\'t see a single Code Geass character throughout the entire film. Just some chick with eggs in her hair, a dude that can do acrobatics better than a Gliscor holding a flying gem, and three other terrorist...dudes. Man who are these dudes? They fricken suck! Give me the charismatic Lelouch and the head in his butthole Suzaku!For another thing, the plot was entirely irrelevant to anything that happened in Code Geass. Who\'s this blue haired ninja fighting against? Why\'s he doing that? Why should I care?""Didn\'t you watch the movie you idiot? You should know the answer to those things.""I\'m sorry myself, but I still don\'t know. It took all my effort to just watch the whole movie.The preview at the very end of the movie showed some images (maybe stock footage?) of a few characters I recognize, like Suzaku and CC. YO, YOU GUYS ARE LATE! YOU MISSED THE WHOLE MOVIE! A BUNCH OF EXTRAS HAD TO COVER FOR YA!But hey, there were some cool fight scenes, and some suave sax was playing during one of them. There was another cool scene where a Knightmare popped out of his jack in the box and some sick bass started pumping. It was almost kind of as cool as the bass in Redline.Besides that, it was pretty boring. It\'s not much fun watching a movie called Code Geass that has nothing to do with Code Geass. The whole thing was clearly just building up for the next episode, and who knows maybe the next part will be the best thing since internet porn, but man, this movie was balls.

However, when I actually watched it, I was a tad bit disappointed. The movie wasn’t bad, but it definitely wasn’t on the same level as the original Code Geass.Story: 7The plot has similar elements to the original series, with Knightmares, Geass, a war, terrorists, themes of racism, etc. However, the plot doesn’t seem nearly as interesting as the original. This movie was mostly dedicated to introducing the characters and the world, so perhaps we’ll see some improvement in the later movies.Art: 9The background art is detailed and...beautiful. Personally, I didn’t like the CGI for the Knightmares, but the action scenes are still wonderfully done.Sound: 7The soundtrack just wasn’t very noticeable. It got its job done, but there wasn’t any pieces that stuck out to me as great.Character: 7Quite a lot of characters were introduced, and it doesn’t seem like there was enough time to develop all of them. It didn’t seem like there were any characters that I really liked, or any that had really good character development. Still, none of the characters seemed to be flat or annoying, and there’s still time for them to develop in the next few movies.Enjoyment: 7There are some good action scenes, and some ok dialogue. It was relatively enjoyable.Overall: 7The movie was just average. It did its job of introducing all the characters and setting up for the next movies, but didn’t make too big of an impact.

Even the mecha is more agile compared to R1. If you haven't noticed, this series take place after R1 and before R2. This series is pretty much skippable if you'd only like to see the original storyline.Ngl i wasn't expecting much since the MC isn't Lelouch, but I got hooked up on something else. While code geass R1 and R2 is excellent due to its complicated plot and storyline, this series takes pride in its animation.Shit you not the battle sequences...in here are few of the best I've seen so far and I've watched so many action animes. The CGI didn't feel out of place, movements and interractions are smooth af, the sound effects are super lit, and the OST in the background is just artistic.The plot is slightly mainstream but I guarantee you it is still fun to watch. The story closes up beautifully but imo the 5th movie lacked explanation and has quite a rushed ending because they left out one villain unconfronted.All in all its a fun watch in here are few of the best I've seen so far and I've watched so many action animes.

Akito the exiled is really more about everything that's going on around him, with a little bit of the focus being on Akito or Leila.  This OVA series has potential but really needs to build on this episode and isn't good as a stand alone. "", 'Lelouch of the Rebellion is a story about Lelouch vi Britannia, a young exiled prince who strives to find a place in the world, finding small amounts of happiness along his journey, until his eventual repentance to bring peace into the world for his actions. This is a story about hope and love, and how sacrifice is needed for the sake of the world. Akito the Exiled, however, is like the complete opposite of that story. Set in between R1 and R2, Akito is an eleven; a derogatory name for the Japanese, and his story involves the madness that he views in his military life....What he fights for is not for his family nor his friends nor for his country; what he wishes is to die. This is one of the factors that make Akito the Exiled an intimidatingly dark story compared to Lelouch of the Rebellion. Most certainly it is still Code Geass that is being watched, however, Akito the Exiled shows a darker side of Code Geass than that of Lelouch of the Rebellion. The new animations, art, color palette and the music contribute to making Akito the Exiled a dark toned movie. Some people may not like it since the Code Geass we all know and love features a hopeful story that Lelouch will eventually get his revenge and create a kind and peaceful world for his sister, Nunnally in contrast with a dark story which shows the conflicts in the EU in its war against Britannia and Akito striving to fight and fight quite maniacally in a world separated from the hopeful setting of Ashford Academy or within the cheerful cast of characters who give hope in the story more than it should. Personally, I think Akito the Exiled is a great spin-off from Lelouch of the Rebellion especially since you get to see some of the old characters returning and it gives Code Geass a side which feels like a different experience.

I'm pleased to say that I did enjoy the episode and am looking forward to the next one for a number of reasons. I'll try to give my reasons as best as I can without giving spoilers.The characters seem very promising. Of course being a fan of the original series I was a little doubtful coming into this knowing that Lelouch and the gang wouldn't be in it, however...the doubt was erased quickly just from the beginning scene involving Lelia and Akito. Lelia comes off as a strategist to me that could pull some brilliant plans during battle in the future, and with the help of an amazing fighter such as the Eleven Akito, I'm looking forward to seeing how this fearsome duo deals with the problems to come in the next episodes.Although the animation was different compared to the original series I did enjoy it. With it being a new addition to the series I could see why they would want to change the appearance of the mechs and the animation to keep it fresh looking and to avoid people complaining about it being too similar to the original series (you can't please everyone). The fighting was very entertaining and shows great promise of even better fights to come.There are of course some things I didn't like. One being the music that played during the fight scenes. I understand it's supposed to be new and different but in all honesty the music did not fight what was going on. This isn't Cowboy Bebop! Another thing would be the reason for the character Akito to fight. I won't say it on here but to me it comes off as stupid and reckless. I'm almost certain they will go into detail later on but as of now from what we know it is not that great of a reason to fight.Overall I give this OVA a 7. It was good and shows promise but the music could be better and the characters need more depth (Of course I expect them to have more with the episodes to come). I highly recommend this to anyone that was a big fan of the original series.

When I first watched it, it didn't catch my interest. But, for me, it was alright because I hated the original series at first, but then I realized the amazingness to the story.The story was alright to me. As the biggest CG fan, I had to watch it, but I was disappointed in a way. The story nor the characters had the depth and feel into the as the original story did. I really enjoyed the battle scenes. They outdone themselves at that part....Overall, I'd say it was okay-ish. I can't wait for the next one in Spring 2013. I hope this one will be better than the first.

You could slap that brand name on anything and people will go crazy for it. Code Geass was/is one of the best anime ever and has a huge following.The main problem - this isn\'t Code Geass.There isn\'t any of the original cast. The characters in CG were excellent. The dynamics between different characters, and the way Lelouch used the Geass. In CG there is a giant overarching plot - the giant world war happening. We are shown how certain characters react due to that conflict, and it\'s through...them the story (CG anime) is told.This episode focuses on the overarching story, and we\'re introduced to characters though that. For example, we\'re shown a story about a war EU vs Britania, and the 11\'s fighting as basically slave fighters. Though showing that war we are introduced to different characters. The opposite is true for CG. We\'re shown the characters, and learn more about the war through them.When the fight scenes are going on there is some pretty impressive animation, but it\'s nothing amazing. Mechs fighting each other. Been seen a million times before. A lot of times I have no idea what mech is on what side, or what side is supposed to be the ""good"" guys, or why I should care who wins. What are the stakes? I don\'t care about any of the characters yet, I don\'t care if they die or not.Several times during the first fight when Akito keeps saying die, they do close-ups of his eyes, and they turn kind of angry red, and you can\'t help but notice this main character looks almost just like LeLouch. I believe they were using these are tie ins to the original story which many people loved, and perhaps by leaving easter eggs from the original CG it will make people like this spin-off for those reasons alone, just like labeling this as ""Code Geass: something-something something"".I wish there was a spoiler tag I could use because the last scene before the EV is worth writing about.Overall this was mediocre. Nothing super special. If the later episodes turn things around some of these scores may rise, for example if there was brillant forshawdowing I missed, and causes me to re-watch episodes and say ""I can\'t believe I didn\'t notice that""etc.Unfortunately, for me at least, with a series like Code Geass which is one of my favorite animes, and people have beenwishing for something like an R3 - after all the wait, and all the hype, this just wasn\'t what I wanted. them the story (CG anime) is told.This episode focuses on the overarching story, and we\'re introduced to characters though that.

You don't need anything more to get me fired up. I loved CG series it easily became one of my favorite titles. Story of Lelouch was perfect for me. It had everything I needed. Of course I was happy when I heard of Boukoku no Akito but on the other side what else Sunrise can provide to make me even more hyped?Well it is not R1 or R2 that's for sure. But I instantly felt this is the world showed in this series. However we visit Europe not Japan. Action still evolves around guy from Area 11 - Akito. We get nice preview...of his character, we can guess he is possessed by the Geass. But as the introduction go we can't get everything at once. And it is made in great way - you want to know what is wrong with this main character.Second main character - Leila Malcal is also intriguing. We get a little of her background and also of her capabilities as military officer. Seems smart, seems being able to handle difficult situations. And she is caring for Elevens.And here we come at great thing about this spinoff. While watching Hangyaku no Lelouch I believed that EU is fighting Britannia for the free world. And Boukoku no Akito shows as they indeed are fightining Britannia but they are no better than Brits. Japanese can't hope for refuge in EU, they get locked in ghettos. And they use them as cannon fodder and main frontline force. Why? Because they value is way lower than value of European's life.The unit of Elevens is called Wyvern and noone sees problem with equipping their mechs with explosives. Noone but Leila who eventually takes over command however too late to save soldiers. There is only lone survivor - Akito.As story is interesting and quite clear characters didn't get too much development. They are not as charismatic as the Hangyaku's cast. But that was only first movie so introduction was well done. We got quite high amount of them but is obvious only part of them will get more highlight. I rated characters high, maybe a little overrated it but it is my review so I can do it! ;)Art and sound. Animation is great. Knightmares are beautiful, there is more variety to them and fighting scenes are well done. I felt like this machinery really smashed into another one. Characters were drawn with care, I didn't spotted any oddities. And voice acting is again very good. As well as soundtrack. Especially ending song. I felt in love with it instantly!To sum up I realize this anime is not perfect. But it got this feeling of Code Geass it is great promise of better movies following this one.Story: 9/10Art: 9/10Sound: 10/10Character 8/10Enjoyment: 10/10Overall: 9/10 of his character, we can guess he is possessed by the Geass.

Akito however fails to recreate what it's predecessor accomplished, and in turn created one of the most 5/10 experiences yet, the fights are average, the story is average, the characters are average, I couldn't feel much remorse or grief when any character had died or went missing, overall just so not bad and not good that I kind of just forget about everything the moment it happened, it's so forgettable I forgot the purpose of the plot like 20 minutes in, and everytime I kept watching I'd just forget everything again.One thing I can give credit for in this is that it does answer questions that were left unanswered in the original Code Geass, with scenes starring LeLouch vi Britannia and Suzaku Kururugi, which were arguably the best scenes in the entirety of this series, even while being 1-2 minutes in length, up against the other 50 minutes per movie which starred Akito and Leila.Overall Akito the Exiled just ended up being another forgettable spin-off from a popular and deserving show, with nothing really special or memorable about it, just another spin-off that serves as plot hole fillers left by the original. themed one by a long shot, behind only the likes of stuff like Attack on Titan.

I have not seen the rest yet, but I will. Code Geass is my #1 favorite anime series but this OVA was unbearable to watch. I never knew I could watch a 50 minute movie in which NOTHING happens. By the end of it there isnt even really a goal established unless you want to speculate. This might as well have been a jumble of random boring scenes that just barely matter. The only thing we know about the protagonist so far is that he's Japanese and pretty edgy. The...other character who I cant bother to remember the name of, has basically only been shown as some Neo Euphemia with an arranged marriage dilemma. It's not inaccurate to say that almost nothing happens in this movie and almost anything that does, doesn't seem to matter. I acknowledge that a lot more can be established with the limited stuff they've shown but the first movie is an introduction to Akito the Exiled and as an introduction it falls flat to create any interest in the story. I had to try to watch this 3 times before finally breaking through the boredom and completing it. But yeah, not very good. Probably the most boring anime i've layed my eyes on. other character who I cant bother to remember the name of, has basically only been shown as some Neo Euphemia with an arranged marriage dilemma.

Akito came just in time to offer even more of an expansion on the world that surrounded the main story.I dove in almost blind, which was surprising for me when I found out that Lelouch is probably not going to take part in any of those, but who knows, he may make a cameo appearance, and God, please let that happen, along with a few if not all of the major characters from the parent series.

Lelouch is probably now held captive, and thus, Akito an Eleven that sparks Lelouch and Suzaku vibes is taking the main lead. Along with his commander Leila (A Britanian aristocrat), and a few other Eleven.Without putting too many credits on Akito, he does not scale to the complexity that both Lelouch and Suzaku display, but it's also worth noting that this is one the first entry out of 5 movies in total, so it might be still too early to judge his character indefinitely.The action that made a great part of Code Geass was present, luckily. I forgot how fast-paced and intense the fights were. It's so blooded thrilling to see an exchange of raw mecha punches, gigantic swords waving left and right, and bursts of lethal firearms that hit at all directions. And even when the pilots leave off their nightmares, they can certainly impress with they fast and precise hand-to-hand combat mastery. It's very safe to say that this movie does not disappoint from an Animation stand of point.The music was also good, the voice acting left nothing to be desired, you know something is good and working as it should when you don't feel the need to bash on it. While not phenomenal, it delivered an enjoyable deal of vocal fun. That was a weird way to phrase it.Definitely excited to see more of this.

This means no spoilers. (Disclaimer: I´m not a native English speaker, sorry if you see some grammatical mistakes)The short answer to that burning question is: if you love CG for everything that is not mecha related, this shows it´s not for you, the appearance of OP characters can be easily missed and it has nothing of the brilliant strategies and reflections about justice, power, treason, etc... Also, very poor writing, far away from the original series.Now, if...you love mechas, this series it´s spot on. The animation is incredible, and the fighting scenes with the Knightmares are very well made. In this show, they removed most of the greatness of Lelouch and his machiavellian personality and strategies, but they compensated it with great action.That said, I gave it a 5 overall because it carries ""Code Geass"" in the name, and as a CG spin-off, it´s not good. Also, all that the main series presented as lore regarding the Geass, seems to be thrown away. At least I couldn´t understand a lot of things in this series, they use the Geass as a justification to name this spin-off but it doesn´t make sense.Very poor writing in that regard. That´s why my score for Story will be a 3. Nothing regarding Geass in this one makes sense, and not to mention that the villain is the more generic villain a story can have: the ""I want to destroy the world just because"" type. That´s just very poor and lazy writing.In the end, I think I wasted my time watching it. Most of the reviews I found said the contrary, but besides the great action scenes, it´s a very mediocre story. you love mechas, this series it´s spot on.

I wouldn’t call them amazing as the CGI still feels rough when combined with 2D. The action scenes are otherwise spectacular if you are fond of quick motions and stuff blowing up.Akito is a 4 movie side story to Code Geass, chronologically taking place between the two seasons. It has some cameos from the characters of the main series but in all it can be considered a stand alone mission with its own cast.The first movie is only the introduction to the setting and the characters. The European...Union is fighting Britannia by using kamikaze Japanese pilots, one of which is an elite soldier and Geass user named Akito. The themes of the plot are very similar to the main series but focus a lot more on the war aspect and leave out all the rest of the school life and romance bullshit. I liked that; it feels a lot more focused this way and the duration wouldn’t allow a complicating script anyway. It deals heavily to the sacrifices that must be made for peace to return, and how many are willing to give up their very lives in order to achieve that. Themes regarding terrorism and honour are also present but are directly related with sacrifice and thus don’t feel as needless extra.The biggest question is of course if this side story can work without the presence of Lelouch, who was the main attraction of the core series. The answer is no, if you liked the main story mostly for him. The new cast hardly feels as imposing or even important in the longrun, with very little time available for fleshing out. In fact, half the duration is technically wasted on action scenes that serve as nothing more than guilty pleasure with robot battles and stuff blowing up instead of investing time to get to know the characters better.So the only way to like the side story is to be fond of its action and themes, and not so much of its character appeal, which is quite weak so far. You get an emo super soldier protagonist, ala Gundam Wing, some other youngsters who are fighting for revenge, and a bunch of military jerks who act like assholes and are ridiculed five minutes after they are introduced just to make the rest seem heroic. Too rough and dry characterization to appeal much. There is also a Britannian commander who seems to have the same Geass power as Lelouch, but I doubt he will manage to be much of an opposition. Hell, he already is at the point he orders people to just kill themselves and doesn’t use any (actual) mind games. In fact, there aren’t any field tactics or elaborate plans on sight in here. Not that there were that good in the main series but you were constantly made to thing there that the enemies were losing with something more than just raw power.In all, it looks like a nice time waster but I don’t expect it to be anything great.

And it takes place in Europe and their encounters with Britannia invading them.And right from the get go we get all out knightmare fights, which is amazing, the animations during the fighting were visually stunning, and that\'s where this movie shines the most, and then after the beginning fights we meet the two main characters, and then there isn\'t much...action after the first 5-10 minutes, its basically just getting to the know the characters and what\'s happening at that time.I\'m not quite sure what the ""final goal"" of this movie is, the story isn\'t really heading anywhere, or it might be, but I\'m not really sure where. And the pacing of this movie seemed pretty inconsistent, they prolonged some things that could\'ve been shortened and some things that were to short and should\'ve of been prolonged. But nonetheless the story seems interesting to me and I hope it can go somewhere from hereLike I said, the animations and art were wonderful. Especially the fight scenes, how the machines moved were just so smooth and fluid.We get some decent character development from Akito and Leila, not much other than those two get any development. They do seem to have interesting personalities though, Akito especially, I can\'t quite seem to figure him out yet. Akito seems the opposite of lelouch, Akito wants to be on the front line and just attack like crazy without much strategy, while lelouch sits back a little more and uses his intelligence and strategy making skills to beat his opponents. Leila is pretty awesome also, she\'s kind of like if you mess with me I\'m going to round house ninja kick your face, or that\'s what she seemed like to me, she easily has good intentions of what she does, Akito seems to also have good intentions but I could be wrong.The sound was good, picked up almost every sound of the clanking metal during the fights, soundtrack was ok, nothing special there.While the pacing wasn\'t the best and with not much character development, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I loved the action scenes, and I definitely like Leila and Akito and hope to see more from them in the next installment. And it might feel weird to be watching code grass without lelouch, but Akito is interesting enough to get over the fact that there are all these new characters to get used to. So if you liked the original CG series you\'ll most likely enjoy this, and don\'t look at my 7 score and say, ""oh the show was ok, maybe ill pass"" don\'t pass.

I ultimately thought the whole thing pitiful; it’s a series with the foundations for a genuinely revolutionary political narrative that is unfortunately brought down by its creators’ penchant for truly awful story beats and shoddy writing.But then I learned that Kazuki Akane, our favorite bird-loving anime director, had made a spin-off OVA series, Akito the Exiled. This was immediately intriguing to me for a few reasons: 1) I really enjoy...some of his work, 2) political thrillers aren’t really his thing as far as I know, and 3) while he certainly has a flair for aesthetic detail and action sequences, Akane excels at crafting scenes that explore characters’ emotional turmoil and trauma. Clearly, these don’t exactly gel with the politics-dominated stone-cold Code Geass of old, but they really aren’t supposed to. As soon as I had seen his name in the role of director, I knew that Kazuki Akane had not directed the “Code Geass but without all the bullsh*t” series for which I am sure some fans were clamoring, but an intensely emotional character piece encapsulated in a war drama. With giant robots. And lots of blood. Sound familiar? I hope so, because, at its heart, Akito the Exiled is a redux version of Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea, and I kind of love it for that. You can read my review of that movie later if you like, but, for the purposes of this review, suffice it to say I gave Akito the Exiled a higher rating. Also, note that, from this point on, the term “Escaflowne” will refer to the aforementioned film, not the series it retold.It’s almost baffling just how many analogs there are between Akito the Exiled and Escaflowne. With regard to characters, there’s a Van Fanel, a Folken, even a Dilandau (yay!), and they even got Maaya Sakamoto to voice the main heroine and sing the themes (SUPER yay!), but we can’t forget the similarities of the series’ narrative, especially its ending. Herein lies one of the biggest reasons why the writing of Akito the Exiled works whereas that of Escaflowne fails: pacing. Escaflowne is a film with a shorter runtime, so while it is paced well in terms of action and entertainment, most of its characters don’t have adequate time to be explored and subsequently grow. This runs directly contrary to Akane’s greatest strength of slow, emotional, and cathartic introspection. Instead of leaving Escaflowne with incomplete character motivations and story beats, the attempted solution was to dumb those motivations and story beats down so hard that they became either completely ridiculous or even insulting. Akito the Exiled has its share of cringe-worthy or questionable moments, but, aside from some scenes of sexual harassment, which are, of course, tastelessly played for laughs, I would be reluctant to say the series is insulting to the audience.Most importantly, though, I would be remiss to not mention the parallels in core theming. Both Escaflowne and Akito the Exiled adopt a message of saying “yes” to life, with all its joys, pains, and everything in between (which Evangelion already did, albeit differently, but whatever). Where Akito the Exiled surpasses Escaflowne is by allowing room for character growth, but also in the conveyance itself; instead of the message just being outright told to the audience (even though it is), there is usage of metaphors and symbolism with the contrasting Geass powers of the characters, thus weaving the themes into the narrative itself. It’s sad that this is where many Code Geass fans were frustrated; read just about any of the reviews with the score 2 out of 10 and you’ll find that those reviewers are hyper-fans of Code Geass that denounce Akito the Exiled as being a garbage fire that betrays the original’s core narrative ideas and power mechanics. While they may be correct in that this series does stick to a more grounded story, distancing itself from many of the more fantastical elements of its predecessor, I can’t help but see that the fans are missing the forest for the trees… a part of that forest being the frequent idiocy of the original series’ writing.Code Geass was never about creepy eye-superpowers that completely break realism and/or the narrative. It was about societal control, keeping peace among diverse masses, how irrational hatred incites violence, and the nuances of maintaining morality in the face of corruption. That’s why asinine plot developments like Lelouch accidentally eye-zapping Euphemia completely undermine broader, more thematically rich conflicts like Lelouch’s commitment to vigilantism against Suzaku’s law-abiding path, and the ethical debate therein. Code Geass is to anime as Ubisoft’s Watch Dogs is to video games; there are two halves to each of them: one that is full of truly great, intriguing philosophical ideas and another half that actively seeks to undermine the audience’s ability to enjoy the other.Akito the Exiled actually manages to at least touch on just about all of those grand ideas that Code Geass so poorly spoiled with its annoying bullsh*t. We have a main hero that has lost faith in humanity and the possibility of moral governance to the point that he is damn-near suicidal and resigns himself to being a cog in a machine that is designed to grind people of persecuted minorities like him into dust. Thankfully, he is open-minded enough to maintain the hope that he can be a part of a movement to build something better. Our main villain differs here; his hopelessness causes him to devote himself fully to living a life without any ambiguity, only willing to see black and white, even if that means becoming an agent of evil, chaos, and destruction. Contrast these characters to the main heroine, someone who has unwavering faith and believes wholeheartedly in the value of life’s nuances. She recognizes possibility in the freedom they provide but is willing to risk her life standing against those who would restrict that freedom, ultimately coming to see and respect the ambiguity of concepts such as “moral governance”. What Akito the Exiled does is successfully marry Escaflowne’s narrative beats, (newly-developed) characterizations, and themes with the world and themes of Code Geass. That is an incredible feat, and it’s apparently one that only diehard fans of both Akane’s work and Sunrise’s history can recognize and thus appreciate.But, obviously, none of this (mostly) high-quality writing would be worth a damn if nobody watched Akito the Exiled, which means it needs market appeal. Thankfully, this series fares well on production quality fronts. Character designs are good, staying true to the long, slender look of CLAMP’s original designs while abandoning the meme-ably sharp jawlines. That said, the characters’ costuming can sometimes be disorienting or even wildly inappropriate, and it’s here where we see the fanservicey roots of Code Geass; skirts, plunging dresses, and (for both sexes, so the ladies have something to look at, too) bare midriffs and skin-tight pilot suits are all prevalent, for worse, in my opinion. It can be difficult to take racist comrades-in-arms seriously when I’m wondering why they’re deriding the characters’ being Japanese rather than making some crude comment about Ayano’s pilot suit being unzipped down past her navel with her entire chest exposed, but, hey, at least it’s not giant robots cooking pizzas or… (gag)… high schools. Clothing choices aside, the character art is, thankfully, very consistent and, while I think other works have better character animation, there are some nice moments of fluidity and very few shortcuts taken. Additionally, outside of a big, sweeping, CGI background shot in the first episode where trees are very poorly rendered, the art direction is pretty top-notch. There are some beautiful still backgrounds that suit Akane’s grandiose and symbolically dense storyboarding style, but also showcase well-detailed, varied CGI environments for the dynamic and frenetic action sequences.On the topic of those action scenes, I’m not the biggest fan of CGI robots, but I found myself quite entranced by the fluidity of their movements and the wild, swinging camerawork. The Knightmare designs themselves are all very detailed; true, the golden centaur robot was completely ridiculous (it even neighs!!!), but it’s not the first giant robot centaur I’ve seen. Looking at you, Iron-Blooded Orphans. That aside, I was pleasantly surprised by how agile the robots are given that I am, as my reference just then would attest, more used to Sunrise’s Mobile Suit Gundam franchise with its often weightier movements (see Gundam Unicorn or Char’s Counterattack). Sure, the very notion that 30-foot robots can do insane backflips, cartwheels, and gymnastics is totally ludicrous, but I found it all quite entertaining once I quickly overcame that realism curve. Also, for some reason I can’t pin down, the robots’ crawling animations just looked cool as hell. Now, THAT is what Leopardon should have been able to do.Let’s also not forget the music; Ichiko Hashimoto may not have many anime credits, but she does a damn good job with Akito the Exiled. It’s especially in the action sequences where she brings the thunder by letting her jazz roots shine. Ironically enough, the style of music presented here is so frantic that I probably wouldn’t sit and listen to it out of context, despite my love for jazz, but that high-octane, nail-biting, redlining vibe perfectly captures the chaos of the battles, complementing them exceptionally well. It’s like if you took “Bad Dog No Biscuit” from Cowboy Bebop, dialed it to eleven, and made it the main battle theme, only I’d say it’s even better. There are, of course, more melodic, orchestral themes, usually reserved for those quieter moments of introspection, but they too are very well-suited because each piece carries as much weight as the scene’s induced feelings and dialogue, spoken or otherwise.And that’s a good enough segue to the dialogue. More than a few times, the lines can come off as immature and lacking subtlety, definitely to the detriment of the more serious subject matter, and a couple times it descends into science fiction jargon that doesn’t matter in the slightest, but it’s serviceable for the most part. Characters could stand to crack a few more jokes, but no character ever felt grating, and a lot of that is helped by pretty solid vocal performances. Now, okay, I watched this series subbed, but I did at least sample the English verison, and in spite of some flaws, I can’t fault it for ambition. I like that a few L.A. actors and actresses were cast in this Funimation dub (something of a callback to Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine, for which Hashimoto composed the opening theme), and not just in the very minor roles of Suzaku, Lelouch, and C.C. Our main heroine, Leila is voiced by Jeannie Tirado (Carole and Tuesday, My Next Life as Villainess), who does a pretty decent job. What’s more ambitious, I think, is the decision to direct many of the actors to use accents in their lines, and while that occasionally does impede their ability to inflect and employ greater range, the good consistency of their accents is something to note.So, in the end, do I recommend Code Geass: Akito the Exiled? Semi-surprisingly… yes. I went into this series with rather low expectations as a result of my not caring for the Code Geass of old, but it turned out better than I had hoped, a worthy entry in Kazuki Akane’s repertoire that I would recommend over Birdy the Mighty: Decode or Stars Align. While Code Geass fanboys may not find much of the original show’s spirit here, Akane fanboys like myself will find the Escaflowne redemption he wanted to tell and I didn’t know I wanted to see. That artistic license likely isn't meant to be deliberate hostility toward the Code Geass fanbase, but in my own personal little meta-headcanon, I see Akane writing the script to Akito the Exiled, smiling to himself, and saying “those fanboys won’t know what hit them.” Redemption and open-mindedness are important ideas in the narrative of Akito the Exiled, so while I see the redemption arcs speaking to Akane himself over the literary shortcomings of Escaflowne, I also see the open-mindedness idea intended for those who hyped themselves up for more Code Geass and got a more somber, grounded, and emotional piece instead.I think Akito the Exiled is designed to be a healthy dose of variety in the Code Geass franchise and, in some measure, an attempt to further diversify the fanbase from the raving lunatics that fanbases for uber-popular works often are. That’s one of the only reasons I can think of for why Sunrise let Akane run wild with this series and make what (I believe) he genuinely wanted to make. It just so happens that what he wanted to make is what I wanted to see, but let’s stay objective for the rating; the visuals are pretty-well polished, the music is great, the scenes are beautifully and smartly crafted, and the voice acting is solid, but the costuming and dialogue could be a bit more mature to suit the mood of the series. Also, the core message, while meaningful and well-integrated into the narrative and characters, is a bit less than original. All of this comes to an enjoyable mid-7 out of 10. It’s not as good as The Vision of Escaflowne, but it’s a definite improvement of Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea, for which I wrote a review. Please read it; I promise it’s not as long as this one!Happy watching!- LC some of his work, 2) political thrillers aren’t really his thing as far as I know, and 3) while he certainly has a flair for aesthetic detail and action sequences, Akane excels at crafting scenes that explore characters’ emotional turmoil and trauma. Clearly, these don’t exactly gel with the politics-dominated stone-cold Code Geass of old, but they really aren’t supposed to. As soon as I had seen his name in the role of director, I knew that Kazuki Akane had not directed the “Code Geass but without all the bullsh*t” series for which I am sure some fans were clamoring, but an intensely emotional character piece encapsulated in a war drama. With giant robots. And lots of blood. Sound familiar? I hope so, because, at its heart, Akito the Exiled is a redux version of Escaflowne: A Girl in Gaea, and I kind of love it for that. You can read my review of that movie later if you like, but, for the purposes of this review, suffice it to say I gave Akito the Exiled a higher rating. Also, note that, from this point on, the term “Escaflowne” will refer to the aforementioned film, not the series it retold.It’s almost baffling just how many analogs there are between Akito the Exiled and Escaflowne. With regard to characters, there’s a Van Fanel, a Folken, even a Dilandau (yay!), and they even got Maaya Sakamoto to voice the main heroine and sing the themes (SUPER yay!), but we can’t forget the similarities of the series’ narrative, especially its ending. Herein lies one of the biggest reasons why the writing of Akito the Exiled works whereas that of Escaflowne fails: pacing. Escaflowne is a film with a shorter runtime, so while it is paced well in terms of action and entertainment, most of its characters don’t have adequate time to be explored and subsequently grow. This runs directly contrary to Akane’s greatest strength of slow, emotional, and cathartic introspection. Instead of leaving Escaflowne with incomplete character motivations and story beats, the attempted solution was to dumb those motivations and story beats down so hard that they became either completely ridiculous or even insulting. Akito the Exiled has its share of cringe-worthy or questionable moments, but, aside from some scenes of sexual harassment, which are, of course, tastelessly played for laughs, I would be reluctant to say the series is insulting to the audience.Most importantly, though, I would be remiss to not mention the parallels in core theming. Both Escaflowne and Akito the Exiled adopt a message of saying “yes” to life, with all its joys, pains, and everything in between (which Evangelion already did, albeit differently, but whatever). Where Akito the Exiled surpasses Escaflowne is by allowing room for character growth, but also in the conveyance itself; instead of the message just being outright told to the audience (even though it is), there is usage of metaphors and symbolism with the contrasting Geass powers of the characters, thus weaving the themes into the narrative itself. It’s sad that this is where many Code Geass fans were frustrated; read just about any of the reviews with the score 2 out of 10 and you’ll find that those reviewers are hyper-fans of Code Geass that denounce Akito the Exiled as being a garbage fire that betrays the original’s core narrative ideas and power mechanics. While they may be correct in that this series does stick to a more grounded story, distancing itself from many of the more fantastical elements of its predecessor, I can’t help but see that the fans are missing the forest for the trees… a part of that forest being the frequent idiocy of the original series’ writing.Code Geass was never about creepy eye-superpowers that completely break realism and/or the narrative. It was about societal control, keeping peace among diverse masses, how irrational hatred incites violence, and the nuances of maintaining morality in the face of corruption. That’s why asinine plot developments like Lelouch accidentally eye-zapping Euphemia completely undermine broader, more thematically rich conflicts like Lelouch’s commitment to vigilantism against Suzaku’s law-abiding path, and the ethical debate therein. Code Geass is to anime as Ubisoft’s Watch Dogs is to video games; there are two halves to each of them: one that is full of truly great, intriguing philosophical ideas and another half that actively seeks to undermine the audience’s ability to enjoy the other.Akito the Exiled actually manages to at least touch on just about all of those grand ideas that Code Geass so poorly spoiled with its annoying bullsh*t.

Please read it; I promise it’s not as long as this one!Happy watching!- LC"", 'Note: This will be a review of all 5 OVAs. It will also contain a couple of spoilers for ""Code Geass"". Read at your own risk.Overview:Most of you have probably seen or at least heard the story of Lelouch, an exiled prince who wages a war against his homeland for the sake of creating a better, more just world. What you probably haven\'t heard of, however, is the story that happened in Europe during the year in between the two seasons of ""Code Geass"". I am talking about ""Code Geass: Akito the Exiled"", a five episode OVA series that focuses on the Europa United, one...of the ""Code Geass"" world\'s three superpowers that went practically untouched in the original series. Clocking in at about 4 hours, ""Akito the Exiled"" may not be able to compare to the series that spawned it, but it\'s still a fun, little side story with amazing visuals, great fight scenes and well-developed characters.Set in Europe during the time Lelouch was made a puppet for the Emperor after the failed Black Knight rebellion at the end of season 1, ""Code Geass: Akito the Exiled"" focuses primarily on two individuals; the titular Akito Hyuga, a Japanese soldier who works for the European Army, and Leila Malcal, a European noblewoman who serves as Akito\'s commanding officer. One day, they end up encountering a trio of terrorists trying to kidnap one of their generals, who turn out to be exiled Japanese who are simply looking for their place in the world. Fortunately for them, Leila offers them exactly that- namely, a place in her team, which comes to be known as the Wyvern Squad or W-0. They\'re reluctant at first, but ultimately they accept. The rest of the series follows Akito, Leila and their new allies as they come into conflict with a group called the Knights of St. Michael, led by a man named Shin Hyuga Shiang, Akito\'s mysterious older half-brother who has sinister plans for the world as a whole.The series\' short length definitely works against it from time to time. While it is nice to see the Europa United explored in greater detail, since we saw almost none of it in the original series, there unfortunately just isn\'t enough time to really make the most out of this opportunity. Ultimately, the politics and slice-of-life elements that were so prominent in the original series take a backseat here, resulting in a far more straightforward action flick, complete with a considerably more somber and melancholy tone. In fact, there is only one period of levity in the whole story, which happens roughly halfway through and mostly exists just to give the major cast some much-needed bonding time and character development. Of course, some of you may not mind that, especially if its your thing, but it does definitely lack what made the the main series so original and enjoyable. Not helping matters is that it is almost completely divorced from the story of the main series, with an almost completely new cast of characters and only a few appearances from the original cast, and ultimately these appearances are so irrelevant to the story that I don\'t really see why they were even in the story at all. In fact, it would have been better for the story if they hadn\'t been, as the scenes that involve the original cast only further show just how irrelevant Akito and Leila\'s story is to the world of ""Code Geass"" as a whole.The length of the series also hinders the quality of characterization, though the major characters are at least good for what they are, as they all get a fair amount of development and have decently fleshed-out backstories. My favourite would have to be Leila, as she is essentially a combination of both Lelouch and Euphemia, taking the best parts of both of them and discarding their weaknesses. While this admittedly makes her a less interesting character than Lelouch, that was a really high bar to clear regardless, and she\'s ultimately really lovable, being the one to keep the squad together with her kindness and lack of prejudices, though it takes a while for her to earn the trust of them sans Akito. While she’s not a particularly skilled pilot, she can kick a fair amount of ass on foot, disarming an enemy with a sword in the first episode and forcing another enemy into submission, showing that while she’s kind, she can more than hold her own as well. My only real problem with her character is that some parts of her backstory, like the implied conflict between her and her adopted family, went almost completely unexplored, though this ultimately wasn’t a huge issue. Second to Leila is Akito himself, who is best described as Suzaku in reverse. Suzaku started off as highly idealistic, but then tragedy struck and he gradually became more ruthless and cynical, alienating those he considered friends in the process. Akito, by contrast, starts off ruthless and cynical (not to mention highly unstable) but overtime becomes more idealistic as a result of bonding with his comrades, particularly Leila, whom he’s shown to be incredibly loyal to even in the beginning. It certainly helps that his crazy nature in battle isn’t by choice- rather, it’s the result of his brother Geassing him when he was a child, which was initially an order to die but instead became one to kill everything in his path, not unlike Suzaku’s own order to live at all costs. All in all, Akito proves himself to be a very likable and sympathetic character, and I really enjoyed the romance arc between him and Leila, which proves to be a lot more believable than your typical “bad boy” schtick.Besides Akito and Leila, we also have the three terrorists they recruit early on. The leader of the trio is Ryo Sayama, who at first comes off as a typical hot-headed jerk and dangerous terrorist but is really just a desperate man looking for his place in a world that is not kind to his people. He also cares a lot about his friends and has no problem making this known, often going to great lengths to ensure their safety, though he’s not above tough love from time to time. There’s also Ayano Kosaka, the only girl in the trio as well as the emotional centre, being the kindest member of the squad after Leila, though she’s just as capable in combat as her male comrades, and doesn’t hesitate to express her pain about how her kind are used as cannon fodder, initially believing Leila to be the same as any other commander until she showed her otherwise. Finally, there’s Yukia Naruse, the brains of the trio and also the most unstable (as well as the most unstable of the whole squad along with Akito). While he initially seems to be a typical sociopathic mad bomber, it’s soon revealed that his real problem isn’t that he doesn’t care, but that he cares too much. As someone who lived in a place where the Japanese took their frustrations of being oppressed out on each other, Yukia has a deep disdain for Japanese people despite being one himself. This has resulted in him being incredibly loyal to Ryo and Ayano, due to them being two of the few people to ever be nice to him. Unfortunately, this loyalty manifests as a willingness to do anything for their sake, up to and including blowing himself up, which he attempts to do on no less than two occasions. As time goes on, however, he starts to channel his loyalty in a healthier, more positive way, particularly as said loyalty extends to Akito and Leila. Other than Wyvern Squad, there’s a fair amount of other characters exclusive to the series, some of whom are well-developed and some of whom are just there. One last thing I’ll say is that Shin, while not a bad villain by any means, is not as threatening as he could have been, if only because of the fact that there’s never any danger of him succeeding in his plans. Even disregarding the fact that his absence in R2 of “Code Geass” makes his defeat by Akito and the others a foregone conclusion, the series makes it clear that even if he hadn’t failed within the story itself, he would have somewhere down the line. Instead, the real draw of his character comes from his entertainment value and conflict with Akito, which much like the latter’s relationship with Leila, is given a lot more nuance than a typical case of two siblings trying to kill each other.“Akito the Exiled”’s music generally isn’t anything to write home about, consisting mainly of tracks from the main series that you probably won’t even recognize. There are exceptions, however, the most notable example being the song that plays at the end of each episode, “More than Words”, sung by Leila’s Japanese voice actress Maaya Sakamoto and composed by Yoko Kanno of “Cowboy Bebop” and “Ghost in the Shell” fame. The voice acting is great all around, though some performances are definitely better than others. Jeannie Tirado is probably my favourite performance, as she voices Leila with a believable French accent that makes her sound unrecognizable in comparison to her roles in “ReLife” or “Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash”. Micah Solusod also does a great job as Akito, capturing both his vulnerable and psychotic sides very well, and the series has a strong supporting cast including Ricco Fajardo, Elizabeth Maxwell, Aaron Dismuke, Jad Saxton and Christopher Sabat. The visuals are outstanding, taking the already crisp and distinct art style of the main series and making it more polished and refined, as well as using 3D effects to make the mech battles even better looking than they already were.While the tale of Akito and Leila is ultimately an inconsequential side story that matters little in the grand scheme of things, it’s nevertheless proof that that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. In fact, if you’ve heard people say that “Akito the Exiled” is best being taken as its own thing rather than as a “Code Geass” spin-off, then they’re absolutely right, as without the main series hanging over it it’s a good story with very likable characters. Put simply, if you’re a fan of mecha anime, particularly “Gundam” shows, then you will most likely enjoy “Akito the Exiled”. Just don’t expect to get a lot of viewing time out of it. of the ""Code Geass"" world\'s three superpowers that went practically untouched in the original series.

My only real problem with her character is that some parts of her backstory, like the implied conflict between her and her adopted family, went almost completely unexplored, though this ultimately wasn’t a huge issue. Second to Leila is Akito himself, who is best described as Suzaku in reverse. Suzaku started off as highly idealistic, but then tragedy struck and he gradually became more ruthless and cynical, alienating those he considered friends in the process. Akito, by contrast, starts off ruthless and cynical (not to mention highly unstable) but overtime becomes more idealistic as a result of bonding with his comrades, particularly Leila, whom he’s shown to be incredibly loyal to even in the beginning. It certainly helps that his crazy nature in battle isn’t by choice- rather, it’s the result of his brother Geassing him when he was a child, which was initially an order to die but instead became one to kill everything in his path, not unlike Suzaku’s own order to live at all costs. All in all, Akito proves himself to be a very likable and sympathetic character, and I really enjoyed the romance arc between him and Leila, which proves to be a lot more believable than your typical “bad boy” schtick.Besides Akito and Leila, we also have the three terrorists they recruit early on. The leader of the trio is Ryo Sayama, who at first comes off as a typical hot-headed jerk and dangerous terrorist but is really just a desperate man looking for his place in a world that is not kind to his people. He also cares a lot about his friends and has no problem making this known, often going to great lengths to ensure their safety, though he’s not above tough love from time to time. There’s also Ayano Kosaka, the only girl in the trio as well as the emotional centre, being the kindest member of the squad after Leila, though she’s just as capable in combat as her male comrades, and doesn’t hesitate to express her pain about how her kind are used as cannon fodder, initially believing Leila to be the same as any other commander until she showed her otherwise. Finally, there’s Yukia Naruse, the brains of the trio and also the most unstable (as well as the most unstable of the whole squad along with Akito). While he initially seems to be a typical sociopathic mad bomber, it’s soon revealed that his real problem isn’t that he doesn’t care, but that he cares too much. As someone who lived in a place where the Japanese took their frustrations of being oppressed out on each other, Yukia has a deep disdain for Japanese people despite being one himself. This has resulted in him being incredibly loyal to Ryo and Ayano, due to them being two of the few people to ever be nice to him. Unfortunately, this loyalty manifests as a willingness to do anything for their sake, up to and including blowing himself up, which he attempts to do on no less than two occasions. As time goes on, however, he starts to channel his loyalty in a healthier, more positive way, particularly as said loyalty extends to Akito and Leila. Other than Wyvern Squad, there’s a fair amount of other characters exclusive to the series, some of whom are well-developed and some of whom are just there. One last thing I’ll say is that Shin, while not a bad villain by any means, is not as threatening as he could have been, if only because of the fact that there’s never any danger of him succeeding in his plans. Even disregarding the fact that his absence in R2 of “Code Geass” makes his defeat by Akito and the others a foregone conclusion, the series makes it clear that even if he hadn’t failed within the story itself, he would have somewhere down the line. Instead, the real draw of his character comes from his entertainment value and conflict with Akito, which much like the latter’s relationship with Leila, is given a lot more nuance than a typical case of two siblings trying to kill each other.“Akito the Exiled”’s music generally isn’t anything to write home about, consisting mainly of tracks from the main series that you probably won’t even recognize. There are exceptions, however, the most notable example being the song that plays at the end of each episode, “More than Words”, sung by Leila’s Japanese voice actress Maaya Sakamoto and composed by Yoko Kanno of “Cowboy Bebop” and “Ghost in the Shell” fame. The voice acting is great all around, though some performances are definitely better than others. Jeannie Tirado is probably my favourite performance, as she voices Leila with a believable French accent that makes her sound unrecognizable in comparison to her roles in “ReLife” or “Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash”. Micah Solusod also does a great job as Akito, capturing both his vulnerable and psychotic sides very well, and the series has a strong supporting cast including Ricco Fajardo, Elizabeth Maxwell, Aaron Dismuke, Jad Saxton and Christopher Sabat. The visuals are outstanding, taking the already crisp and distinct art style of the main series and making it more polished and refined, as well as using 3D effects to make the mech battles even better looking than they already were.While the tale of Akito and Leila is ultimately an inconsequential side story that matters little in the grand scheme of things, it’s nevertheless proof that that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. In fact, if you’ve heard people say that “Akito the Exiled” is best being taken as its own thing rather than as a “Code Geass” spin-off, then they’re absolutely right, as without the main series hanging over it it’s a good story with very likable characters. Put simply, if you’re a fan of mecha anime, particularly “Gundam” shows, then you will most likely enjoy “Akito the Exiled”. Just don’t expect to get a lot of viewing time out of it.', ""If you just recently watched code geass seasons 1 and 2, then watch this show, you will be disappointed greatly, the akito series mini movies suck in comparison to the code geass seasons, like, I was falling asleep while watching akito.

Doraemon Movie 42: Nobita to Sora no Utopia,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52318/Doraemon_Movie_42__Nobita_to_Sora_no_Utopia,"['My first impression.The story and the position of the guest characters are new and challenging. However, I thought it was a waste because there was little explanation of the character\'s background.Good points:- Adventure stageDoraemon movies often have adventures in places far removed from the world Doraemon and his friends live in. For example, space away from the earth, ancient times, in the mirror.This movie is also a story in a paradise floating in the sky. However, in this movie, it is closely related to the sphere of daily life. Looking at the pamphlet, the scriptwriter said, ""At first, I thought that the town where Nobita...and others lived would be the stage for adventure, and I thought of a story that doesn\'t go anywhere.(After that, it became a story in the sky)."" This movie is less adventurous than usual. It\'s not a big stage. This point was new and challenging to me.- Relationship with the main guest characterGuest characters appear in every Doraemon movie.

Fujio.)To summarize the final impression.I don\'t think this movie was a movie that children would enjoy. It was a movie with an important message, but Doraemon\'s movie is a chance for Nobita and his friends to go on a big adventure once a year.

That curiosity makes them have a time travel journey to search for Utopia (Crescent Moon island). Somehow they find out the Utopia but there is something wrong with that place. That's how their journey begins.Art (10)The art in this anime is excellence! I like the color, glow, and shadow they were using for this anime. They also use a lot of animation than the static image which makes it more enjoyable to watch. What I like much is...how they can animate the planet morphing also the attack effects (Mostly the electric ones)Sound (10)All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation.Character (10)The main and supporter character is very memorable since they have their unique personality.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.Overall (10)It's recommended to those who love adventure, sci-fi, and comedy anime!*Recommended to watch with your family! how they can animate the planet morphing also the attack effects (Mostly the electric ones)Sound (10)All the sounds that they used were suitable and adjusted to the animation.Character (10)The main and supporter character is very memorable since they have their unique personality.Enjoyment (10)It's very enjoyable to watch this movie in 2023.Overall (10)It's recommended to those who love adventure, sci-fi, and comedy anime!*Recommended to watch with your family!"", 'My overall take: Could benefit from minor adjustments to the pacing and writing, but a solid, emotionally charged addition to the franchise.In this movie, Nobita thinks life would be much better if he lived in a utopia, and asks Doraemon to help him find one. There are quite a few things I enjoyed about this film. The story is well crafted for most part, making effective use of foreshadowing. It\'s certainly one of the most emotionally driven Doraemon movies, with several heartfelt moments among the characters, especially between Nobita and Doraemon and between Doraemon and the ""perfect"" robot cat Sonya. Speaking of which, Doraemon being...the main protagonist to forge a connection with one of the movie characters is a rare occurrence! Additionally, Sonya himself probably qualifies as one of the more memorable and developed movie-exclusive characters in the franchise.If I were to criticize anything about this movie, one would be that it\'s very exposition heavy. I have to wonder whether some of the scenes dedicated to explaining background information and character backstories through dialogue could have been trimmed down just a bit, especially given that there were other elements of the story that could have used the extra runtime. For example, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo don\'t get a whole lot of focus this time around.I do appreciate though that the movie actually highlights one of Shizuka\'s flaws other than ""she plays violin badly""—she can be stubborn, which is true... even if the way it is shown here makes her come across as studious more than anything. The scene where the protagonists come around to embracing their shortcomings is also a well done character moment.That being said, there are ways in which the central theme of the story (essentially ""it\'s okay not to be perfect"") could have been handled with more nuance. After all, Gian and Suneo\'s misbehavior is regularly shown to cause real harm to others throughout the franchise. I know, there are limits to how deeply one can explore a moral conundrum in a children\'s film, but I don\'t believe this would have been too challenging to achieve. Perhaps more emphasis could have been placed on learning to control one\'s flaws and redirecting them into exacting positive change, contrasting with the villain\'s plan to forcibly erase all individuality. Glimmers of this are already present in the aforementioned scene, but I think it could have been made more explicit still, which isn\'t helped by the fact that the main villain only appears in person briefly and barely interacts with the heroes.On the whole, however, these weaknesses didn\'t detract much from my viewing experience, and I\'d consider this a worthwhile entry in the Doraemon film series. the main protagonist to forge a connection with one of the movie characters is a rare occurrence!

Futatsu no Spica,https://myanimelist.net/anime/344/Futatsu_no_Spica,"[""Twin Spica is a pretty good anime for young viewers. I say that because there are alot of morals and good values taught in this show. If you don't mind most of that stuff im sure anyone would enjoy this show. The show evolves a young girl named Asumi Kamogawa whos dream is to become an astronaut. The story starts off as a very young Asumi and then progresses forward from there. Although Asumi is a very engeretic and smart little girl, theres more than enough tragic stories in this show to last a lifetime. Which is another point. Even though you will be convinced...from most anime descriptions as a story about a girl wanting to go to space, the story and ending will eventually reveal itself to be something very diffrernet. Now the question to be asked now would be: &quot;Is it worth watching?&quot;To start off, the show's character structure purely surrounds Asumi as everything about her life is told throughout the twenty episodes. But from episode one, the viewer gets exposed to a large amount of information about Asumi and her habits. One of the pieces of information is the introduction of Lion-san, a man with a funny looking mask. You'll be wondering why he would be wearing such a silly costume but it all makes sense even before you know it. There are a few other friends that show themselves throught the show but you'll have to watch to figure out who they are. The character types for her friends are pretty standard anime fare and are fairly uninteresting. Their character types may be uninteresting but how they evolve and support Asumi and each other will definitely stick out most out of anything in the show. This is the show's only saving grace is how Asumi and her friends all work off each other. It's actually very believeable and I even can relate to a few of them.As the story progresses Asumi's friends will be given time to get their backgrounds explained. But like any tragic show like this, Those tragic stories are where most of the show's stories will come from. Of course from every tradgedy there is a lesson to be learned hence my reccomendation to younger viewers. I'm sure some of the stories will definitely tug at your tear ducts because I cried a little more than i would expect from a show about a girl becoming an astronaut. But if you enjoyed this show as much as me you'll start wanting to know what happens next instead  wondering about the girls main goals. Its good that they do a decent job on character building because the story isn't all that great and the art work is even worse.Nothing about the show's artwork will impress you at all. The artwork is below average at best. Background details are weak and generic, no real detail is put into them. Although they are hand drawn and painted which is good i guess. The character artwork is very early 1990's style. Clothing isn't very detailed, school uniforms are generic, even their everyday clothes are very plain. One art point that does bug the hell out of me the most though is Asumi's rosy cheeks. I've never been a fan of the rosy red cheek circles on faces since it reminds me too much of a clown. Its kind of a shame because she would look just fine with out them. Even with that the animations are poorly drawn too you can see some breaks in animation, or the shadows are even just triangles with legs. I could keep knocking on the art and animation, but I should spend an equal time hating on the sound as well.The music and sound isn't very versitile. Most of the time its guitar or harmonica solo's or the occasional melancholy orchestra breaking out in song when something tragic happens. Voice acting is allright but with all the bad things going for it you can't even say the voice acting is well done (even though it is).Overall the show has one thing going for it, and thats the character building and its morals. Most viewers will say that its a very bad anime. But to those few people who dont mind the occasional tragic anime or those few people who can relate to some of the things dealt with in this show will find a special place for this anime. The ending isn't where I thought it would end but for what it was worth it was a good place to stop this anime. This anime was like a road trip in a beat up minivan. The whole ride was ugly and bumpy but with good company, it can still be fun. from most anime descriptions as a story about a girl wanting to go to space, the story and ending will eventually reveal itself to be something very diffrernet.

However, unlike Stelliva of the Universe, it is more of a slice of life anime and down to earth.  For the most part Twin Spica is character driven focusing mainly on Asumi and later on Marika.  What differentiates Asumi from other leads in other &quot;HS space dramas&quot; is that she is a very strong willed and determined character despite her diminutive stature.  She has gone through a lot and yet has never whined or cried.  We are later introduced to her friends when she goes to the...academy.  For the most part they're pretty clique/standard.  Marika on the other hand may be the &quot;stoic/cold/loner&quot; part of the clique but has an intriguing back story.  Its just too bad that we don't get to know more about her.  One of the things that worried me about Twin Spica was &quot;lion-san&quot; when I was reading a synopsis.  &quot;Lion-san&quot; is a person that wears a lion mask and is a mentor to Asumi.  Thankfully Lion-san wasn't distracting, in fact he fits in very well.As I said before, Twin Spica is character driven.  For the first 8 some episodes the focus was mainly on Asumi and flowed perfectly abiet slow paced.  After that it loses a bit of focus and at times become too slow paced.  I was confused as to where the development and focus was going.  You could say that the story became too non-linear.  While it was all very interesting and ties together it could have been handled much better.  For example, while Asumi may be strong it just that she may be a bit too strong this early.  They show how she developed by devoting entire episodes showing her past.  Again the flow of the story felt a bit muddled in the middle but gets back on track for the end.  As for the ending, it may be a bit too open for some.  There are a lot of unanswered questions especially Marika and may seem to be an odd place to stop.  However, considering the nature of the anime I felt that it was perfectly fine.As for the technical aspects, nothing stood out too much.  The character designs reminded me Tezuka Osamu and Studio Gibli works.  Fantastic Children comes to mind in terms of similar character designs.  Animation was standard for tv anime.  The music was pretty good and the ED was very fitting.  As for the OP.... it was good but it felt odd having something fast paced for such a slow and somber anime.Twin Spica is a character driven story about a group of friends that want to become astronauts.  However, the story losses focus a bit in the middle and the ending maybe a bit too open for most people.  Overall Twin Spica is very heartwarming, heartbreaking, and somber piece. academy.

As for the ending, it may be a bit too open for some.  There are a lot of unanswered questions especially Marika and may seem to be an odd place to stop.  However, considering the nature of the anime I felt that it was perfectly fine.As for the technical aspects, nothing stood out too much.  The character designs reminded me Tezuka Osamu and Studio Gibli works.  Fantastic Children comes to mind in terms of similar character designs.  Animation was standard for tv anime.  The music was pretty good and the ED was very fitting.  As for the OP.... it was good but it felt odd having something fast paced for such a slow and somber anime.Twin Spica is a character driven story about a group of friends that want to become astronauts.  However, the story losses focus a bit in the middle and the ending maybe a bit too open for most people.  Overall Twin Spica is very heartwarming, heartbreaking, and somber piece."", ""I loved this anime.Story:       The storyline is simple, sweet, and straight forward.   You can not help getting caught up with it.  I do wish they had of carried the story on longer, but the end they chose feels right. The bit in there about the clone I did not really understand its significance; but all and all very enjoyable.Artwork:    I actually really liked the art work for this one.  The 'washed' out feel of the backgrounds lend to the slow pace of the story.    There is not a lot...of back ground animation..  most scene backgrounds are still, except for the story characters (not a lot of Traffic, people, etc, etc).   For me, this added to the feel of the story.Sound:      It was ok.  Spoken Dialog and the soundtrack/background noise had a nice balance.  The music did not grab me, or leave any real impression on me actually.  But it did not irritate me either, so all is good.All in all, It was a great watch.  It was refreashing to sit back and just watch a well told story.  No real action, violence, fan service, etc.  This one carries itself on content alone.  Also, the simplicity and concept of the story can be enjoyed by all viewers. of back ground animation..  most scene backgrounds are still, except for the story characters (not a lot of Traffic, people, etc, etc).

The anime appears to take place in the near-future considering Japan\'s astronautical advances have led it to just start appointing younger astronauts for the journey up in space. In this case, Asumi and a number of students her age have enrolled at a space school that recently started up where they are trained in understanding all that is needed to be known about living in space and dealing with differing situations...that could occur, said training involving regular physical activity, simulated scenarios and understanding how the physics in space are much different from being on Earth. Considering my exposure to Rocket Girls and Space Brothers allowed me to gain familiarity with how astronauts are trained and both were getting backing from NASA and/ or JAXA, it appeared Twin Spica believably depicted the rigid training and knowledge one has to go through and gain in order to be an astronaut, a definite plus for this series.The anime also has its supernatural elements shown through Asumi\'s interactions with the ghost of Mr. Lion, an astronaut who fell victim to a horrible space shuttle crash 15 years prior to the present events of Twin Spica. Mr. Lion serves as Asumi\'s inspiration to wanting to be an astronaut and serves mostly as an observer to many of the major events that effect Asumi throughout the series. One notable episode even features a dark dream where Asumi encounters the spirit of her dead mother on the Sanzu River, Japan\'s river of the underworld, that serves as a major element to the girl\'s character.The supernatural and sci-fi elements to Twin Spica though are mostly secondary though to the title\'s focus on Asumi. The series quite often switches between past and present time frames in focusing on major events that effected the young girl\'s life from the loss of her mother from the mentioned space shuttle crash to her enrollment at the space school. Her story mostly serves to be an inspirational one considering the hardships she endured in her past from her father\'s connection to the shuttle crash and her out-of-place behavior to get a shot at fulfilling her childhood dream of being an astronaut.Other characters that Marika comes to encounter also get their focus to see how they interact around Asumi and what motivations they have for either wanting to be an astronaut or trying to help or deter Asumi in any way. Notable elements of the show\'s character focus that got my interest came from how the space shuttle disaster effected characters who experienced its events and Marika\'s background. The former gets a great amount of focus through different points of the series, past and present, as Twin Spica introduces workers involved in the space shuttle program and civilians who were effected by the tragedy to any degree, including Asumi and her father. Marika\'s story made for the most interesting character focus I seen in the show as she seemed to have hardships placed upon her from her overprotective father who doesn\'t consider her to be the ""real Marika"" and seeming to suffer from some sort of illness as she tries distancing herself from both problems to be her own person. Sadly, both elements to the series never get fully fleshed out as the series was left open-ended following a major arc involving the show\'s cast.The visuals to Twin Spica are nothing special as character designs are a bit on the plain side and the animation doesn\'t stick out too prominently compared to anything noteworthy like Heat Guy J and Last Exile that aired during 2003. Scenery is decently drawn with vivid colors and having a good amount of detail to the show\'s different settings.Overall, Twin Spica made for an engaging and worthwhile watch thanks to its solid mix of sci-fi and supernatural elements coming from Asumi\'s interactions with Mr. Lion and her journey in becoming an astronaut. This is a worthwhile ""hidden gem"" anime that is worth seeking out if you\'ve already seen plenty of licensed anime titles. that could occur, said training involving regular physical activity, simulated scenarios and understanding how the physics in space are much different from being on Earth.

This is a worthwhile ""hidden gem"" anime that is worth seeking out if you\'ve already seen plenty of licensed anime titles.', ""Futatsu no Spica is great on being something. There are many intertwined connections between characters, extensive backstories and great character moments. But the biggest thing, that is missing, is the conclusion.Futatsu no Spica covers the first 25 chapters of the manga in 20 episodes. This is roughly 28% of the material, and, thusly, leave many unanswered questions in the end. Not to mention that, especially in the later episodes, some key parts are changed to fit into the anime format. All these changes are mainly made because the anime finished when only 30 chapters were released.But this wasn't the only issue. As being a drama...series, Futatsu no Spica indulges itself in its slow pace. But don't misunderstand slow for being bad. It takes careful time to develop its moments and releases the emotional tension of the characters and the audience at the right moment, especially in the earlier episodes. The later episodes felt more rushed in some places as the material got scarce. And some of the episodes don't even have a emotional payoff even tho those heavily relied on them.For characters, the main cast is well developed and are partly loosely connected by the main incident of the plot, a rocket crash in an urban area. But the good characters, sadly, end here as most of the secondary characters seem to be almost single-minded. Probably the biggest offender of this is Sano-sensei, one of the casts teachers. He has a big grudge towards the main characters for being the daughter of one of his ex-colleagues. While he gets an epiphany and redemption at the end of his arc, he simply vanishes from the plot, never to be seen again in the anime.All in all, Futatsu no Spica was made to early. If the studio has waited more to let the manga finish, or at least progress more, it probably would be one of the best drama series. But for now all its flaws can be traced back to the fact, that the anime was made when the manga was early in its chapters. It is still great, but the end feels very lackluster in comparison to the rest. series, Futatsu no Spica indulges itself in its slow pace. But don't misunderstand slow for being bad.

Future GPX Cyber Formula,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1391/Future_GPX_Cyber_Formula,"[""Cyber Formula series has been keeping its position at the top of my favourite list for a long long time. Of course, I'm not just talking about the TV series, but also the sequel OVAs as well. It's created by Sunrise, a studio well known for mecha genre anime.In a nut shell, Cyber Formula is about car racing (Grand Prix), but there's a catch. It takes place in a near future, where the technology is more advanced. All cars are equiped with a computer system that aids the racer in many ways such as giving advice and tips, detecting dangers ahead, and basically fulfilling drivers'...wishes. The computers understand human languages and can somewhat intereact with people.This TV series was first aired in 1991, so it's considered as an old school anime I guess.SYNOPSISIt is 2015. Kazami Hayato, a 14 year old boy gets involved in an unexpected event that eventually leads him to becoming a driver in Cyber Formula Grand Prix. Racing cars are equipped with advanced computer navigation system that can interact with its driver to aid and fulfil driver’s needs. With “Asurada” a racing machine that was created by his father, Hayato and his team take on the world’s best drivers in order to become the youngest champion in the history of Grand Prix.STORYIn a sense, it has a story of typical sport anime. A main character tries to become the best at what he does, in this case it's car racing. You will definitely see a lot of car racings in this anime. What makes racing unique in this anime is that each round takes place in different parts of the world with many different and difficult obstacles that racers have to face. It’s not your typical “just go around in circle” car racing. This series also shows us what kind of hardships and challenges that racers face while striving forward to their goals. What makes Cyber Formula shine are all the intense dramas that take place, complimented by some timely humour and heart warming moments.ARTWell, it's an old TV series and considering when it came out, it's not too bad.  There are some inconsistencies in that some scenes are flat coloured (one tone) while some scenes have shadings (two tones), but it didn't bother me too much, maybe because I'm used to a lot of the old school anime series. Character designs are quite nice looking and I felt that the designs suit the personalities very well. The highlights of this anime are the racing machines, designed by one of my favourite artists, Shoji Kawamori. The racing machines look very unique, but believable, which is always important to me. Oh, did I mention they have boosters?SOUNDI really loved the soundtracks in the anime. They do have that 90’s nostalgic feel to them, which I enjoy a lot. Intense moments, sad moments, heart warming moments… They are all complimented well by great music (rock music is quite prominent). OP and ED songs are great. I’ve been listening to them since over a decade ago and I still enjoy them to this date. Finally, voice acting isn't flawless, but it's very solid as expected like most other anime. I think they found right voices for all the characters.CHARACTERSNo story is great without good characters and Cyber Formula has them all. There are some characters who are just like us, who we can relate to. Then there are characters with unique personalities, which strengthens the enjoyment of the show. Another charm to this anime is character developments, mostly the drivers who face obstacles and hardships that they've never faced before. I could personally feel for them and sometimes I found myself really rooting for someone who I didn't think I'd be rooting for before.ENJOYMENTI’m not a racing fan and I don’t watch racing. However, Cyber Formula really takes it to the next level not only because it is futuristic, but you can see all the dramas that take place during races (unlike TV broadcasts). I think this anime has great replay value.OVERALLI remember when I was a little kid, I'd come home from school and was hardly able to wait for Cyber Formula to play on TV. Not only can kids enjoy this, but I think many grown ups will still find this series quite entertaining. If you can get over the fact that this is an older anime, you will be hooked (especially for sports/mecha fans). There are OVAs, which are sequels to the TV series. They have more mature feel to it, along with skyrocketed art quality!As I have a special nostalgic attachment to this series, I'd personally give this an overall score of 10. However I know I'm little biased and just objectively speaking, I'd give a solid 8. It's a fun, unique anime that's filled with excitement and heartwarming moments. So if you have some time, give this anime a shot! wishes.

Found the entire series with English subs and I went to town! Very fun series that feels grounded in how they take physics and engineering then exaggerate it for special moves.The fact that the legendary Shoji Kawamori was the mecha designer explains how gorgeous the Cyber Formula cars look even after 15 years.Without spoiling too much, the main characters and racers are a joy to watch. Even though mostly five racers have the most characterization, the show never feels...bogged down when it comes to drama. Since it's a 90s show, lots of old tropes especially in regards to childhood romance or rivalry are here.The races themselves are surprisingly tense but also believable enough that you don't feel cheated by the results. The filler episodes that allow Hayato to display his and Asurada's skills or tools aren't that engaging but, since this was aimed at kids, I can forgive it.All in all I was very glad to watch this series. I look forward to the OVA series and I'm glad to have found a simple and fun racing anime. bogged down when it comes to drama.

Gatchaman Crowds: Embrace,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23703/Gatchaman_Crowds__Embrace,"[""So, are we gonna be seeing more of Katze Berg? I know that the 2nd season is still far ahead, so I gonna cut to the chase as I make my 1st lousy review.StorySo what we have was something that is connected to the parent anime, so therefore this 1 off special can be considered as an extra episode. Plotwise, there isn't much to say something that connects to the parent anime, the only consultation here was about Katze Berg as we see him........or her being absorb by Hajime. So I guess it is safe to say that this 1 off special is all about...Rui, Katze and Hajime, since it does revolve around them, so my score for this category is a 5.ArtWhat I like about the illustration was modern bohemian style that has been applied to every aspect of the anime, so my score for this part is very good 8.SoundI gonna give it a 7 since I like the opening, closing, the action them and the voices of Hajime, Rui and Katze since the inflection was well suited for their character.CharacterAs much as I like Hajime, Rui and Katze, I very disappointed that director  Kenji Nakamura has sidelined the main characters for  the latters, it was suppose to be Sagane, Utsutsu, Joe, paiman and OD who were suppose to be the main characters, unfortunately he overshadowed them with the mentioned 3, so a 3 it is for this part.EnjoymentFor the most part, this special was quite annoying, tbh, but seeing what happen to Katze did provide me with some sort of enjoyment, but barely so I'm gonna say that I'm giving this category a 4.OverallI still can't say if this anime from season one up to the upcoming season 2 would qualify as a remake of the 1970's  anime or a spin off of the live action movie Gatchaman. But from the looks of it, it seems like a series of it's own, Now I aware that the review I'm making is for this special but like I've said this is connected to the parent anime so technically it was part of season 1, well anyways it was still worth watching.............but only barely.Btw: overall- it is a 4.  utsuutsu shimasu Rui, Katze and Hajime, since it does revolve around them, so my score for this category is a 5.ArtWhat I like about the illustration was modern bohemian style that has been applied to every aspect of the anime, so my score for this part is very good 8.SoundI gonna give it a 7 since I like the opening, closing, the action them and the voices of Hajime, Rui and Katze since the inflection was well suited for their character.CharacterAs much as I like Hajime, Rui and Katze, I very disappointed that director  Kenji Nakamura has sidelined the main characters for  the latters, it was suppose to be Sagane, Utsutsu, Joe, paiman and OD who were suppose to be the main characters, unfortunately he overshadowed them with the mentioned 3, so a 3 it is for this part.EnjoymentFor the most part, this special was quite annoying, tbh, but seeing what happen to Katze did provide me with some sort of enjoyment, but barely so I'm gonna say that I'm giving this category a 4.OverallI still can't say if this anime from season one up to the upcoming season 2 would qualify as a remake of the 1970's  anime or a spin off of the live action movie Gatchaman.

The story, already on a long nosedive since the first act, finally hit rock bottom and dug just a bit deeper. Everything built up was waved away, and the few remaining threads of interest cut short. The last few minutes, especially, were a new height in aggravating bafflement.No wonder then, that exactly those last few minutes are what Embrace fills out. I won't assume anything about the production, whether it was not...being able to get a double-length timeslot, or some pacing disagreement, but whatever the case the version of Episode 12 that aired was the wrong one. I can't give Embrace too much credit, after all it didn't fix the rest of the show's problems, but it did fix the one most significant.----The bulk of the new footage in Embrace covers an additional confrontation with Berg Katze, interposed around the final scenes of Gatchaman Crowds. While I don't want to spoil the ending of the series proper, it doesn't make a lick of sense. Embrace successfully rectifies this, by way of adding a proper climax to the story, rather than what was in the aired version. Aside from a few more, calmer scenes to close off the rest of the characters' stories, that is about all that is added.----And I am at an absolute loss as to why this wasn't the aired version. Not only is it far more fitting as a conclusion, removing the additional footage leaves a ridiculously huge plot hole. I would say that Embrace is not just the better version of Episode 12, but the real version.Gatchaman Crowds itself is still a very poor show, but at least this alternative finale makes it a tiny bit less so. being able to get a double-length timeslot, or some pacing disagreement, but whatever the case the version of Episode 12 that aired was the wrong one.

Me neither, but I’m pretty sure this story is something that might pop into your head if you did.  Get ready for the ride of your life as you follow two cardboard cutouts into a cluster of strange and meaningless scenes. Usually stories have linear plots and character developments with a twist at the end that makes...everything make sense. Gisaburou Sugii throws all of that out the windows. Night on the Galactic Railroad is a tale that will leave you shocked at the fact that you just spent over an hour of your life watching nothing.Animation (1/10)Bambi was made in 1942 and the animation still hold up to this day. Night on the Galactic Railroad was made in the mid 1980’s (38 years later) and the animation was terrible. This is a slideshow of a movie. Almost every shot is either a panning shot or a series of recycled animation.Sound (1/10)Never has there been a more disturbing sound track in anime. For 113 minutes I squirmed in my seat out of discomfort. The soundtrack consists of nothing but scary, creepy, and unsettling music. Even if the characters are going through something heartfelt or loving the music would cut in and ruin everything. The quality of the music is also a problem. This static music not only sounds bad but it breaks all illusion of immersion, destroying the atmosphere, which in all honesty is a breath of fresh air.Characters (1/10)Have you ever sat down and looked at a piece of cardboard covered in crayon scribble. That’s basically the experience of watching these characters on the screen. There has never been a more cold hearted character as Giovanni. This ice cold cat stares without compassion as children drown before his eyes. The only other being that is as heartless as Giovanni is his prick friend Campanella. This couple stares poker-faced as they see horrific sights and atrocities committed in front of them. It does not matter what these characters go through, their facial expressions will not change in the slightest.Enjoyment (1/10)The sound scraped against my ears, the animation scraped against my eyes, and the story scraped against my soul. This movie was uncomfortable, horribly written, and everything about it made me want to turn it off. This was a train-wreck of a movie.Other ThoughtsI would not recommend this movie to anyone and neither should you. everything make sense. Gisaburou Sugii throws all of that out the windows.

To be completely honest, I think I would've been seriously scared had I watched this when I was younger - it's quite creepy at times. Almost all characters in NotGR are cats with human proportions for some reason. I don't know if this was the case in the original book, but I never felt like it mattered, actually. Judging from the synopsis, it was because the animators were lazy, and that may've been the case for all I know.The story...starts off on an Italian-esque countryside, on the day of the so called Centaurus Festival.  We are introduced to the movie's main character, a blue cat named Giovanni, who apparently is being bullied because of his father's line of work (smuggler) and is living together with his sister and sickly mother. When the night of the festival draws near, he is once again ostracized by the other kids - or should I say kittens? - and runs up on a hill from which he gazes up on the starry sky with awe. Suddenly, a flash of light appears and with it a magnificient train, which he boards together with his only friend Campanella, who was following him up the hill. Together they embark on a compelling journey as the train moves across the Milky Way.The first thirty or so minutes of the movie are horribly slow, but after the characters have boarded the train, the pacing is screwed up a notch or two.With the movie being made in 1985, it's no surprise that its animation is dated. Especially the characters look very simple, without much detail to them. On the other hand, the sceneries the two cats encounter during their journey are highly imaginitive; a walnut-littered excavation site of some kind of gigantic dinosaur skeleton; an immense field of corn with an unsuspended pendulum swinging in the blue sky above. And the like. I don't want to spoil too much, but there are some really interesting vistas to be seen. Night on the Galactic Railroad might not be as technically competent as contemporary Ghibli movies, but it certainly has got heart.Cats and even some humans board the train and disappear into thin air as suddenly as they came, lending the movie an even more mysterious atmosphere. There aren't any deep personalities to be found here, though, but I doesn't matter - it's the journey and the journey alone that is the core of this movie and it's interesting enough.Night on the Galactic Railroad features mostly classical music. Among the tracks we find the New World Sympony and Halleluja Chorus for example. Looking at the latter of those two, it's not too surprising that there are some Christian elements incorporated into the story more or less obviously, like it or not. Putting that aside, the music fits the mood most of the time, but there are some creepy, more ambient tunes that seem sort of misplaced in their context. Which in a way only serves to make the atmosphere even more creepy.So, to summarize, this movie was quite a trip. It's very slow-paced in the beginning, but if you get past the first boring thirty minutes, you're in for an experience unlike any other. starts off on an Italian-esque countryside, on the day of the so called Centaurus Festival.

Just about two little cat boys who ride a giant train and travel across the universe, in it all being a metaphor for dying and being taken to heaven.While this film is very slow and can drag at moments, its extremely atmospheric. The inside of the train and the cats are nothing special but some of the backgrounds are STUNNING. Things like the giant cross and fields seen from the train look very...well drawn, especially for the time this movie was made.It should also be noted that the main theme is one of my favorite orchestrated pieces of all time. Such a beautiful and haunting tune, combining a music box and the ticking of a clock.This movie's ending also caught me off guard completely. This is a G rated movie, meant for children, but it has one of the most bleak and nihilistic endings I have ever seen. Seriously, if you would have showed me this movie as a kid I would have been very confused, but this does not mean the ending is bad by any means. It suits this movie perfectly, being so eerie and downright startling.Overall, this is a movie I would recommend if you want to watch a classic, artbook of a film. Don't come for a linear story. Come for the capturing atmosphere, bleak tone and beautiful OST. Its not for everyone, but it is a one of a kind movie with heart behind it. well drawn, especially for the time this movie was made.It should also be noted that the main theme is one of my favorite orchestrated pieces of all time.

It has the quality that some movies have to resemble a  work of art, like a painting that draws you into it and makes you spend some time just appreciating it. I don't mind low pacing in general, I actually like it, and  here the low-pacing is an extra plus that increases appreciation time. I could just watch it again and again.And it is not just empty beauty. The...story is touching, deep, and emotional, and just adds to the overall beauty of everything. It's actually much more serious than I was expecting, with some dark revelations and concepts, although there is enough hope in it. It's surely something that will be stuck in my soul for some time.An interesting comment is that I found it to be actually more concrete than the general consensus. Sure, the sequences have a strong abstract and symbolic element, however, many events do have a concrete explanation or receive one after we learn more of what is happening.From all of the above, it's inevitable to conclude that the movie has the following qualities: abstract elements, symbolism, dream-like feeling, depth, and slow-pacing. It's also imperative to say that the story-telling is highly unconventional and requires the appropriate attitude to be appreciated. For some, like me, this means immediate recommendation. For others, it can mean a sound no. What it doesn't mean, however, is that it is just psychedelic bullshit; maybe it's just not for you. If you feel like the elements above appeal to you, I'd say it's a must. Break the barrier of infinite superficial and popular content, reach to the forgotten realms of the underground, and enjoy this hidden but preserved masterpiece. story is touching, deep, and emotional, and just adds to the overall beauty of everything.

I don't even know if I can call it a movie, because it's nothing short of an experience. It's a languid, heavy exploration of the cosmos, relying heavily on esoteric symbolism and the lack of interaction projected AS interaction. Screenshots and short clips don't do it justice; just like a Captain Beefhart album, this is something that you need to sit down and take in in one sitting with no distractions.The only thing I didn't give a perfect score to was the art, but please know that...the art is gorgeous and the only reason I left off a point was because the high foreheads of the cats bothered me a little bit. Aside from that, I don't see any flaws.Also: do not watch this movie if you want to watch a happy movie. This is not a happy movie. It does not have any happy parts. And the ending made me cry. A lot. For a while. But I still think it's an experience worth having, and even though it isn't happy, I did find it enjoyable. the art is gorgeous and the only reason I left off a point was because the high foreheads of the cats bothered me a little bit.

Sometimes it doesn’t flow smoothly. If you are looking for an action-packed movie, this is not for you. I think this is a movie to take a moment and just watch it, but sometimes the movie kind of stops and that can be bothering. Also the story is very philosophical, so the meaning of the movie isn’t evident the first time you watch it. I had to read an analysis of...the book to completely understand it.The art is ASTONISHING. The music was composed by Haruomi Hosono and is sometimes eerie, but also very beautiful. The art of the movie is magnificent and oneiric (also kinda trippy tbh)The characters are cute kitties! I love the character design of the protagonists, but it is kind of cliché since it’s pretty easy to tell them apart from the rest of the cast who just look like normal cats. The cats on the train also have good designs.Also I have a special feeling for this movie for one reason: Esperanto. Miyazawa Kenji (the author of the original book) was very interested in Esperanto, and the creators of the movie decided to use this language in the film. There’s even an Esperanto version of “Nearer my good to thee” on this movie! That’s amazing and gives an interesting atmosphere to the movie.

On one hand it seems to be quite a subtle anime with deep and hidden meanings, on the other hand it\'s so booooriiiiing. One thing I am sure of though, is that in terms of effective audience targeting, this anime badly misses its mark. It\'s meant to be for children, but it\'ll be a miracle to find some that can actually sit out the whole film and absorb some of its meanings. For one thing the pacing is far too slow for children, and for another it\'s far too incoherent....In fact, even I had trouble keeping concentration, especially during the first half. My mind would often start wandering and then I\'d suddenly realise that the scene\'s completely changed without me noticing, which is NOT a good sign. I couldn\'t be arsed to rewind either cos it just didn\'t seem to be worth it. The rather outdated production doesn\'t really help. Though the background music itself is really good, it\'s often overly quiet, which can make the film feel quite flat at times. The Second half of the film made me perk up, especially with the incident involving the ship. I think it was then that I realised that there\'s a lot more to this anime than meets the eye. Thinking back on it, perhaps other scenes such as the bird hunting one that seemed so pointless at the time actually has hidden meanings as well. Damned if I know what they are though.There\'s a great twist at the end that I really didn\'t see coming - maybe it\'s \'cos I can be a bit dense when it comes to predicting twists. I especially like the way the main character Giovanni held on to the milk he was taking to his mother despite him getting a big shock. There is no cliched smashing of the bottle, and I thought that was a nice touch. The strong ending made me feel I really need to re-watch it at some point in order to understand the movie better... but the dead slow pacing is putting me off re-watching it any time in the near future.To sum up: An overly long, boring anime but with a deeper story full of religeous themes under its yawn inducing exterior. I find it puzzling that it has been made into a two hour film when it would have fared far better as a one and a half hour one with which the pacing would have been less painful.

It\'s based on a children\'s story written by Miyazawa Kenji. It\'s a novel that\'s unfinished. Miyazawa was still polishing the middle of the piece when he died in 1933. The novel was posthumously published as it was and it became a classic work of children\'s literature. In 1985 it was made into an anime film. How well does it work? Let\'s take a look and find out.We open with our protagonist, Giovanni attending classes. Giovanni attends school with all the other cats......Yes, cats. All the characters in this were replaced by talking cats most of which need to put on pants. For those of you who aren\'t familiar with the book, it\'s not originally about cats. That pointless change aside, Giovanni goes into town to get milk for his sick mother while all the other cats are attending the starlight festival. Giovanni stops to rest on a hill when he hears a train. A train that stops right in front of him. He gets on board to find that his best friend, Campanella is there as well. The two ride to a variety of different locations but what\'s their destination and what\'s waiting for them when they arrive? I\'m not going to give that away, even though it\'s kind of obvious. The symbolism in this is pretty effective and it ties together nicely. I\'m not even going to complain about it being kind of heavy handed since this is a kid\'s movie. The film does have some flaws though. There are some really slow stretches, especially in the beginning, where nothing of value happens. Changing all of the characters to cats would be fine, albeit pointless, but there are three human characters introduced later which doesn\'t make sense. At least keep it consistent. The reason that Giovanni\'s on the train is pretty weak as well, especially when you figure out what its nature is. They also separate the scenes with chapter cards which show a mostly black screen with some words like ""Giovanni\'s Ticket"" or ""Apples"" which doesn\'t really work in a film. It just serves to bring the action to a grinding halt for several seconds each time.This film is more about the journey than it is the characters. The characters in this are a little deeper than those found in Animal Crossing, but they\'re still kind of shallow. And, honestly, they aren\'t as much fun. Giovanni and Campanella have a pretty good connection and Giovanni does develop a bit as a result of his experience, but aside from that there\'s not much to the characters.The art in this is a bit dated. To be fair, this movie is older than I am so that\'s only to be expected. The art actually does hold up quite well. The backgrounds are very well done and nicely detailed. There are some spectacular environments in this film, especially when they\'re showing constellations and representations thereof. The characters are the real weakness. Not because they\'re mostly drawn as cats, but because of their expressions. Most of the time the characters either look slightly surprised or just blank. Actually, that might explain why most of the characters are drawn as cats. Since it\'s more difficult to identify expressions on animals, it may have been a deliberate effort to conceal that flaw.The voice acting is pretty good. Both Tanaka Mayumi and Sakamoto Chika do well in their roles. The rest of the cast is decent enough, although most of them don\'t say much. The music in this is really well done. It goes perfectly with the art to maintain atmosphere.The yuri factor is a 1/10. There are only two important female characters. Giovanni\'s mom, and the inexplicably human girl they meet on the train and they never meet.My final rating for Night on the Galactic Railroad is a 7/10. It has some weaknesses in terms of story but overall it has aged pretty well. It may not be as good as the novel but it\'s still a solid film and I think it\'ll prove to be enjoyable whether you\'re a child or not.

This is an emotional ride about friendship but also about life. Its a simple, dreamy anime where things are simply happening and you need to just stay along for the ride instead of nit picking every detail.Story- 10/10Its fun, you just need to listen to it and not think...too much. seriously dont, that anime is only fun if you\'re just listening to it, especially with someone else.Characters- 9/10they\'re not really special or different, but once you get to the end of the movie you still feel like you miss them for some reason. because even if you dont have multiple episodes to get attached they still leave a lasting impact on you.Art- 10/10interestingly enough in the manga the artstyle was quite different because the characters were actually not anthropomorphic cats. but im so glad they decided to change that for the anime because it really makes in all better. it definitely adds to the ""dreamy"" and ""weird"" feel that this anime has and i think changing the characters for cats was a really smart choice.soundtrack- 10/10The music in the anime actually makes the atmosphere a lot more tense and scary than it should. it adds a lot of suspense and its honestly what makes the anime even better. what couldve been a simply dreamy anime had a lot more substance all because of the soundtrack. its beautiful, sounds good and really shows the difference between a simple ride and a more suspensful moment.overall im glad i got to watch this anime, its amazing and i recommend it to literally anyone who\'s reading this right now! good luck! too much. seriously dont, that anime is only fun if you\'re just listening to it, especially with someone else.Characters- 9/10they\'re not really special or different, but once you get to the end of the movie you still feel like you miss them for some reason. because even if you dont have multiple episodes to get attached they still leave a lasting impact on you.Art- 10/10interestingly enough in the manga the artstyle was quite different because the characters were actually not anthropomorphic cats. but im so glad they decided to change that for the anime because it really makes in all better. it definitely adds to the ""dreamy"" and ""weird"" feel that this anime has and i think changing the characters for cats was a really smart choice.soundtrack- 10/10The music in the anime actually makes the atmosphere a lot more tense and scary than it should. it adds a lot of suspense and its honestly what makes the anime even better. what couldve been a simply dreamy anime had a lot more substance all because of the soundtrack. its beautiful, sounds good and really shows the difference between a simple ride and a more suspensful moment.overall im glad i got to watch this anime, its amazing and i recommend it to literally anyone who\'s reading this right now! good luck!', ""+Beautifully atmospheric+Simple character animation but gorgeous scenery+Very artsy and symbolic+Slower paced but I like it+The characters were cute+Surreal-Yeah definitely for the more creative, artsy type (Which isn't really negative tbh)As I said, this movie is very atmospheric, and very dreamlike. Yes, it's very slow paced, not much happens at once, but personally I love these types of movies now and then. These types of movies are always such a nice breather from the usual anime I watch.

It's more something for...people who are creative (What I mean by that is people who are, daydreamers, surrealist, artist ect ect).But who knows, if you can handle slower paced movies I recommend checking it out. It's a pleasant experience. people who are creative (What I mean by that is people who are, daydreamers, surrealist, artist ect ect).But who knows, if you can handle slower paced movies I recommend checking it out. It's a pleasant experience."", 'Night on the Galactic Railroad is a slow-burning reflective piece about death and self-sacrifice. The story follows Giovanni, an absent minded yet diligent working class boy, through his night whisked away on an inter-dimensional trail ride. Though adapted in 1985 from the 1934 cult novel of the same name, the work’s enduring influence on anime cannot go unnoticed. This is what drew me to the work initially as I felt my understanding of shows like Mawaru-Penguindrum and Giovanni’s Island were lacking. After viewing the film I quickly realized how much wider this scope of impact was. For example, its persistently soft and otherworldly feel, and...ephemeral characters are all over the waterside train scenes in Miyazaki’s Spirited Away. I was pleased to find that the film stands on its own despite its age and countless imitators.This owes to its characters above all else. I was initially off put by the stolid reactions to the fantastical and terrible situations many of the cast found themselves confronted with. However, it becomes evident that this was the point in a scene where Giovanni easily shrugs off  disparaging remarks from  his schoolmates. Giovanni and the rest of the cast have an enviable stoicism about them that the author endearingly asks the audience to imitate. Throughout the film characters willfully resign to their fates trading faith for fear. Many instances of Christian symbolism and ritual are employed to reinforce this theme. The conclusion seems to be patently Christian too - service to others is happiness. However the film’s incorporation of religion, though reverent and unassuming, is somewhat eclipsed for a broader more metaphorical take on its precepts.While the animation wasn’t impressive even by 80’s standards, it still manages to be engaging. The character animation was given the most fluidity. The film is without any grand action set-pieces but what action there is is at least colorful and stylized. The backgrounds were the most unique aspect of the art direction. They have a stripped-down psychedelic design aesthetic to them. This paired with the sparse, lightly distorted and swelling synth tracks makes for a compelling atmosphere. Both the sound design and art direction vary enough while maintaining an otherwordly theme that creates a strong sense of adventure.Night on the Galactic Railroad takes the pauses it needs to. It works remarkably well as an unhurried, simple and multi-dimensional meditation on life. It is a journey that borrows from old literature and history itself so well that even when the references are not understood it still speaks well to the themes it sets out to explore - another undeniable anime classic. ephemeral characters are all over the waterside train scenes in Miyazaki’s Spirited Away.

He doesn’t really have any recollection of getting a ticket. On the train he finds his (probably only) friend - Campanella. Together they travel through the galaxy on the way to the edge of the universe. During the ride they meet a bunch of people who have different takes on life and witness a lot of things that would make You question...Your sanity on a normal day, and develop their relationship further.The longer the ride goes the more it is obvious that Giovanni is a bit special. Something that is shown by a unique ticket he possesses. A ticket so unique that even a passenger who seems to have a lot of experience with the galactic train, never saw it before.I know this description is a bit dry but I really want to avoid spoilers.When it comes to Giovanni and Campanella themselves there isn’t much to say. They are pretty much just proxies for the viewers. The only things that we know is that Giovanni doesn’t have many friends, is bullied because of his father and takes care of his mother. Campanella on the other hand is Giovanni's only friend, is stoic and cares about Giovanni. For a story such as this it is a bit on the low info side and it is to the detriment of the drama. But given the story is aimed at children I guess I can live with it.While not as mindfucking as “Angel's Egg” and being pretty heavy handed with its metaphors it is still a very atmospheric movie with a pretty universal message. Both Giovanni and Campanella, despite travelling on the same train don’t witness all the same things and there is a good reason for that that is revealed towards the end but You can easily figure it out sooner.The movie has a lot of scenes that are there just to build the drama and a lot of them are longer than they need to be. I can’t really get mad about that, a lot of movies from the 80s have scenes like that so it’s obviously a product of the times. That said, I do understand why some people think the movie is slow. Up until the halfway point the movie takes its time and builds the universe of the train. The thing that bugged me for a long time is that there are no clear rules to the train. We see things that could be interpreted as memories, hopes and even just the daily grind. It does get a little clearer towards the end but You never get the full picture.I really don’t want to spoil anything and talking about the plot would be mostly spoilers so…Despite being old with dated animation (the music is still wonderful) it’s a very solid movie. Being from 1985 I understand that not everyone would be willing or able to sit through it but I encourage You to do just that. You might be surprised by what You’ll find. Your sanity on a normal day, and develop their relationship further.The longer the ride goes the more it is obvious that Giovanni is a bit special.

I don’t think reading these spoilers will make your experience any worse, but I don’t explain the plot so some sections may be confusing.Night on the Galactic Railroad is a fantastic film. To summarize, it portrays a post-death journey about the pain of living and finding a path forward in a meaningless universe.You can easily read LGBTQ themes into it, an imposition more defensible for this work than for other anime films commonly read in this way (like Ocean Waves). Though there is...little explicit textual support for a relationship between the main leads, a queer reading is a valuable lens through which to view the film.The film establishes early and never breaks a relaxed, uncertain tone and slow, hypnotic pace, which affords the viewer space to chew on the film’s ideas and immerse in its world.This is accomplished through its editing and soundscape, which entrap the viewer in the film's rhythm, a space in which its ideas are readily absorbed by the viewer, even when expressed unclearly.This too holds the film back from becoming boring, allowing the viewer to reliably anticipate when the next cut or event will come, with no scene allowed to run too long.The soundtrack is fantastic, composed by Hosono Haruomi, it incorporates both Sci-fi and fantasy aesthetics to provide the otherwise flat setting an otherworldly texture.There are various aesthetic features I appreciate about the film. I'm a fan of weathering storms, that is, I enjoy the feeling of being enclosed in a space amidst a force over which I have no control. There you have nothing but your thoughts and the people you're with, it’s a space which forces meditation and introspection.When films embody this feeling it's typically framed as a plot device. Eight people trapped together amidst a blizzard have to solve a murder mystery. This isn't that. It's in no rush to provide distractions. It doesn’t only afford the viewer space to think, it forces them to. You are trapped alongside the characters and have no escape but thought. This feeling defines most of the film's mid section, and adds weight to even the most mundane details and conversations.The film too shares the vibe of the “liminal space” aesthetic that blew up online last year, a fact I can definitely use to rope a few friends into watching it with me.While I'm sure most, like me, watched this to examine its influence on contemporary directors (Ikuhara in particular), it is worth approaching as its own artistic statement.Since it seems my reading is not the most common one online, I’ll make the case here by examining my favorite sequence.Throughout, we and protagonist Giovanni see through the train’s windows the various afterlifes at which riders arrive. But when the train clears of everyone but Giovanni and his best friend Campanella, and it approaches Campanella's destination, Giovanni sees nothing through the window but darkness. Campanella claims to see his mother waiting for him, while the viewer and Giovanni see only a black hole. Giovanni awakes, now back home, and Campanella has drowned.That moment seemed to me the film's thesis statement. We see in the afterlife our loved ones, eternal paradise, a flock of swans, an unknowing expanse. But really, there is nothing. And we, the living, have only hope.Early in the film we're presented with Giovanni's family situation. His mother is bedridden, his father is missing. The film doesn't resolve these plotlines, it leaves both the viewer and Giovanni to find their own paths forward. Giovanni's mom is sick, his father is missing, and his friend is dead. The universe doesn't care, roll credits.What does Giovanni do? Does he turn his sights to the railroad's destination, where all of this can just stop. Does he push forward in an absurd universe, towards an unknowable future. We aren't told, we aren't given the false impression that all of this has any purpose or end point.This is the effect of the film’s nontraditional narrative structure; leaving these plotlines open creates uncertainty. If the film concluded with these plotlines wrapping up and Giovanni growing as a result, it could leave the viewer believing all of this was somehow necessary, that without all of this suffering Giovanni could not have reached that desirable end point, and thus it all had meaning.The film instead leaves the viewer to contend with reality. People don’t die for good reasons, they just die. The universe is constructed such that people we love die for no reason and we’re left to pick up the pieces.And Night on the Galactic Railroad leaves us in this position, without satisfying conclusion, grasping for a path forward. It places the viewer and the protagonist in the same position as every living human, a miniscule piece of a meaningless cosmos operating on a set of arbitrary rules, indifferent to the suffering of those living in it.Night on the Galactic Railroad is a beautiful meditation on life, death, meaning, and the universe, and it fully deserves its cornerstone place in anime history. little explicit textual support for a relationship between the main leads, a queer reading is a valuable lens through which to view the film.The film establishes early and never breaks a relaxed, uncertain tone and slow, hypnotic pace, which affords the viewer space to chew on the film’s ideas and immerse in its world.This is accomplished through its editing and soundscape, which entrap the viewer in the film's rhythm, a space in which its ideas are readily absorbed by the viewer, even when expressed unclearly.This too holds the film back from becoming boring, allowing the viewer to reliably anticipate when the next cut or event will come, with no scene allowed to run too long.The soundtrack is fantastic, composed by Hosono Haruomi, it incorporates both Sci-fi and fantasy aesthetics to provide the otherwise flat setting an otherworldly texture.There are various aesthetic features I appreciate about the film.

This iconic film is something that bred films like Angel’s Egg and Yuasa Masaaki’s adaptation of Nekojiru-sou; this movie is a heavily surrealistic, auteur piece that breaches the boundaries of mortality and death. An unfettered classic that will send shivers down your spine with the eerie atmosphere and emotionally intense climax.The story begins with the protagonist, Giovanni, running errands for his sickly motherーwhich then turns into a magical adventure with the deuteragonistーthe protagonist’s closest friendーCampanella. Much...of this movie is quiet and contemplative, rather than filled with dialogue; every speech, action, and observation by a character in this film is intentionally there to scrub away Giovanni’s confusion and lead him to the grand realization towards the end.The pacing may seem slow, but the deliberation and the uncovering of mysteries throughout the breadth of the movie makes those solitary moments worth while. This series is similar to something like Neon Genesis Evangelionーwhere you watch it the first time to experience it and the second time is to analyze things that you may not have noticed before.This film left me feeling deeply lethargic and melancholic. It made me cherish the journey that I’ve embarked on with the people I love and how much I should treasure those moments while they’re still alive. An allégorie towards the strife of living itself. The subtly, care, and passion poured into this film can be felt. It is unlike anything that has ever existed in Japanese animation and I feel that it deserves the reverence that it gets from many long-time anime fans; a curio among most. It’s difficult to say much about this film without spoiling anything, but I definitely recommend the experience that this film brings to anyone who is willing to be confused at first, then sit through a slow burn, only to be immensely rewarded in the end.

I give Night on the Galactic Railroad a 7/10.', 'Based on the classic Japanese fantasy novel by Kenji Miyazawa written around 1927, Night on the Galactic Railroad is a bit of a story with major themes hidden and in plain sight. One theme in particular, “What is true happiness” is the focal point. It was directed by Gisaburou Sugii (Astro Boy episode director), and a slew of other notable staff members, most of which went on to promising careers in the anime industry as directors or studio founders. One of note was Kōichi Mashimo, whom founded Studio Bee Train (.hack//sign).The story centers on what appears to be a mix of an old Japanese town...with Italian influences, hence the two main characters names Giovanni and Campanella. All the major characters in the anime are depicted as cats as to mellow down the somewhat depressing overall mood. During the night in town, there is a star festival called the Centaurus Festival. However, due to our poor stricken main character, Giovanni must work and care for his family instead. He goes to get some milk at a dairy farm and falls asleep. A train appears, and somehow, he ends up boarding it. He is joined shortly thereafter by his only friend Campanella, who is wet for some reason. There, they both start a journey through the galaxy over the course of a single night meeting strange beings, Cats and humans alike, all of whom have interesting circumstances why and how they came to be on the train.Pacing wise, the anime is fairly slow, especially during the beginning with almost nothing significant happening other than giving the viewer an idea of the town and the people in it. Over the course across the Milky Way, there are imaginative visual, interesting ways of giving each theme an underlining meaning whether it is through classical music or symbolism, and even the importance in what the characters are saying creates deep philosophical thoughts.Based on the fact it is geared towards trying to teach children symbolism and themes, the anime hits the mark. However, the slow pacing and how tough it is to pick up on some of the more important meanings in some scenes leads to some viewers overcoming to boredom easily. Night on the Galactic Railroad has very enticing visuals, music, and generally makes up for the pacing once the characters get on the train. It’s an enjoyable ride from 30 minutes in to end, and worth a good watch to get a nice perspective on “What is true happiness?” with Italian influences, hence the two main characters names Giovanni and Campanella.

You have to think on a deeper level about what each scene actually means - just about all that happens has a deeper meaning/moral to it.Secondly - this movie is very abstract, the music is meant to be jarring and the art is meant to look unusual - that just gives it its unique style and feeling. I feel that it gets better and better the more you pick at its...scenes and think about what they truly mean.As a final note more towards the other reviews - I don’t get where people are saying that Giovanni and Campanella are in a relationship together, the movie has them as being friends (at least in the translation) or I’m just not getting something.All in all I absolutely recommend it to anybody that wants something to think about on a deeper level, although I don’t recommend it for people not thinking deeper - you will just see it as a nonsensical acid trip. scenes and think about what they truly mean.As a final note more towards the other reviews - I don’t get where people are saying that Giovanni and Campanella are in a relationship together, the movie has them as being friends (at least in the translation) or I’m just not getting something.All in all I absolutely recommend it to anybody that wants something to think about on a deeper level, although I don’t recommend it for people not thinking deeper - you will just see it as a nonsensical acid trip.', ""I wish I could say I enjoyed it and appreciate it for the art it surely is, I really wanted to like it. But I ended up being disappointed.First of all, the whole movie (even the everyday life scenes) have a strange and uncanny feeling to them, and often even a creepy one. I heard many people liked the mysterious atmosphere, but to me it was kind of off-putting.I also think the pace of the movie is too slow, at least for me. It was kind of boring for a decent amount of time.But my main issue with the movie is that I...didn't get most of the scenes in the railroad. They were just so weird - but (in my opinion) not an interesting or exciting kind of weird, but just a strange, off-putting one. The movie leaves me very frustrated because I can't understand it. I don't know if there is anything to understand, the scenes are probably just supposed to be creative and dreamy. But as I said, I found most of them pretty boring and alienating.The artstyle... I don't know. It's not bad, it has very pretty scenes, but there was also something putting me off again. The main characters have the same expression most of the time: a little surprised, but not very emotional.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll put it that way: There is a character with two kids who came from a ship, and he did a specific thing, that everyone seems to be okay with or even think it's good. I find the moral to be problematic in this scene.Finally, a positive point: I liked the ending and when you're realizing the real purpose of this railroad.So, this movie definitely made me think about it a lot.

If you like these sorts of movies, you’ll probably be able to find enjoyment in this one. It’s not entirely on the same level of weird, abstract/surreal as something like 2001 A Space Odyssey, but it’s approaching it.The characters are dreadful. They don’t react to anything that happens around them, even when insane things are occurring. It’s hard to talk about the characters because they do not do very much throughout the movie. Mostly we see shots of them looking at things and being...bored. I would say we’re shown their reactions, but as I already mentioned, the characters do not react to anything and have blank, bored looks plastered on their faces.Did I mention this movie is incredibly dull? Nothing even vaguely interesting happens until around 30-40 minutes in. And a lot of the things that occur before then are just shots of Giovanni walking. There is a lot of reused footage in this movie which contributes to the boredom. I would mention the story, but like I already said there isn’t one because not having a coherent plot makes the film “deep and introspective.” I wouldn’t complain about this so much, but this movie is just not visually entertaining at all. I find it frustrating that we’re shown random things with no buildup and somehow we’re supposed to find this emotional? It just feels like a lazy way of making the story seem “cerebral.”I liked the soundtrack, though a lot of the music feels misplaced. The animation and art are terrible for something made in the 1980s. bored.

Nothing even vaguely interesting happens until around 30-40 minutes in. And a lot of the things that occur before then are just shots of Giovanni walking. There is a lot of reused footage in this movie which contributes to the boredom. I would mention the story, but like I already said there isn’t one because not having a coherent plot makes the film “deep and introspective.” I wouldn’t complain about this so much, but this movie is just not visually entertaining at all. I find it frustrating that we’re shown random things with no buildup and somehow we’re supposed to find this emotional? It just feels like a lazy way of making the story seem “cerebral.”I liked the soundtrack, though a lot of the music feels misplaced. The animation and art are terrible for something made in the 1980s.', ""This movie is paradoxical for a number of reasons, but the most important one was how it merged a sense of calmness with unease. Its extremely slow pace was an open invitation to a very contemplative viewing experience. There is a generous abundance of silent moments in which the characters are able to allow their emotions to sink in, and in turn the viewer is allowed to interpret their thoughts and emotions. Inner monologues are practically non-existent, and the dialogue is enunciated very naturally, more for the benefit of the moment than for the viewers' comprehension. This is not a negative point, far from it....Those quiet scenes in which we are able to take in the atmosphere are meant to lead us into thought, into interpretation, and the message is either clear enough or just elusive enough to allow the imposition of certain key emotions of our own.This intent is at times truncated by the rather rigid animation, and while the character designs are memorable enough, they are not given much leeway in the form of facial expressions, so the conveyance of subtler emotions depends on the viewer's ability to project their own feelings into them to a certain degree. This is a shortcoming that has a significant impact on a movie that is so reliant on emotion rather than plot or character. Despite this, the visuals are for the most part a pleasure to observe, particularly the backgrounds. While not overly intricate, the art's ability to transmit a sense of welcoming warmth, of impending dread or absolute desolation should not go without mention. It is obvious that the director prioritized the environment over the people in it, and despite how harsh my wording may sound, let it be said that at no point do the characters look bad; at worst they are serviceable, and at best a little better than that. The rigidity that dictates their movement and reaction, while not awful, will serve as a deterrent for many people, and they should be made aware of that.I believe that what should be taken away from the film is its devotion to the establishment of a mood. It is an emotional experience, one that takes you to both beautiful and haunting spaces, that delves in the stark themes of solitude, isolation, hardship and death, as well as, more positively, on the value of a life well spent, endurance against its cruel realities, and even faith. This movie bears a surprisingly blatant religious charge whose effect with undoubtedly vary depending on the viewer. In my case, due to my lack of a potent religious background, I was not as touched as others may have.In any case, this movie is a study of the beautiful and the grim, a serene and entrancing experience that will demand patience from you, but whose fruit will be extremely fulfilling.Due to its pacing and this very clear focus on an element that does not appeal to the average viewer as much as character studies or plot driven stories might, I find myself hard pressed to issue an open recommendation. Despite all my commendations I would not qualify this movie as a required viewing for everyone, but if you are ever in the mood for a calming, personal experience, a journey of sorts to undertake (preferably alone), I would advice you to give this movie a chance.

Not Huh? Huh.This was Non-Sequitur the movie. Not much would happen, but at the same time, I would end up asking ""How did we get here? What are they talking about? How does that relate to what happened before this?"" Mixed feelings is what\'s appropriate for me, did I dislike it? Not, really, it was cute enough. Do I like it enough to potentially watch it again? Eh, I doubt it. Though, I still don\'t know if it\'s going to be one of those movies that I\'ll forget after a day or it\'s going to randomly pop in...my head making me question ""wait, there\'s a fake Heaven and a real Heaven?

It hit me now--this was exactly like what you experience in a dream--which works with this movie actually.I wouldn\'t call the main characters cardboard, per se, there are little mannerisms in their personality that keep them from that area.

You take a good chunk of time of slow ""slice of life"" before getting to the galaxy train bit and once you\'re there...you\'re definitely getting plenty of that train ride. So yeah, your mileage may vary a lot.

It's remarkable how lyrical it is, the mood and atmosphere building (especially sounds) is so neatly engineered, it really gets under your skin and you let it do so willingly.So far, the story seems to be about the inner and secret lives of animals, this is a very compassionate ode to our friends.

Huyao Xiao Hongniang: Zhu Ye,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38533/Huyao_Xiao_Hongniang__Zhu_Ye,"['It’s rare these days I would think about an anime, months after watching but the 7th season of Fox Spirit Matchmaker does just that. I know most people couldn’t even get through the 1st season and I almost didn’t too. The juvenile jokes, weird pacing and bad animation of season 1 was tough to get through but I’m glad I stuck with it. Fox Spirit Matchmaker is at its best when it focuses on telling love stories, exploring aspects of the many facets of love which isn’t often presented in anime. The basic premise involves fox spirits helping lovers to reunite in the present life...after reincarnation, specifically when one party is a human (with a limited lifespan) and the other, a demon (who lives much longer). Season 7 made a lasting impact on me - it did something different from the usual premise. The love story differs from the other seasons as the lovers are both human which made it more relatable. It got me thinking about how some marriages fell apart when the person you married is no longer the person you fell in love with.  For those who struggle to get through season 1, maybe give the series another shot by watching season 7 first - it’s sort of a prequel to the series, with much better animation and a cohesive storyline that focuses on telling what the series does best: love stories. after reincarnation, specifically when one party is a human (with a limited lifespan) and the other, a demon (who lives much longer).

Journey: Taiko Arabia Hantou de no Kiseki to Tatakai no Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48612/Journey__Taiko_Arabia_Hantou_de_no_Kiseki_to_Tatakai_no_Monogatari,"[""As of the writing of the review, only two projects are attributed to Manga Productions (including this project) so keep that in mind for the rest of the review. Toei Animations does not need any introduction. I watched the original Arabic version.The Journey is an ambitious but flawed experience. It is ambitious because it gambles its reception over the audience's acceptance or interest in Arabic culture. There is very little to take from the film if you're already well acquainted with Arabic culture and the Quranic legends. As a person who lived through and heard all those stories multiple times in his life, I'd say...I felt conflicted while watching the movie; there is the joy in having a legendary story animated in Japanese style, and the boredom of knowing exactly how the story will pan out.Starting with the premise of the film, it's an ode to Surah Al-Fil taken directly from the Quran as source material. The film also utilizes several other short stories to give the film the illusion of depth, but we'll take more about that soon enough. The story itself is adequate, it stays true to the source material and provides sufficient information at all stages without taking too much off the experience. What disrupts the enjoyment, however, are the short stories that are included to give the viewer this false sense of depth; the stories themselves do not add anything to the story, in fact, the film would probably be better received removing them altogether. They really cheaped out on them, and the stories (3 of them, if I recall correctly) are essentially glorified slideshows with decent art. They are mainly used as ideas that characters use to extract wisdom, motivation, and stoical qualities for application. The detail in them is great and appreciated, but the length it took them to divulge that information results in extreme boredom, where the viewer wishes the segment to end as quickly as possible.The art, to me, resembles the western adaptations of anime (Netflix adaptations and originals) more than the traditional Japanese productions. It focuses more on aesthetics rather than quality of the animation. Much of the fight scenes were anti-climactic because they were extremely brief and have no momentum to deliver.Voice acting for the Arabic dubs was unexpectedly good. The script of the dialogues was fun to hear and dissect because the characters converse using Classical Arabic (unspoken Arabic that is present and known only in texts, it was replaced by the more modernized version: Standard Arabic), and expresses itself more like stanzas in an elegant poem rather than just plain statements. This is usually the product of well-written Arabic prose.There is not much to say about the characters themselves, they are bare-bones and much of the cast simply exists because, well, the directors shoved them in there. Quantity over quality. The designs were average, while some characters looked pretty good; nothing much to be said about them. However, it is important to note that several historically accurate characters weren't given the time they deserved, such as the main antagonist, Abraha, for example.I viewed this movie with a friend of mine in the pandemic—we were the only persons in the theatre hall. I believe this greatly enhanced the experience. The enjoyment that can be taken from this anime would be the strict historical and cultural qualities, other than that, it is your average run-of-the-mill moderate budget anime movie.To conclude, this anime is an okay watch. If you're interested in the legends it depicts, go for it. If you're wishing to watch the stories you read in text your whole life come to life in animation (and presentation, but I digress), then go for it.

Unfortunately with that in mind the animation was bound to very severe constraints on what they could do.Art-The art was amazing in my opinion, nothing too wacky that deserves a 10 but it was decent. The major downfall in this anime was the pathetic powerpoint slides for...memory sequences... the whole point of an anime is to well... animate, so watching powerpoint slides to explain something unrelated to the main plot was unnecessary. If the entire movie excluded those PP slides I think the movie would\'ve been much better.Sound-Interesting sound choices, very Arabic. Nothing much to say.Character-This movie completely failed in anything character related, I disliked every character as they fail to make you care about anyone and 99% of the characters just shouldn\'t have existed as they literally added nothing. The anti-hero or whatever you call the ""bad guy that turns good"" was so out of place, I get that it\'s an anime but he didn\'t fit the scene at all with the white hair and blue clothes and his backstory was super lame [SPOILER] He saved the protagonist and made him escape from imprisonment, then he gets made that he actually escaped... what? The only cool character was the war general wearing a red scarf and guess what, he\'s the only character which they said nothing about, and that\'s what made him the most fun.Enjoyment-Like I said the story was limited because it\'s a story from the Quran. This shouldn\'t have been their first choice for an anime because you lose all the freedom with the possibilities. Watching the movie didn\'t get me excited.Summary-I wouldn\'t recommend watching this specific movie but I would keep an eye on their future works.

Living in Japan.Story:The Journey story is based from the Quran, and once it has been animated, I truly enjoyed seeing the life story that was animated and explained to us in such a simply way.

This anime also often explains short stories about the greatness of Allah\'s miracles which I think is good. However, you have to know that the story is limited because this is a story from the Koran. So there are several additional characters in this anime that don\'t fit...in the Koran so don\'t take them seriously.

Speaking as a Muslim, I am a bit disappointed to read bad reviews from other Muslims about this anime. Come on, Journey was made not totally by Muslims! We should be grateful they made Journey quite representative and realistic about Elephant War in 571 AD!Maybe I should give my review for each scope of the anime.Story: 8/10.Thanks to TOEI animations for filming such a beautiful Arabian movie WITHOUT changing any significant plot of the real event. I was quite surprised to see the ending. As a movie that was planned to be played on Cannes, I didn\'t think TOEI...would end Journey with ""that bird scene"" *no spoilers here*.Hmm...speaking as a movie enjoyer (not as Muslim), I would prefer if Journey more focused on the plots and actions, not the moral value. So people who are non-Muslim can watch this movie freely without being told about God multiple times (Journey\'s story happened before Islam was revealed tho).And yeah, to be honest, the stories about past believers were good, but they were added during important events where they were actually unnecessary, with too long duration.Art: 8/10.The art is quite compelling, although needs some improvements especially in war and fight scenes. Probably more blood would be interesting?Sound: 7/10.This is the first project, so I guess it\'s acceptable if Journey is incomplete in some parts, including theme songs. I enjoy the Arabian theme songs, but the movie would be more tempting if it used more soundtracks.Character: 8/10.The character of Aws the son of Jubair is MC typical. He is good but I think not complete enough in the character development. Meanwhile, other characters felt like just additional to the story. I wish I could see more development if someday TOEI makes the TV version of Journey.Enjoyment: 8/10.Yeah! I fully enjoyed the movie!

The animation is good. As a Muslim, I know the story and watched cartoons about it when I was young and guess what the cartoon was much better in terms of writing, characters, and clarifying the goals of each side. Unfortunately, the writing is poor in the movie. For example, the three stories that were only audio, I see as unnecessary and were killing fun. I mean, I was following a battle and then suddenly it was cut off. And the characters did not delve into them too much, especially from the side of evil.. but since it is a beginning...for Saudi Arabia, it is a good start, and I wish them success in the future. for Saudi Arabia, it is a good start, and I wish them success in the future.']"

Who killed who and why is the question asked every episode.As a huge fan of mysteries, I recommend this show to anyone who likes shows that have you thinking while being on the edge of your seat waiting for the murderer to strike again. You really get pulled into the stories, you get a feeling of pressure and of being uneasy as if you really were in the story. You want the killer to be caught and for everything to work out. Something very interesting about the show is the mixture of villains. Some times...the murderer is a completely evil person, but often times you feel sympathy towards them, you wish that they could have found another way. It gives you a strange feeling of realism.A 10 on story from me.Art:The art is nothing special. I would maybe compare it to Rurouni Kenshin, or something else of that general time. The colors of clothes, people, and objects are usually very bright, but the backgrounds are generally dark.

Also, there are some that have very big simularities to cases in other Anime/Manga, but this is not do to complete coping, but due to the cliques that run through them.That being said, what makes this story is the mystery solving pair, a boy and his puppet, and how they interact with the characters. As it progresses, one gets to not only get a really good mystery to try to solve, but a better understanding of who Ukon and Sakon are.Art:The art...work is very detailed. For those wondering why Ukon looks so much like the Rurouni, it is because the two artists worked together when starting out. I can actually find quite a few simularities in their work due to this, yet their art has their own flavor to it.Sound: The opening theme is so haunting, perhaps even gothic, as in the sence of a literary term. It is the same with the ending music. It is something that sticks in ones head and one gets out.Character: Is Ukon possesed, or does Sakon have a major split personality disorder? That is a good question as the story progresses, one has to wonder that, as Sakon is rather attached to the puppet and is really only know being able to make friends with people, something he couldn't do when he was younger. Sakon is also very smart too, which sets him apart.Enjoment: It is one of my favorites, I fell in love with the characters and loved the fact they were so unique.Overall: I highly recomend this Anime to any one who is into this kind of stuff.

It's very similar structural-wise with Kindaichi Shounen, which also shared a number of familiar whoddunit tropes between them; seemingly impossible scene of crime, multiple victims, tragic and elaborate backstory, etc. While none of the ideas or solutions for the murder themselves is particularly mind-blowing, it’s still plenty engrossing for the most part. The show also subscribes to the fair play rule and very generous with...clues for audience who wanted to play along……a tad too generous, perhaps. The murderers tend to be really easy to figure out, as the show really like to shove visual lead-on and backstory information in your face that makes it painfully obvious, especially in later cases. Heck, a certain case/arc practically spoiled itself through its title alone! While I certainly prefer a predictable but fair mystery over ones that pulled off unfair solutions out of thin air, this could still be a problem—especially when we’ve figured out the murderer way ahead of the curve and had to wait impatiently while the characters are still busy freaking out. Luckily, Ayatsuri Sakon also has plenty of supporting elements that helped mitigate this.For one, Sakon  is a great detective character. Paired up with his ventriloquist puppet/channeling medium/bratty alter ego Ukon, these two provided the most unique Holmes-Watson dynamic I’ve ever seen. Watching Sakon develops and interacts with various recurring characters is very intriguing, as the show gradually reveals more of his personality and background between cases, especially during the second half of the series. Bunraku (the art of Japanese puppetry performance) itself is a prominent theme throughout the story, with a lot of screen time intertwined with Sakon’s development and depicting the culture surrounding it, which lend a distinct flavor and personality beyond your typical “genius boy solves murder” basic set-up.Speaking of flavor, the show is very effective atmospherically, exuding an air of chilling mysticism in-between development of suspense, poignant character moments, and amusing banter between its main characters. While the animation is probably on par with what you expect from its time, the character models (drawn by the renowned Takeshi Obata) also meshed pretty well with the overall themes. What I really love, however, is the music:  the soundtrack is terrific, with an array of background tunes that always solidified the mood, as well as OP + ED combination that not only very fitting, but also featured great vocals and ranked among my all-time favorites.A thoroughly niche show, Ayatsuri Sakon probably appealed the most to those who are already card-carrying member of murder mystery fan club. But, if you’re interested in Japanese puppetry culture or just like good character drama/tragedy in general, it’s also good enough reason to give this an extended look. clues for audience who wanted to play along……a tad too generous, perhaps.

I was a bit sceptical at first, as the animation looked a bit too old for my taste. But I gave it a try, and I actually enjoyed it more or less.Story: 5 out of 10 (Minor spoilers)The story revolves around Sakon, a puppeteer, and his bunraku puppet Ukon. Together they solve mysteries behind murders that happen within a group of people. Each arc is around 3 episodes, displaying nearly the same type of cases, i.e. ithey are a bit like locked room mysteries, so the suspects and...murderers are always one of the people in a group. But the problem lies in how they try to conceal who the actual culprit is, by giving of obvious hints. That makes all of the stories actullay really pointless, because it\'s really predictable for the viewer (atleast for me xD) who the murderer is. Some twists here and there wouldn\'t hurt. But one of the biggest problems is that quite a lot of sidecharacters die before Sakon can solve the mystery. This just narrows down the amount of suspects, making it easier for him to point out who it is. Every culprit is then revealed by one of the murderered persons spirit possessing Ukon (the puppet). But it\'s actually not really obvious if that\'s the case, it is possible that Sakon does that to make the culprit frightened. Ukon then talks in that persons voice. And, the mystery is solved, more or less.Art: 6 out of 10The art isn\'t that bad for being an anime from the late 90\'s, though the effects are quite bad at some part. A cut of head doesn\'t look like a mannequin head with pink flesh and nearly  no blood. That\'s just one of the minor things that may lower the quality of Ayatsuri Sakon. The wardrobe change is limited: nearly no wardrobe change. The characters look quite good, and some scendery\'s are beautiful.Sound: 7 out of 10I personally disliked the opening, it\'s a typical J -Pop song. But the ending song is really good, it\'s a bit mysterious, yet beautiful somehow. I felt that it represented Sakon in a way. The other soundtracks aren\'t that memorable, though I liked the one called ""Koe"" (Voice). Both the ending song and this song is more of the traditional type.Characters: 6 out of 10We have Sakon, our main protagonist, a mystery magnet. When he\'s not holding his puppet Ukon, he\'s quite a shy boy. He\'s also quite a bishounen (I personally think that he\'s quite cute). But when he holds Ukon, he becomes more brave, speaks up a bit more, and also, gains confidence.Sakon is also more calculative when he is with Ukon. All of these traits come out like that because for Sakon, Ukon is the only friend he has. But here\'s the creepy thing, Ukon is like a human boy when with Sakon. He has the opposite personality of Sakon, yet, Sakon is the puppeteer, so he is obviously the one making Ukon talk. Sometimes, Sakon makes Ukon say ""rude"" things, which leads to him telling Ukon to not be rude. I think that\'s really creepy, because it feels like Sakon talks to himself, and not to an actual person. (Sakon and Ukon has the most dialouges in this anime.)We don\'t actually know of Ukon is a magic or supernatural puppet, who becomes alive when Sakon holds him.If that is actually the case, then it becomes less weird that Sakon talks to Ukon when they are not entertaining the audience. Otherwise, I think that Sakon has some sort of Dissociative identity disorder, which has come up because of him getting bullied. But others  don\'t seem to think that he\'s mentally unstable. Another weird thing is that Ukon and Sakon\'s aunt Kaoruko fight quite a lot with each other. Ukon is used as a comic relief. Though I feel that Ukon is actually a magic puppet.Sakon doesn\'t either seem to feel much remorse after quite many has died because of the murderer, although it\'s not his fault, I felt that he would be the type who would blame himself.Sakon seems to be a really kind and softspoken person, but he is still quite an incomplete character. He doesn\'t seem to show his feelings quite well, making him look kinda emotionless, and the lack of emphathy is unsettling.Kaoruko Tachibana, Sakon\'s aunt, is one of the characters that pops up more than the other side characters. She\'s an assisstant police inspector. Although it\'s her job to find out the culprit, she\'s as dumb as a crayon. She just jumps to conclusion very fast, it doesn\'t even take her five minutes after inspecting the crime scene before she starts sprouting nonsense. She\'s quite a silly character, whom I dislike.Enjoyment: 7 out of 10Even though I got easily bored of the story arcs, I enjoyed this anime. The last arc focused on Sakon and his family, making it more interesting and worthwhile. You could actually understand why Sakon is the way he is, in a way.Overall: 6 out of 10So all in all, it\'s quite good anime as something to pass your time. It\'s not that good in the mystery department, but it\'s somehow interesting in a way. murderers are always one of the people in a group. But the problem lies in how they try to conceal who the actual culprit is, by giving of obvious hints. That makes all of the stories actullay really pointless, because it\'s really predictable for the viewer (atleast for me xD) who the murderer is. Some twists here and there wouldn\'t hurt. But one of the biggest problems is that quite a lot of sidecharacters die before Sakon can solve the mystery. This just narrows down the amount of suspects, making it easier for him to point out who it is. Every culprit is then revealed by one of the murderered persons spirit possessing Ukon (the puppet). But it\'s actually not really obvious if that\'s the case, it is possible that Sakon does that to make the culprit frightened. Ukon then talks in that persons voice. And, the mystery is solved, more or less.Art: 6 out of 10The art isn\'t that bad for being an anime from the late 90\'s, though the effects are quite bad at some part. A cut of head doesn\'t look like a mannequin head with pink flesh and nearly  no blood. That\'s just one of the minor things that may lower the quality of Ayatsuri Sakon. The wardrobe change is limited: nearly no wardrobe change. The characters look quite good, and some scendery\'s are beautiful.Sound: 7 out of 10I personally disliked the opening, it\'s a typical J -Pop song. But the ending song is really good, it\'s a bit mysterious, yet beautiful somehow. I felt that it represented Sakon in a way. The other soundtracks aren\'t that memorable, though I liked the one called ""Koe"" (Voice). Both the ending song and this song is more of the traditional type.Characters: 6 out of 10We have Sakon, our main protagonist, a mystery magnet. When he\'s not holding his puppet Ukon, he\'s quite a shy boy. He\'s also quite a bishounen (I personally think that he\'s quite cute). But when he holds Ukon, he becomes more brave, speaks up a bit more, and also, gains confidence.Sakon is also more calculative when he is with Ukon. All of these traits come out like that because for Sakon, Ukon is the only friend he has. But here\'s the creepy thing, Ukon is like a human boy when with Sakon. He has the opposite personality of Sakon, yet, Sakon is the puppeteer, so he is obviously the one making Ukon talk. Sometimes, Sakon makes Ukon say ""rude"" things, which leads to him telling Ukon to not be rude. I think that\'s really creepy, because it feels like Sakon talks to himself, and not to an actual person. (Sakon and Ukon has the most dialouges in this anime.)We don\'t actually know of Ukon is a magic or supernatural puppet, who becomes alive when Sakon holds him.If that is actually the case, then it becomes less weird that Sakon talks to Ukon when they are not entertaining the audience. Otherwise, I think that Sakon has some sort of Dissociative identity disorder, which has come up because of him getting bullied. But others  don\'t seem to think that he\'s mentally unstable. Another weird thing is that Ukon and Sakon\'s aunt Kaoruko fight quite a lot with each other. Ukon is used as a comic relief. Though I feel that Ukon is actually a magic puppet.Sakon doesn\'t either seem to feel much remorse after quite many has died because of the murderer, although it\'s not his fault, I felt that he would be the type who would blame himself.Sakon seems to be a really kind and softspoken person, but he is still quite an incomplete character. He doesn\'t seem to show his feelings quite well, making him look kinda emotionless, and the lack of emphathy is unsettling.Kaoruko Tachibana, Sakon\'s aunt, is one of the characters that pops up more than the other side characters. She\'s an assisstant police inspector. Although it\'s her job to find out the culprit, she\'s as dumb as a crayon. She just jumps to conclusion very fast, it doesn\'t even take her five minutes after inspecting the crime scene before she starts sprouting nonsense. She\'s quite a silly character, whom I dislike.Enjoyment: 7 out of 10Even though I got easily bored of the story arcs, I enjoyed this anime. The last arc focused on Sakon and his family, making it more interesting and worthwhile.

If you are looking for a short version, read the last paragraph.Looking at the cover image and reading the short resume, I was given the impression that the series would be somewhat different than what it really is.

Kidou Senshi Gundam: Cucuruz Doan no Shima,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49827/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam__Cucuruz_Doan_no_Shima,"[""This Doan's Island movie feels, overall, out-of-place. While the episode it is adapting has a self-contained plot, pulling it out of Mobile Suit Gundam and stretching it to the length of a movie has resulted in an empty experience. This movie would have been better off as a shorter episode in an OVA of reimagined 0079 escapades.Character animation is emotive and interesting, but very exaggerated, just like The Origin OVA's. The writing and characterization is also just as exaggerated.Mobile Suit combat is done in stylized CGI. This looks pretty good at points but also has awkward moments where you notice the anti-aliasing on faraway models.In...regards to the plot, the movie can't seem to decide whether or not it needs to justify itself or not. The stakes are sometimes played up unrealistically or literally raised in comparison to 0079's Episode 15. At other points, it tries to feel like the episode should; a moment of downtime and an exploration of Doan's dilemma. A Zeon pilot deserting to look after war orphans; what does this teach Amuro?Maybe I'm just pessimistic about modern imaginings of the Universal Century, but I did come in with a positive outlook. I won't say this is a bad movie by any means, just a sort of disjointed thing. It doesn't fit as a replacement for the original Episode 15 and it isn't a good follow-up for the Origin OVA's. regards to the plot, the movie can't seem to decide whether or not it needs to justify itself or not.

I did watch the original episode when I watched 0079 and was really curious of what I would get out of this.Voice acting is amazing, I'm surprised Toru Furuya still can portray young Amuro with no issue, and was really happy to hear Toshio Furukawa as Kai again. Some seiyuus were already here since Origin and Ken Narita has been Bright since Unicorn, but obviously long time fans like me are still gonna miss those who are gone. That said I'm happy to say everyone did a good job and lived up to...expectations.The animation's good, even though I know there will be some mixed opinions about the use of CGI for the Mobile Suits and rightfully so, but I was pleased with it. I can say the animation did add way more expressions than that derp smile Doan had in episode 15, everyone was full of emotions and it was nice to see. I have some issues with how Amuro looks like in Yasuhiko's current style (and that I still don't know why he gave him blue eyes now) but the other characters look good.The characters feel... Like home. It was like coming back home to the White Base after a long time. All of them felt like they used to back in 0079, and Sleggar did add some funny moments despite being an odd change to replace Ryu with him so soon.The story was well delivered, let me tell you I hated Doan's kids in 0079, but somehow they made them actually endearing and I grew to care about them, and Doan himself... He was always meant to be a Zeon desertor who took care of the kids who's parents he killed, but I felt him more fleshed out here, I feel his story really needed more than 22 minutes and seeing his struggles upclose is something I wasn't expecting since I didn't read the Doan manga.I'm actually from Spain and seeing the Canary Islands and that they gave most of the kids spanish names was nice to see, but I already knew they would do a great job with the locations since they did the same in Hathaway.And once again Hiroko Moriguchi delivered, she has always been a nice fit for Gundam songs since Zeta on her debut, and you can tell she enjoys working for the franchise at any chance she gets.I can say with confidence that I liked this movie way more than episode 15, and if it wasn't for the few inconsistencies with 0079's plot I would replace the original take with this one in the canon.To anyone who has seen 0079, regardless if you have seen the Doan episode or not, I highly recommend this.

In the process of fleshing out the story, it expands the original episode to nearly two hours.To be quite honest, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I'm not one to enjoy CGI, but it was used pretty effectively here. It doesn't look great in every scene, but when it works it looks absolutely amazing - especially in scenes that are darker. Darker scenes tend to hide a lot of the flaws in CGI, and during these darker scenes it goes from being just okay...to being really amazing looking.

If you are a fan of the original series, it is a must watch."", ""The reimagining of Cucuruz Doan's Island from an episode of the original MSG to a movie is a solid adaptation, albeit a little conflicted in its tone and goals. Following the Origin continuity of the One-Year War, the movie attempts to give wider importance to the events in this originally self-contained story. However, the magnitude of the consequence is so great that it creates a great deal of tension with the many light-hearted and comedic moments.Although Gundam has developed a reputation over the decades for being a more dramatic series that strongly emphasises the pain and cost of conflict, the original series was sometimes incredibly...campy. It was a product of many factors, probably the most significant two being the time it was made and the goals of the series sponsors for Gundam to be a vehicle to sell toys, therefore requiring it to be perceived as kid friendly. While there are plenty of serious and dramatic battles throughout MSG, it is arguably not until the White Base leaves Jaburo and returns to space that the more mature tone becomes dominant in the show. Prior to that, there was always the presence of Katz, Letz and Kikka, as well as the many interlude episodes that centre around comedic scenarios. While that can be seen as a weakness of MSG, Doan's Island faithfully follows this tone. The movie mixes the more light-hearted moments of life on the island/White Base with the more serious combat scenes or discussions of the war. While there is tension in the tone of these two elements, it is not impossible to reconcile and have it serve a narrative purpose. After all, Doan's story is about a soldier who gave up fighting because he could not bear the collateral damage he inflicted on innocent people. The implicit contrast of the war going on to the children's antics has a strong thematic bite throughout the film.Yet, because the story cannot be satisfied with being self-contained, it overplays its hand with how much tonal contrast the show can take. Choosing to tie the events of Doan's island back to the larger events of the One-Year War is a fun bit of fan service, but it gives the whole show a distinct feeling of mismatch. What could have been a smaller scale, endearing story like the original, a snippet into the consequences of the war on innocents, is now burdened with being a pivotal point in the wider war. The stakes are increased by giving the island greater strategic importance to the conflict, ultimately bringing the Zeon forces back to it and creating the climax of the show. The impression alone is that the creators of this adaptation were not confident in the story's emotional punch without war-altering stakes being involved. But the more concrete issue is that almost none of the main cast is aware of the strategic purpose of the island and the threat it poses. The character tension for Amuro and the White Base crew centres solely around the mobile suit combat and if they can prevail. This leaves the larger strategic threat feeling like it is just there for the audience's benefit since most of the cast is ignorant of it and thus does not interact with that element of the plot at all. It takes the viewer distinctly out of the experience on the realisation that an entire plot element is invisible to a majority of the cast, leaving its resolution feeling arbitrary and unsatisfying.The movie's leads, Amuro and Doan, have a surprisingly subtle depth to them. While we do get flashbacks for both of them to their earlier experiences in the war, there is never a cathartic conversation about it during the show. While we get some dialogue that implicitly discusses the war experience of Amuro and Doan, most of it is subtly reflected in their behaviour and mannerism around the island. It is interesting, though a bit strange initially, to return to teenaged Amuro. While most his more recent incarnations are just as brooding, they are all distinctly more mature in how they carry themselves. But this should pose no issue for a viewer newer to the Gundam series, and older fans will find that Furuya Toru's performance is still spot on for a younger Amuro despite the decades that have gone by. Although they play only an indirect role in the movie, the scenes with Bright and Mirai are some fantastic character moments, though they are not strictly necessary for the plot. The rest of the White Base crew are as charming as ever, with Kai, Sleggar Law and Sayla standing out.The action and animation are excellent, as expected of Sunrise, with plenty to keep the viewer engaged. The CGI mobile suits are fantastically modelled and give the fights a sense of weight that older Gundam series sometimes lack. Much of the older animation had action happen at a breakneck pace, with the mobile suits being animated as incredibly nimble, whipping back and forth. The CGI models have the ability to convey the immense weight of the mech while combining it with this nimble action to create incredibly kinetic fights. The scenes with the RX-78 wielding its beam sabres are a highlight, evoking the old-fashioned Kurosawa-style swordfights in the movement of the mobile suits and how the tension is built up as they size up each other. Of course, there are some misses, like the truly idiotic moving turtle design of Admiral Gopp's flagship La Grandpa. But these are extremely minor issues. And in defence of the movie, the design of vehicles from the original MSG, like the Gunperry, do also look distinctly retro and unrealistic by current standards. On the music side, it is similarly fantastic, with plenty of leitmotifs and tracks from the original MSG OST being incorporated into the movie. In particular, the more mellow version of Tobe! Gundam with the acoustic guitar is a standout, evoking both a mellow nostalgia and a tender, at times close to sorrow when it is played. All these aesthetic elements combine with and significantly enhance the characters and the plot.Overall, Cucuruz Doan's Island is a solid entry in the Gundam franchise. Though it does suffer a bit from a conflict in its tone with how it tacts on the larger potential consequences of its plot, there is still an emotional core of a man bidding farewell to arms. Even though it would have probably been emotionally and thematically stronger as a more intimate story with fewer stakes, akin to the original episode it is based on it, it is still a strong 7 out of 10. Probably even an 8 out of 10 for fans of the original MSG characters in particular. And as a stand-alone film to someone unfamiliar with the franchise, it is still something entertaining and a reasonable taster of what Gundam has to offer. campy. It was a product of many factors, probably the most significant two being the time it was made and the goals of the series sponsors for Gundam to be a vehicle to sell toys, therefore requiring it to be perceived as kid friendly. While there are plenty of serious and dramatic battles throughout MSG, it is arguably not until the White Base leaves Jaburo and returns to space that the more mature tone becomes dominant in the show. Prior to that, there was always the presence of Katz, Letz and Kikka, as well as the many interlude episodes that centre around comedic scenarios. While that can be seen as a weakness of MSG, Doan's Island faithfully follows this tone. The movie mixes the more light-hearted moments of life on the island/White Base with the more serious combat scenes or discussions of the war. While there is tension in the tone of these two elements, it is not impossible to reconcile and have it serve a narrative purpose. After all, Doan's story is about a soldier who gave up fighting because he could not bear the collateral damage he inflicted on innocent people. The implicit contrast of the war going on to the children's antics has a strong thematic bite throughout the film.Yet, because the story cannot be satisfied with being self-contained, it overplays its hand with how much tonal contrast the show can take. Choosing to tie the events of Doan's island back to the larger events of the One-Year War is a fun bit of fan service, but it gives the whole show a distinct feeling of mismatch. What could have been a smaller scale, endearing story like the original, a snippet into the consequences of the war on innocents, is now burdened with being a pivotal point in the wider war. The stakes are increased by giving the island greater strategic importance to the conflict, ultimately bringing the Zeon forces back to it and creating the climax of the show. The impression alone is that the creators of this adaptation were not confident in the story's emotional punch without war-altering stakes being involved. But the more concrete issue is that almost none of the main cast is aware of the strategic purpose of the island and the threat it poses. The character tension for Amuro and the White Base crew centres solely around the mobile suit combat and if they can prevail. This leaves the larger strategic threat feeling like it is just there for the audience's benefit since most of the cast is ignorant of it and thus does not interact with that element of the plot at all. It takes the viewer distinctly out of the experience on the realisation that an entire plot element is invisible to a majority of the cast, leaving its resolution feeling arbitrary and unsatisfying.The movie's leads, Amuro and Doan, have a surprisingly subtle depth to them. While we do get flashbacks for both of them to their earlier experiences in the war, there is never a cathartic conversation about it during the show. While we get some dialogue that implicitly discusses the war experience of Amuro and Doan, most of it is subtly reflected in their behaviour and mannerism around the island. It is interesting, though a bit strange initially, to return to teenaged Amuro. While most his more recent incarnations are just as brooding, they are all distinctly more mature in how they carry themselves. But this should pose no issue for a viewer newer to the Gundam series, and older fans will find that Furuya Toru's performance is still spot on for a younger Amuro despite the decades that have gone by. Although they play only an indirect role in the movie, the scenes with Bright and Mirai are some fantastic character moments, though they are not strictly necessary for the plot. The rest of the White Base crew are as charming as ever, with Kai, Sleggar Law and Sayla standing out.The action and animation are excellent, as expected of Sunrise, with plenty to keep the viewer engaged. The CGI mobile suits are fantastically modelled and give the fights a sense of weight that older Gundam series sometimes lack. Much of the older animation had action happen at a breakneck pace, with the mobile suits being animated as incredibly nimble, whipping back and forth. The CGI models have the ability to convey the immense weight of the mech while combining it with this nimble action to create incredibly kinetic fights. The scenes with the RX-78 wielding its beam sabres are a highlight, evoking the old-fashioned Kurosawa-style swordfights in the movement of the mobile suits and how the tension is built up as they size up each other. Of course, there are some misses, like the truly idiotic moving turtle design of Admiral Gopp's flagship La Grandpa. But these are extremely minor issues. And in defence of the movie, the design of vehicles from the original MSG, like the Gunperry, do also look distinctly retro and unrealistic by current standards. On the music side, it is similarly fantastic, with plenty of leitmotifs and tracks from the original MSG OST being incorporated into the movie. In particular, the more mellow version of Tobe! Gundam with the acoustic guitar is a standout, evoking both a mellow nostalgia and a tender, at times close to sorrow when it is played. All these aesthetic elements combine with and significantly enhance the characters and the plot.Overall, Cucuruz Doan's Island is a solid entry in the Gundam franchise. Though it does suffer a bit from a conflict in its tone with how it tacts on the larger potential consequences of its plot, there is still an emotional core of a man bidding farewell to arms. Even though it would have probably been emotionally and thematically stronger as a more intimate story with fewer stakes, akin to the original episode it is based on it, it is still a strong 7 out of 10. Probably even an 8 out of 10 for fans of the original MSG characters in particular. And as a stand-alone film to someone unfamiliar with the franchise, it is still something entertaining and a reasonable taster of what Gundam has to offer."", 'Cucuruz Doan\'s island is a fun (yet kind of unnecessary) experience.The infamous island episode of the original Mobile Suit Gundam is notorious for various reasons. The disjointed staff causing the animation to be extremely inconsistent (if hilarious) and the episode itself being considered ""filler"" being some of them. Tomino himself has disowned this episode in future releases and broadcasts.The infamy of Doan\'s island says a lot about Yasuhiko\'s balls in trying to stretch it from a single self contained 25 minutes episode into a full movie with almost 2 hours of runtime. I dare to say it\'s a fruitful experiment as it delivers a decent...film, but the reason it was made in the first place is what interests me the most.The movie itself is good. You have very expressive and well made character animation accompanied by decent cgi for the Mobile Suits, a nice score, good directing and stellar voice acting as expected. The plot makes a mistake by trying to share the focus between the high stakes of the One Year War and the personal touching story of a Zeon deserter trying to raise orphans and atone for his sins. None of them are fleshed out well enough, despite the middle portion of the movie being fairly bloated. Doan\'s character is well written enough however, and the soul and intent of the original episode remains.But WHY was this made? Simple, they wanted to test waters for a full 0079 remake.

It doesn't feel stretched too thin. Much of it is reminiscent of the Ranba Ral arc from the original series, in that it gives Amuro some downtime away from White Base. Despite that, the stakes are ultimately appropriately high for a movie by the climax. The story only falters in the resolution of one major conflict, which ends too quickly and easily, and is the main vestigial element betraying that this was originally all over in 25 minutes. Overall it feels like a classic Tomino-style war...story.The animation is excellent, especially for the well-directed mobile suit battles. Character designs retain the look of The Origin, being faithful to the original series for the main cast while having some minor characters seem relatively unhinged almost to the point of parody. While this is primarily an Amuro story, its depiction of Bright Noa was particularly interesting. Having only seen the movie trilogy version of the original, he's portrayed as mature and confident from the outset there, but this movie reveals uncertainty and a lack of experience, making him seem more the 19-year-old out of his depth that he was at that point.The only aspect of this movie I didn't like was that the story gives a huge amount of screen time to various annoying little kids. This was probably unavoidable given the nature of the story, but these kinds of characters were a recurring weakpoint in the early Gundam shows.

I grew up watching these and recently gotten my friend into the franchise watching the OG 0079 reminded me of what I love about 0079. The White Base crew. It is always great to hear Tooru Furuya reprise his role as Amuro (with his most recent one being his one liner from Hathaway\'s Flash). It does makes me sad whenever I think of previous seiyuus that voices Bright, Sayla, Mirai, etc but regardless everyone did a great job with this movie.This movie is a...spectacular retelling of the infamous 15th episode and I believe is based off of Gundam Origin Cucuruz Doan manga. You can think of this as, a filler movie. Completely unnecessary. Does this add on any important world building into 0079 like the Origin OVAs? Absolutely not. Is this movie damn enjoyable? You damn right it is. Nothing like seeing a certain flashback ""slap"" in HD and a young Bright Noa still figuring out how to be a proper commanding officer.The CGI feels a little wonky for sure though I do enjoy how they are animating the mobile suits. These are big robots, they are sure to move pretty slowly while making big movements something they did really well also in Origin.Sound design for Gundam is always top notch. It is something they\'ve probably perfected since the 80s. OST for this is very, nostalgic. Moeagare, moeagare, moeagare, Gundam...I want to stress that this movie was definitely unnecessary. We could all have gone about our lives without having seen this movie but what can I say, it is always nice to see the old White Base crew once again in newer animation style.Seeing this movie is definitely optional but if you\'re a older OG Gundam fan or even a newer fan to the UC era I recommend giving this a try.

They do flashbacks to famous moments from the early parts of the series. Char even gets one line, lmao.It fits Gundam thematically very well. At its heart, it's an anti-war movie that depicts a family struggling to live in an inhospitable environment caused by that conflict.

However, they do a good job of making you care for the movie-only characters.The film did a good job of hitting all the nostalgia points.It was nice to...see everyone in modern animation & it was particularly nice to hear the classic music.I brought a friend who's never seen any Gundam with me.He caught on very easily & enjoyed it quite a bit but I wouldn't recommend it as a 1st Gundam experience for most people.Just your hardcore anime buds.

Kemonozume,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1454/Kemonozume,"[""10's all across the board eh?  Now I'm going to really have to defend that decision aren't I?  This will be interesting because for something like Kemonozume there just aren't adequate words to describe how and what it is.Story:  I almost want to say it's Romeo and Juliet. But....it isn't.  It sort of starts out that way, two groups of people who hate and kill each other....but it definitely evolves from there.  It's a beautiful love story, the two protagonists go through quite alot...and not just with each other.  The blend of characters that contribute to this story were...quite amazing, each character shaping pieces of it as it went along.  There were a couple things I saw coming from a mile away, but I wasn't at all disappointed by that, it was beautifully done.  It's 13 episodes long, which is a perfect length for something like this.  It did kind of slow down near the ends of a couple of the episodes but it was almost always very engaging.Art: What is there to say about the art?  Kemonozume is art.  I remember seeing Kemonozume featured on a different site and every single person commented on the art.  It does take an open mind to view this.  The art is completely sporadic, sometimes it's absolutely barbaric and crude and choppy, while other scenes are beautiful and smooth.  But the fact that the art is all over the place makes this a truly memorable anime.  I've never seen this art used in any other anime, except for Mind Game.  It's incredibly refreshing.Sound: The entire soundtrack is jazz.  I don't know why they chose jazz, considering that it's set in Japan in a relatively recent time peroid....but they decided to go with jazz.  And it definitely works.  It's all up-tempo stuff and it really does a great job of furthering the mood in this piece. They re-use some of the songs a bunch, and it's cool to see how the same song can be used in a completely different scene and give a completely different feel to it.Character: They did an amazing job with characters in this anime.  Some are kind of cheesy, and contain traits that are a little...stereotypical.  The way they made each character interact with each other is great.  I could imagine each character as a person, the emotions they exhibited were incredibly real.  I found myself genuinely caring about these characters, something that doesn't happen to me as often as I would like it to.I watched Mind Game, then I decided that since Kemonozume had the same style of art that I would watch it.  I'm glad I did that.  It's not the kind of animation from Naruto or Gankutsuou or any other kind of anime.  Unique, is a more than perfect way to describe this entire anime.  There aren't any annoying anime cliches in this.  However you have to have an open mind about your anime to watch this.  It's not something that can be enjoyed if you're only in to one kind of anime..like Mecha or Shoujo.

I sure have a few times, yet even my supposedly ""open"" mind was put to the test right from the very first minutes of Kemonozume.Its not just about the fugly art, mind you. Weird little monkeys, tower-sized detectives, man-eating monsters that look like right out of some simple children\'s picture book with their overly round and stubby shapes. I began watching the show all like ""dude, finally an artsy and refined piece for such...a mature and elite anime viewer like myself"" and ended up almost dropping the show after the first episode. Why? Because it caught me completely off guard and didn\'t match my usual tastes at all.Good thing I gathered my wits to go on watching, however, as Kemonozume showed me that ""unique"" isn\'t always an euphemism for just plain ""shit"".To start with the art of which everyone seems to have an opinion when it comes to this show: yes, it\'s ""unique"". Yes, in that euphemistic way. But as someone with a way better way with words than me once said, you get used to everything except an icicle up in the ass (\'cause it melts before it gets comfy), and such is the way with Kemonozume\'s art as well. Or perhaps it isn\'t as much about getting used to the crappy art is it is about realizing it\'s grotesque genius in this very anime? For just like Kemonozume\'s story and characters vary in their nature, the art varies from raw, murky, surreal, and sketchy to light, joyful, and truly beautiful.Character-wise, Kemonozume is a treat for anyone tired of angsty teens all across their usual anime. Not a single character under 20 years of age in this show. The average year count ain\'t the only mature aspect about the characters either, for the chemistry, dialogue, and interaction they have with each other all clearly depict we\'re not talking about a middle-school drama here. Instead of the stuttered ""I like you"" and a hesitant, clumsy peck on the cheek, the two lovers in Kemonozume meet each other on a dark beach, exchange not a word, meet again, and fuck. While perhaps a highly romanticised setting (a beach, a girl literally falling from the sky, and BANG [get it?], love at first sight), it is a rather realistic portrayal of young love\'s carnal nature.The story of Kemonozume manages to be both simple and multi-layered at the same time. ""Simple"" meaning that the viewer can easily grasp what\'s going on instead of having to endure pointless overphilosophicalpsychologicalwhatevermindfuckshit, whereas the plot\'s different aspects can be seen how, on one hand, it\'s a conflicted love story about two people so obviously representing two opposite sides, a story about the characters who all have their own goals and ambitions and trying to find their place in their environment, a story about the distinction between man and monster, and so on. Yet even with all these different sides, Kemonozume\'s story feels like a whole in which the varying aspects support and fulfill each other instead of annoyingly pulling it into a myriad of ways. Which, in turn, makes the story that much more enjoyable and intriguing, and unlike with many other animes, it doesn\'t end with a more or less horrendously disappointing conclusion.Unlike with some of my previous reviews, I think I\'m going to skip the part about how unnotable I found the soundtrack and go right to the ending rants. Overall Kemonozume was very much an enjoyable show once the eye got adjusted to the unique artwork and I learned to swallow the mindfuck-ish aspects which I usually hate with vehemence. A fair word of warning here, btw, if you\'re generally of the same mind and would prefer your anime withOUT any overt surrealism: prepare your...selves.

I have watched a good amount of anime and cannot understand how such a bogus-ass anime could garner such high ratings.Story:  5/10This is pretty much a story revolving around humans and their relationship with monsters known as ""flesh eaters"" who are cursed with an appetite for human beings.  The general story starts out pretty solid and interesting - a typical situation in which a person has to choose between his human comrades and...a monster.  One would think that it would be pretty hard to botch this tried-and-true plot line.  However, this anime manages to turn what could have been a relatively decent story into one of absolute bullshit and nonsense.  The episodes turn from engaging and suspenseful to utter crap that simply drags on.  By the closing of the series i was forcing myself to hang in there till the end.  Good thing it\'s only 13 episodes.  I would stay away from this anime unless you like watching mindless, uninteresting crap pulled out of the director\'s ass.  the only reason i give it a 5 is because the first few episodes were somewhat interesting.Art:  3/10Sticking a paintbrush in my ass and attempting to draw human figures on a canvass would produce a better picture than what would be found in the ""art"" of Kemonozume.  i can understand the artist wanting to create a rushed, violent, and haphazard look to try and match the mood, but not to the point of looking like something out of a 10-year-old\'s doodling in a school notebook.  I for one do not hold art in high regards when judging and anime, but for those who do - I think you will need to be a very ""special"" person to appreciate this lousy, half-assed artwork.Sound - 6/10The sounds and music used are nothing special.  They consist of mostly jazz/jazz related music.  The music is neither outstanding nor mediocre and sufficiently plays its roll in this uninteresting anime.Characters - 5/10The characters in this anime are adequately interesting.  However, many of the main characters are very inconsistent in their behaviors, ideas, and actions.  It isnt really clear why some actions are carried out by some characters.  Many of the actions seemed to be pulled out of the director\'s ass in order to boringly further the plot.  None of the characters appealed to me or stood out as is usually the case in animes/mangas.Enjoyment - 3/10The beginning of the anime gave me the idea that i would be in for a decent ride.  However, the episodes/series turned to crap as they became filled with a third rate plot; shitty, pointless, weird ass sex scenes; and lame fight scenes.  This anime was a struggle to finish.The only reason i can think of for the various high scores given to this anime is that people fall for the third-class plot line that tries too hard to be deep and philosophical.  People also probably find this anime ""artsy"" for its use of jazz and broken-looking drawings.  It is a shame that in its attempt to be philosophical and mature, this anime turned out to be inconsistent with a plot full of holes.Overall:  5/10 a monster.

The music is neither outstanding nor mediocre and sufficiently plays its roll in this uninteresting anime.Characters - 5/10The characters in this anime are adequately interesting.  However, many of the main characters are very inconsistent in their behaviors, ideas, and actions.  It isnt really clear why some actions are carried out by some characters.  Many of the actions seemed to be pulled out of the director\'s ass in order to boringly further the plot.  None of the characters appealed to me or stood out as is usually the case in animes/mangas.Enjoyment - 3/10The beginning of the anime gave me the idea that i would be in for a decent ride.  However, the episodes/series turned to crap as they became filled with a third rate plot; shitty, pointless, weird ass sex scenes; and lame fight scenes.  This anime was a struggle to finish.The only reason i can think of for the various high scores given to this anime is that people fall for the third-class plot line that tries too hard to be deep and philosophical.  People also probably find this anime ""artsy"" for its use of jazz and broken-looking drawings.  It is a shame that in its attempt to be philosophical and mature, this anime turned out to be inconsistent with a plot full of holes.Overall:  5/10', 'In the very first moments of Kemonozume we learn of a legend about a man rescuing a woman who is to be sacrificed to the gods: when they escape and run off together, the gods are angered and condemn them to feed on the flesh of humans in the form of monsters overwhelmed by bestial rage, lust, and the urge to devour.  And so the descendants of these banished lovers live on as Flesh Eaters, some of them choosing to embrace their inner beast, and some choosing to suppress their curse by will alone, retaining their human form and living normal human lives.The story...here truly begins when Toshihiko, a key member of the Kifuuken, a clan dedicated to the slaughter of these abominations, and Yuka, a Flesh Eater, fall into a tangle of hungry lust with each other — before they know what each other are.  When the shit hits the fan the suddenly star-crossed lovers end up on the run, unsure of where to go or what to do, often doubting themselves and struggling to find a way.  Together, Toshihiko and Yuka wrestle with their desires and sexuality, their sense of duty and belonging, and having the courage to do what they feel is right.Ultimately, Kemonozume — like Masaaki Yuasa\'s own Mind Game — has a very simple thing to say: love and dreams are worth fighting for even in the face of the ""maddening, dreamless truth"" of reality.  Both leave us not with a sense of overwrought tragedy or profound enlightenment, but a reinvigorating affirmation of the importance of living for what we believe in — and perhaps most importantly, they do it with fucking style.  The story of Kemonozume is such that could have been told just as easily with vampires or anything less novel than the Flesh Eaters, but instead its creators opt to take a traditional story and a traditional form and approach them in an extraordinarily fresh way.Yuasa\'s love of whimsical surrealism and macabre comedy coupled with the raw, emphatically hand-drawn and viscerally expressive style of animation flies in the face of generic anime blandness, particularly in the amazing final episodes.  As it becomes increasingly psychedelic, Kemonozume is like a jazz fusion record that spirals into free jazz madness; rock giving way to feedback-driven climax.  It\'s dark, funny, romantically and sexually mature, and wildly stylistic in a way that comes off as improvisational yet intensely focused, perfectly suiting the story and theme.Note that most of the visual style present throughout the series draws more from a unique impression of manga-style absurdism than from mainstream anime\'s insular concept of what anime is ""supposed to look like"" these days (i.e. moéfests galore), and because of the choice to involve a number of different animators the look and feel naturally varies slightly or sometimes shockingly from episode to episode, to subtly kaleidoscopic effect.  Again, this allows for audacious imagery that parallels the vision behind this story, and its characters\' quest to redefine the way of things and what is acceptable.The music, too, suits the theme here, presenting a mixture of crazed jazz and swinging fusion reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop\'s timeless soundtrack.If you have an affinity for fresh, exciting, mature, and daring forms of expression, for love and dreams that shred through all misfortune and the crushing banality of those in power, Kemonozume is for you. here truly begins when Toshihiko, a key member of the Kifuuken, a clan dedicated to the slaughter of these abominations, and Yuka, a Flesh Eater, fall into a tangle of hungry lust with each other — before they know what each other are.

Piece of crap.Thought I should give more balance on this load of shit for all you anime watchers out there so here it is. It might give you another point of view from a reviewer who didn't give it a 9 or a 10.First of all, beware of brain cell damage after watching this anime!Overall art:I understand some people are into this but c'mon man, looks like everyone's been run over by a train. Too many distortions and un-proportional animation. Movement angle's all wrong. You can argue that it matches the style of the dark-themed storyline, but the last four episodes look like...they plain gave up on common sense whatsoever. That is, unless you enjoy watching ugly heads dancing around, WTF.Story:If you enjoy romance that consists of nothing but sex, then this might be your anime to watch. Have to warn you though, the sex scenes aren't even that good- unless having sex with ugly looking monsters turn you on.The plot is poorly developed. This guy finds sex with a monster and runs of with her. They have sex.Things happen back home. They have more sex. More, boring, things happen back home. They continue to have sex.They somehow manage to find time from all that sex to destroy a crazy maniac.Romance my ass.The END.Overall:Sometimes shit is created with a constipated attempt to seem mature and deep. Some people interpret it as more than it is, and think it to be genius. This is one of those occasions.If you're trying to dim the lines between what is human and what is monster, then writing about how both human and monster are lustfilled idiots who kill each other is not the way to go. If you're writing romance then give me at least one scene where it doesn't involve sex, PLEASE.So, yeah. Do not recommend. they plain gave up on common sense whatsoever.

Kemonozume is in the same style as Mind Game and Cat Soup with the very same twisted sequence of events one was to expect. I personally love this bold new animation style, like a sketch colored with water colors that doesn't adhere to any sort of spacial rules (limbs bending way out of shape to emphasize movement).  Anyway, I have to say that the love story is frighteningly  realistic and very touching,...something rarely found. This isn't to say that the action isn't incredible and wonderfully stylistic, hell the whole series is. My complaint with this series is that it slows down immensely in later episodes, but I suppose the production team thought it best. There's a great amount of scheming and terrifying plot twists, something always appreciated. I highly recommend this series, just be forewarned that it is in a very serious tone with little relief (except of course for the ultimate badass monkey master).

In a stroke of brilliance, Masaaki Yuasa redefines this ancient epic and brings to light the full spectrum of human emotion and psychological development.Our story starts simple enough.We are introduced to an accomplished young warrior of the Kifuuken (a clan with a thousand year tradition of hunting Flesh Eaters), Toshihiko, who is led on a fast paced chase through his Japanese village where he stumbles across our unfortunate heroine.Yuka,beautiful Yuka. Flesh Eater Yuka.After...a fateful encounter between the hunters and the hunted, Toshihiko and Yuka are forced to flee, wandering the countryside in the hopeful search of a place where they can live and love in piece. In the first handful of episodes we are introduced to a truly inspired and whimsical world with a take on macabre humor that sets Kemonozume in a place all its own.The true depth of this series however, comes with the revelation of our main antagonist, and this is when the viewer is confronted with the true potential for depravity not of the Flesh Eaters, but of mankind itself.Without revealing too much, our main villain is the most well developed character I have encountered in a series thus far, anime or otherwise. What began as a noble pursuit ends in a horribly demented fantasy twisted and corrupt. More impressive is that the entire complex scheme is started not through power or force but through the successful manipulation of human desires and dreams and his sociopathic tendencies continue all the way to the climax.The character development in Kemonozume is superb and far beyond any expectations I had set for it. We bear witness to many crushingly realistic human reactions between the cast and within themselves. As the sinister undercurrent develops from mere hints to full blown plot device the tone and setting of Kemonozume drives considerable deeper into the human psyche, drawing out not only vivid portrayals of overwhelming emotion, but a visual experience unlike any other. Every main and supporting character goes through a powerful transformation that they must struggle to overcome or die trying.The unique art design and story structure combined with a fast paced and perfect soundtrack eases the viewer into a world filled with gruesome consequence and powerful prejudice. The visual experience is often in complete juxtaposition with actual story elements, presenting the viewer with complex and conflicting emotions.In the end, this is a story about courage, trust and faith in yourself, a story of maintaining your humanity despite overwhelming odds pointing you towards darker, easier paths, and of course a story of love and the struggle to maintain it no matter what.If you're searching for something unique, vivid and emotionally charged, this is more then worth your time.

Unfortunately, it all goes down hill when you reach about half the show. It pains me to say it was a disappointment. Lots of loose ends, they didn\'t bother to explain details that were crucial to the development of the characters initially and because of all the sudden twists nothing seemed credible about their choices. If there was a plot hole it would be filled with some unknown bit of the character\'s...past and they would roll with it. Surely it\'s nothing we\'ve never seen before, but it was terribly done and still they left me with questions. Now to break it down:STORY: Overall poor. It had great potential but it just collapsed on itself because of the romance. It is based mostly on sex and the dangers a ""monster"" partner might bring (wow where have we seen this one before?). Also, the sex as plot tool is not exclusive to the main couple. All the relationships in the show grow up from that and never manage to be truly convincing. I don\'t know if I should even refer to the storyline of the monsters and the Kifuuken because it barely survived the awful development of the main characters. Good conquers evil in the end but we don\'t exactly know why and to be honest, by the end we don\'t even care. The animation masks well the adult themes but they are not successfully addressed.ART: Enjoyable and a great breath of fresh air from the moe stuff that has been breeding all over the charts for the past few years. It was the reason that made me watch this anime and for that I don\'t regret it. Madhouse can be proud of this one (though not so much story-wise). It you liked Tatami Galaxy I recommend you take a peek at this. It also reminds me of some of the shorts from the Gurren Lagann Parallel Works anthology.SOUND: Nothing extraordinary. Jazzy. Abides by the show.CHARACTER: The protagonist who should have the most development never sees it, his initial problems are never tackled and simply add on once he meets the girl flesh eater. She is mildly interesting and stumbles upon some of the show\'s most endearing moments. Were not for the excessive nudity and sudden changes of heart she might have been a good character. Kazuma, the protagonist\'s brother, was probably the most verisimilar character but he had to be ruined for the show to work in accordance with its mediocrity. Rie was a feminist pebble sunken in a well. After serving her purpose as fanservice material, she discovered she had ambitions and tried to do something about it, not to mention save the Kifuuken. Needless to say what happened to her. The evil guy was pretty entertaining by the end. He was crazy enough to let his weak motives go by unnoticed.ENJOYMENT: I\'d say the enjoyment with which you began is not the same you\'ll have by the end. If you start to watch this anime with the intention to take it seriously and with hopes of seeing the plot flourish and be resolved than you\'re going to be sourly let down as I was.

It encompasses everything from bloodthirsty, sword-wielding monster killers to small, fighting monkeys. This is Masaaki Yuasa\'s (Mind Game, The Tatami Galaxy) full anime series debut. As usual, he does not allow anime industry norms tone down his surreal art style and storytelling. This is not the best showcasing of his talents or his finest work, but it still manages to be amusing and eccentric enough to be a memorable anime in and of itself.The story of ""Kemonozume"" is definitely an unusual one with many twists to offer. The fierce and extremely dangerous monsters...known as Shokujinki run rampant. Toshihiko Momota falls in extreme love with a woman who ends up being one. He comes from a family who are renown for being capable swordsmen whose occupation is to hunt down these grotesque monsters, and many issues that arise as he attempts to be with her. Their interactions together is the second most interesting aspect right behind the art.The problem is that the interactions between them aren\'t as heavy as they should be. The emotional resonance for the main characters is weakened by the lack of focus that sometimes appears in this anime. ""Kemonozume"" gives them some nice development and back story, but not as much as it could have. Many of the other secondary characters that are introduced feel fairly dull and serve the sole purpose of being killed. They take up unnecessarily long amounts of screen time, and ultimately only hold the anime back by not leaving it enough time to fully develop the main characters, which are easily the most interesting ones.Its art is the most noteworthy feature of the anime. It is impeccably gritty and alluring. Uniqueness does run much through this anime. Character designs are very rough and sketchily drawn. This anime does not use the huge-anime-eyes-possessing character molds that many other typical anime incorporate. Fans of moe will definitely not be pleased by this move; standard anime artwork fans are simply not catered to in ""Kemonozume"". Action scenes are fairly fluid, and the artwork in it enhance the intensity well. Backgrounds are often riddled with heavy brush strokes and very moody.Much of the anime\'s soundtrack is jumpy and jittery. It\'s composed of jazz music that slightly elevates the tense or exciting moments. Other smoother and more laid-back songs preform their role well, and don\'t intrude the dramatic scenes they are played in. Most of the soundtrack is nice but not all too memorable. The standout is the opening theme ""Auvers Blue"" by Katteni-Shiyagare. It is an unrestrained jazz song that becomes as intense with excitement as the most action-filled scenes in the anime. The ending theme by Santara, ""Suki"", is nothing special or irksome. It\'s just a decent, somewhat melancholic song.""Kemonozume"" is bloody, creative, albeit lacking, fun with a gripping and odd twist on traditional monster and love stories. The flaws are not enormous and the visual approach is fresh enough to outshine many of its contemporaries. Those who enjoy overtly strange, violent, and fascinating anime with an appealingly coarse and offbeat art style should definitely check this one out.Seven Large, Staining, and Darkly Red Blood Splatters out of Ten. known as Shokujinki run rampant.

I knew what I was expecting from the director Masaaki Yuasa, known from his critically acclaimed works such as Kaiba, The Tatami Galaxy, Mind Game, and the most recent work of 2014 Ping Pong the Animation. The surrealistic art style, jarring enough to see the choppy yet dynamic movement, and the unconventional means of using a diverse set of characters to get the message across its audience would be also in Kemonozume. I was half right.What I didn’t expect was the copious amounts of gore, sex, and nudity that were there. However, I did get used to...it and the nudity was far from an erotic hentai and was more under the lines of unsettling due to its abstract art style.**Pretty much spoiler-free. Be aware of the frequent uses of “T and A” and grotesque violence that’s usually there for every single episode and sometimes at the same time. Also, it doesn’t get lighter. In fact, it’s somewhat progressively worse, but you might get used to it and see the other things it has going. **Characters, Concept, and Story-The concept itself is far from original. Unwanted supernatural beings living and hiding in our society have been used (and will have been used), ranging from titans, hollows, ghouls, aliens, ghosts, demons, chiropterans, parasites, beastmen, walkers and other inhuman organisms. However what makes Kemonozume different from other monster exterminators is its focus. It manages to have a collection of motley tones and genres that when the action and gore are removed, Kemonozume holds water compared to those others that would come off empty. The elite hunters called the Kifuuken aren’t solely at a conquest for more power-ups and the monstrous Shokujinki aren’t superficially painted as the decisive villain. Also, the narrative is not a bleak melodrama as there are various insert comedic reliefs mainly for the monkey Saru and the beginning of some episodes. Yet it also has its placid moments and energetic romance.With that being said, it’s quite difficult to separate the characters from the scripted plot. More akin to Baccano! it focuses on an eclectic cast of characters, done by granting them a moderate amount of screen time and  contributions to the individually segmented, but somehow overall, cohesive plot. But the same, inseparable problems are still prevalent. Characters are blown up to extreme exaggerations often to offer a quirk or two: a pair of star-crossed lovers, a rival, a kick-ass monkey, a deranged megalomaniac, and a jealous partner. Problems within the narrative often make a large hop, skip, and a jump towards their objectives in the beginning such as when Yuka hopes to go to this certain place to [insert spoiler]. However, that may be a minor flaw because as it goes on, the crafty and nonlinear story starts connecting the dots by the viewer’s progression.Art, Animation, and Sound-By now, the art style is more towards Yuasa’s Ping Pong the animation rather than the more polish Kaiba and the Tatami Galaxy. Expect the jagged contours, asymmetrical figures, trippy color schemes and real images. However, despite its rough drawings, it’s far more dynamic than most cel animated shows. I would also mention the change in art style typically at the beginning of each episode, as the start of Ep 5 has one of the cleanest art styles. While I wouldn’t call the art at face value for just a bunch of scribbles, it’s quite fitting to it as a whole. But I can’t deny the clumsy movement of a person tied to a chair in one scene.As I’ve said before, there are a lot of scenes of people making out, having sex, having innards spew out and having the grotesque figures of the Shokujinki. Overall, it does well to capture the horrific images and visceral actions. I could have also sworn that I’ve seen Yuka without clothes almost more often than not. It’s obviously something to take note.In the sound department, it has a jazzy theme done by Katteni-Shiyagare and a calmer ending. But it really disappoints me that there really isn’t much music in the background and it’s usually jazz played during the action sequence. Meanwhile, voice acting is fun and exaggerated and the sound effects are fine.Personal Enjoyment6/10 Episode 1 & 2 (Fine)7/10 First half(Good)9/10 Latter part (Great)It was an uncomfortable start when lacking prior knowledge of its content. Also, because of its jarring tone change I sometimes get whiplashed as I couldn’t pin what Kemonozume actually is, but soon see what it is trying to do. However, towards the end, it was a fun ride even if certain events were absurdly random and were just there to escalate the thrill.Btw: Shortly after it finished, it just dawned on me what just happened towards the very last scene after the turbulent climax. I almost forgot a critical event and had a major epiphany.Overall- low-mid 8/10 (Very Good)As much I enjoyed Kemonozume, I can’t overlook the structural and technical issues with its possibly offensive content.  It is definitely a diamond in the rough with several scratches here and there. However, the beauty of this gem would be its somewhat critical approach for its themes of our own reflection of our dark, primal instincts needed to satiate our idealized lust, greed, and strength. While very much extreme, it can also mainly be taken at face-value for its rollercoaster ride entertainment, chock full of a cornucopia of genres and style. it and the nudity was far from an erotic hentai and was more under the lines of unsettling due to its abstract art style.**Pretty much spoiler-free.

But the same, inseparable problems are still prevalent. Characters are blown up to extreme exaggerations often to offer a quirk or two: a pair of star-crossed lovers, a rival, a kick-ass monkey, a deranged megalomaniac, and a jealous partner. Problems within the narrative often make a large hop, skip, and a jump towards their objectives in the beginning such as when Yuka hopes to go to this certain place to [insert spoiler]. However, that may be a minor flaw because as it goes on, the crafty and nonlinear story starts connecting the dots by the viewer’s progression.Art, Animation, and Sound-By now, the art style is more towards Yuasa’s Ping Pong the animation rather than the more polish Kaiba and the Tatami Galaxy. Expect the jagged contours, asymmetrical figures, trippy color schemes and real images. However, despite its rough drawings, it’s far more dynamic than most cel animated shows. I would also mention the change in art style typically at the beginning of each episode, as the start of Ep 5 has one of the cleanest art styles. While I wouldn’t call the art at face value for just a bunch of scribbles, it’s quite fitting to it as a whole. But I can’t deny the clumsy movement of a person tied to a chair in one scene.As I’ve said before, there are a lot of scenes of people making out, having sex, having innards spew out and having the grotesque figures of the Shokujinki. Overall, it does well to capture the horrific images and visceral actions. I could have also sworn that I’ve seen Yuka without clothes almost more often than not. It’s obviously something to take note.In the sound department, it has a jazzy theme done by Katteni-Shiyagare and a calmer ending. But it really disappoints me that there really isn’t much music in the background and it’s usually jazz played during the action sequence. Meanwhile, voice acting is fun and exaggerated and the sound effects are fine.Personal Enjoyment6/10 Episode 1 & 2 (Fine)7/10 First half(Good)9/10 Latter part (Great)It was an uncomfortable start when lacking prior knowledge of its content. Also, because of its jarring tone change I sometimes get whiplashed as I couldn’t pin what Kemonozume actually is, but soon see what it is trying to do. However, towards the end, it was a fun ride even if certain events were absurdly random and were just there to escalate the thrill.Btw: Shortly after it finished, it just dawned on me what just happened towards the very last scene after the turbulent climax. I almost forgot a critical event and had a major epiphany.Overall- low-mid 8/10 (Very Good)As much I enjoyed Kemonozume, I can’t overlook the structural and technical issues with its possibly offensive content.  It is definitely a diamond in the rough with several scratches here and there. However, the beauty of this gem would be its somewhat critical approach for its themes of our own reflection of our dark, primal instincts needed to satiate our idealized lust, greed, and strength. While very much extreme, it can also mainly be taken at face-value for its rollercoaster ride entertainment, chock full of a cornucopia of genres and style.', ""There are no two ways about it; &quot;Kemonozume&quot; is HOT!!! This Wowow/Madhouse modern horror anime will slam you back into your chair and leave you totally astounded. It is a brilliant, in-your-face take on an old folktale that has smashing action, don't-give-a-care animation, outstandingly witty humor, touchingly human protagonists, a totally over-the-top villain, and a very cool jazzy sound track.Toshihiko Momota is the oldest son in a family of monster-hunters. Like his father Jyuuzou, Toshihiko believes in the &quot;way of the sword&quot; as the correct means to get rid of the man-eating Shokujinki who prey on humans. Toshihiko's younger brother Kazuma wants to modernize the...&quot;family business&quot; with high powered mecha-suits and other bits of high-tech, but Jyuuzou and Toshihiko oppose this, resulting in a split in the family and Kazuma challenging Toshihiko to a sword duel.But the duel between the brothers is interrupted by a monkey who is chased by Toshihiko out to the beach, where a strangely attractive woman sails out of the sky in a parachute and lands in front of Toshihiko. Toshihiko is immediately smitten by the woman, who is called Yuka, and they start a blindingly passionate affair, causing Toshihiko to forget &quot;the way of the sword&quot;, initiating the destruction of the Kifuuken - the organization of monster-hunters - and begetting something much more horribly evil than even the Shokujinki.&quot;Kemonozume&quot; is definitely not for &quot;all tastes&quot;. There is a tremendous amount of black humor tied directly to violent death, very raw and sometimes monstrous sex, more nudity than in most hentai anime, and lots of surreal animation. But if you are looking for something different in terms of an anime that is truly meant for adults, &quot;Kemonozume&quot; is a tremendously entertaining place to look. &quot;family business&quot; with high powered mecha-suits and other bits of high-tech, but Jyuuzou and Toshihiko oppose this, resulting in a split in the family and Kazuma challenging Toshihiko to a sword duel.But the duel between the brothers is interrupted by a monkey who is chased by Toshihiko out to the beach, where a strangely attractive woman sails out of the sky in a parachute and lands in front of Toshihiko.

RomanceFor the most of the show you\'ll be following Toshihiko and Yuka. To begin with there\'s a very ""forbidden love"" vibe to their relationship since Toshihiko hunts monsters and Yuka is one but they both have...something in it that makes them overcome it. For Toshihiko it\'s about feeling love for the first time, he sees her, falls in love and then can\'t think of anything else until he runs back to beach and meets her again through sheer luck. They start dating more and more and after some time Toshihiko realizes how much he needs Yuka in his life, his priorities shift from upholding the mantle of martial artist and future head of the Kifuuken to his personal life and relationship with Yuka. At one point the truth comes out and they\'re forced to elope. From there things advance rather slow and from certain points of view don\'t really move at all until much later. You know these two won\'t just break up at this point without something really drastic happening, something more drastic than risking getting killed every time they have sex but it\'s interesting to see them deal with it, with the frustrations that occur when your girlfriend turns into a flesh eating monster when she gets too excited and living a normal life when you\'re constantly chased.On Yuka\'s behalf things are just as complex. When Toshihiko first meets her she\'s still dating another man, another flesh eater, someone she probably thought is the only choice for her because of the problems mentioned above but that\'s until she meets Toshihiko which gives her hope to be normal again. Unlike a lot of other Flesh Eaters in the show she\'s not into the whole murder thing and wants to be a normal human, she doesn\'t want to become a victim of her claws like her relatives.It\'s also later revealed that she\'s already pregnant from the man she dated before and while it\'s not really built up well and drops on you just as suddenly as it is resolved it\'s still kinda sweet to see Toshihiko pull through for her despite knowing all this and in a conversation with strangers answer that she is his wife and she\'s carrying his child and then tells her that no matter what they\'ll raise and cherish him. It all plays into Yuka\'s desire to be normal, and find someone to support her despite the flaws.There\'s also a bit of rivalry between Rie and Yuka but unless I\'m missing something it was rather pointless and Rie\'s love for Toshihiko could\'ve been dropped entirely without any significant impact to the story. Also as I mentioned from episode 9 things just go to shit, Yuka gets captured, Toshihiko saves her and then they jump out of a plane to lead a happy life after a pretty nonsensical moments where Yuka tries to jump alone thinking that she\'ll only cause him harm. It\'s a happy ending overall but that part was completely unnecessary, felt like it was ripped out of some shitty fanfic because I thought Yuka is a more sensible person than that. Abandoning the guy who gave up his way of life to be with you, pulled through all the hardships and then risked his life to save you and NOW she\'s trying to be ""we can\'t be together""? I\'m not buying this crap, I feel like it was just the last attempt to manipulate the audience into thinking how sweet it all is when Toshihiko jumps out and goes after her.2. KifuukenSecond I think in importance aspect of the show is a moral conflict within Kifuuken and other martial art schools that existed for a long time but now exist in a world that makes their ideology harder to uphold and all of this is personified within Kazuma, ""adopted"" son of Juzo who\'s frustrated that his brother is seen as superior and nobody listens to his ideas. These ideas include building mech suits to battle monsters more efficiently. In the first episode he does a presentation listing all the upsides of his concept but gets shut down by his father who won\'t accept it because Kifuuken is a martial art first and foremost. In the first third of the show he\'s mostly in the sidelines but as soon as Juzo had passed takes an very important part of the story. His arc is honestly the most interesting to me in the whole thing, Kazuma might be the single most dynamic and conflicting character in Kemonozume. He boldly walks forward and changes Kifuuken because he\'s passionate about it, he wants to reduce injuries of his comrades while increasing efficiency of their job, all his actions are motivated by trying to make things better for everyone but then Ooba starts to exert his influence. Ooba is a terrible character and part of why ending was such a trainwreck but for the second half he\'s just an evil businessman with ulterior motives who pushes Kazuma to make decision that would benefit his own plans. Kazuma slowly starts falling apart at the seams, after the point where he fulfils first step of his plan the momentum he creates moves his forward, sometimes it feels like he has no other choice but to do what he\'s told cause by using the same reasoning as Kazuma, Ooba convinces him to make further alterations to his organization until it finally spirals out of control and Kazuma is left alone, his final decision it to to go directly to Ooba with a sword and wearing a traditional Kifuuken outfit. It\'s not explicitly said but I think the implication is that he rejects his old ideas that led to all of this and in his last moments sticks to the tradition his father upholdest to the last.3. OobaYes, Ooba, the main villain who is also like the worst character of this story. He first appears in the flashback that tells us the story of Kifuuken\'s triumvirate, a rather out there comparison to three great rulers though they were just candidates to become the heads of Kifuuken. In that flashback Juzo dates Yuka\'s mother who is also a flesh eater and from that Kazuma is born. Later all three find out she a flesh eater but promise to keep it a secret, including Ooba who seemed like a nice enough guy in the flashback, a bit of a coward even. Because of this Juzo loses a duel that decided who will head Kifuuken. Person he lost to becomes mad that he could never prove his strength in a fair match so he aims to go a step above and prove he\'s the stronger than everyone by using the technique called Kemonozume that relies in cutting your own arms and taking arms of a flesh eater, he does just that and slaughters a village of flesh eaters before losing control on turning on his own, that forces Juzo to take hands of his wife to kill the other guy, end of flashback. This is later implied to be set up by Ooba without anything to actually back that up. After this Ooba appears later and notices that the woman dating Toshihiko is a flesh eater after which he tells everyone in the Kifuuken about it which leads to them luring her in and exposing her before Toshihiko himself but instead of killing her Toshihiko escapes. I wonder why Ooba would set this up cause his plan largely revolts around manipulating Kazuma but if Toshihiko turned on Yuka there he would be the head of the organization and likely wouldn\'t listen to Ooba. Whatever that\'s not the worst part yet. The longer this goes on the more evil Ooba become and we\'re never given any reason behind why he is this way, neither are we given his motivation yet he becomes borderline the central character in the last 5 episodes. He\'s at the center of everything and we\'re supposed to just watch him do evil shit and care because? There\'s so much build up before and fall of Kifuuken is interesting to watch but Ooba just doing evil shit just for the hell of it was boring. It\'s an anti-climactic conclusion to what otherwise was an interesting story. It\'s not made any better by his ridiculous boss battle.That\'s about all I have to say about the story, it starts out complex and interesting but devolves into an utter mess when the focus shifts to ""good guys fight crazy psycho lol"".Art: Yuasa\'s art style is often a polarizing aspect of his shows when it goes towards the rougher direction. A lot of people equate the rough lines and inconsistent proportions as bad art instead of a stylistic choice. Personally I loved the look of the series. The rough look of it reminded me somewhat of old low-res games before developers could fully portray characters in complete detail and a lot of it was left up to the interpretation of the player. Similarly the constantly shifting lines made me have a portrait of the characters in my head that went beyond what was seen on screen and while it\'s far from an objective strong point of the anime it\'s something that I enjoyed when watching it. Episode 12 in particular is where I think art style peakes, it\'s extremely striking visually and the animation at times made it look like a fever dream. Kemonozume in this way offers something that you won\'t get out of normal anime.Music: It\'s no masterpiece, the only real standout to me were some pretty slick jazz compositions during occasional fights. Jazz and stylish violence usually go hand in hand.Voice acting: standard package, everyone sounds very distinct and fits their role if I had to commend anything it\'s that they had enough sense not to overact all of the times where a more grounded delivery would work betterFun factor: I avoided watching this for the longest time cause it didn\'t seem to be on the level of best Yuasa\'s works nor did I really crave for this type of story at any point and after watching it I can safely say that I could\'ve not seen it for god knows how much longer and wouldn\'t feel bad about it. While there is a lot to like about it the terrible decline in the end keeps it from being a one of the must-see shows. If you think the synopsis is cool go ahead, check it out, it mostly delivers on the romance but if you want a real solid show then I can\'t recommend it. something in it that makes them overcome it.

I don't think I've ever seen anything more visually electrifying like this, and it's kinda disappointing considering I haven't really found anything with this kind of style out there.Story: With Yusa's illogical animation, you definitely need a wacky story to accompany it and here you'll find samurais clashing with human/monster hybrids, cannibalism, zoophilia, peach loving monkeys smooching with monkeys growing out of an evil head running...on a gigantic ball headed for destruction, you name it.

Or the vibrant colors used in the intro dialogue, not to mention how illuminating it looks as if the animators somehow took a lamp and underlaid it behind the scenes. My only complaint though is the lack of s_surrealizm which I had really anticipated after seeing the crown achievement of mankind Mind Game.Sound: The episodes feature some upbeat jazz which I definitely digged as it held hands with the action scenes, but there's another piece of music found in the 3rd episode after the subway chase scene, which was the opposite of upbeat. Aw man, you see pretty umbrellas swaying in the streets with that guitar in the background stimulating my posterior pituitary gland in releasing some chillout hormones. The intro/outro themes are also alright, though nothing personally special.Character: Toshihiko struggling between the path of the sword and his heart was amusing, his romance between Yuka and Rie had its moments, I never really cared for the minor characters (especially their backgrounds), but there was Saru the monkey who I'll never forget.Enjoyment: I enjoyed my time... bye. on a gigantic ball headed for destruction, you name it.

I don't find the story's premise compelling, but do recognize that it's well told. The lead characters' romantic relationship, which is one of the major axes of conflict in the plot, is unconvincing. However, this is partially redeemed when some of the secondary characters end up in interesting and poignant circumstances.

"", 'If there is one director in the anime world who never fails to surprise, refresh and delight me, it is Yuasa Masaaki. Having created popular masterpieces like Ping Pong the Animation and The Tatami Galaxy, it is clear that he does not disappoint. His works are stylistically striking and always seem to bear an overwhelmingly positive and uplifting atmosphere. Kemonozume is no exception.Story: 8/10The story follows a species of monsters that prey upon humans, the Shokujinki, and the organisation that is dedicated to eradicating them - the Kifuuken. The story gains direction when Toshiko, a member of the Kifuuken, and Yuka, a ""Flesh Eater"", fall...in love at first sight. META_BODY\'s review covers the philosophical aspect of this story far better than I could, but believe me when I say that it is excellent, if obscure. It is, without a doubt, highly confusing and somewhat surreal if one stops to think about it. Nevertheless, it was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch.Art: 10/10I have seen numerous comments about the art of Kemonozume being its biggest flaw - that it is messy, as though it is a draft and not the final product. I couldn\'t disagree more. The art is what stood out to me as the most magnificent aspect of this series. The art style incorporates rotoscope and/or live action shots on occasion - these aspects are also present in Masaaki\'s film, Mindgame, and The Tatami Galaxy. Otherwise, the art makes use of scratchy, scribbly lines, similar to those used in Mindgame and Ping Pong, and the use of colour varies according to the tone of the scene. Sometimes, the palette is muted and unspectacular, and sometimes it is jarring and vivid. What I love about Masaaki\'s anime is how eccentric and different it is in comparison with other modern anime: you won\'t find any moeshit here. No two characters look the same. Each character has, well, [i]character[/i].Sound: 9/10The sound, both the OST and voice acting, were another spectacular aspect of this series. The OST was like nothing I have heard in an anime before. Somehow it was jazzy and evocative and interesting, and most importantly, it worked. The voice acting was absolutely excellent. I don\'t believe an English dub exists, but I\'m quite certain one would never do the original justice.Character: 8/10Each character in Kemonozume was portrayed uniquely in every aspect - not only scriptwise, but also through the art and voice acting. Each was distinctive in their own way, and developed adequately throughout the series.Overall: 9/10Kemonozume undoubtedly does everything right for what it is - and it is a beautiful blend of fantastically absurd art and sound and a seemingly simple Romeo and Juliet-based story that deviates from the norm. It is refreshing and entertaining to watch, and I\'d highly recommend it to anyone who feels like something a bit different without having to delve into the realm of dementia. Not only is it an excellent anime it is, dare I say it, a piece of art. in love at first sight.

The art style incorporates rotoscope and/or live action shots on occasion - these aspects are also present in Masaaki\'s film, Mindgame, and The Tatami Galaxy. Otherwise, the art makes use of scratchy, scribbly lines, similar to those used in Mindgame and Ping Pong, and the use of colour varies according to the tone of the scene. Sometimes, the palette is muted and unspectacular, and sometimes it is jarring and vivid. What I love about Masaaki\'s anime is how eccentric and different it is in comparison with other modern anime: you won\'t find any moeshit here. No two characters look the same. Each character has, well, [i]character[/i].Sound: 9/10The sound, both the OST and voice acting, were another spectacular aspect of this series. The OST was like nothing I have heard in an anime before. Somehow it was jazzy and evocative and interesting, and most importantly, it worked. The voice acting was absolutely excellent. I don\'t believe an English dub exists, but I\'m quite certain one would never do the original justice.Character: 8/10Each character in Kemonozume was portrayed uniquely in every aspect - not only scriptwise, but also through the art and voice acting. Each was distinctive in their own way, and developed adequately throughout the series.Overall: 9/10Kemonozume undoubtedly does everything right for what it is - and it is a beautiful blend of fantastically absurd art and sound and a seemingly simple Romeo and Juliet-based story that deviates from the norm. It is refreshing and entertaining to watch, and I\'d highly recommend it to anyone who feels like something a bit different without having to delve into the realm of dementia. Not only is it an excellent anime it is, dare I say it, a piece of art.', ""*Very brief review--sure to get a lot of dislikes! Yay!*A bizarre, sexually-charged Romeo and Juliet story involving a flesh-eating monster and a hunter of said flesh-eating monsters. Mashes together fantastic drama and romance with surrealistic comedy and action, so that the end result is something like FLCL, though strictly for adults. There is a lot of nudity and sex here, but, refreshingly for an anime, it almost never dips into fan-service territory. (And when it does, it goes so hilariously over the top that the effect isn't even remotely titillating.) Monstrous transformations during sexual climax aside, the sex just feels real, and the kaleidoscopic, unpolished...animation helps keep Kemonozume from lewd, ecchi territory. I'd say that this anime is everything that Elfen Lied is not--EL tries to tackle similarly thorny, compelling issues, but its noble intentions are constantly undermined by the consistent, juvenile fan-service and broad stereotyping. Not that Kemonozume is subtle either, but it is, at the very least, a joy to watch. animation helps keep Kemonozume from lewd, ecchi territory.

Right after the first episode, I felt at ease and just relaxed and enjoyed the ride. Everything about this anime is great. Story is well developped, you can connect to characters, music is amazing, very much like Cowboy Bebop by the way.Story:...Kemonozume's story revolve around a woman and a man who loves each other passionately despite the fact that they are not meant for each other , lots of physical contact in this anime, their love is Eros type. I will not reveal any spoilers,  but as the story goes further, it gets darker and darker, almost every episode has a moment of action or let's say every episode has a touch with the main plot, so you might get diverted a little in the first minutes, though I never did, but right on time it will take you back to its pace.Music:Mostly jazz. In action sequence there is a certain uptempo jazz they are using- very much like the first jazz song in the cowboy bebop movie, the one enters when spike fights with a girl- which is great, sometimes to create suspense they use only drums, for emotional scenes they have a song like a jazz/blues, it adds a lot to the scene. It never bores you, or it never feels like its too much, I mean the movies make that mistake a lot, for simple scene like a simple walk in the street, they put a real complex classical stuff, and you get distracted by it, well this anime doesn't do that, and that's certainly a good thing right?Main CharactersWe have two main characters. Yuka and Toshihiko. Yuka is like a source of life to Toshihiko, Yuka was living a normal girl's life with some exceptions, Toshihiko is a master swordsman at the Kifuufen dojo. Until the time when Toshihiko met Yuka, he had been living a life devoted to the path of sword. But Yuka changes everything. The two starts on a journey, which is decided in very stresfull moment. And the anime is the journey, the later developped main plot is actually a device that makes the journey more acceptable, and more fast paced, and the good thing with fast paced plot is that when it slows down, you really see the significance of the scene. Same with the characters, if a moment lasts, it is significant, if a thing is repeated, it is significant.Side CharactersSo for my only concern with the anime is the sometimes under developped side characters. At the end of the story, yes the villain has a good reason to be villain, but where does he get that good reason, and why it is a good reason, you do not see that. Or the side character Rie, an entire episode is devoted to her, that's how significant she is, yet we actually know so little about her, and after a certain point she is used as a stimulating device for the plot, which is so sad for a character which has a real potential to be deep. Toshihiko's brother is a very significant character and yet his relation to Toshihiko is really under developped. Maybe anime should have been a little longer like an episode or two. But besides that, some of the side characters, like the old couple, which is shown only in one episode is very well developped, because, we know a little about their past, and their relation to each other, it is all done in four or five minutes, yet the anime fails to do same thing for more significant characters, or should have done a little bit more, but it is great anyway. Now that I think about it, I'd go who cares, it was great.VisualsWell, it is different alright. I loved it, you might not like it. It has a certain attitude, which is, if I am not mistaken, they tried to give or show the meaning/emotion not by just the contents in the drawing but with the drawing style too. I mean, something like this, if the scene is smooth, and loving scene, they draw smooth and gentle, soft colors, poetic visual imagery and all that. But if the thing is rough, they draw rough, lots of visible lines, you can see every corner in the scene, the drawing style changes according to mood, which for me was an amazing experience.ConclusionDefinitely worth your time.

While it does have a lot of standard ideas within it, I feel like it separates itself from them by presenting them in a new, unique manner that comes off a wholly original. Most of the episodes feel like a self-contained tale, while still adding to the overall plotline, and I love that style of doing things. The way the story is presented, in terms of the camera angles and the pacing of everything is also masterfully done.Most of the characters have some unique qualities to them, but don't do too much to sand out from the crowd,...giving us interesting, likable, and realistic characters... but also entirely forgettable ones. However, one character really stands out to me as memorable, and that would be Kyuutarou Ooba. This old man with his iconic laugh and demented personality is one of the most well done, and most memorable characters in the series, for sure.As for the art, it may not be for everyone, but I really like it, and I feel like it adds so much to the visceral nature of the show. The rough edges around all of the characters might look sloppy to some people, but for me, I feel like it gives the show a very specific tone, but it also allows the animators to get more fluid and natural with the character movement, combine that with the muted and dark color palette, and it makes the whole show feel a lot more realistic than many other anime.The Audio is fantastic, across the board. From loud, thumping sound design, to a really effectively used soundtrack, I'm absolutely in love with it. The opening theme is fantastic as well and sets the tone of the series very nicely. The ending theme isn't quite as good, but the contrast between the themes does a good job of showing the contrast between the action parts of the story, and the romance parts.Overall, this is a really enjoyable show. It's got a few minor flaws here and there, but every episode was a blast.

Needless to say, my expectations were high. Fortunately Kemonozume was able to live up to those expectations and even exceed them in some ways. The most striking thing about this anime is it’s visuals, everything is drawn to have a very rough look and real life photos are even used for things such as food. Kemonozume is one of the most stylised anime I have ever seen, but for those of you who are familiar with Yuasa’s work this will come as no surprise. One of my...favourite things about this anime is that the visuals not only complement the horrific story being told but even elevate it in many ways. Kemonozume is great at combing elements from many different genres such as comedy, horror and romance. The best thing about all these genres being present is that they all flow together seamlessly. Kemonozume can go from a horrific nightmare to a hilarious gag in mere seconds and somehow Yuasa was able to pull it off perfectly. This anime also does a great job of exploring the world of both humans and the flesh eating monsters that hunt them down. Kemonozume does a far better job than Tokyo Ghoul (which has a similar premise) at showing ways in which humans and monsters could co exist. However, this anime has a far more pessimistic view on this topic which I very much appreciated. I highly suggest checking this out if you appreciate unique art and good writing.

(8.1/10)', ""While watching this show I couldn't help but be reminded of the cartoons (Such as Aeon Flux, The Maxx, and The Head to name a few examples) I used to consume on MTV; bizarre, surreal, with dollops of absurdity, philosophy, and often psycho-sexual imagery. Or pretty much exactly what an edgy teenager in their formative years wanted at the time!However, I've changed over time, and merely being experimental isn't always enough. It's artsy and stylish without being pretentious, and it's easy to sympathize with our lead female, who has a sweet romance with the male lead but struggles to constrain her inner monster, usually brought...about whenever she drinks or gets intimate with him. It's basically a twisted love story where both partners must abandon and risk everything in order to be together; where neither temptation nor past responsibilities will keep them separated for long.Despite the rather odd artstyle, the direction has a lot of flair, with creative and artistic flourishes. It's rounded out by a jazzy soundtrack which helps draw you into its unorthodox atmosphere, which tends to jump from one odd scenario to the next with wild abandon.I'm also reminded of all those trashy late 80s to mid 90s OVAs; you know, the ones filled with ultra-violence, copious amounts of nudity, underdeveloped settings full of ambition, and storylines often told so poorly they often bordered on incomprehensible. Fortunately, this is better executed than many of those, which reveled in shock value with little else to back them up, aside from maybe some nice visuals (If you were lucky) and catchy music. Here the offbeat story at least remained coherent albeit somewhat tricky to follow at times.Anime humor usually does little for me but its constantly used here in attempt to offset the bleaker aspects. Perhaps this was meant to be satirical in nature? There are certainly plenty of scenes which lead credence to that, such as the end of a boxing match where the loser eats his opponent, a television announcement by a cyborg who gets gunned down before a cut to his body in the newspaper, cutaway gags to live action, etc. It straddles the line between art and schlock.

It loses any sense of direction or meaning, and in the end becomes fairly absurd. Still, the atmosphere it put off through the whole was excellent, and some of the characters surprisingly grew on you.

The art is refreshingly different. The jazz soundtrack is the perfect mood-setter.

', 'The anime television debut of Masaaki Yuasa (Mind Game\'s director), Kemonozume both adheres to and diverges from the tropes of the \'Monster Hunter\' genre of media. While the story might not be quite as intriguing as Mind Game\'s, this 1-cour show makes its mark with distinctive art, a quality soundtrack + voice acting, and engaging characters.[Story - 7]Kemonozume follows the story of Toshihiko, an expert swordsman in the Kifuuken (a monster-hunting guild), and his \'unconventional\' romance with Yuka, a Shokujinki (Flesh Eater). It seems rather Romeo & Juliet-esque at first honestly, but it quickly diverts from that in the first 4-5 episodes. From there,...it\'s a high-stakes tale of trying to defeat both depraved monsters and insidious humans while trying to maintain the precarious balance in the relationship. While the ending felt really sloppy + I\'m admittedly a bit weary of ""forbidden heterosexual romances"", I found that this was well executed! It explored themes such as \'how much can love survive in the face of hardship?\' and \'should you abandon tradition to grow or maintain it?\' in a grim, yet not shallow, manner.[Art - 8]The artstyle is as distinctive as Mind Game\'s, which seems to be typical of Yuasa\'s work. It, however, has improved from before: it definitely looks less sloppy while maintaining the surrealism. The backgrounds can be either muddy/dimly-lit or like a painting, but bordering on the line of reality and dream nonetheless. Character design is a bit more distinctive now, as the Shokujinki have unique looks to them, and the various human characters have more distinguishing features in their anatomy and fashion.[Sound - 9]God, this soundtrack is amazing. Maybe it\'s because I\'m a sucker for this type of music now, but having Jazz be the OST to this is clever. It might seem really out of place, but considering the \'trippy\' aesthetic and vibe of this show, it makes a lot more sense to have a genre that can be both slow and calming, then fast and heart-racing. The OP suits the latter rather well, while the ED matches up with the former.The voice acting + SFX are really good! Everyone conveys an appropriate range of emotions, especially Toshihiko\'s and Yuka\'s! The Flesh Eaters sound rather...grotesque, and their gore-filled hunts are always well designed in this department.[Character - 8]The characterization here is, like the artwork, stronger than Yuasa\'s last work. Thanks to having a longer runtime, they all feel more fleshed out and grounded in reality. Toshihiko\'s struggles of having to abandon his past life for a lover is conveyed in a relatable manner, while Yuka\'s frustration with having to be a Flesh Eater while with a human lover is convincingly tragic. Other characters, such as Toshihiko\'s brother Kazuma and his ""betrothed"" Rie, are also displayed in a suitably dynamic light. I admit that the main antagonist of the show is rather lackluster (acting crazed and being an edgy mastermind while having an unclear motive and backstory), but otherwise the characters got their due service![Enjoyment/Overall - 8]This was a fun little watch! Not a \'shining example\' of the best that monster-hunting anime has to offer, but a rather unique take on the genre that should be experienced nonetheless. I would recommend this to people who look for that sort of thing! it\'s a high-stakes tale of trying to defeat both depraved monsters and insidious humans while trying to maintain the precarious balance in the relationship. While the ending felt really sloppy + I\'m admittedly a bit weary of ""forbidden heterosexual romances"", I found that this was well executed! It explored themes such as \'how much can love survive in the face of hardship?\' and \'should you abandon tradition to grow or maintain it?\' in a grim, yet not shallow, manner.[Art - 8]The artstyle is as distinctive as Mind Game\'s, which seems to be typical of Yuasa\'s work. It, however, has improved from before: it definitely looks less sloppy while maintaining the surrealism. The backgrounds can be either muddy/dimly-lit or like a painting, but bordering on the line of reality and dream nonetheless.

However, there is a group of martial-arts styled warriors called The Kifūken that are trained to execute these creatures. The main storyline starts with Toshihiko Momota, a skilled swordsman and chosen heir of the dojo and soon after that, he falls in love with a girl named Yuka Kamitsuki and as it turns out Yuka is a shokujinki making the sudden romance turned forbidden as when The Kifūken finds them, they will hunt both...of them down and it’s not like horrible things can happen to someone like them…….Oh wait...Both of the main characters Toshihiko & Yuka do developed into very interesting characters throughout the series. Their love story is a bit cheesy at a few times and what to expect for a love story only with lots of sex and female full frontal nudity and believe me, there is a lot of that going on in this show. As for the side characters, they just come off as dull and come off as uninteresting, such as, Kazuma (Toshihiko’s half-brother) wants to modernize the business with high-tech gadgets but the family does not take that easily. That little subplot just sounds like something you always find in a business only doing things the old-fashioned way but it wasn’t that bad. Rie Kakinoki is the most underdeveloped character in the show as the girl who gets in between Toshihiko and Yuka, vying for his love and even compares her breasts to Yuka’s. Yeah, that happened. But as for the villain, I wouldn’t say who it is because it would be a huge spoiler but whoever it is; their coming of being a villain is never really explained why.One thing I got to say about the animation in here: I didn’t think that was a Madhouse project at first. It seemed like Studio 4’C helped in there but it is, in fact, all Madhouse and while they used the same art style in some 4’C productions, at first, it was very bold and different but it isn’t unique at all and it can show to be very lazy at a few times. Some character designs look completely flat and unfinished and the same goes to the backgrounds and most of the fight scenes. It seems that they had a slim budget on the animation and resulted into doodling.The opening theme used ""Auvers Blue"" by Katteni-Shiyagare help you prepare for most of the show’s antics and situations and the jazz score in the series is very minimalist but it doesn’t distract you from the series and it helps play its role. The ending theme ""Suki"" by Santara isn’t really anything special but like the music in “Sister Princess”, I just skip this song and move on into the next episode but I still always listen to the opening theme with open ears.FINAL VERDICT: The story gets dull in the first half of the series but as the story goes along, it did alright and that’s all. I noticed many people who reviewed this giving this 9s or 10s in order to be mature to fellow anime watchers but I don’t find it that worthy. It’s an OK show with decent but tiresome animation, average characters, and a good music score. of them down and it’s not like horrible things can happen to someone like them…….Oh wait...Both of the main characters Toshihiko & Yuka do developed into very interesting characters throughout the series.

I got plenty of good laughs out of this anime, which is quite rare.• Many aspects of the story and characters reminded me a lot of Claymore and are rather generic.Art & Sound:• Subjectively, I did not like the sketchy stylistic art. However, the compositions, camera angels, colors, and editing were excellent....Though visually unappealing for me, the stylized art definitely attenuates the avant-garde and playful storytelling. This anime would not be as powerful if it went with a more traditional anime art style.• I loved the jazzy and funky music of this series, the opening theme song was stuck in my head days after finishing it.Overall:Not your traditional anime, but a must watch for people who enjoy experimental art and storytelling. If you are looking for something to make you laugh, this anime surely will accomplish that as well!

It was the only important show of his left for me to watch and I was surprised with how bad it was, considering he made it between Mind Game and Kaiba.The premise isn’t very captivating, it’s Romeo and Juliet with human swordsmen and monsters, that’s it, and I couldn’t even buy the way it’s presented, I don’t believe in love at first sight, attraction? Sure, but love? Nah, which is why I never bought it in fiction either. It’s even harder to accept it in here because the...two main characters just find the other in the beach and the next day they are already fucking, and that’s what the relationship between them is mostly about, having sex. Other than that, other forms of interaction between them are quite short or cut off by an action scene, no letting the viewer to really buy or be invested by this relationship. It’s even worse when you consider that the main character was a diligent man dedicated to his duty his whole life and left it all because of a woman he just met. It’s even worse when you consider that the main couple left their families and even betrayed their species as a whole for someone they didn’t even really know about for just a few days at most.At least the show bothers to show some internal problems between the main couple later on, but even those are resolved in shitty ways. The dude cheats on her and when is found out we have the two women insulting each other with a harem or straight up hentai doujinshi level of dialogue.And it’s not just them really. Almost every male character in this show is driven by sex, they become traitors because they want to have sex, and are even fooled and killed off because of their lust. Meanwhile every woman in this series is limited to a source of problems and just…a bitch, they are all bitches.The only exception I found are the father and step mother of the protagonist, because although their relationship is a bit silly as well, there is a buildup and consequences because of it, and was thus easier to buy and more interesting to watch.Leaving that aside, the setting doesn’t really make sense when you think about it, how can the world be almost the same as ours when monsters have been around it forever? And how can they stay mostly hidden and underground? Some of them do try to remain unnoticed but some just kill off humans constantly to feast on them whenever they want, they should be commonly known by everyone and society as a whole should be completely different as it’s presented.And let’s not even waste much time in talking about the villain, he was so goofy and overpowered and even pretentious near the end of the show, and the way he was taken down was so stupid, he threw whatever little bit of sense and logic was left in the script out the window.Also, as much as Kemonozume wants to present itself as a tragedy because of all the deaths in it, the tone is mostly silly, feeling more like a comedy than anything else, that monkey that would later on become a regular in Yuasa’s works and even own studio was the absolute worst aspect in the series.The resolution was completely open and unsatisfactory, it can only counts as a conclusion for the action and main couple but it still does not mean anything for the rest of the world and not even assures what the main couple is going to be like going forward, who says they won’t have the exact same issues they had throughout the show just because they took down the big baddie?The only saving grace I found in the script is everything revolving the character Kazuma, although also wanting to bone a girl throughout the whole show, he was the most proactive and conflicted character in the whole series. Also diligent, always in the shadow of his brother, wanting to prove himself the whole time, with an identity crisis and mental and physical deterioration as he finds out more about himself and how different he is from what he thought his whole life. He also tries to modernize the swordsmen with technology and way of functioning and funding, so Kemonozume at least follows all the issues he and the Kifuuken as a whole goes through with that, too bad he is incapable of anything at the end because the script had to have him being completely fooled by an overpowered antagonist and the main character being the one to solve everything. Except he doesn’t because as I said, he only cares about a monster pussy and once he assures that, he just sends everything else to fuck off.Visually the series looks like what you would expect something from Yuasa to look like, except very very sloppy and low budget. Yes, it’s done deliberately to look that way, but that still doesn’t mean it’s a good job. The characters constantly look like deformed doodles, the backgrounds look mostly unfinished, the motions are usually weak, the whole artwork seems cheap, the coloring is rather unpolished and goes psychedelic at times for no reason, and sometimes traced live action footage is used for some reason. Which is a shame because thanks to the rare but powerful very few very well animated bits in the series, and the usual great directing you can expect from Yuasa, you can tell that they could have presented a visually quirky but still neat show. Other than that, there’s nothing here that wasn’t done way better both before and after in the other main series and movies from the director.As for the sound, it’s only ok as well. The voice acting is ok, the sound effects and music are also just ok, nothing much to say here, the ending was the best part of it. I’m not very fond of the opening, you can find way better jazzy openings out there, this one is musically uninspired, the vocals suck, and half the lyrics are the title of the song being repeated over and over. It ends up being catchy if you don’t skip it while you are watching the show, but it’s still a pretty bad song all things considered.As a whole, it was a big disappointment coming from Masaaki Yuasa, the script is stupid, almost all the characters are beasts in heat regardless of their species or gender, and visually it looks like the makers weren’t even trying most of the time. Kazuma elevates the whole show to be above Crybaby, and it’s definitely way better than JAPAN STINKS, but it’s still, like, the worst Yuasa Yuasa show, you know what I mean? He only directed Crybaby, and was only a co-director in Japan Sinks 2020, over here he had control of many aspects in the show, and practically none of all of them worked well. It feels more like a demo of what his filmography and directing for Crybaby would be like moving forward, only worthy to check out for someone who want to complete everything from the director, and nothing else. two main characters just find the other in the beach and the next day they are already fucking, and that’s what the relationship between them is mostly about, having sex.

Everybody complains about this being Romeo and Juliet with a new coat of cannibal demon paint. That's absolutely why it's so great to begin with. The concepts of impossible love are those which explore the limits of human emotion. What would you do? Happiness is beyond a threshold that requires a sacrifice. No going back, and it's all for another person who's doing the same. Accelerating, passionate, brutal, bloody, filled with comedy, mess-ups, mistakes, and most of all, the horror of leaving life behind for somebody you're just getting to know.First thing I gotta acknowledge, holy...sh*t the characters here are incredible. Human beings who do everything towards their desires, and the world putting them in their places, just for wanting more. I felt for the main couple, I rooted for everybody involved, and I dreaded for the ending. It felt like a precursor to “Devilman Crybaby”, but everything was more about hope. The options were there, the setup, the payoff, written like a page right there on the side, but it wasn't taken. It speaks about life in an abstract, humane way which I can't entirely explain. This is more of a ramble on how the art, the writing, and everything spoke to me. The hard way IS the right way. People are left behind, but it meant something, even within the chaos. Love burst, and the ending wasn't at all what I expected.Sure, the style turned me off for the first ten minutes. As always with abstract art, you don't know how the world works. It gets you in a new frame of mind, and some will get turned off, but I loved it. Style makes an anime go timeless. For 2006, you could tell me this was a modern production and I wouldn't even doubt you. In a way, not only does it feel timeless, but full of passion. You feel what the author wants you to think, and the adult themes feel much more tasteful when it's treated like here.Apart from that ramble, and technical aspects aside, I enjoyed the anime a lot, even with some story flaws. The ending struggle wasn't as satisfying as it could've easily been. Personal preference about the reason they love each other THAT fast. I thought it was gonna be a grand reason, but it was just, “they REALLY liked each other”. So, beginning, and climax, not the absolute best, but dear god, I love everything in between and the actual ending was INCREDIBLE. Not expected, but warmly welcomed.8.3/10. Give this one a shot, it's got action, incredible romance, deep adult themes, grotesque gore, comedy, tragedy, everything that can pack a punch. sh*t the characters here are incredible.

The color is shit. The background is shit. The outlines look like a sketch.The overall feel of the show is simply unpolished and 'unfinished'.But here is the good part: the drama ain't shit. I mean just ask yourself this one question:Do I want to watch a dude gets horny over a rage'aholic piece of meat pie? Cause that's all she really is in a nut shell.There's literally...no background story about the main characters in the show. You, as an audience, were simply given a brief introduction about their lives that's less than paper thin and then it's all action from there, action like racy sex scenes, boob grab jokes, dudes swinging swords like they're in a 2d world expressed in 3d lenses, conversation that's drier than a bunch of birds having one way conversations with each other, etc. And it might seem like I just plain out lie about the good part of the show.But here's the thing though: this show is like Shakespeare on dope even though everyone who give a shit about literature know Shakespeare is shit-smear. His works couldn't be more irrelevant for the past 200+ years, especially in the post modern world where the fiction market is over-saturated. People in today's world are literally looking forward to surrealist shit like killing Zombies and shit and they're raving about it like it's some 'high science'. And this is exactly what you're gonna get in this review. No tricks. No ads. No glory. Just plain text cause you're bored enough to read this crap. So here's the good part: shower sex scene.You're welcome.'Go fuck yourself and die.' That's what I'm 'edging' on my tombstone if I'd ever planned to have a funeral. Yup. That's how it feel like to tag along with this love story. It's tragic and romantic. Oops. (show don't tell)I mean where's the penis? There is literally no penetration scene in this soft-porn, Shakespearean fuck fest. You got sword fucking a bunch of low life who're just trying to get by. And yet they skim out on the penis demonstrations? Classism much? Snowflakes be killing my pleasure drive cause I won't get a boner from simple boob grabs. But seriously though, don't you just wanna beat the shit out the 'system' and then stick two middle fingers at it and then be like 'Leave those poor fucks alone. They got enough on their plates already'.Ok, I'm done and so are you cause I can't animate boob grabs like the artists who'd worked on Kemonozume could even if I were to become the next hardcore Japanese anime director who'd managed to win zero Oscar and yet I was able to milk the crap out of a bunch of horny teenage girls with my shitty drawings. So what are you waiting for? Go watch the damn show and remember to skip the ending so you can come back for more...wait for it...More boob grabs.Btw, ( .  Y   . )  Real boobs are mostly asymmetrical and that's relevant to this review because the romance in the show is done in a realistic way. That's the real good part about this show ( shower sex scene was good too ).tl;dr This show is Romeo and Juliet with smutty violence and the staffs working on it seem to have this 'take it or leave it' attitude. no background story about the main characters in the show.

But seriously though, don't you just wanna beat the shit out the 'system' and then stick two middle fingers at it and then be like 'Leave those poor fucks alone. They got enough on their plates already'.Ok, I'm done and so are you cause I can't animate boob grabs like the artists who'd worked on Kemonozume could even if I were to become the next hardcore Japanese anime director who'd managed to win zero Oscar and yet I was able to milk the crap out of a bunch of horny teenage girls with my shitty drawings. So what are you waiting for? Go watch the damn show and remember to skip the ending so you can come back for more...wait for it...More boob grabs.Btw, ( .  Y   . )  Real boobs are mostly asymmetrical and that's relevant to this review because the romance in the show is done in a realistic way. That's the real good part about this show ( shower sex scene was good too ).tl;dr This show is Romeo and Juliet with smutty violence and the staffs working on it seem to have this 'take it or leave it' attitude."", ""It's not too bad it or either that good, the romance is garbage the only romance is the sex scenes he actually cheated on her age that had no reprecursions.Art direction is unique but at the end of the day it doesn't look even slightly visually appealing the plot is all over the place and for most of it they had no goals and couldn't see where it was going.The female lead is mid and it feels like the anime is just about the couple trying to have sex successfully.The characters are not likeable the only one that was likeable was Rie&Bon the rest mid...also the main antagonist was shit also the main antagonist was shit"", ""To a first timer Kemonozume might not look itbut boy it does pack a punchand not just any punchit's the realistic-in your face-tragedyit's the quick development of plot and charactersit's the ultimate message of a hero who has fallen only to struggle to rise againI just love a show that can convey a greatly truly proper villian who- YOU KNOW-is gonna deliver some heart-wrenching realitiesfor those of you who believe that anime cannot get past traditional bullshitthis show is for you "", ""Kemonozume serves as a grand experiment in both animation and narrative. The storyline initially establishes a firm foundation, evolving into a suspenseful romance with a rapid influx of plot twists soon after the introduction. Yet, it is akin to a perplexing mind-bender, albeit in reverse, once it undergoes a narrative whirlwind. Allow me to elaborate. A compelling mind-bending show usually starts with a relatively comprehensible premise, gradually intensifying the mystery and dropping subtle clues, possibly enhancing the viewer's confusion, until everything clicks into place at the climax. However, this show resembles a fusion of FLCL, Saikano, and Higurashi: commencing as incredibly bizarre yet comprehensible, it...progressively introduces increasingly absurd concepts to an initially solid plot, culminating in a chaotic blend of limbs, sex, monsters, gore, and surreal elements, all delicately hanging on the frail remnants of what was once a coherent storyline, albeit slightly eccentric. Describing this as a robust romantic show with elements of gore and mind-bending would be akin to labeling FLCL as an intellectual narrative about saving the world, when it was essentially a vibrant explosion of colors.The animation tends to evoke either love or disdain. Despite its unconventional aesthetics, akin to Hitsuji no Uta, the animation style complements the overall atmosphere of the show, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Moreover, the distinctive art contributes to making the extensive use of absurd gore more palatable.Ultimately, I wouldn't readily recommend this anime to a broad audience. The incorporation of violence and explicit content makes it unsuitable, and the pervasive gore and unpredictability may dissuade many from watching. However, if you find yourself among the unconventional enthusiasts like myself, intrigued by experimental series, and unfazed by a touch of mind-bending, then you might find Kemonozume interesting. progressively introduces increasingly absurd concepts to an initially solid plot, culminating in a chaotic blend of limbs, sex, monsters, gore, and surreal elements, all delicately hanging on the frail remnants of what was once a coherent storyline, albeit slightly eccentric.
